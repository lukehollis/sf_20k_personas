Born in Guangzhou, China, she was the eldest daughter of two hardworking factory workers who saw in her a sharp, literary mind. She was the first in her family to attend university, excitedly pursuing a degree in Chinese literature. However, this dream was cut short at 21 when her family made the difficult decision to immigrate, pooling their life savings to give her younger siblings a chance at an American future. Mei-ling, bound by filial piety, dropped out to join them in San Francisco.\n\nHer first decade in the city was a blur of survival. She worked grueling hours in Chinatown garment factories and bustling dim sum restaurants, her wages helping to secure a small apartment and eventually supporting her brother through college. The university brochures she once treasured gathered dust, replaced by the immediate needs of her family. The turning point came when her own grandmother fell ill. While caring for her, Mei-ling discovered a quiet, steadying patience she never knew she possessed. It was a difficult but meaningful role, and after her grandmother passed, she pursued a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) license\u2014a practical path forward.\n\nFor the last eight years, Mei-ling has been a live-in caregiver for Mrs. Eileen Chen, an elderly widow whose own children live out of state. This explains her zero-mile commute; her life unfolds within Mrs. Chen's quiet home. Her days are a structured routine of medication schedules, preparing soft foods, gentle bathing, and reading newspapers aloud. Their bond is a complex tapestry of employment, companionship, and a surrogate familial tie that fills the home's silence. Her own family, now successful and assimilated, calls on holidays, their gratitude a source of both pride and a quiet, unvoiced ache for the life she set aside.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is seen through Mrs. Chen\u2019s large bay window, watching the N Judah streetcar rumble past. Her dream of a literature degree has softened into a more modest aspiration: a small apartment of her own someday, filled with books and quiet. For now, she finds solace in the poetry she reads to Mrs. Chen, a final, fragile thread connecting the woman she is to the girl she once was."
