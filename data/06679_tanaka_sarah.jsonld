The daughter of a pragmatic, third-generation Japanese American engineer and a vibrant, community-focused mother from Mexico City, Sarah grew up in Fresno straddling two cultures. From her father, she inherited a relentless analytical mind; from her mother, an innate ability to connect with people. This unique blend of skills would become the engine of her success.\n\nHer educational journey was a deliberate escape from the Central Valley\u2019s familiar horizons. After graduating from UCLA, she set her sights on the top. Earning an MBA from Stanford was her turning point, providing the credentials and network to enter the demanding world of elite management consulting. For nearly two decades, her life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and late-night strategy sessions. She thrived on the pressure, sacrificing personal relationships\u2014including a long-term partnership that buckled under the weight of 100,000 air miles a year\u2014for professional ascent. At 41, she achieved her ultimate goal: making Partner.\n\nThe promotion, however, coincided with a global shift. The pandemic grounded her, transforming her commute from a weekly cross-country flight to a zero-mile walk to her home office in Noe Valley. For the first time, her sleek, modern apartment became more than a place to recharge between trips; it became her world. This forced stillness prompted a quiet reckoning. Having conquered the corporate ladder, she found herself asking, \u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is rooted in her neighborhood. Her mornings start not with a dash to SFO, but with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by hours of intense virtual meetings overlooking the fog rolling over Twin Peaks. While she remains a formidable consultant, her aspirations are shifting. The drive for profit is being tempered by a desire for purpose. She dreams of using her strategic skills to advise impactful non-profits and has begun mentoring young women of color entering the tech and consulting fields. Sarah Tanaka has built a life of incredible success in San Francisco; now, she is learning how to build one of meaning."
