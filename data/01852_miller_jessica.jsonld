Her childhood was defined by loving but uncomprehending parents whose evangelical faith left no room for the daughter they didn't know they had. For Jessica, college was an escape. She pursued an English Literature degree, not for a career path, but for the stories and the space to quietly begin understanding herself.\n\nAfter graduating, she drifted through a series of administrative jobs, feeling anonymous and unfulfilled. A move to San Francisco in her late twenties was a desperate search for belonging. It wasn't immediate; the city was initially overwhelming. The turning point came when she, lonely and seeking connection, walked into an LGBTQ+ Community Center to volunteer. For the first time, she felt she could breathe. Surrounded by people whose stories mirrored fragments of her own, she found her purpose not in literature, but in lived experience.\n\nVolunteering soon became a part-time role, and eventually, her current full-time position as a Program Assistant. Now 39, Jessica lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment just two streets away from the center. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of a short walk past rainbow flags and familiar faces. Her days are a whirlwind of scheduling, resource coordination, and offering a calm, reassuring presence to vulnerable youth. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; her closest friends are colleagues and community members she\u2019s supported.\n\nStill nursing the quiet ache of a recent, amicable breakup with her long-term partner, Jessica pours her energy into her work. She dreams of being promoted to Program Manager, with a specific vision to launch an outreach initiative for queer youth from religious, rural backgrounds like her own. Her aspiration isn't fame or fortune, but to be the person she needed when she was a scared, lonely girl in Ohio, building a sanctuary one person at a time."
