Raised by a pragmatic high school history teacher and a meticulous CPA, his upbringing was one of stability, common sense, and quiet intellectual curiosity. He was the kind of kid who spent more time organizing his Lego sets by color and function than playing imaginary games.\n\nHis educational journey was an act of minor rebellion. Eschewing the practical business or engineering degrees his parents might have expected, Will pursued a Bachelor's in Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was fascinated by formal logic, ethics, and the structure of arguments, finding beauty in well-reasoned systems. Graduation, however, brought the stark reality that existential dread paid no bills. Adrift and back in his childhood bedroom, he stumbled upon a new kind of logic: programming. He taught himself Python and SQL with obsessive focus, discovering that the same part of his brain that loved untangling Kantian ethics also loved cleaning datasets and building predictive models.\n\nThis self-taught skill set secured him a remote position as a data analyst for a burgeoning FinTech firm. The job offered him freedom, and he chose San Francisco, a city he\u2019d only seen in movies but was drawn to for its reputation as a hub of ideas. He found a clean, modern studio apartment in Hayes Valley. With a 0.0-mile commute, his apartment is his entire world for eight hours a day. His routine is disciplined: a morning pour-over from a local caf\u00e9, hours spent staring at spreadsheets and Tableau dashboards, a midday break for a run through the Panhandle, and an evening spent either at a climbing gym or deep into a strategy board game with a small circle of friends.\n\nWill feels a persistent disconnect between his work\u2014using data to maximize profit\u2014and his philosophical roots. While financially comfortable, he\u2019s not entirely fulfilled. His social connections are structured and intentional, a defense against the isolation of remote work. He aspires to eventually move into data science for a non-profit or an ethical-tech company, a role where he can use his analytical mind to solve human problems, not just market ones. For now, he remains a quiet observer of the city from his window, a logician parsing the complex, often irrational data stream of life in San Francisco."
