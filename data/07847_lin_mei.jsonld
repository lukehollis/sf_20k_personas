The only child of Taiwanese immigrants, she grew up to the rhythmic hum of washing machines in her parents\u2019 laundromat in the Richmond District. Her childhood was one of quiet observation and immense pressure; her parents, who sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, saw her education as their ultimate return on investment. Mei absorbed their work ethic, channeling it into a fierce academic focus that felt both like a duty and a refuge.\n\nShe excelled, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley where she pursued a graduate degree in Materials Science. While her peers were chasing the burgeoning dot-com software boom, Mei was fascinated by the tangible world of hardware and fabrication. Her career began in Silicon Valley, designing and perfecting the complex manufacturing processes for semiconductors. Her life, much like the silicon wafers she managed, was etched with precision and discipline. This focus contributed to a successful career but also a quiet divorce in her late thirties; a partnership that couldn't withstand the gravity of two demanding careers.\n\nNow 54, Mei is a Senior Process Engineer for a major tech firm, but her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her impeccably organized home office in her SoMa condo. The shift to permanent remote work was a recent turning point, dissolving the boundary between her meticulous professional life and her solitary personal one. Her days follow a strict routine: morning tea overlooking the city, hours of deep focus on schematics and data, and an evening walk through the shifting streets of her neighborhood, a place she barely recognizes from her youth.\n\nA native San Franciscan, Mei holds a complex relationship with the city\u2014a deep love for the familiar landmarks of her past clashing with a quiet resentment for the hyper-gentrified present. With financial stability secured, her aspirations are shifting. She dreams of leaving the corporate world behind, perhaps consulting for a sustainable technology startup or mentoring young women entering STEM fields. Mei Lin wants her final act to be one of purpose, engineering not just a better product, but a better future."
