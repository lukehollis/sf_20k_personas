The son of pragmatic Taiwanese immigrants, his childhood was defined by the fog-laced streets and the expectation that he would pursue a stable, respectable career. While his father worked tirelessly in construction and his mother as a seamstress, Dimitri found his true education in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen. It was there, amidst the aromas of star anise and simmering broths, that his Amah taught him not just recipes, but the stories and heritage cooked into every dish.\n\nPressured by his family, Dimitri enrolled in business classes at San Francisco State University, but his heart wasn't in it. The call of the kitchen was too strong. After two years, he made the gut-wrenching decision to drop out, a choice that caused a deep rift with his father. To prove himself, Dimitri dove into the unforgiving world of professional kitchens, starting as a dishwasher in the Mission and working his way up through sheer grit. He learned speed, technique, and the fierce camaraderie of the line, hardening his hands and his resolve.\n\nThe defining turning point came with his grandmother\u2019s passing. He inherited her worn, hand-written recipe book, a tangible link to his past and a clear map for his future. Armed with her legacy and his hard-earned savings, Dimitri secured a small loan and opened \u201cAmah\u2019s Table,\u201d a cozy, unpretentious restaurant in the Inner Richmond. He lives in the small apartment directly above, making his commute a simple walk downstairs.\n\nAt 42, Dimitri\u2019s life revolves around the restaurant. His day begins before dawn at the wholesale produce market and ends long after the last customer has left. He is respected by his staff and fellow chefs, but personal relationships have often taken a backseat to 80-hour work weeks. His once-strained relationship with his father has softened; the older man now occasionally dines at the restaurant, his silent presence a quiet acknowledgment of Dimitri\u2019s hard-won success. Dimitri dreams of earning a Michelin star\u2014not for ego, but as the ultimate tribute to his Amah. He hopes to one day close the restaurant for a month and finally visit Taiwan, to taste the flavors he has spent a lifetime recreating."
