The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Outer Sunset. From a young age, she was a translator\u2014not just of language, but of culture, explaining American school forms to her parents and the nuances of traditional herbs to English-speaking customers. The salty air and the rhythmic clang of the L Taraval streetcar formed the soundtrack of her childhood.\n\nHer parents, pragmatic and hardworking, encouraged a stable career path. Mei-ling, ever the dutiful daughter, enrolled at San Francisco State University and majored in Communications, thinking it was a practical degree applicable to marketing or public relations. The turning point came during her junior year when her grandmother, her beloved N\u01cei nai, was diagnosed with late-stage diabetes. Mei-ling sat through countless doctor's appointments, watching helplessly as complex medical advice was lost in translation, delivered without cultural context. She realized the most profound communication gap wasn't in business, but in health. This experience ignited a new passion.\n\nAfter graduation, she pivoted. She volunteered at a community health clinic in Chinatown, using her communication skills to create easy-to-understand pamphlets on nutrition and preventative care in both English and Cantonese. This led to her current role as a Health Educator for a major healthcare provider. Her 0.0-mile commute is a modern perk; she works entirely from her cozy NoPa apartment, a world away from the quiet Sunset.\n\nHer days are a disciplined blend of work and wellness. Mornings start with jasmine green tea and a run through the Panhandle, followed by hours of developing digital health resources and hosting virtual wellness workshops. Evenings are for herself: a pottery class at a local studio, grocery shopping at Bi-Rite, or dinners with college friends on Divisadero. She remains deeply connected to her family, visiting her parents for dinner every Sunday. Her dream is to launch a non-profit that creates accessible, video-based health content for elderly, non-English-speaking immigrants\u2014a tribute to the N\u01cei nai she couldn't help, but a promise to the thousands she still can."
