Raised in a small town dependent on both logging and tourism, he saw the complex, often fraught relationship between community and nature firsthand. His parents, who owned a local hardware store, taught him practicality and self-reliance, virtues he would later apply to his academic and professional life.\n\nThis quiet reverence for the natural world solidified into a career path at the University of Oregon. He pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science, but found himself more drawn to the human element\u2014the policies and politics that shaped the landscape. This led him to UC Santa Barbara for a graduate degree, a Master's in Environmental Policy and Management, which served as his ticket to San Francisco and a coveted job at a large consulting firm. The initial years were thrilling, working on high-stakes projects. The turning point was a waterfront development proposal where his meticulously researched conservation plan was whittled down to a footnote in favor of corporate interests. Disillusioned, Caleb realized he wanted his work to have integrity, not just a high billing rate.\n\nTwo years ago, he took the leap. He quit his corporate job and now operates as an independent consultant from his apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to his standing desk, where he advises non-profits, small municipalities, and green-tech startups. His daily routine is disciplined: a pre-dawn run through Golden Gate Park, coffee from a local cafe on Clement Street, and long, focused hours on projects he genuinely believes in.\n\nThough professionally driven, Caleb maintains a close-knit group of friends, many met through local conservation volunteer days and pickup soccer games at Beach Chalet. He feels deeply connected to the city\u2019s unique geography\u2014the fog-drenched coastline and the green corridors that cut through the urban grid. His dream is to eventually found a small non-profit that helps underserved Bay Area communities develop their own local, sustainable infrastructure projects, giving them a powerful voice in their own environmental future."
