Raised in a small, cluttered house, Kenji inherited his father\u2019s quiet disposition and his mother\u2019s practicality. He was never one for books; his education happened in the garage, learning the language of engines and the logic of circuits. While his peers aimed for college, Kenji was more interested in disassembling a broken washing machine and making it whir back to life. After graduating high school, he bypassed higher education for a series of handyman jobs, finding satisfaction in tangible results.\n\nHis career was a slow, steady progression from apprentice work to a formal maintenance position for a property management company. The turning point came a decade ago. The superintendent of a large, aging apartment building in the Tenderloin was retiring, and Kenji, known for his reliability and broad skill set, was offered the job. Crucially, it came with a small basement apartment. For the first time, he had a home within San Francisco proper, a city he had only ever worked in. This explains his 0.0-mile commute; his life and his work are contained within the same hundred-year-old brick walls.\n\nKenji\u2019s days are a cycle of routine and surprise. He starts with a walkthrough, checking the boiler and trash chutes, before the calls begin: a clogged sink on the third floor, a flickering light in the lobby, a jammed window on the fifth. He is a familiar, silent presence to the dozens of residents, knowing them by their maintenance requests rather than their names. His personal life is minimal; a long-term relationship ended years ago, strained by his constant on-call status. His social connections are now brief nods in the hallway and a weekly beer with another building manager at a dive bar on Geary Street.\n\nThough he feels a deep, foundational connection to his building, Kenji dreams of escape. His hope is not for wealth, but for space\u2014a small plot of land in Sonoma County where he can build a workshop, restore old motorcycles, and finally get a dog. He is the invisible force that keeps a piece of the city running, a quiet man who fixes what is broken while dreaming of a place where nothing needs his attention but himself."
