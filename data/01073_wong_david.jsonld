Born in Los Angeles to a young, overwhelmed Salvadoran mother, he was adopted at six months old by the Wongs, a loving first-generation Chinese-American couple who owned a small pharmacy in the Inner Richmond. Growing up, David's life was a blend of pupusas from neighborhood visits with family friends and the comforting scent of his father\u2019s herbal remedies. While his parents provided unwavering love and stability, he always navigated a quiet, internal space of dual identity\u2014the Hispanic boy with a Chinese surname, fluent in Cantonese idioms but with a deep longing for the Spanish lullabies he never knew.\n\nThis intrinsic curiosity about belonging and human connection guided his educational path. After earning a bachelor's degree in sociology from UC Davis, he felt a pull to translate theory into practice. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, completing a Master of Social Work. His own upbringing became his greatest asset, granting him a unique empathy for others caught between worlds. He found his calling in a hospital-based healthcare system, becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in adolescents and immigrant families grappling with cultural and generational divides.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago when, after a long and emotionally fraught search, he met his birth mother. The reunion wasn't a storybook ending but a complex, bittersweet dialogue that provided answers but also new questions. The experience solidified his professional resolve, deepening his compassion for the messy, imperfect nature of family.\n\nToday, David lives alone in a cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a few blocks from his parents. The 0.0-mile commute reflects his shift to providing therapy primarily through telehealth, a change that allows him more time for his routines: early morning runs in Golden Gate Park, weekly dim sum with his parents, and a fiercely competitive pickup basketball game with a close-knit group of friends. His dream isn\u2019t to change the world, but to continue creating safe spaces for others to find their footing. He aspires to one day open a small private practice focused on identity and adoption, a testament to his own journey of becoming whole in the city that has always been his home."

You don\u2019t look Chinese.\u201d The question hung in the air, thick with the scent of herbs. He felt a hot flush of shame, a feeling of being wrong. His father just placed a warm hand on his shoulder, a silent, powerful gesture of belonging that David would carry forever. It was the first time he understood his identity was a question he\u2019d have to answer, but that he wasn't alone in it.\n\n2.\nThe letter from the private investigator arrived six years ago. Just a plain manila envelope. For years, his birth mother was a ghost, a question mark. Now, her name\u2014Ana\u2014was ink on paper. His hands shook as he sat at his kitchen table, the abstract longing he\u2019d carried his whole life suddenly having a weight, a terrifying reality. In that moment, the boy who wondered became the man who had to know, no matter the cost. His search was no longer a dream; it was a destination.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, in a sterile coffee shop, he finally met her. He\u2019d imagined this moment thousands of times, but what he remembered most were her hands. They were his hands\u2014the same long fingers, the same shape of the knuckles. They had held him once. As she nervously stirred her coffee, he saw a lifetime of labor in them, a story he\u2019d never fully know. There was no grand revelation, just a quiet, painful recognition of a connection that was both undeniable and irrevocably broken.\n\n4.\nEarly in his career, a teen client from a mixed-heritage family confessed, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not enough of either thing.\u201d The words struck David like a familiar chord. He didn\u2019t just hear the boy\u2019s pain; he felt it in his own bones. In that moment, his own lifelong feeling of being \"in-between\" transformed from a private burden into his greatest professional asset. He finally understood his purpose: to hold space for others navigating the same fractured landscapes he had, and assure them they were already whole.\n\n5.\nLast Thursday at the pickup game, chest heaving, he passed the ball to his friend Mike without looking, a perfect assist for a layup. The high-five afterwards was instinctive, familiar. Amid the squeak of sneakers and easy trash talk, there were no questions about his name or his face. He was just David. This simple, sweaty camaraderie felt as vital as any family bond. It was a powerful reminder that belonging isn't just about roots; it's also about the connections you build, shot by shot."
