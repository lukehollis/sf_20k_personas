Born in Los Angeles to a young, overwhelmed Salvadoran mother, he was adopted at six months old by the Wongs, a loving first-generation Chinese-American couple who owned a small pharmacy in the Inner Richmond. Growing up, David's life was a blend of pupusas from neighborhood visits with family friends and the comforting scent of his father\u2019s herbal remedies. While his parents provided unwavering love and stability, he always navigated a quiet, internal space of dual identity\u2014the Hispanic boy with a Chinese surname, fluent in Cantonese idioms but with a deep longing for the Spanish lullabies he never knew.\n\nThis intrinsic curiosity about belonging and human connection guided his educational path. After earning a bachelor's degree in sociology from UC Davis, he felt a pull to translate theory into practice. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, completing a Master of Social Work. His own upbringing became his greatest asset, granting him a unique empathy for others caught between worlds. He found his calling in a hospital-based healthcare system, becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in adolescents and immigrant families grappling with cultural and generational divides.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago when, after a long and emotionally fraught search, he met his birth mother. The reunion wasn't a storybook ending but a complex, bittersweet dialogue that provided answers but also new questions. The experience solidified his professional resolve, deepening his compassion for the messy, imperfect nature of family.\n\nToday, David lives alone in a cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a few blocks from his parents. The 0.0-mile commute reflects his shift to providing therapy primarily through telehealth, a change that allows him more time for his routines: early morning runs in Golden Gate Park, weekly dim sum with his parents, and a fiercely competitive pickup basketball game with a close-knit group of friends. His dream isn\u2019t to change the world, but to continue creating safe spaces for others to find their footing. He aspires to one day open a small private practice focused on identity and adoption, a testament to his own journey of becoming whole in the city that has always been his home."
