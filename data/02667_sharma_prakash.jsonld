Born to nomadic humanitarian aid workers, his childhood was a blur of continents and cultures, leaving him with a rich internal world but no single ethnic identity to claim as his own. His education was equally unconventional, happening not in classrooms but in bustling marketplaces, quiet temples, and refugee camps. He learned perspective by sketching faces in a Moroccan souk and color theory from the fading murals of a Peruvian village. He has no formal degree, only a collection of dog-eared sketchbooks that serve as his passport and diploma.\n\nThe turning point came at 27. After his parents were killed in a sudden rockslide while on assignment, Prakash found himself unmoored, the threads connecting his past completely severed. He drifted for years before landing in San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a sanctuary for wanderers. Here, his portfolio of raw, worldly art spoke louder than any academic transcript. He was hired by a progressive private high school near Golden Gate Park, which valued his unique life experience over traditional credentials.\n\nNow 46, Prakash\u2019s life has found a quiet, intense focus. He lives in a small faculty apartment on the school\u2019s campus, making his commute a simple walk across a manicured lawn. His apartment is a curated chaos of his own sculptures, canvases, and artifacts from his travels. His daily routine is grounded in his work: early mornings spent prepping clay and paint, days guiding teenagers through the frustrations and triumphs of creation, and evenings spent on his own projects or walking through the fog-laced trails of the nearby park.\n\nHis most meaningful connections are with his students, particularly the ones who feel like outsiders. He sees himself in them and pushes them to find their own visual language. While he has friends and occasional dates, he remains romantically guarded, wary of the deep roots he never experienced as a child. Prakash\u2019s dream is to one day open a small, free community art studio in the Outer Richmond, a stable, creative hub for anyone who feels adrift. For a man who grew up everywhere and nowhere, his greatest aspiration is to build a permanent sense of home for others."
