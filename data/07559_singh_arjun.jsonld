They had sacrificed everything in Punjab to give him a life of stability, which, in their minds, was paved with a degree in engineering or medicine. Arjun, a quiet and perceptive child, often felt like a supporting character in his own life story, his emotional landscape overlooked in the family\u2019s relentless pursuit of tangible success. He was the one his friends confided in, the calm presence in their teenage dramas, yet at home, his own anxieties were dismissed as distractions.\n\nThis formative experience became his compass. After a miserable year as a computer science major at UC Davis, he made a life-altering choice, switching his major to psychology. The decision caused a rift with his parents, who saw it as a rejection of their sacrifices, but for Arjun, it felt like his first truly authentic act. He excelled, driven by a newfound purpose, and went on to earn his Master's in School Counseling from San Francisco State University.\n\nNow, at 30, Arjun works as a counselor at a prestigious private high school in Pacific Heights. The position came with a rare San Francisco unicorn: on-campus housing. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk across a manicured quad, a strange reality that blurs the lines between his personal and professional life. His days are a whirlwind of scheduled appointments with students struggling with academic pressure, social anxieties, and family expectations he understands all too well.\n\nLiving amidst the city\u2019s elite, Arjun is a keen observer of the privilege that surrounds him, a world away from his Fremont upbringing. To maintain his sanity and connection to a life outside the school\u2019s ivy-covered walls, he is fiercely protective of his weekly trivia nights in the Mission with friends from grad school. On weekends, he finds solace in long, anonymous runs through Golden Gate Park. His dream is to one day develop a district-wide mental health program for public schools, making the kind of support he offers accessible to all students, not just the fortunate few. He hopes for a future where his home is his own and his work is something he can leave at the office\u2014a simple, quiet life he can finally call his own."
