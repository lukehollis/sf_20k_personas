A third-generation Japanese American, he was raised in San Jose by a stoic engineer father and a nurturing teacher mother who saw education as the ultimate form of security. Surrounded by the nascent hum of circuit boards and the ambition of the burgeoning tech industry, Liam was pushed toward a practical, promising future. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley, spending three years designing microprocessors. Yet, he found the work isolating, a silent dialogue with machines that lacked the human element of strategy and debate he craved.\n\nThis realization was his first major turning point. He pivoted, applying his technical mind to the world of law, and earned his Juris Doctor from Stanford. Liam found his true calling in the intricate dance of technology and litigation. He joined a prestigious San Francisco firm just before the dot-com bubble, making his name defending the intellectual property of brilliant, chaotic innovators. He thrived on the pressure, his calm demeanor a valuable asset in high-stakes negotiations. His career soared, but his marriage, strained by 80-hour workweeks, quietly dissolved.\n\nNow, at 50, Liam lives a life of curated solitude in his Pacific Heights condo, his commute a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his home office overlooking the fog-draped bay. His days are a disciplined rhythm of client calls, patent filings, and legal strategy. The frantic energy of his youth has mellowed into a deep expertise. He no longer chases every case, selecting clients whose technology genuinely excites him.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and quiet. It's not in the nightlife, but in his morning walks through Lafayette Park and the familiar faces at his local Japanese grocer. In his free time, he practices Kintsugi, the art of mending broken pottery with gold. It feels symbolic, a quiet reflection on his own life\u2014finding beauty and strength in the fractures. His ambition is no longer about wealth, but about legacy. He dreams of scaling back his practice to mentor young, underfunded inventors, helping them protect the sparks of genius that still fascinate him more than anything else."
