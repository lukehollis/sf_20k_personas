Born in Daly City to a Filipino-American auto mechanic father and a first-generation Korean mother who worked as a caregiver, Nikolai\u2019s upbringing was a blend of loud, grease-stained practicality and quiet, determined diligence. His childhood wasn't spent in coding bootcamps but in his father's garage, where he learned the satisfying logic of how things fit together.\n\nIn school, Nikolai was never captivated by abstract theories. He found his focus in ROP classes, his hands instinctively understanding what his mind struggled to grasp in textbooks. After high school, he enrolled in the Machine Tool Technology program at City College of San Francisco, but the formal degree felt less important than the skills themselves. After earning several key certifications, he left college to accept a promising apprenticeship. This was a turning point; he chose the certainty of a craft over the ambiguity of a diploma.\n\nNow, at 33, Nikolai is a highly skilled CNC Machinist at a small, specialized manufacturing plant in the Dogpatch. He earns a solid $95,000, but in San Francisco, that salary demands a modest lifestyle. His daily 8.5-mile commute is a ritual. He zips from his small apartment in the foggy Outer Sunset to the industrial edge of the city on his beloved Suzuki SV650, the roar of the engine a stark contrast to the quiet hum of tech company shuttles.\n\nHis life is one of tangible creation in a city obsessed with the virtual. Nikolai\u2019s social circle is tight-knit, composed of fellow riders and makers he\u2019s met at local garages and rock-climbing gyms. He isn't chasing venture capital; he's saving for a down payment on his own 5-axis CNC mill. His dream is to open a small, independent shop creating bespoke motorcycle parts and high-precision components for local robotics firms. He represents a different San Francisco\u2014one built not on code, but on craft and steel. Nikolai\u2019s future is one he intends to mill for himself, with his own hands, one perfect cut at a time."

He just took the tool, tapped the bolt head, and said, \"It\u2019s not angry, it\u2019s just stuck. You have to understand *why*.\" In that grease-scented moment, Nikolai learned that every problem had a logical solution if you just looked at it right. It was the instant he fell in love with fixing things, not just forcing them, a lesson that defined his patient approach to every challenge.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, he watched his mother make kimchi on a foggy Saturday, the Outer Sunset pressing against the glass. Her movements were precise, repetitive, and full of a quiet intention he rarely saw elsewhere. It wasn't loud like the garage; it was a different kind of work. He realized then that diligence wasn\u2019t about noise or sweat, but about patient, perfect repetition. It was a lesson in focus he\u2019d later apply to the lathe, seeing his mother's hands in the steady path of the cutting tool.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty, standing in a sterile City College hallway, the smell of floor wax in the air. His phone buzzed\u2014the shop in the Dogpatch was offering him the apprenticeship. He felt the pull of the diploma his mother hoped for, but the thought of the Bridgeport mill, the raw steel, the tangible result\u2014it was a visceral certainty. He accepted the job on the spot. It was the moment he consciously chose the craft itself over the paper that described it, cementing his identity as a maker.\n\n4.\nThe first time he rode his own Suzuki SV650 home from the Dogpatch at 24 was a revelation. Weaving through traffic on Cesar Chavez, the V-twin engine thrumming beneath him, he felt a powerful ownership over the city. He wasn't a passenger in a silent tech shuttle; he was a part of the city\u2019s mechanical heartbeat. The ride became more than a commute; it was a daily reclamation of his space in a San Francisco that so often felt like it wasn't built for him.\n\n5.\nAbout a year ago, he machined a delicate actuator housing for a robotics firm. The specs were unforgiving. He ran the final pass, pulled it from the 5-axis mill, and held it in his palm. It was perfect\u2014flawless to the micron. In that moment, the part felt more like his own creation than his employer\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t just pride; it was the crystalizing thought that he could, and should, be making things like this under his own name. The dream of his own shop was no longer abstract."
