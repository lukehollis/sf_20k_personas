The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up in the apartment above his parents\u2019 small grocery store. From behind the counter, he watched the city evolve, listening to the concerns of his neighbors\u2014complaints about the MUNI, the ever-rising cost of rent, and the labyrinth of city permits his father battled. This daily education in civic life proved more formative than any textbook.\n\nAn academically gifted but quiet student, David attended Lowell High School before heading across the bay to UC Berkeley, where he studied sociology. After graduating, a brief, disillusioning stint at a housing rights non-profit became his turning point. He realized that to enact real, systemic change, he needed to understand the mechanics of power from the inside. This conviction led him back to Berkeley for a Master of Public Policy, where he specialized in urban planning and municipal finance.\n\nToday, at 37, David is a Senior Policy Analyst for the city. His 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in the spare bedroom of the Inner Sunset condo he shares with his long-term partner, Sarah, a landscape architect. His days are a meticulous procession of data analysis, policy briefs, and Zoom meetings about zoning regulations or transit efficiency. He dissects the very issues he once heard debated over boxes of produce in his parents' store.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is etched into his being. He jogs through Golden Gate Park, tracing the same paths he did as a child. His social circle is a tight-knit group of friends from grad school and a few old high school connections. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand or flashy; it\u2019s granular. He aspires to author a single, elegant policy that demonstrably eases the housing crunch or streamlines a public service. He doesn't want his name on a plaque, but he desperately wants to leave his hometown a more equitable and functional place than he found it."
