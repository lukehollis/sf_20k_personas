Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from her small bedroom to the living room of a large Victorian in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. At 47, her life is a quiet rhythm of service, defined by the needs of the man she cares for.\n\nBorn in Okinawa to a Japanese mother and an American serviceman, Keiko grew up between worlds. Her formal education was inconsistent, but her true learning came from her mother, a woman skilled in traditional remedies, massage, and the art of patient listening. They moved to the Bay Area when Keiko was a teenager, a disorienting shift that left her feeling like an outsider. For years, she drifted through low-wage service jobs, never finding a place to anchor herself.\n\nThe turning point was her own mother\u2019s long illness. Keiko became her primary caregiver, rediscovering the hands-on skills she had learned as a child. In those difficult years, she found a profound sense of purpose. After her mother\u2019s passing, a friend connected her with the family of Mr. Chen, an elderly man with advancing dementia whose children needed a compassionate, live-in aide.\n\nFor the last five years, this has been her life. Her days are structured around Mr. Chen\u2019s medication schedule, his meals, and his moments of lucidity. Her social life consists of brief, friendly chats with the neighborhood grocer and weekly phone calls with one of her old friends. Her deepest human connection is with a man who often doesn\u2019t remember her name, but whose calm depends entirely on her steady presence. Her San Francisco is not the city of tech booms and tourist crowds, but the foggy avenues, the mournful sound of the foghorns, and the familiar faces in her immediate vicinity.\n\nKeiko doesn\u2019t dream of wealth or travel. Her aspiration is smaller, more sacred: a quiet studio apartment of her own, perhaps in the Sunset District. A place where she can tend to a window box of herbs, adopt a cat, and experience the simple peace of being responsible for no one but herself. It is a future she quietly holds onto, a gentle hope for the day her work is done."
