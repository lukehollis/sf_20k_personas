Raised in Fremont by an immigrant father, a pragmatic software engineer, and a community-minded mother who taught English as a second language, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a predictable landscape of cul-de-sacs and strip malls. He saw how the reliance on cars isolated his parents\u2019 community and erased public space. This quiet observation planted a seed that wouldn\u2019t fully blossom until a semester abroad during his undergraduate studies at UC Davis.\n\nThat turning point came in Copenhagen. The city\u2019s human-scaled elegance\u2014its seamless integration of bicycle infrastructure, vibrant public squares, and efficient transit\u2014was a revelation. It wasn't just beautiful; it was equitable. He returned to California with a singular focus, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Urban Planning program. There, he immersed himself in land use policy, housing theory, and the complex social dynamics of city-building.\n\nUpon graduating, Rohan took a junior role with the San Francisco Planning Department, driven by a desire to tackle the Bay Area\u2019s most pressing challenges. Now, at 34, he\u2019s a Senior City Planner, a veteran of contentious community meetings and intricate zoning battles. He lives and breathes his work from his Hayes Valley apartment, a location that makes his 0.0-mile commute a reality on his remote workdays and a short walk to City Hall on others. His days are a blur of GIS mapping, policy draft revision, and mediating between developers and long-time residents.\n\nSocially, Rohan\u2019s life is intertwined with his profession. His close friends are fellow planners, architects, and housing activists. Dating is a series of well-intentioned walks to new parklets and debates over dinner about the city\u2019s future. He dreams of an SF that lives up to its progressive ideals\u2014a city with abundant, affordable housing and world-class public transit. His deepest aspiration isn't to build a landmark skyscraper, but to successfully shepherd a policy that allows a teacher or an artist to continue calling San Francisco home."

He remembers her quiet disappointment as she hung up the phone after another student, who lived just two miles away across the wide asphalt river of Fremont Boulevard, had to cancel. They had no car. Rohan saw the invisible walls trapping them, built of concrete and car-dependency. The memory cemented his childhood observation into a core belief: that poor design wasn't just inefficient, it was a subtle form of cruelty that isolated the vulnerable.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, sitting at an outdoor cafe in Copenhagen on his second day abroad. It wasn\u2019t the number of bikes that struck him, but the sound. The near-total absence of engine roar was replaced by a symphony of human activity: the gentle ringing of bells, overlapping conversations, the laughter of children in a nearby square. He felt a profound sense of peace and rightness. This wasn't merely transit; it was dignity. That moment transformed his abstract academic interest into a tangible, emotional quest for a more civilized urban life.\n\n3.\nHis first major community meeting as a junior planner, barely 27. He was presenting a modest affordable housing proposal for the Sunset. He came armed with data and rational arguments, but was met with a wall of pure, unscripted fear from older homeowners. One woman, clutching a folder of photos of her street, tearfully accused him of trying to destroy her life\u2019s work. He felt his idealism curdle into a sobering reality. He learned that night that he wasn\u2019t just a planner of spaces, but a navigator of people\u2019s deepest anxieties.\n\n4.\nOn a Saturday morning when he was 30, he walked to the Inner Richmond to see the first parklet he\u2019d successfully navigated through the approval process. He bought a coffee and watched from across the street as a young couple sat reading on the bench and a family paused so their toddler could touch the planter box. It was a tiny victory on a tiny patch of reclaimed asphalt, but it felt monumental. This quiet vindication affirmed that his work could, in small but tangible ways, give the city back to its people.\n\n5.\nLast week, after a brutal thirteen-hour workday spent mediating a hopeless zoning appeal, he felt utterly defeated. He stepped out of his Hayes Valley building, ready for a silent, grim walk. But the street was alive. The warm light and chatter spilling from the restaurants, the distant rumble of a MUNI streetcar, the couple walking past arguing playfully about where to get dessert. The vibrancy of his own neighborhood washed over him. It was a visceral reminder of what he was fighting for, recharging his spirit when his professional resolve was nearly gone."
