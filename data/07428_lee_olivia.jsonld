The only daughter of pragmatic first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, both software engineers, Olivia was raised on a diet of logic, ambition, and the promise of a stable career in tech. Her childhood was comfortable but regimented. However, a family trip to Yosemite National Park when she was ten became a quiet rebellion in her soul. While her parents discussed hiking efficiency, Olivia was mesmerized by the sheer granite cliffs and ancient sequoias, feeling a profound connection to the natural world that code could never replicate.\n\nThis formative experience guided her educational journey. Forsaking the engineering path laid out for her, she chose to study Environmental Science at UC Santa Cruz, a decision her parents met with confused support. There, she thrived, immersing herself in ecology and policy. After graduating, she made her definitive break from the suburbs, moving into a small, sunlit studio in San Francisco's Mission District. The move was a declaration of independence, a choice to live amidst the culture and controlled chaos she craved.\n\nNow, Olivia works as an environmental consultant from her apartment, which explains her zero-mile commute. Her firm specializes in helping Bay Area tech companies and developers navigate California's complex environmental regulations. Her days are a blend of virtual meetings, data analysis, and writing impact reports, her apartment filled with thriving plants that serve as a miniature version of the ecosystems she fights to protect. She finds a certain irony in helping corporations she is wary of achieve environmental compliance, but sees it as making a tangible, if incremental, difference from within the system.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of the Mission. Mornings often start with a run to Dolores Park before a day of remote work. Evenings are for exploring taquerias with a tight-knit group of college friends, rock climbing at Mission Cliffs, or simply enjoying the vibrant street life from her window. A recent, amicable breakup has shifted her focus inward, strengthening her friendships and her commitment to her career. Olivia dreams of one day moving from consulting to policy-making, to have a larger hand in shaping a sustainable future for the city she now calls home. She loves San Francisco for its progressive spirit and its proximity to wild coastlines, seeing it as the perfect, complicated place to build a life dedicated to protecting the planet."
