Raised in a large, boisterous family where the salt-laced air was thick with the scent of plumeria and backyard imu, Malia learned early that community meant caring for one another. That sense of duty and a desire for a different future propelled her to San Francisco at 19, following a high school sweetheart to enroll in the Social Work program at SF State.\n\nThe city was a shock of cold fog and dizzying energy, a world away from the Big Island\u2019s gentle pace. Malia found her footing, but two years into her degree, a call came from home. Her mother had fallen ill, and the family needed support. Without hesitation, Malia left school to work full-time, sending a portion of every paycheck back to Hawai'i. The dream of a degree was deferred, replaced by the immediate reality of necessity.\n\nThis detour became her path. While working administrative jobs, she found herself unofficially guiding colleagues and friends through the very healthcare and social service systems she was struggling with herself. This informal role became a calling. Now, at 41, she is a Patient Navigator at a community health center in the Mission, helping low-income families untangle the maze of bureaucracy. It\u2019s not the career she planned, but it\u2019s the one that fits her spirit perfectly.\n\nMalia lives in a quiet one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond. Her daily commute on the 38-Geary bus is her time to decompress, watching the city\u2019s diverse cast of characters. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a handful of fellow Hawai'i transplants who gather for potlucks, sharing laulau and laughter that reminds her of home. Her aspiration is to finally finish her Social Work degree, taking one online class at a time. It\u2019s not for a promotion, but for herself\u2014a promise made to a younger Malia who first crossed the Pacific, ready to help the world."

Inside, her father\u2019s voice, rough with a strain she\u2019d never heard, explained her mother\u2019s diagnosis. The future she had been building\u2014classes, a degree, a life with her boyfriend\u2014crumbled in that instant. It wasn't a choice to leave school. It was an instinct, the same way you\u2019d pull a loved one from a fire. It was the moment her *k\u014dkua* became her compass.\n\n2.\nAt 27, working data entry, she remembers sitting with a new hire from the Philippines during a lunch break. The woman, Elena, was staring at a bill from SF General, her face a mask of fear. Malia took the papers and, using her lunch hour, made three phone calls, deciphering codes and advocating for a payment plan. When she hung up, Elena was crying softly with relief. In that sterile office, under fluorescent lights, Malia felt a flicker of purpose she hadn\u2019t felt since leaving school, realizing her true work happened between the spreadsheets.\n\n3.\nThe first potluck felt like cheating on San Francisco. She was 24, lonely, and walked into a Sunset apartment filled with the scent of k\u0101lua pig and the comforting cadence of pidgin. Someone had flown in a cooler of Zippy\u2019s chili. She sank into a worn-out couch, a plate of laulau on her lap, and listened to stories of home. The laughter was a warm current in the cold city air. That night, she learned she didn\u2019t have to leave Hawai'i behind; she could build a small island of it here.\n\n4.\nJust last year, a young mother from El Salvador finally received the approval for her son\u2019s specialized medical care after a six-month battle Malia had fought alongside her. Malia found the woman in the clinic waiting room to share the news. The mother didn\u2019t shout or cheer; she simply folded her hands over Malia\u2019s, her shoulders shaking with silent, grateful tears. In that quiet moment, Malia felt the entire weight of her diverted life settle into a feeling of profound rightness. This was the work she was meant to do.\n\n5.\nIt was almost midnight on a Tuesday when she did it. At her small desk in the Inner Richmond, illuminated by her laptop screen, she finally re-enrolled at SF State Online. Just one class: Social Policy & Practice. Her finger hovered over the confirmation button. This wasn\u2019t for a promotion or a pay raise. It was a quiet promise kept to the earnest 19-year-old who stepped off the plane years ago, ready to help. This time, the helping started with herself. She clicked the button and smiled."
