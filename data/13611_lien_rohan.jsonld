His father\u2019s family were Vietnamese boat people who settled in San Jose in the early 1980s, building a life from scratch. His mother, an aspiring software engineer, emigrated from Mumbai in the 90s. They met at a community Diwali celebration, a fusion of worlds that would define Rohan\u2019s upbringing. Growing up in the sprawling suburbs of San Jose, Rohan felt a constant disconnect. Life was a series of car rides between tract housing, strip malls, and office parks. His world was defined by the sterile efficiency of Highway 87, not the vibrant chaos he craved.\n\nThe turning point came during a high school trip to San Francisco. Riding the rattling F-Market streetcar, surrounded by the dense, human-scale architecture of the Castro and the energy of a city where people lived their lives on foot, was a revelation. He saw how thoughtful design could foster community and connection. This ignited a passion that led him to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for a degree in Urban Planning, where he focused his studies on public transit systems.\n\nNow 29, Rohan lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. He\u2019s achieved his goal of shaping the city that once inspired him, working as a Transportation Planner for the SFMTA. His 3.8-mile commute on the 38R-Geary Rapid is a daily field study; he meticulously notes bus bunching, sidewalk conditions, and rider behavior, often sending himself notes for work. His $115,000 salary affords him a comfortable, if not extravagant, lifestyle. Weekends are for running in Golden Gate Park, exploring dim sum parlors on Clement Street, and catching indie films at the Balboa Theatre.\n\nRohan\u2019s social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow urban enthusiasts and old college friends. His relationships are often intense but fleeting, hampered by the transient nature of the city and his own deep focus on his career. He dreams of a future San Francisco with fewer cars and more equitable access for all residents. His personal aspiration is simpler, yet perhaps more challenging: to one day own a small piece of the city he works so hard to improve, a place to truly put down roots in the vibrant urban tapestry he calls home."

He stared out at the sound walls, the endless chain of brake lights, the distant, identical office buildings. It felt like living inside a diagram, a place without a soul. This wasn't a community, just a series of destinations connected by asphalt. The feeling of profound loneliness that settled in his chest that day became the quiet engine driving him toward something, anything, else.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, the clatter of the F-Market streetcar was a symphony. Packed shoulder-to-shoulder on a high school field trip, he watched the Castro slip by: rainbow flags, people laughing on sidewalks, ornate Victorian windows stacked one atop the other. It was dense, chaotic, and gloriously human. He realized then that a city wasn't just buildings, but a system designed for connection\u2014or disconnection. In that moment, staring out the window, his future career path clicked into place.\n\n3.\nHe was nine, at a Diwali party in a San Jose community hall. The air was thick with the scent of his mother\u2019s samosas and the distinct, savory aroma of his grandmother\u2019s nem n\u01b0\u1edbng. His Vietnamese B\u00e1c was trying to explain cricket to his Indian Uncle, both laughing over paper plates. He felt the beautiful awkwardness of it all\u2014a fusion that was uniquely his. It taught him that the most vibrant places are born from unexpected intersections, a lesson he would later apply to city blocks.\n\n4.\nTwo years into his job at SFMTA, he stood on a corner on Geary Boulevard at dawn. He watched the first of the new, articulated 38R buses he\u2019d helped route pull away from the curb, its doors hissing shut. He saw a nurse, a cook, and a student settle in for their ride. It was a small, incremental change, invisible to most. For Rohan, it was everything\u2014a physical manifestation of countless meetings and spreadsheets, a tangible piece of a better city. He felt a profound, quiet pride.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a farewell party for a close friend moving to Austin for a cheaper mortgage, Rohan stood on a foggy balcony in the Mission. He listened to the familiar talk of burnout and the impossibility of buying a home. Each story was a small departure, a fraying thread in the city\u2019s fabric. Looking at the skyline, a fierce, protective ache bloomed in his chest. It cemented his quiet, almost defiant dream: to not just plan the city, but to own a small, permanent piece of it."
