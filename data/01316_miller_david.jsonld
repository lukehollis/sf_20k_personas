            "value": "David Miller considers himself a native San Franciscan, not by birth, but by spirit. Born to a globe-trotting academic mother and a father he never knew, David\u2019s upbringing was a patchwork of temporary homes until they settled in a dusty Inner Sunset flat in the late 1970s. He carries no specific ethnic identity, viewing himself simply as a product of a hundred migrations that ended, for a time, in the fog. Formal education was a poor fit for his restless mind; he found traditional schooling intolerably slow and dropped out at 17, his true education already well underway in the nascent world of personal computing and dial-up bulletin board systems.\n\nHis career was forged not in a university lab but in his garage. An autodidact with a preternatural gift for code, David navigated the first dot-com boom by creating elegant solutions to complex data problems. He never sought the spotlight, preferring to sell his patents or consult for small, ambitious teams. This journey led him to his current role as Director of Research and Development for a stealth biotech firm. He is a ghost in the machine, a brilliant mind on a payroll with no physical office.\n\nThe pivotal turning point in David\u2019s life was his divorce fifteen years ago. His ex-wife, an artist, had lovingly called his work \"the mistress,\" until she could no longer compete. The split solidified his retreat into his work and his home. Now, his life unfolds within the glass walls of his SoMa condominium. The 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to the standing desk overlooking the Bay Bridge. His social connections are primarily digital\u2014collaborators in Zurich, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in Seoul.\n\nHis daily routine is monastic: coffee, code, a solitary walk along the Embarcadero to feel the sea air, then back to the glow of his monitors. He is a living artifact of a bygone San Francisco, now helping to build its hyper-modern future. His dream is no longer financial; it\u2019s about legacy. He hopes to pioneer a breakthrough in computational biology that fundamentally changes medicine. It's a quest for a meaning profound enough to justify a lifetime of chosen isolation, a contribution more lasting than the flickering city lights reflected in his window."
