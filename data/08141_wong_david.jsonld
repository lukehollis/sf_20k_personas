Born in Daly City to hardworking parents who had immigrated from Hong Kong in the early 1970s, his childhood was a blend of two worlds. At home, the air was thick with the scent of his mother\u2019s cooking and the sound of Cantonese filling their small house. Outside, he navigated the English-speaking world of American schools, becoming the family\u2019s de facto translator and bridge to their new country. He saw the toll that running a small dry-cleaning business took on his parents and vowed to build a different life, one fueled by intellect rather than physical labor.\n\nThis pragmatic ambition led him to UC Davis, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications. The timing was perfect. Graduating in the late 90s, David was swept up in the first dot-com boom, landing an entry-level sales job at a software startup. He survived the subsequent bust by being adaptable and relentlessly personable, learning early that selling technology was less about the code and more about human connection and trust. Over two decades, he steadily climbed the corporate ladder, moving from company to company, building a reputation as a savvy, reliable manager who could close deals and mentor a team.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was a divorce seven years ago. The split was amicable but jarring, forcing him to re-evaluate his priorities. He sold their shared house in the East Bay and bought a crisp, modern condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he chose for its walkability and proximity to the city\u2019s cultural heart. Today, his life is defined by a quiet, structured independence. As a Regional Sales Manager, his 0.0-mile commute means his second bedroom is a permanent command center of monitors and headsets. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, managing teams from Seattle to San Diego.\n\nHis social life consists of a tight-knit circle of old friends, meeting for dinner in the Mission or catching a Giants game. He\u2019s a familiar face at his local coffee shop, the baristas knowing his order by heart. Though successful, David harbors a quiet longing for something more. He dreams of taking a year off to travel through Southeast Asia\u2014not for a sales conference, but for himself. He wants to see his parents\u2019 village, not as a visitor, but as a son reconnecting with a part of himself he feels has been muted by decades of relentless ambition in the city he now calls home."
