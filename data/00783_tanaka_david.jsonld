Raised in the manicured suburbs of Saratoga, he was the son of a first-generation Japanese architect and a second-generation high school math teacher. His upbringing was a comfortable mix of high expectations and supportive logic, instilling in him a deep appreciation for structure and the natural world. He spent his youth hiking the Santa Cruz Mountains, a passion that led him to UC Santa Cruz, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science.\n\nHis early twenties were a frustrating lesson in reality. The environmental jobs he coveted were scarce and underfunded. After a year of disillusionment working part-time at a nursery, a friend suggested a pivot that felt like a betrayal of his ideals: a coding bootcamp. To his surprise, David excelled. The logical problem-solving clicked, echoing the mathematical and architectural principles of his upbringing. It wasn't his passion, but it was a skill.\n\nThis new path brought him to San Francisco. He landed a junior developer role at a mid-sized tech firm and quickly distinguished himself not just for his clean code, but for his ability to organize chaos. He saw the entire system, not just his small piece of it, a remnant of his holistic environmental studies. This led to his promotion to Project Engineer, a role that leveraged his knack for structure and communication.\n\nNow 32, David lives a life defined by his 0.0-mile commute. His apartment in the Inner Richmond, shared with his long-term partner, Chloe, is both a sanctuary and an office. His days are a disciplined routine of morning runs in Golden Gate Park, followed by a sequence of Zoom calls and project management tasks. Evenings are for cooking with Chloe, unwinding with video games, or planning weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nHe feels a dual connection to the city: it\u2019s the epicenter of the career he fell into, but also the gateway to the nature he\u2019s always loved. David's dream is to bridge that gap. He aspires to lead a project with a tangible environmental benefit, using the pragmatic skills of his tech career to finally fulfill the ideals of his youth. He seeks a future where his work not only builds software, but also rebuilds a small piece of the world he once studied."
