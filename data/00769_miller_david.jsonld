            "value": "David Miller is a product of the pragmatic, industrious Midwest. Raised in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, his father was a mechanical engineer who filled their garage with diagrams and half-finished projects, while his mother, a high school math teacher, ensured life ran on a predictable, comforting schedule. From them, David inherited a quiet fascination with systems\u2014not just how things were built, but how they could be improved. He saw the world as a series of processes waiting to be optimized, a mindset that led him to pursue an undergraduate degree in engineering at Ohio State.\n\nThe turning point was his acceptance into UC Berkeley for a Master's in Industrial Engineering. Leaving Ohio was a seismic shift. The sheer scale and chaotic energy of the Bay Area was both intimidating and exhilarating. He excelled in his program, finding beauty in streamlining complex supply chains and operational workflows. Upon graduating, he accepted a role as a Process Engineer at a growing San Francisco tech company, a job that, to his satisfaction, was made fully remote a year into his tenure.\n\nNow 28, David\u2019s life is a carefully calibrated system built within his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute offers peak efficiency. Mornings begin not with a rush-hour train, but with a solitary run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, just blocks away. He then settles into his workday, finding deep satisfaction in untangling digital knots and designing smoother pathways for software deployment, his focus uninterrupted by office chatter.\n\nThis deliberate isolation, however, requires a conscious counterbalance. He\u2019s a regular at a climbing gym in the Mission, where the physical problem-solving offers a welcome escape from the digital world and a low-stakes social outlet. His social circle is small, a tight-knit group of friends from his Berkeley days. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, David is navigating the awkward terrain of dating apps, finding the process inefficient but necessary. He dreams of rising to a lead position where he can design systems from the ground up, and more personally, of finding a partner who understands his blend of quiet intensity and deep curiosity. His San Francisco is not one of tech parties and downtown skylines, but of perfecting a mapo tofu recipe with ingredients from Clement Street and finding the quietest corner of the park."
