A third-generation Japanese American, he was born not in San Francisco, but amidst the suburban sprawl of San Jose. His grandparents, who had endured the indignity of internment camps during WWII, later established a successful plant nursery, instilling in the family a reverence for growth, patience, and meticulous form. Kenji\u2019s parents, a practical engineer and a detail-oriented accountant, hoped he would follow a similarly stable path. However, from a young age, Kenji was more captivated by the skeletal frames of high-rises under construction than by spreadsheets or circuit boards.\n\nHe found a compromise in architecture, a field that satisfied both his artistic sensibilities and his family\u2019s desire for a respectable profession. After completing his undergraduate studies, he pursued a Master of Architecture at UC Berkeley, where he honed his philosophy: that a building should serve the human spirit, not just its function. His early career at a large corporate firm was lucrative but creatively stifling, spent designing sterile office towers. The turning point came in his late thirties when he quit, taking a significant pay cut to join a small, prestigious firm specializing in cultural projects. It was there he found his calling, designing museums, theaters, and public galleries.\n\nToday, Kenji lives in a sun-drenched, minimalist loft in Dogpatch, which also serves as his home office, hence the zero-mile commute. His days begin before dawn with matcha tea and an hour of sketching, allowing ideas to flow freely before the day\u2019s structured work begins. His partner of fifteen years, Marcus, a landscape architect, shares his aesthetic and passion for creating beautiful, functional spaces. Their social life is intimate, revolving around gallery openings, dinners with a tight-knit circle of artists and academics, and long weekend bike rides through the Marin Headlands.\n\nKenji feels an immense connection to San Francisco\u2019s history of reinvention. He sees his work as part of that legacy, creating spaces that foster community and inspire awe. His ultimate aspiration is not fame, but permanence. He dreams of designing a small, beautifully integrated community arts center in an underserved neighborhood\u2014a legacy of accessible beauty that, like his grandparents\u2019 nursery, would nurture growth for generations to come."
