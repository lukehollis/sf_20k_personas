The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a bustling grocery store in the Outer Sunset, she was raised on the values of pragmatism and sacrifice. Her parents envisioned a future for her in medicine or law, a stable path far removed from their own grueling hours. To appease them, Sarah enrolled at UC Davis, initially declaring a major in Economics. But her true education happened in borrowed art history books and on weekend trips to SFMOMA, where she felt a sense of belonging she couldn't find in spreadsheets.\n\nHer turning point came during a summer internship at a small, independent gallery in the Mission District. The scent of oil paint and the passionate, chaotic energy of the artists convinced her that art wasn't just a hobby; it was a world she could inhabit professionally. She graduated with her Economics degree but immediately pivoted, taking a low-paying job as an assistant at a performing arts non-profit. Over fifteen years, she meticulously built her career, blending her practical education with her passion. Now, as a Senior Communications Specialist for a major San Francisco arts foundation, she crafts the narratives that connect artists to the public.\n\nAt 40, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her Hayes Valley condo, which doubles as her office. Her zero-mile commute affords her a deliberate routine: a morning spent on Zoom calls and writing press releases, a midday walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, and an afternoon finalizing campaign strategies. She has a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of curators, chefs, and one token tech friend\u2014who share her love for gallery openings and long dinners.\n\nWhile content, Sarah dreams of stepping out from behind the curtain. Her aspiration is to one day use her savings to become a micro-patron, funding a promising local artist\u2019s first solo show. For Sarah, who spent her youth navigating the space between expectation and desire, the ultimate success would be to provide the validation for another artist that she once so desperately sought for herself."
