Raised in Daly City, his Samoan mother instilled in him a deep respect for aiga (family) and community, while his Irish-American father, a union carpenter, taught him the value of a hard day's work. Their home was a vibrant hub of laughter, Pacific Islander traditions, and stories of scraping by in the ever-expensive Bay Area. Seeing his parents\u2019 financial struggles first-hand ignited a quiet but fierce ambition in Rohan: to understand the economic forces that shaped their lives and to build a future of stability.\n\nThis drive led him to UC Santa Barbara, where he pursued a degree in Business Economics. Initially, it was all theory and graphs, but a summer internship with a Bay Area developer was a turning point. He saw how abstract numbers on a spreadsheet translated into tangible steel and glass towers that reshaped the skyline. He was hooked. Upon graduating, he targeted the heart of the action, landing a coveted junior analyst position at a commercial real estate firm in San Francisco's Financial District.\n\nNow, Rohan\u2019s life is a study in modern SF contrasts. He lives with two roommates in a gleaming SoMa high-rise, a world away from his Daly City upbringing. His 0.7-mile walk to work is his daily meditation, a short journey past construction sites and tech shuttles that represent the city's constant churn. Weekdays are a blur of Excel models and market analysis, predicting the financial viability of future city landmarks.\n\nWeekends are for reclaiming his identity beyond the spreadsheet. He plays pickup rugby at Golden Gate Park, a visceral connection to his Samoan heritage, and explores the city\u2019s diverse food scene, from Mission taquerias to Richmond District dim sum. Though focused on his career, he feels a growing desire to bridge his two worlds. His ultimate dream isn't just to climb the corporate ladder but to one day leverage his expertise to develop community-focused projects\u2014perhaps affordable housing or small business incubators\u2014giving back to the kind of neighborhood that raised him. For Rohan, San Francisco is both the ultimate career challenge and a constant reminder of the communities that exist in the shadows of its skyscrapers."

His dad was on the roof, shouting instructions over the wind, while his mom calmly placed pots to catch drips from the ceiling. He felt a knot in his stomach\u2014not just fear of the storm, but the cold realization of how fragile their shelter was. That night, watching his father\u2019s exhausted face, Rohan quietly promised himself he would one day build things that were solid, things that couldn\u2019t be broken by the wind or worry.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring his first week as a summer intern, he stood on Folsom Street, neck craned back. A massive steel I-beam, guided by a single crane operator, ascended into the blue sky. On his spreadsheet, it was just a line item, a cost. Here, it was a piece of a future giant. In that moment, the abstract world of economics fused with the visceral reality of construction he grew up with. He wasn't just crunching numbers; he was helping to build the skyline. He was truly hooked.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was a muddy Saturday at Golden Gate Park\u2019s polo fields. After a week of staring at screens, the ball felt electric in his hands. He saw a gap, lowered his shoulder, and drove through two defenders for a try. The impact, the cheers from teammates\u2014strangers who felt like family\u2014and the feel of turf under his cleats was a visceral jolt. This raw, physical joy was the part of his Samoan heritage his spreadsheets could never quantify, and the part of himself he refused to lose.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOn his morning walk down Howard Street, he passed a construction crew sharing coffee from thermoses. Their Spanish and Samoan laughter echoed off the glass walls of the condos. He saw his father in their tired eyes and calloused hands\u2014the men who build the city he now analyzed from an air-conditioned office. He clutched his leather briefcase, feeling a sudden, sharp disconnect between his world and theirs. That moment cemented a goal: he had to find a way back, to build for them, not just around them.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe was back in Daly City for Sunday aiga. The scent of his mother\u2019s lau lau filled the small kitchen as she spoke of a neighbor\u2019s bakery closing, squeezed out by rent. Looking at the familiar faces around the table, Rohan saw more than family; he saw a community fighting to hold on. The conversation wasn\u2019t about market trends or cap rates, but survival. In that instant, his vague ambition sharpened. He didn\u2019t just want to build skyscrapers; he wanted to build lifelines for businesses like that bakery."
