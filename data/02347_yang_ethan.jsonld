The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in Daly City, he grew up surrounded by the tangible logistics of stocking shelves and managing inventory. His parents preached the virtues of hard work and stability, values Ethan absorbed even as he felt a pull toward a different world.\n\nHe initially indulged his intellectual curiosity, earning a degree in History from UC Berkeley. However, graduating into the uncertainty of the 2008 financial crisis was a sharp reality check. Seeing his peers struggle, he pivoted toward the pragmatism his parents championed. He enrolled in an MBA program with a focus on Supply Chain Management, determined to build a career that was both modern and secure. This decision proved to be his defining turning point.\n\nEthan\u2019s career began in the structured world of a major shipping corporation before he was lured by the chaotic energy of San Francisco\u2019s tech scene. He found his niche bringing order to the complex global supply chains of fast-growing hardware startups. His ability to anticipate bottlenecks and solve complex problems under pressure saw him rise quickly. Now, as a Director of Logistics Operations, he manages a global network of suppliers and distributors entirely from his apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute defines his current lifestyle. Living in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, his day begins not on the freeway but with a run along the Embarcadero or a class at a local gym. His work is a ballet of international time zones, conducted over Slack and Zoom from a minimalist standing desk. The pandemic, a crucible for his profession, solidified his value and his remote status.\n\nSocially, Ethan relies on a tight-knit circle of friends from his MBA program. While professionally fulfilled, he\u2019s increasingly aware of a personal void and hopes to find a serious partner. He loves San Francisco for its dynamic energy and culinary scene, often exploring new restaurants with friends. Looking ahead, Ethan dreams of a life with more balance. He aspires to one day leverage his expertise for a humanitarian organization, applying his skills not just for profit, but to deliver critical aid where it\u2019s needed most\u2014a return, in a way, to the simple, essential work of his parents' store."
