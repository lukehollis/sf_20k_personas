Raised in a quiet suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, by a librarian mother and an engineer father, her childhood was ordered and predictable. This changed when her younger sister was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease. Lila spent her teenage years navigating the labyrinthine world of hospitals, specialists, and insurance claims. It wasn't the medicine that fascinated her, but the massive, flawed system that delivered it. This experience planted the seed for her future.\n\nShe pursued a Master of Public Health degree at Johns Hopkins, driven by an idealistic mission to fix the system from within. A prestigious job offer brought her to San Francisco in her late twenties, an exciting upheaval from her structured past. For two decades, Lila climbed the ladder at a major hospital network, her idealism slowly tempering into sharp-edged pragmatism. She became an expert at balancing budgets, streamlining departments, and navigating hospital politics. A key turning point was her divorce at 45. The marriage had been a casualty of two demanding careers, and its amicable end left her with a reinforced sense of self-reliance and a quiet apartment in Cole Valley.\n\nNow, at 52, Lila\u2019s entire world exists within a few square blocks. Her commute is a 10-foot walk from her kitchen to her standing desk, where she manages complex healthcare logistics remotely. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls, digital dashboards, and policy reviews. Her social life is small but deep: a monthly book club with other professional women and weekly dinners with a friend from her early SF days.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is no longer about the city\u2019s vibrant nightlife but the familiar comfort of her neighborhood\u2014the barista who knows her order, the quiet trails of Sutro Forest, the smell of eucalyptus after the fog rolls in. While professionally successful, Lila dreams of a \"third act.\" The fire of her youthful idealism isn't extinguished, merely banked. She aspires to transition from administration to mentorship or consulting for a non-profit, hoping to apply her hard-won expertise to a cause that feels closer to the reason she started it all."
