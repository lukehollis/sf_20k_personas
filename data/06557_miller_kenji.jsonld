Born in San Jose to a Japanese immigrant mother, a meticulous ikebana artist, and a third-generation Californian father, an engineer, Kenji was raised in a home that valued both quiet discipline and ambitious achievement. He followed the prescribed path perfectly, earning an economics degree from UCLA and then a prestigious MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nBy his late twenties, Kenji was a rising star in San Francisco's booming tech scene, a product manager fueled by stock options and the relentless hum of servers. He had the corner office, the expensive downtown condo, and a wife he barely saw. The Dot-com bust was a tremor, but the true earthquake was internal. The 80-hour workweeks led to a quiet, amicable divorce, leaving him with a pristine apartment that felt cavernously empty. He had achieved everything he was supposed to want and felt nothing but a hollow ache.\n\nThe turning point was a notice for a volunteer-run soup kitchen at a small, unassuming church in the Richmond District. He went on a whim, expecting to feel self-congratulatory, but instead found a powerful sense of purpose in the simple act of serving others. The quiet fellowship and shared humanity he discovered there felt more real than any boardroom deal. This experience sparked a radical shift. He quit his job, sold his condo, and enrolled in the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, trading his MBA for a Master of Divinity.\n\nNow, at 52, Pastor Kenji leads that same church in the Richmond. His commute is a walk down a flight of stairs from his modest apartment above the community hall. His days are not measured in profit margins but in conversations, counseling sessions, and community outreach. He knows the names of the grocers on Clement Street and takes his morning coffee on a bench in Golden Gate Park, watching the fog roll in. His aspiration is no longer to scale a company but to deepen the roots of his community, perhaps by starting a program for at-risk youth. He has found that true wealth is not accumulated, but shared."
