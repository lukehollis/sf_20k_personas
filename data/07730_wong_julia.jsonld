            "value": "Julia Wong is a San Francisco native, born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District. The daughter of Cantonese immigrants who ran a bustling neighborhood bakery, Julia grew up surrounded by the hum of the community. While her parents preached the virtues of financial stability, hoping she\u2019d become a doctor or engineer, it was her grandmother, her Po Po, who shaped her path. Julia spent hours listening to her Po Po\u2019s stories and observing the unspoken anxieties of the elderly customers in the bakery\u2014their stoic resilience masking loneliness and a quiet struggle to navigate a changing world.\n\nThis early exposure to her community\u2019s unmet emotional needs became a silent calling. Resisting familial pressure, Julia pursued a sociology degree at UC Berkeley and then completed her Master of Social Work at San Francisco State. The turning point came during her grandmother's final illness, when Julia witnessed firsthand the healthcare system\u2019s failure to provide culturally competent mental health support for her grieving family. This solidified her mission: she would bridge that gap.\n\nNow 28, Julia is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital network. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of modern healthcare; she conducts most of her therapy sessions via telehealth from her sunny apartment in Hayes Valley. Her days are a structured blend of intense virtual sessions with patients grappling with new diagnoses and chronic illness, followed by meticulous note-taking. To decompress, she unplugs completely, either bouldering at Dogpatch Boulders or meeting her small, close-knit group of friends\u2014fellow therapists\u2014for dinner in the Mission.\n\nJulia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and layered. She feels nostalgia for the Richmond of her youth but embraces the vibrant energy of her new neighborhood. She carries the weight of her clients' struggles but is fueled by the hope of making a tangible difference. Her ultimate dream is to establish a non-profit practice dedicated to providing accessible mental healthcare for the Bay Area's AAPI community, a tribute to the quiet needs she first noticed over the counter of her parents\u2019 bakery."
