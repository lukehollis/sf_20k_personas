            "value": "Jessica Vance was a premature adult. Growing up in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, she was the family's designated mediator, the calm center in the low-grade storm of her parents\u2019 emotionally distant marriage. While her friends were navigating high school crushes, Jessica was navigating moods, managing expectations, and providing the emotional support for her younger brother that her parents could not. This early, unasked-for responsibility planted the seed for her future. She pursued a psychology degree at Ohio State, but it was during an internship at a community health clinic that she found her calling. She saw how systemic issues\u2014poverty, trauma, lack of access\u2014were the invisible architects of so much personal suffering. This clarity led her to the University of Michigan for her Master of Social Work.\n\nDrawn by its reputation for progressive healthcare and the promise of a life entirely her own, Jessica moved to San Francisco a decade ago for a coveted role at a major city hospital. The work was grueling but validating. She advocated for patients facing catastrophic diagnoses, guided families through grief, and wrestled with the immense bureaucracy of the healthcare system. The relentless exposure to secondary trauma, however, took its toll. The turning point came during the pandemic, when the lines between her work and life dissolved completely. Burned out and emotionally depleted, she resigned.\n\nToday, Jessica\u2019s life is a testament to deliberate reconstruction. Her 0.0-mile commute is to the sunny corner of her Noe Valley apartment, where she runs a private telehealth practice. She specializes in supporting fellow healthcare professionals, using her own experience to offer a uniquely empathetic perspective. Her mornings begin with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, Ritual coffee in hand, followed by a day of virtual sessions.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is now less about its frantic energy and more about its pockets of tranquility\u2014hikes in the Presidio with a small circle of friends, quiet evenings reading, and exploring the farmer's market. After years of mending others, her focus has turned inward. While she\u2019s cautiously open to a new relationship, her primary aspiration is to write a book: a practical guide for caregivers on building resilience. For Jessica, helping others first required learning how to save herself."
