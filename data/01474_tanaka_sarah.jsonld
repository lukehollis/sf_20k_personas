Growing up in California\u2019s Central Valley, the daughter of a second-generation Japanese-American father and a Caucasian mother from the Midwest, she always felt slightly out of sync. Her world was one of sprawling suburbs and endless drives, a landscape that felt isolating. She spent her youth observing the patterns of traffic from her bedroom window, sketching imaginary bus routes on napkins, instinctively trying to connect the disconnected pieces of her town.\n\nThis nascent passion found its direction during a college trip to Kyoto. Walking through a city designed for people, where ancient temples coexisted with a stunningly efficient public transit network, was a revelation. It solidified her calling. She pursued a Master\u2019s in Urban Planning, her mind consumed with accessibility, sustainability, and equity. Her career became a quiet crusade to give others the freedom of movement she hadn\u2019t had as a child.\n\nAfter years working in other cities, Sarah landed her dream job as a Senior Transportation Planner in San Francisco. The move was a homecoming to a place she\u2019d only known in theory. Now, at 37, the city is her canvas. Living in a compact Hayes Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute allows her to live the principles she advocates. Her mornings start with a walk to a local coffee shop, followed by hours at her desk modeling pedestrian flow or analyzing Muni performance data.\n\nRecently emerging from a long-term relationship, Sarah finds solace in her work and the city itself. Evenings are for exploration; she\u2019ll ride the N-Judah to Ocean Beach just to feel the system work, or walk across her neighborhood to a friend\u2019s potluck. Her greatest aspiration is to see a key project\u2014like a fully pedestrianized Valencia Street or a major light rail expansion\u2014come to fruition. For Sarah, shaping San Francisco\u2019s transportation isn't just a job; it's about building a more connected, logical world, creating a sense of belonging in the city she now calls home."
