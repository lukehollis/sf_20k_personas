The only son of first-generation Korean immigrants, he was raised behind the counter of his parents\u2019 small grocery store. He spent his childhood stocking shelves and observing the quiet dignity of their endless work. They instilled in him a profound sense of duty and a belief that success was a fortress built of education and stability.\n\nInitially, Liam pursued a practical engineering degree at San Jose State, the path of least resistance. However, a data science elective unexpectedly captivated him. He found a strange beauty in the patterns, the stories that numbers could tell when properly interrogated. This discovery became his turning point. He pivoted, convincing his practical-minded parents that this new field was the future. He excelled, earning a spot at UC Berkeley for a Master\u2019s in Information and Data Science, a degree that felt like a passport to a new world.\n\nNow 31, Liam is a Senior Data Analyst for a major tech firm, his role fully remote. His world has shrunk to the 700 square feet of his Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a ten-step walk from his espresso machine to his standing desk. His days are a disciplined routine: a morning run through the Panhandle, hours spent wrangling datasets under the glow of dual monitors, and a brief lunchtime walk to Patricia\u2019s Green to feel the sun. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal, defined by his favorite third-wave coffee shop, the ramen bar he frequents, and the small circle of friends from his grad program he meets for drinks.\n\nDespite his professional success, a quiet restlessness gnaws at him. He optimizes user engagement for a living but struggles to engineer meaningful connections in his own life, navigating the frustrating algorithms of dating apps. He dreams of leveraging his skills for social good, perhaps for a climate-tech nonprofit or urban planning initiative\u2014a way to find the community purpose he remembers from his parents\u2019 store. Liam has built the stable life they dreamed of for him, but now he aspires to fill its carefully constructed framework with a story that is truly his own."

His father, without a word, walked to the stockroom and returned with a jar he\u2019d set aside just for her. The quiet gratitude in her eyes wasn't about commerce; it was community. He didn\u2019t have the words for it then, but he filed the feeling away: a purpose that felt warmer and more real than the numbers on the cash register.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 a.m. in the fluorescent hum of the San Jose State library, staring at a raw dataset of city traffic patterns for an elective. Suddenly, the chaotic numbers clicked into place. He saw the flow, the pulse of a city, a hidden story of human behavior. It wasn't just math; it felt like a form of digital empathy. In that moment of searing clarity, the secure path of engineering dissolved. He felt a thrill of discovery, a sense that he had found not just a career, but his own language.\n\n3.\nThe acceptance email from UC Berkeley arrived with a quiet glow on his laptop screen. He walked into the living room and showed his parents. His mother\u2019s eyes instantly welled up, and his father gave a single, firm nod\u2014the highest form of praise he knew. It felt less like a personal victory and more like a family accomplishment, the repayment of a generational debt. That acceptance was his passport, not just to a new career, but to the fortress of stability they had always dreamed of for him.\n\n4.\nThe Slack channel exploded with celebratory emojis. His algorithm had boosted user engagement by 15%. His manager called him a \u201cwizard.\u201d He closed his laptop, and the silence of his apartment rushed in, broken only by the hum of the refrigerator. The digital praise felt a million miles away. He looked out his Hayes Valley window at the city lights, feeling profoundly disconnected from the world he was supposedly optimizing. The success felt entirely hollow, leaving an ache for tangible, human connection.\n\n5.\nOn a lunchtime walk, he paused at Patricia\u2019s Green and watched a volunteer struggle with a clipboard, trying to survey residents about a proposed community garden. Liam instantly saw the inefficiency, the missed data points, the patterns he could easily find. He could build a simple app to show them exactly where community interest was greatest. A jolt of purpose, sharp and unfamiliar, shot through him. It was a desire to turn his abstract skills into something that could grow in the actual dirt, right here on the ground."
