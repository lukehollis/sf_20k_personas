Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, she immigrated to Daly City with her engineer parents at age six. While they instilled in her a pragmatic, hardworking ethos, Anastasia was captivated by the art and history of their homeland. This passion led her to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Art History, a choice that bewildered her practical family. She dreamed of curating museum collections, of tracing the provenance of beautiful, forgotten objects.\n\nThe reality of the post-college job market hit hard. Needing to pay bills, she took a temporary stocking position at the warehouse of a high-end home goods retailer. There, amidst pallets and packing slips, a different kind of system revealed itself. Anastasia discovered an innate talent for seeing patterns, optimizing workflows, and untangling logistical knots. Her supervisors noticed her efficiency, and a temporary job evolved into a career. She climbed the ranks, trading her dream of cataloging art for the surprisingly satisfying challenge of managing a complex supply chain.\n\nNow 33, Anastasia is a Logistics Manager for that same company, a role she performs entirely from her quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute defines her San Francisco existence. Her days are structured by routine: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, followed by hours spent orchestrating the movement of goods across the country via spreadsheets and video calls. The pandemic normalized her remote work, but it also solidified a sense of contained solitude. Her social life is a small, curated collection of close friends, a mix from college and former work colleagues she sees for dinners or weekend hikes in the Presidio.\n\nLiving just blocks from Golden Gate Park, she feels a deep connection to her neighborhood's calm and its proximity to nature. It\u2019s a peaceful bubble against the city's chaotic energy. While Anastasia finds deep satisfaction in her stable career, a quiet dream persists. She hopes to one day save enough to open a small, curated shop of her own\u2014perhaps for vintage furniture or Eastern European antiques. It would be the perfect synthesis of her life: a business built on flawless logistics, selling the beautiful, storied objects she\u2019s always loved."
