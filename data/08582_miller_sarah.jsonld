Raised in the predictable quiet of a Columbus, Ohio suburb, she was the practical daughter in a practical family. Her parents, a teacher and an accountant, were baffled when a post-graduation trip to San Francisco in the mid-90s became a permanent move. Armed with a Bachelor\u2019s in Communications, Sarah intended to find a corporate job, but the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic arts scene captured her completely.\n\nShe began by volunteering at a small theater in the Mission, then became a gallery assistant, and eventually found her true calling not in creating art, but in actualizing it. She discovered she had a rare talent for managing the volatile cocktail of budgets, logistics, and artistic temperaments. Over three decades, she has become an indispensable Production Manager, the calm center of the storm for large-scale art installations, theater festivals, and museum exhibits. She is the person who ensures the twenty-foot metal sculpture arrives on time and the prima donna lighting designer gets their preferred brand of sparkling water.\n\nThe 0.0-mile commute is literal. Sarah lives in a sprawling live/work loft in a converted Dogpatch warehouse, its industrial windows overlooking the bay. This space, purchased during a brief market dip in the early 2000s, is her sanctuary and command center. A long-term partnership ended amicably years ago, and her social life is now a curated collection of artists, stagehands, and curators who have become her chosen family.\n\nA creature of habit, her days start with strong coffee while reviewing production schedules. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or sharing a bottle of wine with a neighbor. Sarah has watched San Francisco transform, mourning the loss of gritty artist haunts while navigating the new landscape of tech wealth. At 53, her ambition has shifted from climbing to cultivating. She dreams of starting a small consultancy to mentor young, disorganized artists, shepherding their visions into reality and ensuring the city\u2019s creative pulse, the very thing that drew her here, continues to beat."
