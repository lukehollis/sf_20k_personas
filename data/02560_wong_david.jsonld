Born in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he was the quiet, observant son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong. His father ran a small neighborhood grocery, and his mother worked as a clerk, their lives a testament to relentless work and a deep-seated hope for their son\u2019s future. David grew up a bridge between two worlds, speaking fluent Cantonese at home while navigating the American school system, translating not just words but cultural nuances for his parents.\n\nHis path wasn't always clear. He pursued an undergraduate degree in economics at UC Davis, a practical choice meant to secure a stable future. The turning point came during his senior year when his grandmother was diagnosed with late-stage diabetes. David witnessed firsthand her struggle to navigate a complex healthcare system, hampered by language barriers and a lack of culturally competent care. It was a slow-motion crisis that ignited a fire in him. He saw a systemic failure, a gap where compassion and communication should have been. This experience drove him to pivot, enrolling in a rigorous Master of Public Health program at UC Berkeley, determined to become an architect of the solutions his family so desperately needed.\n\nNow 38, David is the Director of Public Health Programs for a major Bay Area healthcare provider. His 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in his sleek Hayes Valley condo, a world away from his humble Sunset upbringing. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, data analysis, and strategic planning, all aimed at designing outreach programs for underserved communities. He\u2019s known for his calm demeanor and a fierce, data-driven approach to health equity.\n\nHis life is disciplined. Mornings start with a run to the Ferry Building and back, the Bay Bridge a steadfast companion. Evenings are often spent with a small circle of friends\u2014fellow policy wonks and healthcare professionals\u2014debating city politics over craft beer, or enjoying a quiet night in. He feels a profound connection to San Francisco, viewing its vibrant, disparate neighborhoods as a living ecosystem he is sworn to protect. His ultimate ambition is to launch a landmark preventative care initiative for the city\u2019s immigrant elders, a project that is both his professional legacy and a quiet promise kept to his grandmother."
