Born in Busan, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by a kind, middle-class couple from Marin County. His upbringing was loving but filled with a subtle cultural dissonance; he was Arthur, a boy who loved baseball and sci-fi novels, but his face in the mirror told a different story.\n\nHis search for identity led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History. He was fascinated by the stories objects could tell, the silent histories embedded in canvas and stone. He imagined a life as a museum curator, surrounded by ordered beauty. However, the dot-com bust of the early 2000s reshaped his path. Facing a difficult job market, he took a temporary position in a retail warehouse. To his surprise, he discovered his meticulous, academic mind excelled at the complex puzzle of logistics. He turned his temporary gig into a stable career, a practical pivot that has defined his professional life.\n\nToday, Arthur lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he\u2019s called home for over two decades. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his current role as a remote logistics coordinator for a large retail chain. His days are structured and solitary: coffee from a local cafe, hours spent untangling supply chain knots on his dual monitors, and evening walks through Golden Gate Park. His apartment is his sanctuary, filled with art books\u2014the ghost of a path not taken\u2014and meticulously organized vinyl records.\n\nHis social circle is small but deep, consisting of his adoptive sister who lives in the East Bay and a few old friends from his university days. Though content, a quiet dream persists. Arthur hopes to one day travel to South Korea, not to find his birth family, but to simply walk the streets of Busan. He wants to visit its museums and galleries, to see the art of his homeland, and to finally connect the face in the mirror with the history of a place he\u2019s never known."
