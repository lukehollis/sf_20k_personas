The son of an Iranian engineer and a Black American jazz vocalist who met at UC Berkeley in the 1980s, Kian grew up in a Richmond district home filled with the scent of saffron rice, the sounds of John Coltrane, and the weight of Rumi\u2019s poetry. His upbringing was a constant, gentle negotiation between logic and artistry, structure and improvisation, which would come to define his professional life.\n\nHe pursued a BFA in sculpture, but graduated into the post-2008 recession where artistic opportunities were scarce. Feeling adrift, he noticed how the world was migrating online and saw a new canvas. He enrolled in an MFA program for Interaction Design, mastering the language of user-centric systems. His early career was a successful but unfulfilling climb through corporate tech, designing sterile interfaces for software companies.\n\nThe turning point came at 35 with the sudden passing of his mother. It was a profound shock that forced him to re-evaluate his path. He realized he was building seamless, but soulless, digital products. He quit his lucrative job and took a significant pay cut to join a boutique firm specializing in experience design for tangible spaces. Now, as a Director, he orchestrates the human journey through museum exhibits, immersive dining experiences, and public art installations, finally merging his parents\u2019 worlds of structured design and soulful art.\n\nKian lives with his partner of eight years, Marcus, a landscape architect, in a tastefully curated apartment in Hayes Valley. His 3.8-mile commute on the MUNI Metro is a cherished ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s complex characters. Evenings often involve cooking elaborate Persian meals, a skill inherited from his father, or exploring the city\u2019s smaller galleries. His connection to San Francisco is deep; he sees it not as a tech hub, but as a flawed, beautiful, and endlessly interesting design problem. His ultimate dream is to lead a project that integrates interactive technology into a major public park, creating a free, accessible space for play and connection\u2014an homage to the city that shaped him."

Tiny screws were arranged on a cloth like a surgeon\u2019s tools. As he worked, his mother hummed a complex Coltrane solo, improvising around the silence. When the warm, vinyl sound finally filled the room, the scent of saffron from the kitchen mixing with it, Kian understood. He saw how precise engineering could serve as the vessel for unpredictable, soulful beauty. It was the blueprint for his entire life, formed in that single moment of harmony.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt 23, his oversized metal sculptures sat unsold in a dusty SOMA studio, relics of a BFA that felt useless in the 2009 recession. Through the window, he watched pedestrians pass, faces bathed in the blue glow of their phones. A profound sense of obsolescence washed over him. The world\u2019s canvas wasn\u2019t steel; it was a screen. It was a pragmatic, heartbreaking pivot. He closed the laptop on his art portfolio and began researching interaction design. It felt less like a new beginning and more like a tactical retreat from his passion.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe was 35, a week after the funeral, standing in his mother's closet. He was successful, designing sterile interfaces that made corporations richer. He pulled out her favorite silk scarf, a vibrant blue that smelled of jasmine and her. He buried his face in it, and the contrast between that tangible, soulful scent and the soulless pixels he arranged all day became a physical pain. The grief was a clarifying, brutal force. He couldn't build another empty digital box. He had to build something that felt like this scarf: full of life.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHis first major project at the new firm was an interactive light installation at a museum. Anxiously, he watched from the shadows as a young girl, no older than seven, discovered it. She wasn\u2019t following any prescribed path; she was just laughing, stomping, and spinning, creating chaotic, beautiful ripples of light with pure, unscripted joy. There was no user-flow for that giggle, no metric for her delight. In that moment, he felt the definitive click of purpose. He was finally designing not for efficiency, but for enchantment.\n\n***\n\n5.\nThe MUNI Metro lurches through the Duboce portal, and the warm afternoon light floods the car. Kian watches the city\u2019s flawed, beautiful characters and thinks of Marcus, probably already on their Hayes Valley balcony. He mentally reviews the steps for the khoresh he\u2019ll cook tonight, a rhythm inherited from his father. This daily 3.8-mile journey through the city\u2019s imperfect design feels like home. It\u2019s not a seamless system; it's a textured, human experience. It's the quiet, grounding proof that he has finally designed a life he truly wants to live in."
