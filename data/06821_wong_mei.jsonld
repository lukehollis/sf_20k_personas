            "value": "Mei Lin Wong is a product of San Francisco's fog and ambition. Born and raised in the Richmond District, she is the only child of immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. Her parents preached the gospel of pragmatism and stability, envisioning a future for her as an engineer or doctor. Mei dutifully followed this path, attending Lowell High School and enrolling in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. However, she found the corporate-focused curriculum spiritually draining. A pivotal volunteer experience teaching coding basics to kids in West Oakland ignited a different passion: using technology not for profit, but for equity.\n\nThis realization was her turning point. Against her parents\u2019 gentle protests, she pivoted, completing her undergraduate degree in Sociology and then earning a Master's in Education, specializing in Learning, Design, and Technology from Stanford. Her early career as a public-school teacher was rewarding but frustrating; she saw firsthand how the digital divide was leaving students behind, a chasm the slow-moving bureaucracy couldn't bridge.\n\nDriven to create more immediate change, Mei transitioned to the non-profit sector. She found her home at a burgeoning organization dedicated to providing free, high-quality tech education to underserved youth. Her unique blend of pedagogical knowledge and technical fluency saw her rise quickly. Now, as Director of Curriculum & Instruction, she works from her sunny Hayes Valley apartment, crafting programs that impact thousands of students across the Bay Area.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute defines her lifestyle. Mornings start with a walk to a local cafe for an oat latte, followed by a day of Zoom meetings and deep, focused work. She is fiercely independent, her social life revolving around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow educators, artists, and tech dissenters. Though she\u2019s a native, she still marvels at the city's resilience. Her deepest aspiration is to scale her non-profit's model nationally, proving that technology can be a great equalizer. For Mei, her work isn't just a career; it's an ode to the city that raised her and a commitment to shaping a more just version of its future."
