Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to a history professor and a university librarian, his childhood was steeped in the scent of old books and the disciplined pursuit of knowledge. He was a methodical child, more interested in building intricate Lego systems than playing sports, a trait that would define his professional life.\n\nHe pursued a Master's in Library and Information Science in the mid-90s, intending to follow his mother into academia. However, graduation coincided with the explosion of the public internet. During a temp job digitizing a university archive, David had an epiphany: the web was the world's newest, messiest, and most vital library. He saw that the principles of cataloging, usability, and information architecture he was studying were desperately needed by the emerging digital storefronts.\n\nIn 1998, drawn by the siren song of the dot-com boom, David moved to San Francisco. He took a job as an \"Information Architect\" for an early e-commerce startup, baffling his family. While many of his peers chased stock options, David was fascinated by a different problem: how to guide a user from curiosity to purchase with the least amount of friction. He survived the dot-com bust because his skills were fundamental, not speculative. Over two decades, he steadily rose through the ranks at various tech companies, his title evolving with the industry from UX Lead to his current role as a Director of E-commerce Strategy.\n\nNow 52, David\u2019s life is anchored in the quiet, foggy streets of Noe Valley. He bought his modest Victorian there in the early 2000s, a home he once shared with his ex-wife. Their divorce was amicable, a mutual acknowledgment that they had grown into different people. He remains close with their daughter, a sophomore at NYU. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen coffee maker to a sunlit home office overlooking a small, meticulously-kept garden. His days are a rhythm of Zoom calls, data analysis, and lunchtime walks to the local bakery.\n\nDavid isn't chasing a C-suite title. His ambition has mellowed into a desire for mentorship and purpose. He hopes to one day teach a university extension course on digital user behavior, bringing his story full circle. For now, he finds contentment in perfecting the online systems for millions of unseen customers and looking forward to his daughter\u2019s calls from New York."

On the screen was a GeoCities page, a chaotic mess of blinking text and broken images. He suddenly saw it not as a novelty, but as a library after a bomb had gone off\u2014desperate for a system, for order. The realization was a physical jolt, a silent, world-shifting click. In that moment, his future pivoted away from musty stacks and towards the glow of the nascent web. It was the beginning of everything.\n\n2.\nThe dot-com bust felt like a sudden, heavy silence. He recalls walking through the cavernous office in 2001, past empty desks where just weeks before people had shouted into phones about their stock options. His department, Information Architecture, was spared. There was no elation, only a profound, sobering sense of vindication. Hype had evaporated, but structure\u2014the quiet work of making things usable\u2014remained. The experience fused a deep pragmatism into his professional DNA, a lesson he would carry for the next twenty years.\n\n3.\nIt was 2003. He and his then-wife stood in the empty living room of their Noe Valley Victorian. Sunlight, filtered through the morning fog, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air. He ran his hand over the cool, carved wood of the banister. It felt solid, permanent. More than just a house, it was an anchor, a physical manifestation of the life he was carefully building far from Michigan. It was the first place that truly felt like his own corner of the world, and a quiet sense of belonging settled deep in his bones.\n\n4.\nHis daughter, then about ten, threw her hands up in frustration at the family computer. \"This website is stupid, Dad!\" He sat down beside her and looked at the convoluted checkout page for a toy she wanted. Instead of fixing it for her, he took a napkin and sketched a simpler path\u2014three clear steps. A light went on in her eyes, and in his. In that small moment of shared understanding, his abstract job became real. He wasn't just organizing data; he was helping a little girl get her toy.\n\n5.\nThe night after his wife moved out, the house was unnervingly quiet. The silence felt vast, a blank page. He stood in his study for a long time, then methodically began to move furniture. He turned his desk to face the window, overlooking the small garden he was just starting to cultivate. There wasn't despair, but a somber sense of reorganization, like re-cataloging a section of his own life. It was an act of personal architecture, designing a new system for a life that was now his alone."
