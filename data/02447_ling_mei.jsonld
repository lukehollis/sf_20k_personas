The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood smelled of her parents' small grocery store\u2014a mix of dried herbs, cardboard, and the damp chill of the city. While her parents preached the virtues of financial security, Mei was drawn to the silent struggles she witnessed, particularly the unspoken sadness that clung to her grandmother, a woman who had left everything behind and never quite found her footing in a new world. The family dismissed it as nostalgia, but Mei saw it as a profound, untreated wound.\n\nThis quiet observation became her calling. Resisting parental pressure to pursue a more lucrative career, she earned a degree in psychology from UC Berkeley, followed by a Master of Social Work. Mei threw herself into the front lines of public health, working for a city-run clinic in the Tenderloin. For a decade, she poured her energy into serving the city\u2019s most vulnerable, confronting trauma, addiction, and systemic failure daily. The work was vital but corrosive, and she felt the creeping symptoms of burnout that she so often diagnosed in others.\n\nThe turning point came at age 35. To preserve her own well-being, Mei made a significant shift. She became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and opened a private practice from a converted office space in her quiet Inner Sunset apartment. This explains her 0.0-mile commute; her workday begins by walking down the hall. Her life is now a curated rhythm of morning tea, intense virtual and in-person client sessions, and afternoon walks through the botanical gardens in nearby Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nAt 38, Mei maintains a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends, mostly fellow therapists who understand the careful boundaries her work requires. She feels deeply connected to San Francisco, not as a hub of tech and innovation, but as a complex mosaic of human stories. Her dream is to one day launch a culturally-competent mental health program for elderly Asian immigrants\u2014a tribute to the grandmother whose silent suffering first set her on this path, hoping to offer the healing her own family never knew how to seek."
