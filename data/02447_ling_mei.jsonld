The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood smelled of her parents' small grocery store\u2014a mix of dried herbs, cardboard, and the damp chill of the city. While her parents preached the virtues of financial security, Mei was drawn to the silent struggles she witnessed, particularly the unspoken sadness that clung to her grandmother, a woman who had left everything behind and never quite found her footing in a new world. The family dismissed it as nostalgia, but Mei saw it as a profound, untreated wound.\n\nThis quiet observation became her calling. Resisting parental pressure to pursue a more lucrative career, she earned a degree in psychology from UC Berkeley, followed by a Master of Social Work. Mei threw herself into the front lines of public health, working for a city-run clinic in the Tenderloin. For a decade, she poured her energy into serving the city\u2019s most vulnerable, confronting trauma, addiction, and systemic failure daily. The work was vital but corrosive, and she felt the creeping symptoms of burnout that she so often diagnosed in others.\n\nThe turning point came at age 35. To preserve her own well-being, Mei made a significant shift. She became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and opened a private practice from a converted office space in her quiet Inner Sunset apartment. This explains her 0.0-mile commute; her workday begins by walking down the hall. Her life is now a curated rhythm of morning tea, intense virtual and in-person client sessions, and afternoon walks through the botanical gardens in nearby Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nAt 38, Mei maintains a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends, mostly fellow therapists who understand the careful boundaries her work requires. She feels deeply connected to San Francisco, not as a hub of tech and innovation, but as a complex mosaic of human stories. Her dream is to one day launch a culturally-competent mental health program for elderly Asian immigrants\u2014a tribute to the grandmother whose silent suffering first set her on this path, hoping to offer the healing her own family never knew how to seek."

Her grandmother stood by the front window, tracing patterns in the condensation, her gaze lost in the Richmond fog. It wasn\u2019t sadness Mei saw, not exactly. It was an absence, a hollowing out. In that moment, the familiar scent of cardboard and herbs felt like the smell of profound loneliness. This silent, unacknowledged ache became the question she would spend her life trying to answer, planting the first seed of her future calling.\n\n2.\nAt 28, in the Tenderloin clinic, she worked for months to help a young man escape homelessness. They finally secured him a room in an SRO. Two weeks later, he was gone\u2014an overdose. Mei found his thin file on her desk, a paper-thin testament to a life lost. It wasn't just grief she felt, but a cold, clarifying rage at a system that offered so little. That day, she understood that empathy without systemic change was like trying to fill the ocean with a teaspoon.\n\n3.\nThe breaking point came at 35. She was sitting on her own shower floor, the hot water long gone, too exhausted to stand. She had spent the day managing three acute crises at the clinic, but in the silence of her apartment, she felt a terrifying numbness. It was the first time she truly recognized the echo of her clients' burnout in herself. To continue on that path would be to become another casualty. The decision to leave wasn't a choice; it was an act of survival.\n\n4.\nHer first day of private practice. The scent of jasmine tea, not antiseptic, filled her Inner Sunset office. Her first client appeared on screen, a face seeking help not from a chaotic waiting room, but from this quiet, curated space. As the session began, Mei felt a calm settle over her\u2014a feeling she hadn't realized was gone. She was no longer fighting a war on the front lines, but carefully tending to one garden at a time. It was the beginning of sustainable healing, for them and for her.\n\n5.\nLast spring, walking through the Golden Gate Park Botanical Garden, she saw an elderly Chinese woman sitting alone, her posture holding the same familiar weight Mei remembered in her grandmother. In that peaceful setting, Mei's dream crystallized not as an abstract ambition, but as a concrete promise. To create a space where that quiet weight could be spoken, heard, and perhaps, for the first time, lifted. The path from the grocery store to this garden suddenly felt whole and clear."
