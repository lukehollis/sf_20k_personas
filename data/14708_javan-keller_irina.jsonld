The only child of Indonesian immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, she grew up in a small apartment filled with the scent of cloves and the hum of her mother's sewing machine. Her father worked two jobs, first as a dishwasher and later a line cook, instilling in Irina a profound respect for resilience. Watching her parents and their friends navigate a new country with quiet dignity, often struggling with systems they didn't understand, seeded her desire to become a bridge for others.\n\nThis calling led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned both her bachelor's and a Master of Social Work. She chose community-based work, rejecting more lucrative corporate paths. Her early career was a trial by fire, working in community health clinics in the Mission, providing support to families facing housing instability and addiction. It was here she honed her skills, learning that true change required not just compassion, but a deep understanding of systemic barriers.\n\nA key turning point was meeting her husband, Mark Keller, an urban planner, at a neighborhood improvement meeting. They connected over a shared, practical idealism for the city. Their marriage is a balanced partnership, reflected in her hyphenated name\u2014a joining of her heritage and their shared future. They made a conscious decision not to have children, choosing instead to pour their nurturing energies into their careers and community.\n\nNow a senior LCSW, Irina works directly with high school students in the city's public school system. Her 4.5-mile commute on the MUNI L Taraval line is a daily immersion in the city she serves. She lives in a modest but comfortable West Portal home, a quiet sanctuary from the emotional demands of her job. Her days are intense, but her evenings with Mark are her anchor. Her great ambition is not wealth, but legacy. She dreams of launching a small non-profit to provide mentorship for first-generation students entering the social services field. For Irina, San Francisco isn't a playground for the rich; it's a community that needs tending, and she is one of its most dedicated gardeners."

He was a man of immense capability, yet he was stumped by the bureaucratic language. His quiet frustration felt like a physical weight in their small Excelsior apartment. It wasn't shame she felt, but a hot, protective anger. At that moment, she vowed she would master these systems that baffled the people she loved most. It was the birth of her calling to be a bridge, a translator of worlds.\n\n2.\nEarly in her career, a family she\u2019d worked with for months was evicted from their Mission apartment. Irina had done everything by the book, but the system's gears ground them up anyway. Standing on the curb with the mother, surrounded by black trash bags filled with their life, her compassion curdled into cold resolve. She realized empathy wasn\u2019t enough. To truly help, she had to understand the machinery of injustice itself. That day, she started studying housing policy with a vengeance.\n\n3.\nAt a drab community meeting about a new bike lane, she met Mark. He, an urban planner, argued for utility, while she argued for accessibility. The debate was pointed but respectful. Afterward, over stale coffee, they discovered their shared belief: a city wasn't just concrete and zoning, but a living ecosystem of people needing care. She saw in his eyes not just a potential partner, but an ally in her mission to tend the city. Their life together began on that common ground.\n\n4.\nLast winter, the L Taraval screeched to a halt between stops. Rain lashed the windows. Inside, the car was a cross-section of her city: a student studying, a cook heading home smelling of garlic, a tired mother hushing a baby. The shared, silent moment of waiting wasn't an inconvenience; it was community. A profound sense of belonging washed over her. These were her people, this was her train, and this daily journey through the fog was a pilgrimage to her purpose.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, a student named David, whose parents worked cleaning offices, burst into her room. He clutched an acceptance letter to SF State's social work program. He told Irina he wanted to be like her, a \"bridge\" for his community. Seeing the echo of her own nine-year-old vow in his eyes, she felt a powerful sense of legacy clicking into place. This was more fulfilling than any promotion. It was the moment her dream of a mentorship non-profit became an undeniable future."
