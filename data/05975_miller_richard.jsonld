            "value": "Richard Miller is a man who knows the rhythms of a building better than his own heartbeat. Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he was the dutiful son of Chinese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery. The unspoken plan was simple: Richard would be the first to get a college degree. He enrolled at San Francisco State, dabbling in business courses, but his path was rerouted when his father suffered a heart attack. At 20, Richard dropped out to run the family store, swapping textbooks for inventory ledgers. It was a sacrifice he never questioned.\n\nAfter his parents sold the store and retired, Richard, armed with a profound sense of responsibility and a knack for fixing things, found work in property maintenance. He was reliable and observant, learning the language of plumbing, wiring, and tenant relations. He steadily climbed the ladder from handyman to his current role as a live-in Facilities Manager for a pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. This explains his zero-mile commute; his life is contained within the building\u2019s ornate, aging walls.\n\nHis devotion to his work contributed to a quiet divorce years ago; he was always on call, married more to the building than to anyone else. His proudest achievement is his daughter, now in her third year at UC Davis, pursuing the degree he never finished. His personal relationships are now mostly transactional\u2014polite nods to tenants, professional calls with contractors, and a weekly video chat with his daughter.\n\nRichard\u2019s daily routine is a loop of walking the property, troubleshooting a finicky boiler, or coordinating a painter for a vacant unit. He is the quiet, invisible force that keeps the lives of dozens of residents running smoothly. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s a small condo of his own, somewhere quiet like the Richmond District, where the fog feels like home and no one can call him about a leak at 3 AM. He hopes to one day retire, sit by a window, and simply watch the city he has spent his entire life maintaining."
