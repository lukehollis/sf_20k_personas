The son of a stoic sheet metal worker and a reserved library assistant, his childhood home was loving but emotionally muted. Julian learned to read the unspoken needs in the space between words, a skill that would define his life\u2019s work. He attended Portland State University, finding his calling not in lecture halls but in volunteering at a youth shelter, where he saw firsthand how easily people could fall through society\u2019s cracks. He graduated with a Bachelor's in Social Work and a fierce determination to be a part of the solution.\n\nIn his late twenties, he followed a partner to San Francisco, a move that outlasted the relationship. His early years as a caseworker in the Tenderloin were a baptism by fire, exposing him to the rawest struggles of the city. The work was grueling and heartbreaking, and after a decade on the front lines, the weight of secondary trauma led him to a turning point. Instead of burning out completely, he pivoted, seeking a role where he could shape the system rather than just patch its damages.\n\nToday, Julian is the Program Manager for Community Health Services, overseeing outreach programs for at-risk youth. His small, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission is his sanctuary, filled with books and the quiet hum of the city. His 2.5-mile bike commute is a daily ritual, a clearing of the head through the morning fog and the vibrant energy of his neighborhood. At 48, his life is one of settled purpose. His social circle is a tight-knit group of friends, many met through activist circles two decades ago.\n\nJulian\u2019s income doesn\u2019t afford luxury, but it provides stability. His dreams are not of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014for the programs he manages and the city he loves. His current focus is securing a grant to expand a mentorship program connecting LGBTQ+ youth with supportive adults. He is a man who found his family not in blood, but in community, and his purpose in the steadfast work of lifting others up."

Julian saw the exhaustion in his dad\u2019s hands, the way he\u2019d stare past the walls. Without being asked, Julian would bring him a glass of water. In that quiet gesture, he felt a flicker of connection, a sense of easing a burden no one spoke of. It was his first unconscious practice of empathy, learning that the most profound needs are often the quietest.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, volunteering at the Portland youth shelter. A girl who\u2019d been on the streets for a month sat clutching a tattered comic book, refusing to speak to anyone. He didn\u2019t push. He just sat nearby and started talking about his own favorite comics. An hour later, she quietly asked if he\u2019d ever read *Sandman*. In that moment, he felt the click of a key in a lock. It wasn't about having answers; it was about finding the right door. This confirmed his calling.\n\n3.\nHe was 32, a new caseworker in the Tenderloin. He spent an entire rainy Tuesday trying to find a bed for a young trans woman who had just been kicked out of her housing. Every shelter was full. He remembers standing with her under a leaking awning, the city's indifference feeling like a physical force. The look of utter despair on her face as he admitted defeat for the night solidified his resolve. He couldn\u2019t just be an usher to broken systems; he had to help rebuild them.\n\n4.\nIt was the day after his 38th birthday. Sitting in his car after a devastating client meeting, he found he couldn't bring himself to turn the key. The cumulative weight of a decade of secondary trauma felt like a lead blanket. He wasn't sad or angry, just hollow. He realized his compassion, his greatest tool, was eroding him. It wasn't a moment of quitting, but of tactical retreat. He knew then he had to work on the architecture of care, not just the emergency repairs.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a foggy Tuesday morning, biking to work through the Mission. The vibrant murals, the smell of pan dulce, the familiar faces nodding hello\u2014it all coalesced into a feeling of profound belonging. He wasn\u2019t a transplant anymore. He was part of this complex, struggling, beautiful ecosystem. This daily ritual wasn\u2019t just a commute; it was a recommitment to the city and the community he had chosen as his own, a quiet affirmation of his settled purpose."
