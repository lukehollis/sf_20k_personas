Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a kind-hearted elementary school teacher mother, his childhood was comfortable but creatively sterile. His innate fascination with color, form, and story felt like a foreign language in a household that valued spreadsheets and lesson plans. His choice to pursue a Bachelor's in Art History was an act of quiet rebellion, a declaration that his future would be painted in different hues than his past.\n\nThe true turning point was a summer internship during his junior year at a small, independent arts journal in San Francisco. The city\u2019s electric energy and the passionate, intellectual debates he had with his colleagues were a revelation. He felt he had finally found his native tongue. After graduating, he packed two suitcases and moved into a tiny studio in the Inner Richmond, determined to carve out a life.\n\nNow 31, Liam lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose artistic pulse he feels deeply. His 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse; as an Assistant Editor for a prestigious digital arts publication, his world is often confined to the four walls of his apartment, the quiet hum of his keyboard punctuated by the chime of incoming submissions. His days are a disciplined routine: coffee from a local roaster, hours spent refining articles on emerging artists, and a mandatory late-afternoon walk through Patricia's Green to clear his head.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a graphic designer, a musician, and a fellow writer\u2014who serve as his chosen family. A difficult breakup last year pushed him further into his work, making him more introspective. Though he enjoys shaping the narratives of others, Liam dreams of stepping out from behind the screen. His ultimate aspiration is not just to edit but to curate; he wants to bring together the tangible work of the artists he champions, to create a physical space for the dialogues he currently facilitates online. San Francisco, for him, isn't just a home\u2014it\u2019s the gallery he hopes to one day fill."
