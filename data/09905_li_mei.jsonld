Her parents, Taiwanese immigrants who ran a modest dry-cleaning business, instilled in her a deep respect for hard work and cultural heritage. While they hoped she might pursue something more \"practical,\" Mei found solace and curiosity in the city's museums, spending her weekends lost amongst artifacts and paintings.\n\nHer educational journey began at UC Berkeley, where she initially considered a more traditional track before ultimately embracing her passion for art history. A pivotal moment came during a summer internship at the Asian Art Museum, solidifying her decision to pursue a Graduate Degree in Museum Studies at NYU. The hustle and international exposure of New York broadened her perspective, but the pull of her roots and the unique cultural tapestry of San Francisco eventually drew her back.\n\nLanding her current role at a dynamic, mid-sized cultural institution in the Yerba Buena area was a hard-won achievement. Starting as an assistant, she proved her organizational prowess and creative vision, steadily climbing the ranks. The salary of $85,000, while comfortable, reflects the realities of working in the non-profit arts sector in a high-cost city.\n\nMei's daily life is a balance of meticulous planning for upcoming exhibitions, liaising with artists and curators, and navigating the MUNI for her daily commute from the Inner Sunset. Her close-knit circle of friends are a mix of colleagues and others she's met through shared interests in art and food. She cherishes her Sunday dim sum with her parents, a constant reminder of her beginnings.\n\nLooking ahead, Mei dreams of curating an exhibition that showcases the untold stories of Asian diasporic artists in California. She\u2019s also considering pursuing a doctoral degree to delve deeper into museology and potentially contribute to the academic side of the field. For now, she finds fulfillment in bringing art to the community, contributing to the cultural pulse of the city she calls home. San Francisco, with its layers of history and diverse communities, is not just where she works; it's intrinsically woven into the fabric of her identity."

The feel of her father\u2019s calloused hand in hers, walking past the closed storefronts in the Sunset after a long day at the dry cleaners, the air smelling of salt and fog. She was maybe eight, grappling with why they worked so hard. It instilled in her the quiet dignity of their labor, a bedrock of her own future resilience.\n\n2.  Standing before a Rothko at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art during a high school trip. The sheer scale and color overwhelmed her, a feeling of profound connection she couldn't articulate. It was a silent affirmation of the path she wasn't yet ready to admit she desired, a seed planted in fertile ground.\n\n3.  Receiving the acceptance letter from NYU, a dizzying mix of excitement and guilt. Telling her parents felt like a small betrayal of their more \"practical\" dreams for her. The leap felt immense, but the yearning for a broader world, for art, was stronger than her fear of disappointing them.\n\n4.  The chaotic, exhilarating rush of installing her first exhibition as lead assistant. Sleepless nights fueled by lukewarm coffee, the shared camaraderie with the crew, and finally seeing the finished space bathed in light. It solidified her purpose, proving she could translate passion into tangible reality, that this wasn't just a dream, but a career.\n\n5.  Sharing dim sum with her parents on a Sunday, the easy rhythm of conversation and shared food. Her father mentioning a customer admired her work, a rare compliment. It was a quiet acknowledgement of her unconventional path, a sense of having bridged worlds, honoring their sacrifices while building her own life in the city they poured their hearts into."
