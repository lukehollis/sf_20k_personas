The son of a pragmatic Chinese-American engineer from Oakland and a thoughtful librarian mother from rural Ohio, Russell grew up in Alameda in the 1970s and 80s. He navigated the space between his father\u2019s ancestral stories and his mother\u2019s love for the ordered world of the Dewey Decimal System, feeling perpetually like an observer of disparate, overlapping histories.\n\nThis perspective guided him to a history degree at UC Berkeley. However, it was witnessing the first dot-com bust in the late 90s that became his true turning point. He watched as fledgling digital companies\u2014and the nascent digital culture they created\u2014vanished overnight, their data and stories lost to defunct servers. This ephemeral nature of digital information troubled him deeply. He realized his calling wasn't just to study history, but to preserve its modern form. He enrolled in an MLIS program, focusing on digital archiving.\n\nNow the Lead Digital Archivist for a major San Francisco cultural institution, Russell is a respected, if reserved, figure. For the last fifteen years, he has dedicated himself to capturing the city\u2019s evolving narrative, from digitized zines of the punk scene to the oral histories of displaced communities. His work is a personal mission, intensified after his father\u2019s death left him with few tangible records of his own family\u2019s journey from Guangdong.\n\nRussell lives in a meticulously kept one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he\u2019s watched transform from gritty to chic. His daily routine is a comforting ritual: a pour-over coffee from a local cafe, followed by the 1.8-mile ride on the 21-Hayes Muni bus, where he reads from a physical book. His social circle is small and meaningful, consisting of a few close colleagues and an old friend from his Berkeley days. A long-term relationship ended amicably a decade ago, leaving him content in his structured solitude.\n\nRussell\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or fame, but of permanence. He hopes to secure a major endowment for his archive, ensuring that the digital ghosts of San Francisco have a permanent home, safe from the bit rot andlink decay he so deeply fears."

A hollow ache settled in him\u2014the feeling of watching his own history become a set of disconnected data points, already decaying. It wasn't just about the past; it was about the vital need for a system, for context. This moment planted the seed of his life's work: to caption the ghosts before they faded completely.\n        *   *Occurred: Mid-1980s.*\n\n2. He can still picture the SoMa office in 2001, just after the bust. Through the glass, he saw empty desks and a faded logo on the wall for a company that was a verb six months prior. It wasn't just a failed business; it was a digital ghost town. The websites, the forums, the early culture\u2014all gone. He felt a visceral dread, realizing that an entire era of history could be deleted with a keystroke. His path crystallized then: he wouldn't just study history, he would have to save it.\n        *   *Occurred: 2001.*\n\n3. After his father died, Russell sorted through his things, searching for a tangible link to his past. He found engineering blueprints and tax records, but almost no letters, journals, or stories. The man who built physical bridges had left few personal ones behind. The grief was immense, but tangled with it was the specific, sharp pain of a corrupted file, an archive with no accession record. His work became his penance and his purpose, an attempt to save other families from this same silence.\n        *   *Occurred: About 15 years ago.*\n\n4. A few years into his job, a corrupted audio file\u2014the oral history of a Fillmore resident displaced by redevelopment\u2014seemed lost. For two days, he coaxed the data, piecing it together. When the woman\u2019s voice finally emerged from the digital static, clear and resonant, describing her childhood home, Russell felt a quiet, profound triumph. It was the antithesis of the dot-com erasures. It was an act of resurrection, a single story pulled back from the void. This was why he did it.\n        *   *Occurred: About 10 years ago.*\n\n5. On his morning ride on the 21-Hayes, he looked up from his book as the bus passed a construction site where a beloved auto body shop once stood. In his mind, he could see the metadata: family-owned 1948-2009, demolished 2018. He was an archivist of a city constantly overwriting its own source code. The sight didn\u2019t make him sad, exactly. It focused him. It was a daily reminder of his quiet, urgent race against forgetting.\n        *   *Occurred: Last week.*"
