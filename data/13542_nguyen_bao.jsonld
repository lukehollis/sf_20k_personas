He was six when his family fled a collapsing Saigon in 1979, packed onto a fishing boat with little more than the clothes on their backs. They landed in San Francisco, settling in the Tenderloin, where the city\u2019s grit was a stark contrast to the tropical air they\u2019d left behind. For Bao, the anchor in this chaotic new world was his mother\u2019s cooking. In their tiny apartment kitchen, the clatter of her pestle and mortar was a promise of home, a connection to a life and culture that felt miles away.\n\nHe was a practical, quiet student who finished his GED but felt the pull of the kitchen more strongly than any textbook. He started as a dishwasher at a bustling pho restaurant on Clement Street, his hands raw from the hot water but his eyes wide open, absorbing everything. He learned by watching, by smelling, by tasting. He slowly ascended from dishwasher to prep cook, then to the line, his natural palate and tireless work ethic earning the respect of the older cooks. He never attended culinary school; his education was forged in the fire of countless dinner services.\n\nA key turning point came in his late thirties. A prominent restaurateur, dining at the restaurant where Bao was now a sous chef, tasted a staff meal Bao had prepared\u2014a complex, elevated version of *b\u00fan ch\u1ea3*. Impressed, he offered Bao the chance to helm a new, modern Vietnamese restaurant in Hayes Valley. It was a terrifying leap, but one he took.\n\nToday, at 50, Bao is the respected Head Chef of \"S\u00f4ng,\" a restaurant celebrated for its artistic fusion of traditional flavors and California sensibilities. His daily routine is a ritual: an early morning walk through the foggy Outer Richmond, followed by the steady rumble of the 5R Fulton bus downtown. His commute is his time to think, to sketch out new pairings in his worn notebook. He met his wife, Mai, twenty years ago when she was a server; their daughter is now studying business at SF State, a source of immense pride. His hope is simple: to see his daughter thrive in the stable world he worked so hard to build. His private dream, however, is to one day open a small, perfect pho shop in his own neighborhood\u2014no fusion, no pretense, just the comforting, honest broth that first anchored him to this city."
