Born in Daly City to a Maltese father who worked as a freighter mechanic and a Filipina mother who was a nurse, he grew up in a household rich with the aromas of pastizzi and adobo. He never felt he fit neatly into any single category, a feeling that defined his early years. This sense of being \u201cother\u201d made him a keen observer of people, a skill that would later define his career.\n\nHis educational journey was brief and pragmatic. David enrolled in a business program at a community college with a vague notion of following a traditional path. However, when his father\u2019s health began to fail, the pressure to contribute financially became immediate. He dropped out and took a part-time job at a bustling electronics store in the city to help make ends meet. To his own surprise, he thrived. The world of circuit boards, processors, and audio specs made sense to him, but more importantly, he had a natural talent for managing the delicate ecosystem of staff personalities and customer demands.\n\nThe key turning point was his promotion to store manager a decade ago. The position came with a rare San Francisco perk: a small, rent-stabilized apartment directly above the shop in the Inner Richmond. His commute became a single flight of stairs. This arrangement has shaped his entire adult life. He is a fixture of the neighborhood, a constant presence. His daily routine is tied to the rhythm of the store below\u2014the morning inventory checks, the midday rush, the quiet hours before closing. His social life is woven from the threads of his regulars: the elderly woman who needs help setting up her tablet, the audiophile who discusses vintage receivers for hours.\n\nNow 42, David lives a solitary but not lonely life. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his demanding hours and deep integration with his work. He\u2019s quietly content, a pillar in his small corner of the city. His dream isn\u2019t a tech startup or a meteoric rise; it\u2019s simpler. He hopes to one day save enough to buy the store from its aging owner, ensuring this small piece of authentic, service-oriented San Francisco endures, much like himself."
