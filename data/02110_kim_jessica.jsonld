            "value": "Jessica Kim is the daughter of Korean immigrants who built a life from the humble foundation of a Daly City dry-cleaning business. Growing up amidst the scent of steaming fabrics and the constant hum of machinery, she learned the values of meticulous work and quiet resilience from her parents. While they hoped she\u2019d pursue a lucrative career in medicine or law, Jessica was drawn to the complex, human systems that shaped the Bay Area around her.\n\nShe attended UC Berkeley, initially as an economics major to appease her family, but found her true calling in a sociology class that deconstructed urban inequality. This led her to pursue a Master of Public Policy, where she focused on how municipal governments could better serve their most vulnerable residents. Her first job was with the SFMTA, analyzing transit equity, but she felt a growing pull toward the city\u2019s dominant industry: tech. The turning point came during the tech boom of the 2010s. Witnessing the social displacement and cultural shifts firsthand, Jessica decided she couldn't just be an observer; she needed to work on shaping policy from within the city\u2019s power structure.\n\nNow a Senior Policy Analyst specializing in technology, Jessica works from her airy Hayes Valley apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute gives her an intimate connection to her neighborhood. Her days begin with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by hours of drafting policy memos on digital privacy, the ethics of AI in public services, or bridging the digital divide. She\u2019s the crucial, often invisible, link between disruptive startups and the public good.\n\nAt 42, Jessica is single and cultivated a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow policy wonks, artists, and non-profit leaders. Evenings often involve a yoga class, a low-key dinner in her neighborhood, or attending a community board meeting, blurring the lines between her professional and personal investment in the city. Her deepest aspiration is to help steer San Francisco towards a more equitable and humane technological future, ensuring that innovation serves all its citizens, not just the privileged few. She sometimes quietly considers a future run for the Board of Supervisors, believing her parents\u2019 lessons in hard work could be best applied in service to the city she truly calls home."
