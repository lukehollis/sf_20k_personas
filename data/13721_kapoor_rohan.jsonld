The son of an architect father and a textile designer mother who emigrated from Mumbai to Fremont, his childhood home was a study in structure and color. While his parents encouraged a stable career, they filled his life with art books and trips to museums, inadvertently planting a seed. The turning point came at sixteen during a family trip to India. Standing within the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, surrounded by ancient sculptures and intricate miniature paintings, Rohan realized that objects held stories. He decided his life\u2019s work would be to tell them.\n\nThis revelation propelled him to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz and later pursue an MFA in Museum Studies at the University of San Francisco, a move that finally brought him to the city he had admired from across the bay. After graduating, he landed a role as an Exhibitions Coordinator for a dynamic contemporary art gallery in SoMa. His days are a flurry of emails with artists, meticulous planning for installations, and the creative problem-solving required to bring a vision to life.\n\nNow, Rohan\u2019s life is quintessentially San Francisco. He lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in the Mission District, filled with plants and prints from artist friends. His 2.8-mile commute is a daily ritual on his well-loved bicycle, a blur of colorful murals, morning fog, and the hum of city life. His evenings are often spent with his partner, Clara, a graphic designer he met at a gallery opening. They explore new taco spots, attend film screenings at the Roxie, or simply sketch in Dolores Park.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; he sees its layers of history, activism, and reinvention as a living museum. While he enjoys the hands-on nature of his current role, he dreams of becoming a full-fledged Curator. His ultimate aspiration is to curate a major exhibition that bridges contemporary South Asian diasporic art with Western modernism, a project that would honor his heritage and his chosen home."

While his parents discussed architecture, Rohan found himself frozen before a collection of miniature paintings. He saw not just intricate figures, but entire courtly lives, whispered secrets, and dynastic ambitions captured in a single, confident brushstroke. It was a visceral shock of realization\u2014these weren't just objects, they were evidence. In that silent room, thousands of miles from Fremont, he knew with absolute clarity he would spend his life helping these stories speak.\n\n2.\nIt was a crisp autumn morning, a few months after he\u2019d moved to the Mission. Biking his route down Valencia, the fog was just starting to burn off, catching the saturated colors of a fresh mural. The scent of coffee from a cafe mixed with the smell of pan dulce from a bakery. He swerved around a delivery truck, sharing a knowing nod with another cyclist. In that fleeting moment, the city wasn't just a place he lived; it was a living, breathing entity, and he was part of its rhythm. He felt a profound sense of belonging.\n\n3.\nHe was troubleshooting a flickering spotlight at a chaotic gallery opening when he first saw Clara. She wasn't looking at the art on the walls, but at the flow of the crowd, sketching it in a small notebook. When their eyes met, she didn't just smile; she asked him about the installation's spatial narrative. The art became an immediate bridge between them. That conversation, held over the gallery's din, felt more intimate and creatively charged than any art theory class. He knew, right then, that he had met an essential part of his life.\n\n4.\nThe kinetic sculpture had arrived with a hairline fracture, and the artist was distraught. For 48 frantic hours, Rohan coordinated with a local fabricator, calmed the artist, and re-planned the installation, a nerve-wracking dance of logistics and empathy. When the piece finally whirred to life, perfect and graceful, just before doors opened, the artist simply clasped his shoulder. \"You didn't just hang it,\" she whispered, \"you understood it.\" That quiet acknowledgment felt more validating than any diploma, a testament to his ability to truly care for a vision.\n\n5.\nHe and Clara were sketching in Dolores Park on a lazy Sunday. He was trying to capture the geometric shadows of the palm trees, which reminded him of his father\u2019s blueprints, while Clara mapped the spectrum of color in the crowd. He looked from his sketchbook to the diverse city below and thought of Mumbai. Suddenly, his curatorial dream felt tangible: putting a bold, contemporary piece by a diasporic artist next to a Diebenkorn. He voiced it to Clara, and in her immediate, enthusiastic response, his aspiration solidified from a vague dream into a concrete future."
