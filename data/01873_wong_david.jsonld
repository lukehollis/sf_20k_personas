            "value": "David Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laced, western neighborhoods. Born and raised in the Sunset District, he was the quiet son of hardworking Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Irving Street. His childhood was a predictable rhythm of school, helping fold clothes, and listening to the hum of the dryers. While his parents preached practicality and financial security, David was drawn to the hushed halls of the de Young Museum, losing himself in colors and forms that felt more real than his family\u2019s ledgers.\n\nThis passion led him to SF State, where he rebelliously pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History. He dreamed of a life as a museum curator, surrounded by beauty and story. But reality intervened. The 2008 financial crisis hit just as he graduated, shuttering arts programs and making stable jobs scarce. With his parents needing to retire, David made the pragmatic choice his upbringing had always demanded: he took an administrative assistant position at a downtown finance firm. It was supposed to be temporary.\n\nTwelve years later, David is still there. The pandemic shifted his role to permanently remote, shrinking his world to the confines of the same small Sunset apartment he\u2019s rented for a decade. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to a small desk in the living room. His days are a quiet routine of managing calendars and formatting reports for people he\u2019s never met in person. His social life is small; a weekly dinner with his older sister in the Richmond and occasional visits to old college friends.\n\nThough his career feels like a quiet failure, David has not abandoned his dream entirely. After logging off, he works on his own paintings, impressionistic landscapes of the city he knows so intimately. His hope isn't for a promotion, but to save enough money to one day rent a small studio space in the Outer Mission. For David, success is no longer a title, but the simple, future prospect of a room of his own, filled with the scent of turpentine instead of the sterile glow of a laptop screen."
