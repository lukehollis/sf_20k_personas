The son of immigrants from Uttar Pradesh, India, he was raised in Fremont under the heavy expectation of realizing the American Dream his parents had sacrificed for. He was a dutiful son, excelling in school and earning an MBA from San Francisco State University. He spent the first decade of his career in corporate finance, securing a comfortable life that made his parents proud but left him feeling profoundly hollow.\n\nThe turning point came during a mandated company volunteer day at a Tenderloin food pantry. Among the lines of people battling addiction, mental illness, and homelessness, Arun saw a reflection of the systemic struggles he had only read about. The brief interactions he had\u2014sharing a moment of dignity with a veteran, helping a young mother find resources\u2014ignited a purpose that his spreadsheets and profit margins never could. Within two years, he had quit his job, severing ties with his confused and disappointed parents, and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program.\n\nNow, at 49, Arun's 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his life. He is the on-site social worker and manager of a Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotel in the Tenderloin, living in a small unit on the ground floor. His days begin not with an alarm, but with the sounds of the city and the first knock on his door. He navigates a labyrinth of paperwork, mediates disputes between residents, connects them with medical care, and celebrates small victories\u2014a week of sobriety, a job interview, a re-established family connection.\n\nHis social life is intertwined with his work; his neighbors are his clients, and his closest confidants are fellow case workers and nonprofit staff. The friendships from his old corporate life have mostly faded, unable to bridge the chasm between their worlds. Arun\u2019s dreams are no longer of stock options or a house in the suburbs. He hopes to see a few of his long-term residents secure stable, independent housing before he retires. His connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t in its scenic vistas or tech campuses, but in the resilient, gritty, and profoundly human heart of the community he has chosen not just to serve, but to call home."
