Her parents instilled in her a formidable work ethic and the belief that education was the bridge to a different life. A sharp, ambitious student, Michelle was the first in her family to earn a four-year degree, graduating from Cal State East Bay with a Bachelor's in Business Administration.\n\nWith her degree in hand, she crossed the bridge to San Francisco in the early 90s, drawn by the city\u2019s energy and opportunity. Her retail career started on the sales floor of a Union Square department store. She had a natural eye for trends and an uncanny understanding of what customers wanted, quickly moving into assistant buying. She weathered the dot-com bust by proving her indispensable value, learning resilience as colleagues were laid off around her. It was during this time she met her husband, Bao Tran, an architect, while volunteering at the SF-Marin Food Bank, their shared commitment to community forging a deep bond.\n\nNow, as Director of Merchandising for a major apparel brand, Michelle\u2019s days are a whirlwind of strategy meetings, data analysis, and creative decisions. Her 3.8-mile commute is a cherished ritual; she takes the MUNI from her Hayes Valley condo, using the time to listen to industry podcasts or simply watch the city wake up. Life with Bao is a comfortable, curated partnership filled with dinners at new restaurants, weekends browsing the Ferry Building Farmers Market, and occasional escapes to Sonoma.\n\nThough professionally fulfilled, Michelle aspires to do more. She dreams of launching a mentorship program for young women of color trying to break into the corporate side of retail, using her experience to pave an easier path for others. At 53, San Francisco is more than just her home; it\u2019s the city that challenged, shaped, and ultimately rewarded her ambition. It holds the map of her entire adult life, from a determined young graduate to the successful, grounded woman she is today."
