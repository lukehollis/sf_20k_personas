Born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, to a high school history teacher and a nurse, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was steeped in practicality and a deep respect for knowledge. She was a voracious reader, a quiet observer who found solace in the structured world of libraries. This led her to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science, envisioning a life of quiet order, cataloging information and helping others navigate it.\n\nThe turning point came during her first job at a university library. Tasked with managing a departmental budget crisis, she discovered a surprising, thrilling aptitude not just for organizing books, but for analyzing numbers. She found a sharp, cold logic in financial data that was as compelling as any Dewey Decimal System. Weighed down by student loans and feeling a nascent, unexpected ambition, she made a pivot that shocked her family. She completed a grueling post-graduate certificate in financial analysis and, at 28, accepted a junior analyst position in San Francisco, trading Midwestern comfort for the city\u2019s demanding pace.\n\nNow 42 and a Senior Financial Analyst, Sarah works entirely from home. Her commute is the ten steps from her kitchen to the second bedroom she converted into a high-tech office. Her days are a silent ballet of spreadsheets, market reports, and video calls, the global flow of capital contained within the four walls of her apartment. Her connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; she knows the baristas at her corner coffee shop by name and finds peace walking through Patricia's Green before her workday begins.\n\nHer social life is a small, curated circle, mostly friends from a book club\u2014a quiet nod to the librarian she almost was. While she has achieved the financial security she once craved, a sense of dissonance remains. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. She aspires to bridge her two worlds, perhaps by moving into impact investing or providing pro-bono financial consulting for libraries and arts non-profits. She hopes to one day make her balance sheet reflect not just profit, but purpose."
