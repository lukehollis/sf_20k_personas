They had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1970s, settling in the fog-laced streets of the Inner Richmond and pouring their life savings into a small Clement Street laundromat. For their only son, they wanted an American name, a ticket to an easier life. David grew up amidst the hum of dryers and the smell of bleach, a quiet boy who preferred taking apart broken appliances to poring over textbooks.\n\nHis parents, while loving, pushed for academic success he never felt capable of. He was a C-student, more adept with a wrench than a pen. This quiet tension shaped his educational journey; foregoing a four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco. He found his calling not in liberal arts, but in a practical Associate's program for Building Maintenance Technology. It was a world that made sense to him\u2014systems, circuits, and tangible problems with solvable solutions.\n\nAfter graduating, he worked his way up from a handyman for a property management company to a maintenance supervisor. The key turning point came a decade ago when his mentor retired. David was offered the position of live-in Facilities Manager for a grand, pre-war apartment building on the edge of the Presidio\u2014the very building he\u2019d serviced for years. His 0.0-mile commute began.\n\nNow, David\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric of his building. He lives in a tidy basement apartment, his days dictated by a predictable rhythm of preventative maintenance checks and the unpredictable chaos of tenant emergencies. He knows who\u2019s just had a baby by the packages at the door, who\u2019s a night owl by the 2 AM calls about a flickering light, and whose pipes are prone to groaning on cold mornings. His social connections are the residents he serves and the local merchants he\u2019s known since childhood. His life is one of quiet service and immense competence; he is the building\u2019s steady, beating heart.\n\nWhile he finds deep satisfaction in his work, David dreams of anonymity. He aspires to one day save enough to buy a small, quiet condo in the Sunset\u2014a place where he isn\u2019t on call, where someone else fixes the plumbing, and where he can simply be David, not \"David the Manager.\""
