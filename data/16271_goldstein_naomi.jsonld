Born in Seoul, she was adopted as an infant by a loving, intellectual Jewish couple in Berkeley. Ruth and Abe Goldstein raised her with fierce affection, surrounded by books, political discourse, and the traditions of their faith. While her childhood was secure, it was also marked by a quiet dissonance\u2014a Korean face looking back from the mirror, a name that connected her to a heritage that wasn't hers by birth. This profound sense of displacement ultimately fueled her calling.\n\nHer journey led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree and then across the bay to San Francisco State University for her Master of Social Work. The field felt like a natural fit, a way to channel her own complex experiences with identity into helping others navigate theirs. Her career began in community health clinics before she found her true passion: working within the San Francisco Unified School District. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she provides therapy and support to teenagers grappling with everything from anxiety and family trauma to the very identity questions that shaped her own youth.\n\nA key turning point came in her late twenties when she traveled to South Korea. She didn't find her birth mother, a fact that brought a complex mix of grief and relief. Instead, she found a connection to the culture\u2014the food, the language, the bustling energy of Seoul. The trip didn't provide easy answers but gave her a sense of peace, allowing her to integrate the disparate parts of her identity.\n\nToday, Naomi lives in a cozy, fog-laced apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is quintessentially San Franciscan: a morning MUNI ride on the 38-Geary, days spent in the demanding but rewarding world of a public high school, and evenings spent walking in Golden Gate Park or trying new dim sum spots on Clement Street with her long-term partner, a landscape architect named Maya. Her adoptive parents, now retired, are still a central part of her life. Her greatest aspiration is not to find what was lost, but to continue building something whole and enduring\u2014a life of purpose, love, and quiet contentment in the city she proudly calls home."

A classmate, not unkindly, asked why her eyes looked different from everyone else\u2019s. Naomi stared at her hands, smudged with purple marker, and felt a sudden, distinct fissure between the fierce love of her home and the foreignness of her own face in the mirror. It wasn\u2019t a moment of pain, but of profound awareness. It was the first time she understood her identity was not a given, but a puzzle she would have to assemble herself.\n\n2.\nOn her last day in Seoul, she sat on a bench watching the evening rush. She hadn\u2019t found her birth mother. Instead, she bought a hotteok from a street vendor, the warm, cinnamon-laced pancake a balm against the chill. A quiet click sounded within her. The frantic search she had braced for softened into a calm acceptance. This place wasn't about finding a ghost, but about breathing its air, standing on its soil. The trip gave her not an answer, but permission to finally be whole, just as she was.\n\n3.\nA sophomore sat across from her, his shoulders slumped as he described feeling like an imposter in his own immigrant family. Naomi saw her own youth reflected in his eyes. In that moment, she shared a small piece of her own story. The boy\u2019s gaze shifted\u2014not with pity, but with sudden, stark recognition. In that shared vulnerability, her personal history ceased to be a wound. It became a bridge, a tool, the very reason she was sitting in that chair. It was purpose, crystallized into a single, powerful connection.\n\n4.\nShe remembers walking with Maya through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in, swallowing the tops of the cypress trees. Maya, a landscape architect, was quietly explaining the architecture of a fern frond. Naomi leaned her head on her shoulder, breathing in the damp, earthy air. There was no searching, no grand question to answer\u2014just the steady weight of her partner's arm and the quiet hum of the city. This feeling, she thought, was home. A simple, profound peace she had built for herself, piece by piece.\n\n5.\nLast Friday night, after a draining week, she drove to her parents\u2019 home in Berkeley for Shabbat. The familiar aroma of Abe\u2019s brisket and the sight of Ruth lighting the candles instantly settled her soul. Listening to her father retell a familiar story, his hand resting warmly on hers, she felt a powerful wave of gratitude. This love\u2014unconditional and unwavering\u2014was her true foundation. Her heritage wasn\u2019t just a story of birth, but a lifelong story of being chosen, of being fiercely and completely cherished."
