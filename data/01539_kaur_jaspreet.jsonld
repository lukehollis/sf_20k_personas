Adopted as an infant by a loving Punjabi-Sikh couple in Yuba City, she was raised on kirtan, saag, and stories of Punjab. Yet, her physical features told a different, unknown story, creating an internal dissonance that would come to define her life\u2019s work. While she cherished her family, her upbringing was a constant, gentle reminder of being both an insider and an outsider in her own home. This feeling of existing between worlds sparked a deep intellectual curiosity about identity, attachment, and the very definition of family.\n\nHer educational path was a direct line from this central question. She pursued a psychology degree at UC Davis before moving to San Francisco for a Master's in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco. The city was a revelation. For the first time, her inability to be categorized by a single ethnicity wasn't a source of confusion but a point of connection in a city built by transplants and blended identities. It was here she felt she could finally exhale.\n\nNow, at 34, Jaspreet is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). A key turning point was deciding to build her own private practice entirely around telehealth. This affords her a 0.0-mile commute, a significant factor in her grounded, deliberate lifestyle. Her office is a meticulously organized, sunlit corner of her Inner Richmond apartment, a space of calm from which she helps others navigate their own complex relationships and sense of self.\n\nHer days are structured and serene. Morning begins with chai and meditation before she sees clients via video call. Between sessions, she recharges with long walks in Golden Gate Park, her expansive backyard. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014who reflect the city\u2019s diversity. Jaspreet\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; the city didn\u2019t give her an identity so much as it gave her permission to have one that was uniquely her own. Looking forward, she dreams of writing a book on third-culture identity and, perhaps one day, gently exploring the unanswered questions of her own origin story."

A great-aunt pinched her cheek, turning to her mother and asking in Punjabi, \u201cShe\u2019s lovely, but where did she get those eyes?\u201d Jaspreet felt a familiar, hot sting of otherness. But then her mother wrapped an arm around her, pulling her close and saying firmly, \u201cFrom God. She got them from God.\u201d In that moment, Jaspreet learned the complex weight of being fiercely loved yet fundamentally different, a contradiction that would later fuel her life\u2019s work in understanding family bonds.\n\n2.\nHer first week in San Francisco, she walked through the Panhandle on her way to USF. She saw a dozen different worlds colliding: skaters, elderly couples doing tai chi, students debating in Spanish. No one stared or tried to place her. For the first time, she wasn\u2019t a curiosity. She remembers stopping, taking a deep breath of the cool, eucalyptus-scented air, and feeling a profound sense of relief. It wasn't about finding an identity; it was the quiet permission to simply exist without one being assigned to her.\n\n3.\nIt was a rainy Tuesday, two years into her private practice. A young client, adopted from Korea into a white family, confessed, \"I feel like a ghost in my own life.\" Jaspreet nodded, sharing a small, carefully chosen memory of her own childhood dissonance. Across the screen, she watched the client's face soften with the unmistakable relief of being truly seen. In that telehealth session, her personal history was no longer a wound, but a bridge. It was the moment her practice became her purpose.\n\n4.\nLast Thanksgiving, her tiny apartment was crowded with her chosen family. Around the table sat her friends\u2014a playwright from Dublin, a coder from Brazil, a local artist. Her friend Marco raised a glass, toasting Jaspreet as \u201cthe anchor of our misfit crew.\u201d Looking at their faces, illuminated by candlelight, she felt a love so profound it was physical. It was a potent reminder that the sturdiest families are not always the ones you are born into, but the ones you bravely build yourself.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy morning walk in Golden Gate Park, she sat on her favorite bench overlooking Spreckels Lake. After a difficult client session, the quiet was a balm. As the mist swirled, obscuring the far shore, a thought landed with gentle clarity: her book would start not with a question, but with an acceptance of the unknowable. It wasn't about finding answers to her origin, but about learning to thrive in the beauty of the mystery. She felt a peaceful click of alignment\u2014therapist, woman, writer\u2014all settling into place."
