            "value": "Jaspreet Kaur\u2019s life has been a quiet study in navigating contradictions. Adopted as an infant by a loving Punjabi-Sikh couple in Yuba City, she was raised on kirtan, saag, and stories of Punjab. Yet, her physical features told a different, unknown story, creating an internal dissonance that would come to define her life\u2019s work. While she cherished her family, her upbringing was a constant, gentle reminder of being both an insider and an outsider in her own home. This feeling of existing between worlds sparked a deep intellectual curiosity about identity, attachment, and the very definition of family.\n\nHer educational path was a direct line from this central question. She pursued a psychology degree at UC Davis before moving to San Francisco for a Master's in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco. The city was a revelation. For the first time, her inability to be categorized by a single ethnicity wasn't a source of confusion but a point of connection in a city built by transplants and blended identities. It was here she felt she could finally exhale.\n\nNow, at 34, Jaspreet is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). A key turning point was deciding to build her own private practice entirely around telehealth. This affords her a 0.0-mile commute, a significant factor in her grounded, deliberate lifestyle. Her office is a meticulously organized, sunlit corner of her Inner Richmond apartment, a space of calm from which she helps others navigate their own complex relationships and sense of self.\n\nHer days are structured and serene. Morning begins with chai and meditation before she sees clients via video call. Between sessions, she recharges with long walks in Golden Gate Park, her expansive backyard. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014who reflect the city\u2019s diversity. Jaspreet\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; the city didn\u2019t give her an identity so much as it gave her permission to have one that was uniquely her own. Looking forward, she dreams of writing a book on third-culture identity and, perhaps one day, gently exploring the unanswered questions of her own origin story."
