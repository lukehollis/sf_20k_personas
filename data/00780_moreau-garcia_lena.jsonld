            "value": "Lena Moreau-Garcia is a product of San Francisco\u2019s cultural crossroads. Born and raised in an ever-changing Mission District, she is the only child of a French academic father and a second-generation Mexican-American mother who worked as a community health nurse. Her upbringing was a blend of intellectual debates over dinner and firsthand lessons in social justice, watching her mother navigate the city\u2019s complex healthcare system for non-English speaking patients. This early exposure to the stark health disparities within her own vibrant neighborhood became the quiet, guiding force of her life.\n\nAfter earning a sociology degree from UC Berkeley, Lena felt a pull back to the tangible, person-to-person work her mother did. This led her to pursue a Master of Public Health, focusing on policy and community engagement. She began her career on the ground, running outreach programs for a free clinic before methodically working her way up. A key turning point was managing a grant-funded project to improve prenatal care for undocumented mothers, a success that solidified her reputation as a compassionate and fiercely effective leader. Now, as a Program Manager, she develops and oversees initiatives that aim to dismantle the very barriers she witnessed as a child.\n\nLena\u2019s life is centered in her cozy NoPa apartment, which doubles as her office. The 0.0-mile commute allows her to invest time in her well-being; mornings often start with a run in the Panhandle, and evenings are for cooking or losing herself in a book. Though currently single, she is anchored by a tight-knit \"chosen family\"\u2014a group of friends from various stages of her life who gather for potlucks and weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nAs a native, Lena holds a deep, often pained, love for San Francisco. She mourns the cultural vibrancy lost to tech booms but remains fiercely dedicated to preserving its inclusive spirit. Her dream is to one day move from managing programs to shaping policy at a city level, ensuring that the San Francisco of the future cares for all of its residents. For Lena, her work isn\u2019t a career; it\u2019s an act of loyalty to the city that raised her."
