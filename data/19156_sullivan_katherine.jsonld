Born in Seoul and adopted at six months old, she was raised in a supportive, middle-class home in Marin County. Her parents, a librarian and a high school teacher, fostered in her a deep sense of social responsibility. Yet, growing up as one of the few Asian faces in her community, Katherine navigated a quiet, internal landscape of feeling both deeply loved and fundamentally different, a dichotomy that would fuel her life\u2019s work.\n\nThis drive for understanding and belonging led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology before earning a Master of Public Health. Her path wasn't about climbing a corporate ladder but about building a stronger social safety net. Katherine started her career managing outreach for a free clinic in the Mission District. A pivotal turning point came when a teen wellness program she designed demonstrably lowered dropout rates at a local high school, solidifying her belief in proactive, community-based care. Now, as a Director, she develops and secures funding for health programs that serve thousands of children and families across the city.\n\nKatherine\u2019s personal life has been steady, marked by an amicable divorce a decade ago from a man with whom she remains friends. Their son, Leo, is now a junior at UCLA, a source of immense pride and frequent FaceTime calls. She lives in a cozy, book-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its foggy mornings, proximity to Golden Gate Park, and the hum of the 38-Geary bus she rides to her downtown office. Her days are a comforting routine of early morning walks, intense work meetings, and quiet evenings spent cooking or meeting friends for dinner.\n\nNow 52, Katherine\u2019s ambition has shifted from personal advancement to legacy. She hopes to mentor a new generation of public health leaders and create a foundation to ensure her programs thrive long after she retires. Her deepest, most private dream is to one day visit Korea\u2014not to find a past she can't reclaim, but to connect with a culture that lives within her."

Staring at her own round face and dark, straight hair, she felt a strange dissonance. It was her, but the name belonged to someone with freckles and red hair, someone from the books her father read to her. It was the first time she understood that love and belonging could coexist with a quiet, unshakeable sense of being different. That photo marked the true beginning of her questions.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe flimsy graduation announcement arrived at her Mission District clinic address nearly fifteen years ago. It was from a girl named Sofia, a former participant in her fledgling teen wellness program who had once been on the verge of dropping out. Katherine stared at the photo of the beaming young woman in her cap and gown, her chest tightening with a profound sense of purpose. It wasn't just data or a successful metric; it was a life, redirected. That single piece of cardstock solidified her life's work, transforming her career from a job into a true vocation.\n\n***\n\n3.\nShe can still feel the humid, stale air of Leo\u2019s freshman dorm room at UCLA. He was excitedly tacking a band poster to the wall, his back to her, already a part of this new world. In that moment, watching her son, so confident and ready, she felt an overwhelming wave of both fierce pride and heartbreaking release. She had built this for him: a foundation of security he could launch from. The long, tight hug they shared before she left was a silent transfer of trust, marking her own transition into a new kind of motherhood.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe divorce papers were signed, their house officially on the market. She remembers sitting with her then-ex-husband on the cool concrete steps of their Noe Valley home, sharing a thermos of coffee just like they had a thousand times before. There were no harsh words, only a shared, quiet sadness for the future they wouldn't have together. It was a moment of deep mutual respect, proof that an ending didn\u2019t have to be a failure. It taught her that love could evolve, settling into new, durable forms if handled with grace.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last Tuesday, on a characteristically foggy Inner Richmond morning, she paused outside the Korean market on Clement Street. Through the glass, she saw rows of crimson gochujang tubs and massive jars of kimchi. It wasn't a feeling of loss, but a quiet, magnetic pull\u2014a hum of almost-familiarity. This recurring moment isn't about reclaiming a past; it\u2019s a gentle promise to herself to one day go and simply be present in the culture that is an unseen, yet indelible, part of her."
