He grew up in Concord, the son of a union electrician who believed in the value of a skilled trade over a framed degree. David spent his youth shadowing his father, absorbing the logic of wiring, plumbing, and structural integrity. School felt abstract and secondary to the tangible world of making things work, so after graduating high school, he bypassed college for a job in apartment maintenance.\n\nHis career was a slow, steady climb built on reliability and an almost preternatural ability to diagnose a problem. David wasn't a \"people person,\" but he was a \"systems person.\" He moved from residential maintenance to commercial properties in the East Bay, eventually becoming a supervisor. The turning point came 12 years ago when a new biotech research facility was being built in Mission Bay. He applied for a facilities management position on a long shot, and his deep, practical knowledge of HVAC, security, and lab-grade electrical systems won over the PhDs in charge.\n\nThe promotion coincided with a quiet divorce, a mutual parting that left him with a sense of profound self-reliance. He sold the suburban house and bought a small condo in the Inner Richmond. Now, his life runs on a steady rhythm. The 2.8-mile bike ride to work is a non-negotiable ritual, a time to watch the fog burn off over the Presidio. At the firm, he is the invisible engine, the man who ensures the multi-million-dollar research is never derailed by a burst pipe or a power failure. He is respected for his competence, a quiet anchor in a sea of ambitious scientists.\n\nHis social life is small but solid: a weekly beer with a couple of other cyclists at a dive bar on Geary, and Sunday calls with his sister in Petaluma. David\u2019s aspirations are as grounded as he is. He dreams of paying off his mortgage early and taking a long trip to County Clare, Ireland, to see where the O'Connells came from. He loves San Francisco not for its frantic energy, but for its physical presence\u2014the steep hills that test his legs, the cool salt air on his ride home, and the feeling of being an essential, working part of a complex, beautiful machine."

David traced the logic of the circuits with his finger. When he finally found and flipped the right one, the sudden hum of the house coming back to life felt like a secret language he\u2019d just learned to speak. It wasn\u2019t about electricity; it was about restoring order. That day, he understood his path was in things he could hold and fix.\n\n2.\nTwelve years ago, in the glass-walled conference room, David felt his lack of a degree like a missing tooth. The PhDs asked about redundant power for the -80\u00b0C freezers. He spoke not of theory, but of transfer switches, generator load tests, and the specific whine a distressed compressor makes. He saw a flicker of respect, then profound relief, in their eyes. For the first time, his hands-on knowledge wasn\u2019t just useful; it was essential. He felt his world finally click into place.\n\n3.\nAfter signing the last divorce paper, he spent the first night in his empty Inner Richmond condo. All he owned was his bike, leaning against the wall, and a pizza box on the floor. Outside, the N-Judah rumbled past, its sound a comfort. He wasn\u2019t lonely; he was recalibrating. The echo in the small space wasn't of absence, but of profound self-reliance. This small square of the city was his, earned by his own two hands, and that was more than enough.\n\n4.\nIt was 2 a.m. a few years back. A frantic call: the primary air handler for the flagship cleanroom had failed. He arrived to find panicked researchers fearing the loss of a year\u2019s work. In the mechanical room\u2019s roar, David was calm. He diagnosed a faulty relay, his hands moving with practiced certainty. Hearing the system restart with a satisfying thrum, he just nodded. The unspoken gratitude from the lead scientist, a quiet look of awe, was more valuable than any bonus or award.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a bike ride home last winter, legs burning on the Page Street hill. Cars rushed past, but he was in his own world of gears and breath. Reaching the crest, the cold, salty fog hit his face like a benediction, the city lights below a vast circuit board he understood intimately. He wasn't just living in San Francisco; his body was in a physical conversation with it. The effort and the reward were real. He felt, finally, like a necessary, working part."
