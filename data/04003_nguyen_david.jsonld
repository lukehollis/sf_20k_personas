His parents, Hanh and Bao, were part of the \"boat people\" exodus from Vietnam, eventually finding a foothold in San Jose\u2019s burgeoning Vietnamese community in the early 1980s. David grew up amidst the scent of ph\u1edf from his mother's small restaurant and the quiet determination of a community building itself from scratch. He watched strip malls become vibrant cultural centers and apricot orchards turn into suburban sprawl, sparking a lifelong fascination with how places evolve.\n\nThis fascination led him to UCLA for his undergraduate studies and culminated in a Master of Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. Armed with idealism and a desire to build equitable spaces, he landed a coveted position with the San Francisco Planning Department. His early years were a baptism by fire during the dot-com boom and bust, followed by the tech explosion of the 2010s. David witnessed firsthand the city\u2019s profound social and physical transformations, fighting in public meetings for affordable housing overlays and protected bike lanes, often feeling his efforts were a finger in a breaking dam.\n\nNow 44, David lives a deliberately curated life in Hayes Valley. The 0.0-mile commute is no accident; he lives in a modern condo directly above his dedicated home office. He believes in the \"15-minute city\" he advocates for professionally, sourcing his coffee, groceries, and occasional dinners from businesses within a short walk. His days are a disciplined routine of digital blueprints, policy analysis, and virtual community meetings. Socially, he maintains a small, tight circle of friends\u2014fellow policy wonks and a couple of architects\u2014preferring quiet dinners to boisterous nightlife.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city as a complex, flawed, beautiful organism. His greatest aspiration isn't a promotion or public recognition, but to see a single, major project he championed\u2014a new public plaza, a significant affordable housing development\u2014come to fruition and serve the community as intended. For David, a better city isn't an abstract concept; it's a tangible legacy he feels compelled to leave behind."

Across the street, the last apricot orchard was being cleared for a new strip mall. It wasn\u2019t just trees falling; it was the end of one story and the confusing, churning start of another. That day, he didn't just see a changing landscape; he felt it in his bones, a quiet ache that sparked a lifelong question: who decides what comes next?\n\n2.\nHis first big public meeting, around 2002. He stood before a crowd in a stuffy Richmond district library, presenting a mixed-use proposal. The dot-com bubble had just burst. The faces weren\u2019t hopeful; they were angry, terrified of change when their lives were already in freefall. His charts and data meant nothing. He left that night feeling not like a builder, but a target. It was the moment his academic idealism died, replaced by a much harder, more patient resolve to understand the fear behind the \"no.\"\n\n3.\nA late-night walk up to Twin Peaks in his late twenties. The fog was thick, swallowing the city below, but the red lights of Sutro Tower pulsed above it all like a metallic heartbeat. It wasn't a landmark on a map; it was a living beacon in the quiet dark. In that moment, San Francisco stopped being a series of policy challenges and became a singular, breathing organism he was a part of. He felt a fierce, protective love for its strange, imperfect beauty.\n\n4.\nIt was a tiny project, a \"bulb-out\" he\u2019d fought for on a busy corner in the Outer Sunset. Years of meetings for a few feet of concrete. One Tuesday afternoon, he saw an elderly couple sitting on the new bench he\u2019d insisted on, sharing a pastry from the bakery opposite. They were sheltered from traffic, basking in the sun. No one knew his role. It was an anonymous, profound victory that felt more real than any glowing press release. It was proof that the fight was worth having.\n\n5.\nHe stood on a patch of dirt in Hayes Valley around 2008, where the Central Freeway had just been torn down. It was a scar, a dusty void between neighborhoods. But looking at the empty lot, he didn\u2019t see blight. He saw the blueprint of a future: a park, housing, the murmur of a cafe. It was a vision so clear, so tangible, it felt like a premonition. That\u2019s when his vague desire to \"do good\" sharpened into a specific, driving purpose: to leave one space better than he found it."
