Her mother, a pragmatic nurse from the Philippines, and her father, a Mexican-American carpenter with an artist\u2019s hands, raised her on the border of San Francisco, instilling in her a love for structure and a deep sense of family duty. This blend of practicality and creativity led her to pursue architecture at San Francisco State University, where she felt she had found her true calling, sketching buildings that seemed to rise from the page.\n\nHer academic dreams, however, were cut short. When her father suffered a debilitating injury on a job site, the family\u2019s financial stability crumbled. At 21, Serafina dropped out of college to find work, shelving her blueprints to help pay the bills. She landed an entry-level project coordinator role at a large engineering firm, a world adjacent to her passion but firmly rooted in logistics and spreadsheets.\n\nOver the next two decades, Serafina channeled her innate understanding of design and process into a different kind of building: constructing project timelines and managing complex teams. Her sharp mind and reliability propelled her upward, culminating in her current role as a Senior Project Manager.\n\nNow 47, Serafina lives a life of curated stability in Hayes Valley. Her 1.2-mile walk to her SoMa office is a cherished daily ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s architectural tapestry. Her apartment is her sanctuary, meticulously decorated with architectural monographs, thriving fiddle-leaf figs, and a few of her own framed sketches from college\u2014ghosts of a past life. She maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, some from her old neighborhood and some former work colleagues, sharing dinners and weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nWhile she finds satisfaction in her successful career, her ultimate dream isn't a higher corporate title. She aspires to finally circle back to her first love. Serafina spends her evenings taking online courses, slowly working towards her architectural license. Her hope is to one day leave the corporate world behind to design small, impactful projects: a community garden pavilion, an affordable Accessory Dwelling Unit, or perhaps her own modest, perfectly designed home in a quieter part of the state."

Her father, covered in a fine powder, isn\u2019t building; he\u2019s sketching a cabinet design on a scrap of plywood. His calloused carpenter\u2019s hands move with an artist\u2019s grace, making lines that promise form and function. In that moment, watching him, Serafina understood. She saw how a simple pencil line, filled with intention, could become something solid and real. It was the first time she felt the pull of architecture.\n\n2.\nThe late-night quiet of the SF State architecture studio, age 20. A stubborn design for a community library finally yielded, the solution arriving in a flash of clarity. She remembers the frantic energy of her pencil, the graphite smudged on her hand, the sheer joy of solving the puzzle. It wasn\u2019t just a grade; it was a feeling of pure, unadulterated rightness, as if her mind and spirit had finally found their native language. That feeling became the ghost she would chase for the next two decades.\n\n3.\nThe kitchen table felt impossibly large. Her mother, still in her nurse's scrubs, was all pragmatic strength, but her eyes were tired. Her father sat silently, his powerful hands resting uselessly in his lap, a cast shadowing his arm. At 21, Serafina slid her portfolio under her bed and told them she\u2019d found a job. It wasn\u2019t a sacrifice, she told herself, it was a structural decision. She wasn't giving up a dream; she was rebuilding her family\u2019s foundation, beam by necessary beam.\n\n4.\nShe stood on a muddy SoMa construction site in her mid-thirties, hard hat on, clutching a clipboard. The steel skeleton of a building she had managed for months finally met the sky, a perfect grid against the fog. For years, her blueprints had been Gantt charts and budgets. Seeing the physical result of her logistical work stirred a deep, complicated pride. But it was coupled with a sharp, hollow ache\u2014the feeling of being the architect of the process, but never the vision.\n\n5.\nOn her walk home two years ago, she stopped. A new, modest infill house had been completed in Hayes Valley. It was small, clever, and deeply humane. She admired how the light hit the wooden slats, the perfect placement of a window seat. It wasn't a corporate monument; it was a home. In that instant, the old, wistful longing was replaced by a quiet, forceful purpose. Her dream wasn\u2019t dead. It had just been waiting, learning to want something smaller, something truer, something she could still build."
