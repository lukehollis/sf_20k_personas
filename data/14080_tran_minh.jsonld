Born in Saigon in 1971, his early childhood was upended by the city\u2019s fall. At age six, he and his family fled Vietnam, eventually finding sponsorship in San Jose. While his parents worked tirelessly in restaurants and assembly lines, instilling in him a profound work ethic, Minh found solace in dismantling and sketching household objects, fascinated by how form met function.\n\nThis fascination guided him away from his parents\u2019 preferred path of engineering towards Industrial Design at San Jose State University. He thrived, his designs marked by a clean, empathetic utility\u2014a direct result of watching his parents struggle with poorly designed tools. He pursued a graduate degree at California College of the Arts, cementing his love for San Francisco's vibrant design community. His career breakthrough was a line of ergonomic medical instruments that significantly reduced practitioner fatigue, a project that solidified his belief that good design is an act of service. Now, as a Principal Designer, he leads a team developing sustainable consumer electronics, finding elegance in efficiency.\n\nMinh has lived in his Inner Richmond flat for twenty years, a quiet haven of minimalist furniture and meticulously cared-for bonsai trees. His daily 5.5-mile commute on the N Judah is a cherished ritual, a time for sketching in his notebook and observing the city\u2019s endless parade of humanity. He met his husband, Leo, a public school teacher, a decade ago while volunteering at the SF-Marin Food Bank. Their life is built on shared values, quiet evenings, and long walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nHaving achieved the stability his parents dreamed of for him, Minh\u2019s aspirations have shifted. He mentors young designers, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds, helping them navigate a competitive field. His ultimate dream is to launch a small, independent design studio with a focus on adaptive technology for the elderly, a tribute to the parents who sacrificed everything for his future. To Minh, San Francisco is not just a city; it\u2019s the shoreline where his new life began, a place of constant reinvention that mirrors his own."

He was seven, on the linoleum floor of their San Jose apartment. He traced the silent hands with his finger, trying to will the tiny, intricate gears to move again. It wasn't just a machine; it was a fragment of a lost world. In that moment, he didn\u2019t just want to fix the watch; he wanted to understand how to mend what was broken. It was the beginning of his life\u2019s work.\n\n2. His mother\u2019s hands, late one night in the mid-80s. She was trying to open a can of condensed milk with a flimsy, skipping opener, her knuckles white with effort after a 12-hour shift on the assembly line. He felt a hot surge of frustration\u2014not at her, but at the tool that failed her. Good design, he realized then, wasn\u2019t about beauty. It was about dignity. It was about creating things that didn\u2019t add to the world's exhaustion, but eased it. That night, his path was set.\n\n3. One foggy morning in 2005, the N Judah rumbled through the Sunset tunnel. The world outside was a milky blur. Inside, a musician tuned her cello, a student slept with their head against the glass. Minh sketched the elegant curve of the cello\u2019s neck. He felt a profound sense of peace, of belonging. This wasn't a commute; it was a moving diorama of shared, quiet purpose. He wasn't just going to work; he was part of the city\u2019s intricate, beautiful clockwork, a place he finally called home.\n\n4. It was the rhythmic sound of dried pinto beans tumbling into a plastic bin at the SF-Marin Food Bank. He looked up from his task and saw Leo, a teacher, laughing as a few beans escaped his scoop. Their eyes met over the mountain of donated food. There was no grand conversation, just a shared smile and a simple, immediate understanding. In a place dedicated to fulfilling a basic need, he\u2019d found one of his own. It was a connection built not on words, but on a quiet act of service.\n\n5. Last year, a young designer from Oakland showed him her portfolio. She was first-generation, and her work was full of elegant solutions for her grandmother\u2019s arthritis. In her hesitant explanations, Minh heard his own youthful voice\u2014the same desperate mix of ambition and fear. It was more than a portfolio review; it was looking at a reflection across time. At that moment, his dream of a studio for adaptive technology felt less like an ambition and more like a responsibility he was finally ready for."
