Her 0.0-mile commute is the ten steps from her small downstairs bedroom to the kitchen to begin her day. At 31, she is the full-time, live-in Certified Nursing Assistant for an 88-year-old man named Arthur, whose world has shrunk to his bed, a television, and her steady presence.\n\nBorn and raised in the Sunset District, Mei is the only daughter of hardworking Toisanese immigrants who ran a small laundromat. She was a bright, artistic student who dreamed beyond the steam and folding tables. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially pursuing graphic design, her sketchbooks filled with vibrant cityscapes. However, two years in, her beloved grandmother\u2019s health rapidly declined. As her parents worked grueling hours, the responsibility of care fell to Mei. She put her education on hold, a temporary pause that became permanent after her grandmother passed away a year later.\n\nThe experience, while derailing her artistic dreams, revealed a deep well of patience and compassion within her. Becoming a CNA felt like a practical, noble path forward. Her career became a series of live-in positions, offering stability but demanding the sacrifice of her personal space and freedom.\n\nMei\u2019s social life is fragmented, lived through FaceTime calls with her parents in Oakland and texts with a few old college friends whose lives of travel and promotions feel a world away. Her daily routine is a quiet rhythm of medications, meal preparations, and reading aloud to Arthur. In her precious few hours of downtime, she doesn't sketch anymore. Instead, she studies online, slowly chipping away at prerequisites for a nursing program.\n\nHer hope is not to reclaim her old dream but to build a new one. She meticulously saves her income, picturing a day when she can afford a small studio of her own. Her ultimate aspiration is to become a Registered Nurse, to have a career, a commute, and a front door key that is hers alone. From Arthur\u2019s window, she watches the city live and breathe, patiently waiting for the day she can fully rejoin it."
