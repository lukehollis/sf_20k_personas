Born in Daly City to first-generation immigrants, Rafi grew up in the back of a bustling catering kitchen. His parents, who poured their life savings into their business, envisioned a future for him in business or tech\u2014a stable path far from the uncertainties they had known. But Rafi\u2019s focus shifted during his junior year of high school.\n\nThe turning point was watching his younger brother, Leo, struggle with a crippling anxiety disorder. He saw his parents\u2019 confusion and fear as they tried to navigate a mental health system that felt alien to them. Rafi became the family\u2019s bridge, translating medical jargon and advocating for culturally sensitive care. This experience ignited a quiet but fierce passion within him. Instead of a four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Social and Behavioral Sciences\u2014the most direct path to helping families like his own.\n\nNow, at 24, Rafi works as a Behavioral Health Technician, supporting children with developmental and behavioral challenges within the San Francisco Unified School District. His $58,000 salary makes life in the city a constant exercise in budgeting. He shares a cramped but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond with two other friends, a 5.1-mile bus ride from his work.\n\nHis days are a structured routine of patience and empathy. His commute is his sanctuary, a time to decompress with headphones on, watching the city slide by. Evenings are for simple pleasures: cooking meals that remind him of home, exploring the food markets on Clement Street, or taking long walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head.\n\nWhile proud of his work, Rafi feels the pull of what\u2019s next. He is diligently saving, aspiring to return to school for a Bachelor's, and eventually a Master's in Social Work. His ultimate dream is to create a nonprofit that provides mental health resources specifically for Asian immigrant families, ensuring no one feels as lost as his family once did. For Rafi, San Francisco isn't about glamor or wealth; it's the community he serves and the home he is determined to make better."

The doctor spoke of \u201ccognitive behavioral therapy,\u201d and Rafi saw the words float right past his parents\u2019 worried faces. He took a breath and began translating, not just the language, but the entire concept, softening the clinical jargon into gentle Indonesian. In that moment, he felt the weight of being a bridge for his family. It wasn\u2019t a burden, but a purpose, clarifying his entire future away from business and toward healing. This was the day his life\u2019s mission began.\n\n2.\nHis CCSF sociology professor was dissecting the concept of \u201ccultural competency\u201d in social work. She described, with perfect accuracy, the systemic barriers his own family had faced with Leo\u2014the shame, the language gaps, the lack of trust. Rafi felt a profound, validating click in his chest. He wasn't taking an easy route; he was on the most direct, necessary path. This academic validation of his lived experience erased any doubt about his choice, solidifying his resolve to pursue social work with pride and conviction. It was a memory from his first semester.\n\n3.\nLast year, a nonverbal seven-year-old he worked with had a breakthrough. After weeks of patient modeling, the boy, who usually resisted transitions with frantic energy, calmly pointed to a picture on the schedule Rafi had made for him, then quietly took Rafi\u2019s hand. A wave of overwhelming, silent victory washed over Rafi. It was the first tangible proof that his quiet, steady empathy could build trust and create safety. It was the feeling he\u2019d been chasing since he first saw the fear in his own brother\u2019s eyes.\n\n4.\nCooking *rendang* in his tiny Inner Richmond kitchen last winter, the apartment filled with the aroma of lemongrass and coconut milk. His two roommates, drawn by the smell, sat at their small table, genuinely excited. Sharing the food of his childhood, the food his parents built a life on, felt like an act of profound self-definition. He wasn't just surviving in the city; he was bringing the most vibrant part of his heritage into his new, independent life, creating his own version of home, one fragrant dish at a time.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after a draining day, he was on the 38-Geary heading home. Rain streaked the windows, blurring the neon signs on Clement. With his headphones creating a private world, he watched the city\u2019s anonymous, everyday shuffle\u2014an elderly woman with her grocery bags, a student nodding off over a textbook. He felt a deep, peaceful sense of belonging. He wasn\u2019t a tourist or a tech titan; he was part of this. This commute, his sanctuary, reaffirmed that an ordinary life dedicated to this community was its own reward."
