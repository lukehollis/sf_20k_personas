Born in the Richmond District to first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store, she was named to sound unequivocally American, a parental hope for an easier path. Sarah grew up amidst the scent of produce and the constant hum of her parents\u2019 hard work, internalizing their relentless drive.\n\nHer path seemed set when she enrolled at San Francisco State to study business. However, during her sophomore year, her father suffered a major heart attack, forcing her to drop out and help her mother run the family store. The temporary measure became a years-long detour. After her father passed and her mother sold the business, Sarah, now in her mid-twenties with practical experience but no degree, found a job at a stylish retail boutique.\n\nShe discovered an unexpected passion for the work. Sarah had a keen eye for merchandising and a warm, disarming presence that turned browsers into loyal customers. She worked her way up from sales associate to assistant manager, and finally, to store manager. The owner, nearing retirement, valued her so much that they offered her the small apartment above the shop as part of her compensation, creating her zero-mile commute.\n\nNow 41, Sarah is a fixture in her neighborhood. Her life is a predictable rhythm: unlocking the shop door at 10 a.m., chatting with regulars, managing inventory, and retreating upstairs in the evening. While she has many friendly acquaintances, her demanding schedule has left little room for deep personal relationships.\n\nLately, a quiet but persistent dream has taken root. Sarah aspires to buy the boutique from its owner. She envisions rebranding it slightly, curating it with her own unique taste, and finally building something that is entirely hers. It\u2019s not about wealth, but about reclaiming the ambition she set aside two decades ago. For Sarah, San Francisco is more than a city; it is the container for a life of duty, one she is finally ready to reshape into a life of her own design."
