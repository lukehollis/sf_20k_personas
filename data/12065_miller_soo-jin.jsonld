Raised by pragmatic parents who ran a small electronics shop, she was taught the value of stability and diligence over grand, artistic pursuits. Her world was orderly, predictable, and deeply rooted in community.\n\nHer life's definitive turning point came at 25 when she met Mark Miller, a warm, charismatic American teaching English in her city. Their romance was a whirlwind, and within two years, she married him and moved to his hometown of San Francisco. Facing the challenge of building a life in a new country, Soo-Jin adopted her parents\u2019 practical mindset. She pursued an Associate's degree in Health Information Technology, seeing it as the fastest, most reliable path to a stable career.\n\nShe found that stability as a Patient Support Specialist at a large healthcare provider. For over a decade, her role has been to translate the chaos of medical services into clean, manageable data, ensuring patients\u2019 educational and support resources are properly tracked. It\u2019s a job that suits her methodical nature, but one that keeps the human element at an arm's length, filtered through a screen.\n\nNow 39 and amicably divorced from Mark for five years, Soo-Jin has carved out a quiet existence in the Inner Richmond. Her days follow a comforting rhythm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by the 5.5-mile commute on the Muni bus where she listens to history podcasts, a full day of digital organization, and evenings spent perfecting her homemade kimchi recipe. Her social circle is small but tight\u2014a few colleagues and neighbors from the Korean market on Clement Street.\n\nWhile her $78,000 income affords her a comfortable, if modest, life, a quiet dream has begun to take root. Soo-Jin feels a growing disconnect between her screen-based work and her desire for tangible creation. She aspires to one day leave the administrative world behind and open a small, modern Korean tea and pottery shop\u2014a space of warmth and artistry that feels a world away from digital records. For now, she\u2019s saving diligently and has enrolled in a weekend ceramics class, her hands finally covered in clay, shaping a future that feels truly her own."

The scent wasn't the sea and fish markets, but eucalyptus and damp earth. A wave of profound foreignness washed over her, a feeling of being both anchored to Mark and completely adrift. It was in that moment she knew her parents\u2019 pragmatism was the only tool she had to build a life here. It wasn\u2019t a dream; it was a project.\n\n2.\nAt 34, they signed the divorce papers not in a grim office, but at a cafe on Clement Street, a shared pot of tea between them. There were no tears, just a quiet, mutual sadness. Soo-Jin remembers the finality of her pen stroke, the gentle squeeze Mark gave her hand, and walking home alone. The grief was real, but beneath it was the unnerving, exhilarating feeling of a blank page. She had learned endings didn\u2019t have to be failures; they could simply be endings.\n\n3.\nA few years ago, she was meticulously logging support resources for a pediatric patient file. The data was clean, the codes perfect. Then she saw a tiny, administrative side note: \"Loves to draw horses.\" The detail struck her with a physical ache. She was organizing chaos, but completely removed from the small, human joys within it. The disconnect felt vast and hollow, solidifying her desperate need to create something tangible, something that could hold warmth instead of just data.\n\n4.\nSoon after the divorce, feeling adrift, she stepped into the Korean market on a Saturday. The sharp, fermented scent of gochujang and the murmur of her mother tongue were overwhelming. She watched two older women argue playfully over the best cabbage for kimchi, their Busan dialect a sudden, forgotten music. She felt a profound sense of homecoming, a grounding in this small corner of the city. It was the first time San Francisco felt like it could truly be hers, not just a place she lived.\n\n5.\nLast month, in her first ceramics class, she centered the lump of clay on the wheel. The instructor's voice faded as her hands sank into the cool, spinning earth. It was messy, unpredictable, and entirely real. For the first time in over a decade, her hands weren't just typing; they were shaping, creating, and feeling. A jolt of pure joy ran through her\u2014a grounding sensation that no spreadsheet could ever provide. This, she knew, was the beginning of her real life."
