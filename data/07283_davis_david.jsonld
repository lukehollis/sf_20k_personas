            "value": "David Davis was a product of a stable but emotionally reserved Midwest upbringing in suburban Ohio. The defining event of his youth was his mother's long, difficult battle with cancer. He witnessed firsthand how the institutional coldness of healthcare could overshadow compassionate care, a realization that planted the seed for his future. While his friends pursued business and engineering, David was drawn to the humanities, earning an undergraduate degree in sociology before moving west, lured by the progressive reputation of UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Social Welfare, where he earned his MSW.\n\nFor two decades, David worked on the front lines of San Francisco\u2019s healthcare system, primarily at a busy public hospital. He was a master of emotional triage, helping families navigate devastating diagnoses, addiction, and the bureaucratic labyrinth of end-of-life care. He absorbed the city\u2019s pain daily, and by his mid-40s, was suffering from profound burnout. The COVID-19 pandemic, while a global tragedy, became his personal turning point. The mandated shift to telehealth opened a new possibility. When the world reopened, David chose to stay remote, transitioning his practice to a fully virtual model.\n\nNow, at 49, his commute is the ten steps from his kitchen to the spare bedroom of his Outer Sunset apartment. His life is framed by the fog rolling in off Ocean Beach, where he walks each morning to clear his head before opening a digital window into human crisis. He lives a quiet, solitary life, maintaining a small circle of friends\u2014a nurse, a therapist\u2014who understand the psychic weight of the work. His connection to San Francisco is intensely private; he rarely ventures downtown, finding his peace on the city\u2019s quiet, western edge.\n\nDavid\u2019s aspirations are modest. He doesn\u2019t dream of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014the ability to continue his vital work without sacrificing his own well-being. He hopes to one day find a long-term partner who understands his need for quiet decompression and, perhaps, to finally write down the anonymized stories he carries, not as case files, but as testaments to the resilience he witnesses every day."
