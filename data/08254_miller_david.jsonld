He grew up in a working-class suburb of Cleveland, a world away from the Pacific fog and artisanal ingredients that now define his life. His father, a factory foreman, pushed him toward a \"sensible\" path, so David enrolled in a community college business program. He lasted three semesters. The world of balance sheets felt colorless and abstract compared to the visceral, high-stakes ballet of a busy restaurant.\n\nHis turning point came when he took a job as a dishwasher to pay the bills. He was mesmerized by the kitchen's controlled chaos, the sharp commands of the chef, and the miraculous transformation of raw goods into art. He dropped out of college, working his way up from dishwasher to prep cook, absorbing every technique. In his late twenties, lured by the burgeoning farm-to-table movement, he moved to San Francisco with two knives and $800.\n\nDavid\u2019s career was a classic SF culinary grind. He sharpened his skills in demanding kitchens in North Beach and the Mission, earning a reputation for his intense focus and innovative palate. His personal life, however, bore the cost. A marriage crumbled under the weight of 16-hour days; his ex-wife once said the restaurant was a mistress she couldn't compete with.\n\nNow, at 52, David is the Executive Chef at a chic boutique hotel in Hayes Valley, living in a small, modern apartment on the top floor. His commute is a 30-second elevator ride. His world is a 500-foot radius: the kitchen, the farmer\u2019s market, and the local coffee shop. His brigade is his family\u2014he is a tough but respected mentor, seeing his younger self in their ambitious eyes. His dream is no longer about chasing accolades, but about legacy. He hopes to one day open a small, simple eatery in Sonoma, a place where he can cook for the pure joy of it, finally balancing the art with the life."
