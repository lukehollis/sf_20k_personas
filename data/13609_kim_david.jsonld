The only child of a Korean couple who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Daly City, David grew up witnessing the power of community firsthand. He saw how his parents supported other families and, in turn, were supported by them. This foundation of mutual aid, contrasted with the systemic barriers they faced, ignited his passion for social justice.\n\nHe attended UC Berkeley, choosing Social Work over more lucrative paths, a decision that worried his practical-minded parents but felt deeply right to him. His early career was spent as a frontline caseworker in the Tenderloin, a trial-by-fire that exhausted him but sharpened his resolve. A key turning point came during the 2008 recession when he watched funding for a beloved after-school program evaporate overnight, leaving dozens of kids with nowhere to go. It was then he realized he could have a greater impact by managing programs and fighting for their stability from within.\n\nNow, as a Program Manager for a community health nonprofit, David is the bridge between on-the-ground needs and bureaucratic realities. His days are a mix of grant writing, strategic planning, and mentoring younger social workers. He lives in the Inner Richmond with his partner of fifteen years, Clara, a public school art teacher. Their life is a comfortable, intentional one, built on shared values rather than material wealth.\n\nDavid\u2019s 2.5-mile bicycle commute is a daily ritual, a moment of peace as he cuts through the morning fog of Golden Gate Park. He feels deeply connected to his neighborhood\u2019s unpretentious vibe, from the dumpling shops on Clement Street to the quiet residential blocks. His primary aspiration isn\u2019t climbing a career ladder but securing a major multi-year grant to launch a permanent mental health initiative for underserved teens. He dreams of creating something lasting, a safety net woven so tightly it won\u2019t unravel when the next crisis hits, honoring the community that first taught him the meaning of care."

He remembers the weight in their small apartment until Mrs. Santos from next door brought over a steaming pot of sinigang. In that moment, watching his tired father accept the sour, comforting soup with a grateful bow, David understood. Community wasn\u2019t a concept; it was a warm meal that filled their kitchen, a shared burden. It planted the seed of a life built on reciprocal care.\n\n2.\nHe can still feel the silence that fell over the dinner table when he told his parents he was choosing Social Work. It wasn\u2019t anger; it was the heavier weight of their loving fear for him, for his future. Looking at his father\u2019s calloused hands, he knew they saw his choice as a rejection of their hard-earned stability. But for David, it was the first time his life\u2019s purpose felt clear and sharp, a quiet inward vow that solidified his own path, distinct from the one they\u2019d dreamed for him.\n\n3.\nThe burnout from his first year as a Tenderloin caseworker was a physical ache. Then, a seven-year-old girl in his caseload, Maya, shyly handed him a crayon drawing of two stick figures holding hands under a wobbly sun. \"That's you and me,\" she\u2019d whispered. The simple, profound gesture cut through his exhaustion. It reminded him that his work wasn't about fixing vast, broken systems, but about the monumental importance of holding one small hand, of being a steady presence in the storm.\n\n4.\nIt was 2008. The meeting was short, the language bureaucratic: \"\u2026due to budget shortfalls, the program is terminated.\" He didn't feel sad; he felt a cold, hard rage. He pictured the kids who would have nowhere to go at 3 p.m. the next day. His direct-service work suddenly felt like trying to patch a bursting dam with his thumbs. It was a moment of painful clarity: he didn\u2019t just need to help people falling through the cracks; he had to fight to seal the cracks themselves.\n\n5.\nOne Saturday afternoon a few years ago, after a grueling week of grant writing, he sat in their quiet Inner Richmond apartment watching Clara. She was hunched over her table, meticulously gluing together a ceramic bird one of her students had broken, her focus absolute. No words were exchanged, but a profound peace settled over him. This was the life they had built: not of wealth, but of quiet dedication and shared acts of mending. It was the ultimate, sustainable comfort."
