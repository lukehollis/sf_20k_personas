Growing up, he was the steady older brother to Maya, whose adolescence was a tempest of severe anxiety and an eating disorder that bewildered their well-meaning but ill-equipped parents. Caleb became the family\u2019s unintentional mediator and Maya\u2019s staunchest ally, learning firsthand how a lack of accessible mental health resources could fracture a family. This formative experience became his compass.\n\nAfter earning a sociology degree from UC Davis, he moved to San Francisco for his Master of Social Work, drawn to the city's complex social fabric and progressive ethos. He found his calling working for a nonprofit that partners with the San Francisco Unified School District, providing counseling to high school students in the Mission District. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Caleb navigates the turbulent worlds of adolescents grappling with everything from academic pressure to housing instability. The work is emotionally taxing but affirms his purpose daily.\n\nHis life is structured by routine. Each morning, Caleb walks from his small Inner Sunset apartment, grabbing a coffee before catching a crowded N-Judah streetcar for his 2.8-mile commute. The ride offers a cross-section of the city he serves\u2014a stark contrast to the quiet, fog-laced streets of his neighborhood. After work, he decompresses by running through Golden Gate Park or cooking with his close-knit group of friends, most of whom he met in grad school. Recently single after a three-year relationship ended, he leans heavily on this chosen family.\n\nCaleb feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014a city of both immense opportunity and glaring inequality. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. He aspires to one day develop a specialized mental health program for LGBTQ+ youth, a demographic he sees as particularly underserved. For now, he finds fulfillment in the small victories: the student who graduates against all odds, the family that learns to communicate. He hopes to find a partner who understands his demanding career and, perhaps one day, make a permanent home in the city that both challenges and defines him."

He could hear her ragged sobs but didn\u2019t knock, a silent sentry against the helplessness their parents felt. A quiet fury built in him\u2014not at her, but at a world that offered no answers. In that hallway, his protective instinct hardened into a life\u2019s purpose. He knew he would find the tools and the language that his family, and so many others, desperately needed.\n\n2.\nHis first month of grad school, he stood on a packed N-Judah streetcar, wedged between a construction worker and a tech employee. He watched the Mission's murals flash by and the downtown towers emerge from fog. It was a chaotic, beautiful symphony of lives colliding. He felt impossibly small yet part of something vast and vital. In that moment, the city wasn't just a place he\u2019d moved to; it was the place he was meant to be, a puzzle he was now committed to understanding.\n\n3.\nLast spring, he watched Javier, a student he\u2019d worked with for two years through housing crises and family deportations, walk across the graduation stage. When Javier spotted him in the crowd, he broke into a wide, brilliant smile and gave a solid thumbs-up. Caleb felt a lump form in his throat, a mix of profound pride and relief. All the late nights and frustrating sessions dissolved into that one affirming gesture. This was why he did the work. This was everything.\n\n4.\nThe night his three-year relationship ended, he didn't have to call. His friends just showed up at his Inner Sunset apartment with takeout containers of curry and a quiet understanding. They didn't push him to talk; they just sat with him on his worn-out couch as the fog rolled in outside, creating a safe harbor in his small living room. In his own grief, he was held by the very community he fought to build for others. It was a humbling, powerful lesson.\n\n5.\nEarlier this year, a transgender sophomore told him, \"It feels like all the programs are for someone else. I\u2019m just\u2026 here.\" The student\u2019s quiet resignation hit Caleb harder than any loud crisis ever had. He saw a glaring gap in the safety net, a reflection of his own sister's loneliness in a new context. That afternoon, walking home through Golden Gate Park, his vague ambition sharpened into a concrete mission. He wouldn't just help the kids in front of him; he would build a space for them."
