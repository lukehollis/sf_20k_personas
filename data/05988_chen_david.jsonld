The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up in the Sunset District, where the Pacific\u2019s salty air was a constant presence. His father, a stoic engineer, and his mother, a garment factory worker, instilled in him a profound sense of duty and a relentless work ethic. A formative childhood memory was seeing a shoreline at Ocean Beach littered with refuse and iridescent oil slicks after a storm, an image of desecrated beauty that planted the seed for his future career.\n\nThis early environmental consciousness guided his academic path. He earned his undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from UC Berkeley and, driven to bridge the gap between science and policy, pursued a Master's in Environmental Management at Stanford. His career began in the trenches as a field analyst, taking soil samples from contaminated Bay Area industrial sites. Over two decades, David methodically climbed the ladder, his sharp organizational skills and calm demeanor making him a natural project manager. He now coordinates complex environmental remediation and corporate sustainability projects from his home office.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce ten years ago. The split, amicable but painful, was partly a casualty of his demanding career. It forced him into a period of introspection, leading him to cultivate a quieter, more deliberate life. He now resides in a minimalist condo in Noe Valley. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a structured routine: an early morning walk to a local cafe for coffee, hours of focused work managing teams across different time zones, and evenings spent cooking or listening to jazz.\n\nDavid remains deeply connected to the city. He visits his aging parents in the Sunset every Sunday, a ritual of filial piety and connection to his roots. While he enjoys a small circle of friends, he often feels a quiet solitude. His ultimate dream is to lead a landmark project\u2014perhaps a large-scale water reclamation system for the Bay Area\u2014that would leave a tangible, positive legacy. In his quiet moments, looking out over the city lights, David reflects on his journey: a son of immigrants, now a guardian of the very environment that shaped him, trying to heal the city he has always called home."
