Raised in the quiet, tree-lined suburbs of Portland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and a civil engineer father, her childhood was a blend of organized systems and narrative curiosity. She was the kid who categorized her books by genre and publication date but also got lost in their stories for hours. This duality led her not to computer science, but to Stanford for a Master's degree in Cognitive Science, where she became fascinated with using computational models to understand the messy, unpredictable patterns of human decision-making.\n\nHer transition into the tech industry was almost accidental. An internship revealed that the corporate world had far larger and more interesting datasets than academia. She found a strange beauty in predicting user behavior, in finding the elegant signal within the noise of millions of clicks. Now a Senior Data Scientist, she has built a successful career by translating human impulses into actionable data.\n\nA key turning point was her company\u2019s permanent shift to remote work two years ago. This solidified her relationship with her apartment in Cole Valley, which transformed from a home into a self-contained universe. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are a structured, solitary ritual: a pour-over coffee from The Grind, a morning stand-up on Slack, and hours of focused work punctuated by a walk through the eucalyptus groves of Golden Gate Park. She knows the baristas and bakers on Cole Street better than most of her colleagues.\n\nLately, however, the patterns have started to feel hollow. A recent, amicable breakup left a quiet echo in her meticulously organized apartment. At 35, she finds herself yearning for a narrative beyond optimizing user engagement. Her quiet aspiration is to pivot, to apply her skills to a problem with more tangible human impact\u2014urban planning, public health, or climate resilience. She hopes to one day use her command of data not just to understand San Francisco, but to help build a better version of it, finding a deeper, more meaningful pattern for her own life in the process."
