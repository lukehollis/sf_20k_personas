            "value": "Mei Ling Wong\u2019s first map of San Francisco wasn\u2019t one of streets, but of the scents and sounds of Chinatown. Raised in a cramped but lively apartment above a Portsmouth Square alley, she was the only child of immigrants who measured their lives in labor. Her father was a line cook whose hands always smelled of ginger and soy sauce, while her mother\u2019s fingers were perpetually pricked from her work as a seamstress in a small garment factory.\n\nMei Ling\u2019s own path diverged from the expected academic route in her junior year of high school. When her father suffered a debilitating stroke, the family\u2019s fragile income collapsed. Mei Ling dropped out to work full-time, taking shifts at a bakery and a boba shop to help make rent. She later earned her GED through night classes, a quiet testament to her resilience. For years, she felt stuck, a satellite orbiting the neighborhood she grew up in. The turning point came from an uncle who worked for the city. \"Muni is hiring,\" he'd said. \"It's a union job. Stable.\"\n\nThe stability was life-changing. Training was rigorous, but Mei Ling discovered a hidden aptitude for navigating the city\u2019s chaotic streets and a surprising patience for its diverse populace. Now, at 35, her life runs on the Muni schedule. She lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Richmond District, a neighborhood that feels like a calmer, more spacious version of her childhood home. Her mornings start before dawn, her commute a short bus ride to the depot to begin her own route.\n\nShe\u2019s a solitary figure, but not a lonely one. Her social circle consists of a few other drivers and her mother, for whom she is the primary caregiver. From the driver\u2019s seat of her bus, Mei Ling possesses a unique understanding of San Francisco. She\u2019s part of its circulatory system, watching the city wake, work, and sleep through her panoramic window. Her dreams are grounded in the security she never had as a child: to one day buy a small condo in the Sunset, take her mother on a vacation to Hawaii, and eventually travel to a place where someone else is doing the driving."
