Raised in a working-class suburb of Sacramento, he was the son of a mechanic who taught him to respect machinery. David was never academic; he was a tactile learner who spent high school sketching in notebooks and tracing the logos on band t-shirts, fascinated by how images were made. In 1991, at age 18, he followed a punk band to San Francisco, escaping a future he felt was already written for him.\n\nHe landed in a grittier, pre-tech-boom city, finding work sweeping floors at a small letterpress shop in the Mission. It was there, amidst the rhythmic clamor of the press and the meticulous process of setting type, that he found his calling. The shop's owner, a gruff old printer named Gus, saw David\u2019s quiet intensity and took him on as an apprentice. College was never in the cards; the print shop was his university.\n\nThe pivotal moment came in the late 90s when Gus retired. Using a small inheritance, David bought the shop\u2019s prized Heidelberg press and moved it to a cavernous live-work loft in the Dogpatch, then a forgotten industrial waterfront. That loft is still his home and studio. His 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from his mattress on the mezzanine down to the concrete floor where the press dominates the space.\n\nDavid is a respected, if somewhat solitary, figure in the city\u2019s art scene. A brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably; the press, with its constant demands, was always his primary partner. Now, his most enduring relationships are with the artists and designers who seek him out for his skill, creating limited-edition posters and art books.\n\nHis daily routine is a ritual of coffee, calibration, and creation. He laments the condos that have replaced the warehouses around him but remains a fixture, a tangible link to San Francisco's creative past. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth or fame, but of continuity. He hopes to one day find a young apprentice to pass the craft to, ensuring the weight and texture of real ink on paper survives in a city consumed by the digital glow."

He stopped, wiped his hands on a rag, and handed David a single lead character: a heavy, cool capital 'A'. It felt ancient and full of purpose in his palm, more real than any sketchbook drawing. In that moment, chasing a band felt like a childhood game; holding that 'A' felt like grabbing onto the rest of his life. This happened in 1991, his first week at the Mission shop.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAfter Gus left, the shop was unnervingly quiet. The check from his inheritance was gone, and the Heidelberg press stood before him, inert and massive. It was his now. He ran a hand over its cold iron flank, the same way his father touched a car engine. It wasn't just machinery; it was a legacy. The fear was a current under his skin, but a deeper feeling of profound responsibility settled in his bones. That day in the late 90s, he stopped being an apprentice forever.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe riggers had gone. Dust motes danced in the single beam of light cutting through the cavernous Dogpatch loft. The Heidelberg sat perfectly centered on the concrete. He gave its base a final push, and the resulting metallic *thump* echoed in the vast, empty space. That sound was the period at the end of a long sentence. It wasn't just a machine in a room; it was the anchor for his entire world. That evening in the late 90s, as the fog rolled in, he finally felt planted.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt wasn\u2019t a fight. He and Emily were sitting on the edge of the mezzanine, looking down at the press. She asked what he dreamed of. He tried to describe a future with her, but his eyes kept drifting to the moonlight glinting off the Heidelberg\u2019s flywheel. He realized his dream was already there, made of iron and ink. The gentle sadness in her nod told him she knew it too. This quiet moment in his thirties wasn\u2019t a failure, but an honest admission of where his heart lived.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe was calibrating the press when the floor began to tremble. Not from his machine, but from outside. He watched from his window as a wrecking ball tore into the old cannery across the street, a place that had always been there. Each impact felt like a personal blow, erasing a piece of the city he knew. It was then that the vague lament for the past sharpened into a fierce, urgent need: he had to find someone. He had to teach them before it was all just a memory."
