Raised in a working-class suburb of Sacramento, he was the son of a mechanic who taught him to respect machinery. David was never academic; he was a tactile learner who spent high school sketching in notebooks and tracing the logos on band t-shirts, fascinated by how images were made. In 1991, at age 18, he followed a punk band to San Francisco, escaping a future he felt was already written for him.\n\nHe landed in a grittier, pre-tech-boom city, finding work sweeping floors at a small letterpress shop in the Mission. It was there, amidst the rhythmic clamor of the press and the meticulous process of setting type, that he found his calling. The shop's owner, a gruff old printer named Gus, saw David\u2019s quiet intensity and took him on as an apprentice. College was never in the cards; the print shop was his university.\n\nThe pivotal moment came in the late 90s when Gus retired. Using a small inheritance, David bought the shop\u2019s prized Heidelberg press and moved it to a cavernous live-work loft in the Dogpatch, then a forgotten industrial waterfront. That loft is still his home and studio. His 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from his mattress on the mezzanine down to the concrete floor where the press dominates the space.\n\nDavid is a respected, if somewhat solitary, figure in the city\u2019s art scene. A brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably; the press, with its constant demands, was always his primary partner. Now, his most enduring relationships are with the artists and designers who seek him out for his skill, creating limited-edition posters and art books.\n\nHis daily routine is a ritual of coffee, calibration, and creation. He laments the condos that have replaced the warehouses around him but remains a fixture, a tangible link to San Francisco's creative past. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth or fame, but of continuity. He hopes to one day find a young apprentice to pass the craft to, ensuring the weight and texture of real ink on paper survives in a city consumed by the digital glow."
