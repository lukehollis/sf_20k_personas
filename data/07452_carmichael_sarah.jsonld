Raised in a practical, middle-class family with a contractor father and a schoolteacher mother, she was encouraged to be diligent and grounded. Her escape was literature, which led her to UC Davis to pursue a B.A. in English. She loved the world of ideas and narratives but graduated in the late 2000s feeling creatively rich and professionally adrift.\n\nHer early twenties in San Francisco were a patchwork of coffee shop jobs and shared apartments in the Outer Sunset. The turning point came when a friend got her a low-level administrative job at a burgeoning tech startup. While she had no interest in coding, she discovered a natural talent for organization and communication. She could translate the chaotic brilliance of the engineers into clear, actionable plans for the marketing team. This knack for orchestration was her true calling. Over the next decade, she methodically built a career, moving from coordinator to associate and finally to a respected Project Manager at a larger tech firm.\n\nNow 37, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her sunny Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step journey from her bedroom to her standing desk. Her days are a structured rhythm of Slack notifications, video conferences, and digital Gantt charts. To break the monotony, she takes long midday runs through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her head and connects her to the city\u2019s natural beauty. Her social life is her chosen family: a tight-knit group of friends from different phases of her life. They gather for weekend hikes in Marin, dinners in the Mission, and wine nights dissecting work, life, and relationships.\n\nDespite her professional success, a quiet restlessness persists. The English major in her still yearns for a different kind of project. Sarah dreams of one day leaving tech behind to open a small, curated bookstore and caf\u00e9 in her neighborhood\u2014a third space where stories, not software sprints, are the main currency, and community is built over coffee and conversation, not code."
