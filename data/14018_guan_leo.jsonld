Born and raised in the Richmond District, he is the son of Chinese immigrants who ran a small corner grocery store, their lives a testament to relentless work and quiet sacrifice. Growing up, Leo was never drawn to academics; his report cards were a landscape of C\u2019s, but his hands were always busy, fixing bicycles, building models, and deconstructing old radios.\n\nHis turning point came in a high school shop class, where the logic of a lathe and the creative potential locked within a block of metal felt more real than any textbook. While his peers aimed for UC schools, Leo enrolled in a machining vocational program at City College. There, he discovered a natural talent for spatial reasoning and precision. He began his career in a small Bayview workshop, learning on old-school manual mills, his craft honed by feel and experience.\n\nAs the industry shifted, Leo adapted. He saw the coming wave of automation not as a threat, but as a new tool. He took night classes to master Computer Numerical Control (CNC) programming, eventually becoming the most reliable machinist at his company. His promotion to CNC Machinist Lead was a quiet validation of his journey\u2014a testament to his foresight and mastery of both the old and new ways of making things.\n\nNow 43, Leo\u2019s life follows a steady rhythm. He wakes before the sun in the same modest house his parents bought, catches the 29-bus for the 4.8-mile commute to his manufacturing job in Dogpatch, and spends his days overseeing projects that demand tolerances measured in thousandths of an inch. A divorced father, his world revolves around his 15-year-old daughter, Emily. His $95,000 income, strained by the city\u2019s cost of living, is funneled primarily towards her future.\n\nLeo is a quiet observer of the new San Francisco, a city of tech wealth that feels worlds away from his tangible reality of steel and coolant. His dream isn\u2019t a startup exit, but to see Emily get the college education he didn't, and perhaps one day, to buy a small, used CNC machine for his garage to start a side business making custom parts. He is the city\u2019s working heart, a man whose skill built parts of the world around him, forever connected to San Francisco not by its glamour, but by its foundational grit."

He watched his father\u2019s precise, calloused hands stacking cans of dace into a perfect pyramid, a silent lesson in order and repetition. He didn\u2019t understand their exhaustion then, only the quiet dignity in their physical work. That memory cemented his belief that true value was something you could hold, something built with steady hands, not just words on a page.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, the high school metal shop was his sanctuary. He remembers the first time the instructor let him use the manual lathe. The low hum of the machine, the smell of cutting oil, the focus required to turn a rough aluminum block into a perfectly smooth, gleaming cylinder. As the metal shavings spiraled away, so did his academic anxiety. In that moment of creation, he felt a profound sense of competence and clarity\u2014a feeling of being truly smart for the very first time.\n\n3.\nThe day Emily was born, Leo was 28. He remembers staring at his own hands\u2014scarred and stained with grease from the shop\u2014before the nurse placed his daughter in his arms. Her tiny fingers, impossibly perfect, curled around his calloused thumb. In that instant, the purpose of his craft shifted. His skill was no longer just about shaping steel; it was now the engine that would build a life for her, a future with possibilities stretching far beyond the walls of his workshop.\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday night, he was 34, hunched over a community college computer after a full shift. The lines of G-code swam before his eyes, abstract and frustrating. Then, after weeks of trial and error, he ran his program. The CNC mill whirred to life, executing his digital commands with flawless precision, carving a complex gear from a block of steel. He didn't cheer; he just felt a quiet, profound relief. It was the moment he knew he wouldn't be left behind.\n\n5.\nJust last year, Emily was at the kitchen table, her laptop glowing. She tried to explain her physics homework to him, pointing at equations that looked like a foreign language. He didn\u2019t understand the math, but he recognized the look in her eyes\u2014the same intense, problem-solving focus he felt when calibrating a machine. A pang of pride, mixed with a little sadness, hit him. His hard, tangible work was building a world for her that was abstract and limitless, and it was entirely worth it."
