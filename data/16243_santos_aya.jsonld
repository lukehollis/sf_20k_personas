Born and raised in Daly City, the youngest child of first-generation Filipino immigrants, she grew up in a home filled with the aromas of adobo and the quiet hum of hardworking parents\u2014a nurse and a postal worker. Her path wasn't entirely her own at first; it was shaped by her younger cousin, Marco, who struggled with developmental delays. Watching an occupational therapist patiently teach Marco how to hold a pencil and navigate his sensory world planted a seed in Aya. It wasn't a career she chose from a list; it was a calling she felt in her bones.\n\nAfter earning her bachelor's at San Francisco State, she pursued her master's in Occupational Therapy, returning to the city that felt like the true center of her world. She chose to live not in her childhood suburb, but within the city itself, craving its energy and independence. Today, she works for the San Francisco Unified School District, traveling between schools to help children with a range of needs. Her days are a patient shuffle of creating adaptive strategies for handwriting, guiding sensory play, and empowering kids to participate fully in their own education.\n\nAya lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset with her partner of five years, Leo, a graphic designer. Her routine is quintessentially San Franciscan. She starts her day with coffee from a local cafe before catching the N Judah for her 3.5-mile commute, listening to podcasts on child development. Evenings are for jogs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park or cooking with Leo. Weekends are for farmer's markets and dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends.\n\nThough content, Aya dreams of opening a small, private pediatric OT clinic in the city, a space focused on sensory integration. It's a daunting financial prospect, but the thought of building something of her own, a haven for families like her cousin's, fuels her ambition. She loves her deep-rooted connection to San Francisco, but she and Leo often discuss the future\u2014whether this city that shaped her can also be a place where they can one day raise a family of their own."

An occupational therapist gently guided his fingers around a chunky pencil. When Marco finally drew a shaky, deliberate line, a quiet awe settled over Aya. It wasn't just a crayon mark; it was a connection, a bridge to the world. In that silent, powerful moment, she felt the pull of her life\u2019s purpose, a calling to build those same bridges for others. This experience planted the seed of her career.\n\n2.\nThe day she moved into her first Inner Sunset apartment, she remembered setting down a box of books and just\u2026breathing. The air smelled of fog and eucalyptus. Through the bay window, she watched the N Judah rumble past, its sound a promise of the city\u2019s rhythm. This wasn't her parents' home in Daly City; it was her own stake in the world. That feeling of exhilarating independence\u2014of choosing her own life\u2014cemented her identity as a San Franciscan, not just a visitor from a nearby suburb. It was her true beginning.\n\n3.\nLast spring, a second-grader named Mateo, who had refused to hold a pencil for months, finally picked up a weighted one she\u2019d provided. He didn't write his name, but he drew a series of careful, deliberate circles. He looked up at her and gave a small, proud nod. In that shared moment of quiet triumph, Aya felt a warmth spread through her chest. It was a potent reminder that progress isn't always loud. This single act of trust reaffirmed her commitment and the deep, invisible impact of her patient work.\n\n4.\nOn their third anniversary, Leo had packed a thermos of strong coffee and they sat on a bench overlooking Ocean Beach at dusk. As the fog rolled in, blanketing the sea, he\u2019d squeezed her hand. \"Think we'll still be doing this in twenty years?\" he'd asked quietly. The question wasn't about the future, but about the beautiful, simple present. It solidified their partnership as her anchor in the city, the steady, loving presence that made the daunting dream of raising a family here feel, for a moment, entirely possible.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, while walking in the Richmond, she saw an empty storefront with a \"For Lease\" sign. She stopped, picturing a colorful sensory gym inside, a haven for families. \"That's the kind of place,\" she'd whispered to Leo. Instead of mentioning the cost, he started sketching a possible logo on a napkin. That simple act of him joining her fantasy transformed her private ambition. It shifted the dream from a distant \"what if\" to a shared, tangible goal, making the enormous financial risks feel like a mountain they might one day climb together."
