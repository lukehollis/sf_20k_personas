Born to a sharp, intellectual Jewish-American father and a warm, vibrant mother from Mexico City, David grew up in the Mission District of the 1970s. His childhood home was a cacophony of languages, political debates, and the smell of his mother\u2019s *chiles rellenos* mingling with the musty scent of his father's academic books. He was David Cohen, but also *Davidito*\u2014a duality he carried throughout his life.\n\nRebelling against his father\u2019s academic world, David pursued a Bachelor's in Philosophy at San Francisco State University, enjoying the theory but craving tangible results. His turning point came during the first dot-com bust. While his peers in creative fields lost their jobs, David saw the city\u2019s bedrock: the land itself. He saw panic, but also opportunity. On a whim, he earned his real estate license, discovering an innate talent for navigating the complex psychology of a deal. His philosophical training made him a surprisingly astute negotiator, able to understand motivations beyond the numbers.\n\nHe poured his energy into his work, quickly moving from agent to broker, and finally founding \"Cohen Capital Properties.\" His success is embodied by his SoMa live/work loft, a sleek, modern space where his commute is a flight of stairs. This relentless drive, however, cost him his marriage a decade ago. Now, his primary relationship is with his estranged daughter, an art student at CCA, who views his profession with a familiar youthful idealism that both pains and pleases him.\n\nDavid's days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis, client calls, and walks with his rescue dog through the rapidly changing neighborhood he helped shape. At 54, he has achieved immense financial success, but a quiet restlessness pervades his solitary evenings. His dream is no longer about closing the next big deal, but about legacy. He aspires to fund a community arts foundation, a nod to his own past, and more importantly, to rebuild the fractured bridge with his daughter, hoping to prove that his life\u2019s work can build more than just a portfolio."

The air was thick with the scent of simmering mole from his mother\u2019s stove and the papery musk of his father\u2019s books. His father would be debating political theory in English, while his mother called him *Davidito*, asking him to taste the sauce in Spanish. In that small space, he felt himself split in two, a negotiation he would spend his life trying to resolve. It was the first deal he ever had to navigate.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001. Walking through a rain-slicked SoMa, he saw the ghost town the bust had created. \"For Lease\" signs hung like surrender flags on brand-new buildings. His friends mourned the death of creative gigs, but David felt a strange calm. He wasn't seeing failure; he was seeing foundation. The asphalt, the concrete, the dirt beneath it all\u2014that was real. That was the only thing you could truly own. Philosophy finally became tangible.\n\n3.\nThe fight that ended his marriage happened a decade ago, echoing in the vast emptiness of their SoMa loft. \"This isn't a home, David,\" his wife had said, gesturing at the cold, minimalist space. \"It's a portfolio piece. You live in your deal, not with me.\" Her words hit harder than any market crash. He realized he'd successfully built a monument to his ambition but had failed to build a life inside it.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, his daughter nervously showed him her new painting, a chaotic, vibrant splash of the Mission. He saw raw talent, but the broker in him took over. \"There's a developing market for this style,\" he\u2019d offered. \"We could position you...\" The light died in her eyes. He saw then that he was trying to sell her back her own soul, a transaction that would cost him everything and gain him nothing.\n\n5.\nLast year, walking his dog, he saw it: a vibrant community mural being painted over with slate gray primer. He froze, the dog\u2019s leash tight in his hand, a dull ache in his chest. He\u2019d brokered the deal for that condo building. He had traded a piece of the city's soul\u2014a piece of his own childhood\u2014for a commission. The financial win felt utterly hollow. It was then he knew he had to build something that couldn't be painted over."
