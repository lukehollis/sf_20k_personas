Adopted from Seoul, South Korea, as an infant, he was raised in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District by his loving Irish-American parents, a firefighter and a nurse. His childhood was a happy mix of Catholic school, Sunday dinners, and a profound, unspoken sense of being slightly outside the worlds he inhabited. He had his father's last name but not his features, and he felt a gentle distance from the Korean community he physically resembled but didn't culturally know.\n\nInitially, Michael tried to follow a more conventional path. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, vaguely pursuing a business degree, but felt adrift in the abstract world of economics and marketing. The turning point came during a summer job at a community center, where he was unexpectedly assigned to help with the children's art program. He discovered a natural talent for connecting with young kids, finding immense satisfaction in their unfiltered curiosity and joy. It was a quiet rebellion when he dropped out of SFSU and enrolled at City College, earning an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education.\n\nNow, at 36, Michael\u2019s life is defined by a comforting, hyper-local routine. He works as a teacher\u2019s aide at a small cooperative preschool on the ground floor of an apartment building in the Inner Richmond. He lives in a modest studio apartment on the second floor of that same building, making his commute a simple walk down a single flight of stairs. His days are a predictable rhythm of circle time, navigating minor squabbles over toy trucks, and wiping away tears. He knows all the local baristas and grocers on Clement Street by name. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status, but of stability: to one day become a lead teacher and save enough to finally visit Seoul, not to find his birth family, but simply to walk the streets and feel a connection to the other half of his story."
