            "value": "Lani Lee was born from San Francisco\u2019s fog and the fragrant steam of her parents\u2019 modest Cantonese restaurant in the Sunset District. The second-generation daughter of immigrants, her childhood was a rhythm of sizzling woks, the sharp scent of ginger, and the constant, quiet pressure to pursue a stable, respectable career. Her parents, who had poured their life savings and endless hours into their restaurant, hoped she would become a doctor or a lawyer\u2014anything but the grueling life of hospitality they knew so well.\n\nIn a quiet act of rebellion, Lani enrolled at San Francisco State University and chose to study English Literature. She lost herself in poetry and prose, believing stories were the truest form of sustenance. After graduation, facing student loans and the reality of the job market, she took a server position at a chic, upscale restaurant in North Beach, intending for it to be temporary. But the restaurant world had other plans. She discovered that a dining room had its own narrative, a nightly performance of which she was a key player. Her inherited understanding of the industry, combined with her innate ability to connect with people, saw her rise quickly from server to shift lead, and eventually to her current role as General Manager.\n\nNow 39, Lani\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of North Beach. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this; she lives in a classic bay-window apartment directly above the modern Cal-Italian restaurant she manages. Her day begins not with an alarm, but with the clatter of delivery trucks on the cobblestones below. Her life is a cycle of inventory checks, staff meetings, and the controlled chaos of the dinner rush. Her team is her found family, and her regulars are the characters in her unfolding story. A past long-term relationship crumbled under the weight of her demanding schedule, a key turning point that solidified her commitment to her career.\n\nThough she excels as a manager, Lani dreams of more. Her true aspiration is to open her own small bistro, perhaps in the Outer Richmond, closer to her roots but entirely her own vision. A place where the food tells a story\u2014a story she finally gets to write herself."
