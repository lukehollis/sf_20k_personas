Raised in a family where the Sikh principle of *seva*, or selfless service, was as fundamental as daily bread, his upbringing was steeped in community and shared responsibility. He was a bright, observant boy who earned a sociology degree from a local university, fascinated by the structures that govern human lives.\n\nAt 22, he followed an uncle to San Francisco, arriving with a crisp degree that meant little in America and a heart full of undefined ambition. His first decade was a humbling education in the city\u2019s underbelly. He drove a cab, his mind mapping the socio-economic divides of the city grid far better than any tourist map. He saw firsthand the struggles of new immigrants, the loneliness of the elderly, and the systemic barriers that his sociology textbooks had only theorized. This was his real education.\n\nThe turning point came during a long night shift. After dropping off a family at a shelter, he felt a profound pull to do more than just drive away. He began volunteering at that same shelter in the Tenderloin, initially just serving meals. His quiet competence and innate ability to de-escalate conflict and connect with residents did not go unnoticed. He was hired as a case worker, then promoted to a coordinator. His lack of an American degree was eclipsed by his surplus of lived experience.\n\nNow, at 43, Tajpreet is the Program Manager for a nonprofit providing transitional housing and services for refugees. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a small apartment within the same building, making his work and life a single, integrated existence. His day starts with mediating a dispute between residents and ends with late-night grant writing. Single, his \"family\" has become the community he serves\u2014the Afghan translator he\u2019s helping find work, the Salvadoran mother he\u2019s connecting with legal aid.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not of tourist vistas but of the resilient, gritty heart of the Tenderloin. He dreams not of wealth, but of securing enough funding to expand their services. Tajpreet Singh\u2019s aspiration is simple: to be a steady, compassionate presence in a city of constant change, ensuring that the most vulnerable always have a place to call home."
