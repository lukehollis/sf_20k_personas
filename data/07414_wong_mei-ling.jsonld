Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk down a creaky flight of stairs from her apartment to the front door of \"Golden Dragon Goods,\" the store her parents opened in the 1970s and which she now manages. Growing up, the shop was her playground, the scent of ginseng, dried mushrooms, and sweet incense the backdrop to her childhood. She was the bright, American-born daughter, destined for a life beyond its crowded aisles.\n\nThat life briefly began at San Francisco State University. For two years, she thrilled at art history lectures and the promise of a world filled with museums and galleries. But during her sophomore year, her father had a major stroke. Her mother, whose English was still limited, couldn't manage the store and his care alone. Mei-Ling dropped out, telling herself it was temporary.\n\nThe temporary became permanent. After her father passed away five years later, she made a quiet pact with his legacy. She became the store manager, her knack for organization transforming the cluttered shop into a streamlined, if still traditional, business. She knows every neighborhood regular by name and can spot a lost tourist from a block away. Her most significant relationship is with her aging mother, with whom she shares the apartment upstairs, their lives woven together by routine and shared memory.\n\nNow 45, Mei-Ling\u2019s youthful dreams are tucked away like old photographs. She feels a quiet pang when she sees students sketching in Portsmouth Square, a ghost of the woman she might have become. Yet, she is a pillar of her community, a familiar, steady presence in a rapidly changing city. Her secret hope is a small one: to one day convert the dusty back storeroom into a tiny gallery space for local artists, a corner of the block that would be entirely her own creation. It\u2019s a dream that keeps the spark of her old self alive, amidst the daily rhythm of an inherited life."
