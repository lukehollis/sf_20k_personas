Born in San Jose to second-generation Japanese-American parents\u2014an engineer father and a high school teacher mother\u2014her upbringing was one of stability and high expectations. She followed a conventional path initially, earning a communications degree from UC Davis, a choice that pleased her pragmatic parents. However, a post-college volunteer position at a crisis hotline ignited a passion she couldn\u2019t ignore. The raw, human connection she found in those calls redefined her purpose.\n\nThis revelation was her first major turning point. Against her family\u2019s gentle reservations, Sarah enrolled in the Master of Social Work (MSW) program at San Francisco State University. The city immediately felt like home. After graduation, she spent a decade as an LCSW in the demanding, high-stress environment of a major San Francisco hospital, specializing in palliative care. She witnessed immense suffering but also profound grace, work that honed her skills and deepened her empathy.\n\nThe pandemic marked her second great pivot. Burnt out from the hospital system and seeing the surging need for accessible mental health services, she took a leap of faith. In 2021, she opened her own private practice, run entirely via telehealth from a dedicated office in her Inner Richmond apartment. This explains her 0.0-mile commute. Her days are now structured by patient video calls, where she holds space for the city\u2019s unseen struggles from the calm of her own home.\n\nHer lifestyle is balanced. Mornings often begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, just blocks from her door. Afternoons are for sessions and paperwork, and evenings are for herself\u2014trying a new recipe, meeting her close-knit group of friends for dinner on Clement Street, or simply reading. Though single, she is rich in community. Sarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; she chose the city not for glamour, but for its acceptance of reinvention. Her dream is to launch a support group for healthcare workers experiencing burnout, a way of giving back to the community that shaped her. She found her calling not by following a map, but by listening to the needs of others, and in doing so, built a life of purpose in the heart of the city."
