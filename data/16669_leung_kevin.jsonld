A second-generation Chinese-American, he grew up in the quiet, residential avenues, the son of parents who ran a small laundromat on Irving Street. He learned early that the city was a complex machine of interlocking parts, often inefficient. His career path was solidified by memory: watching his mother navigate three MUNI lines daily, the long commute stealing hours from her life. He saw transportation not as a convenience, but as a matter of equity and time.\n\nThis conviction fueled his educational journey, leading him from Lowell High School to a BA at UC Berkeley and culminating in a Master's in Urban Planning. He chose to build his career within the city that shaped him, taking a position with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Now, at 31, he\u2019s a Senior Transportation Planner, analyzing data and designing routes he understands on a deeply personal level. His 1.8-mile commute from his Hayes Valley apartment to his downtown office is, for him, a point of pride\u2014a daily vote of confidence in the public system he works to improve.\n\nHis life follows a comfortable rhythm. Weekdays are for poring over transit flow charts and attending community feedback meetings. Evenings are often spent with his long-term partner, Chloe, a graphic designer, trying new fusion restaurants or simply cooking at home. Weekends are for escaping the city's concrete for hikes in the Marin Headlands or cycling through Golden Gate Park.\n\nDespite his professional fulfillment and stable income, a familiar San Franciscan anxiety lingers. He and Chloe dream of owning a home, of raising a family in the city they both love, but the prospect feels daunting. Kevin\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to see the completion of a major infrastructure project he helped shepherd, like a new bus rapid transit corridor. It\u2019s more than a career goal; it\u2019s a way to leave a permanent, positive mark on his hometown, ensuring that future generations have a more connected, equitable city to navigate than the one his parents first encountered."

They were waiting for his mother's second transfer. When she finally stepped off the 38 line, her shoulders slumped with a weariness that seemed heavier than her tote bag. In that moment, seeing her exhaustion silhouetted by the hazy streetlight, a quiet, fierce resolve took root in him. He didn't just feel sorry for her; he felt an anger at the slow, inefficient system that stole her time.\n\n2.\nAt Lowell High School, around age 16, he sat in the crowded courtyard listening to friends from across the city compare MUNI horror stories. A classmate from the Bayview described a two-hour, three-bus journey. He suddenly saw San Francisco not as a place, but as a sprawling, flawed schematic. His family's struggle wasn't unique; it was a city-wide problem, a puzzle of inequity he felt an overwhelming intellectual and moral pull to solve. That day, his personal grievance became a public calling.\n\n3.\nHis first community feedback meeting as an SFMTA planner, age 27. An elderly woman, her voice trembling slightly, spoke in Cantonese about how shifting the 29 Sunset route would isolate her from her only grocery store. He saw his own mother in her worried face, his spreadsheets of ridership data suddenly imbued with human weight. It solidified his belief that his job wasn't about lines on a map, but about lifelines for real people. It was about protecting dignity as much as improving efficiency.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, on a rare, sun-drenched Saturday, he and Chloe rented bikes and rode aimlessly through Golden Gate Park. They had no destination, simply pedaling along JFK Drive, laughing as they coasted downhill. He felt a profound sense of peace, a deep contentment. This was the city he fought for in his meetings and data models\u2014not the problems, but the simple, beautiful moments of connection and joy it offered. It reminded him that his work was ultimately in service of life itself.\n\n5.\nLast year, standing with Chloe on a hill in the Marin Headlands, looking back at the city shrouded in its evening fog. They had just had another \"what if\" conversation about buying a home, the numbers feeling impossible. He pointed toward a faint line of lights tracing a major avenue below. He began explaining his vision for a new transit corridor, his professional excitement overriding his personal anxiety. He realized his legacy might not be a house, but a permanent, visible line that made life easier for generations of San Franciscans."
