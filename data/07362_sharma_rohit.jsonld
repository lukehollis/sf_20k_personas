Raised in the Sacramento suburbs by Indian immigrant parents, his world was built on a foundation of practicality and ambition. His father, a successful software engineer, and his mother, a meticulous accountant, envisioned a similar path for him. Rohit was steered towards a stable, high-earning career, and he dutifully enrolled in UC Davis to study Business Administration, a degree that felt more like a parental mandate than a personal choice.\n\nThe turning point was an elective: Modern Art History. In the darkened lecture hall, surrounded by images of Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art, Rohit found a language that resonated more deeply than any balance sheet. He graduated with his business degree but secretly spent his weekends volunteering at small galleries in San Francisco. After a tense conversation with his parents, who saw his passion as a frivolous hobby, he took a leap. He moved to the city, not for a tech job, but for an unpaid internship at a contemporary art space in Dogpatch.\n\nNow 28, Rohit\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. His 0.0-mile commute is literal: he lives in a small, rent-stabilized artist loft directly above the independent gallery where he now works as a full-time assistant. His days are spent handling delicate artworks, corresponding with artists, and greeting the city's collectors and art enthusiasts. He\u2019s the quiet, knowledgeable face of the gallery, known for his calm demeanor and insightful observations. His apartment is a curated world of his own\u2014filled with exhibition posters, art books, and prints swapped with local artists he\u2019s befriended.\n\nHis social life revolves around gallery openings, artist talks, and late-night discussions over beers at a nearby brewery. While his relationship with his parents remains strained, tinged with their disappointment, he finds a chosen family within San Francisco's vibrant, and often struggling, arts community. Rohit\u2019s dream is to one day become a curator, creating shows that elevate emerging South Asian diaspora artists. For him, San Francisco is not just a city; it\u2019s the canvas on which he is finally painting his own life, a life of meaning defined not by income, but by passion and connection."
