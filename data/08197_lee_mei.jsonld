The only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat in the Richmond District, her childhood was a map of MUNI bus routes. While her parents worked tirelessly, Mei Ling navigated the city alone, her face pressed against the glass of the 38 Geary, memorizing the flow of people and traffic. She didn\u2019t see buses and streets; she saw a complex, living system of arteries and veins, a puzzle she was determined to understand.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley for Urban Studies and later to a Master's degree in Urban Planning. Turning down lucrative private-sector offers, she felt a deep pull to public service. Landing a job as a Transportation Planner for the city felt less like a career choice and more like fulfilling a destiny. One of her proudest early achievements was helping to implement dedicated bus lanes on a route she had ridden thousands of times as a child, a quiet, personal victory that validated her path.\n\nNow 47, Mei Ling\u2019s life is both orderly and intensely focused. The pandemic shifted her work to her sleek SoMa condo, reducing her commute to zero miles but immersing her even deeper in the digital infrastructure of the city. Her days are a cycle of data analysis, community Zoom meetings, and drafting policy memos. A long-term relationship ended years ago when her partner wanted to move to the suburbs for a quieter life\u2014a compromise Mei Ling couldn't make. Her heart belonged to the city's chaotic symphony.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, consisting of weekly dim sum with her aging parents still in the Richmond and occasional hikes in the Presidio with a few colleagues. Her dream isn\u2019t one of personal wealth, but of civic legacy. She aspires to see a San Francisco where public transit is so efficient and equitable that it becomes the default choice for everyone. Mei Ling\u2019s life story isn't just set in San Francisco; it's a continuing effort to perfect the city that raised her, one bus route and bike lane at a time."
