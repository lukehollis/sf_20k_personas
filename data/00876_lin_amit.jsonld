Born in Fremont to a Taiwanese father, an exacting hardware engineer, and an Indian mother, a brilliant software developer, his childhood was a vibrant mix of logic, ambition, and flavor. His name itself was a compromise, a testament to the blended world he inhabited, where meals often consisted of daal served alongside Taiwanese three-cup chicken. Surrounded by the burgeoning tech boom, a career in the industry felt like an inheritance.\n\nHe resisted at first. Seeking a more creative path, Amit enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, initially majoring in Film and Digital Media. He loved the storytelling but grew anxious about the industry's instability. In his junior year, driven by a pragmatic streak inherited from his parents, he pivoted to Business Management Economics. It was a compromise with himself: he would learn the language of the world he came from, but on his own terms.\n\nAfter graduating, his career trajectory was steady. He started as a junior procurement agent at a semiconductor company in San Jose before being poached by a major San Francisco tech firm. Now, as a Senior Buyer, he negotiates multi-million dollar contracts for server components, a role that satisfies his analytical mind. His 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic blessing, allowing him to trade the Caltrain grind for a meticulously organized home office in his NoPa apartment.\n\nA significant turning point was the end of a five-year relationship two years ago, an event that prompted him to reconnect with his city not as half of a couple, but as an individual. His days are now structured by routine: a foggy morning run through the Panhandle, hours of focused work, and evenings spent exploring the neighborhood\u2019s ever-changing restaurant scene or meeting friends for drinks in Hayes Valley. He still sees his parents in Fremont most Sundays, their home a grounding force.\n\nThough successful, Amit feels a quiet disconnect from his corporate role. The creative spark from his college days still flickers. His secret aspiration is to use his financial security to produce a documentary series exploring the stories of third-culture kids like himself in the Bay Area. He dreams of using the skills he abandoned to tell the stories he knows best, finally bridging the gap between his pragmatic career and his creative soul."
