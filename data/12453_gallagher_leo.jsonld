The son of a high school history teacher and a meticulous accountant, his childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s passion for historical narratives and his mother\u2019s talent for systematic organization. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a more lucrative career, Leo found his calling during a college internship at the Crocker Art Museum, realizing he could turn his inherited traits into a profession.\n\nHe pursued a BA in History at UC Davis before making the deliberate move to San Francisco for his Master\u2019s in Museum Studies at USF. The city, with its vibrant cultural institutions and layered history, felt like an ecosystem built for him. He worked his way up through the ranks, starting as a collections assistant at a science museum, where his diligence and creative problem-solving quickly got him noticed. His turning point came three years ago when he was given the lead on a major temporary exhibit. The intense pressure, the logistical puzzles, and the final proud moment of watching visitors engage with his work solidified his identity.\n\nNow an Exhibitions Manager, Leo\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the city. He lives with a graphic designer roommate in a classic Inner Richmond apartment, just a 3.1-mile bike ride from his office near Golden Gate Park. His daily commute is a cherished ritual, cutting through the morning fog of the park. Evenings are often spent with a close circle of friends from his graduate program, usually at a trivia night at a pub on Clement Street or trying a new restaurant in the Mission.\n\nThough proud of his career, Leo harbors a deeper ambition. He doesn\u2019t just want to manage exhibitions; he wants to conceive them. His dream is to curate a groundbreaking traveling exhibition that re-contextualizes a piece of scientific history, making it accessible and resonant for a global audience. For Leo, San Francisco is not just a home; it is the perfect workshop for building that future, one carefully chosen artifact at a time."

Tracing the captain's spidery handwriting, he felt a jolt\u2014not of seeing history, but of a human hand reaching across time. It was the moment his father\u2019s stories and his mother\u2019s ledgers fused into a single, tangible purpose. He wasn\u2019t just looking at an artifact; he was holding a life. That afternoon during his college internship, the abstract idea of a career clicked solidly into place.\n\n2.\nHis first night in the empty Inner Richmond apartment. His voice echoed off bare walls as he planned his first bike commute to his USF Master\u2019s program. Through the bay window, the fog rolled in, muffling the city into a soft, promising hum. He wasn\u2019t lonely; he was breathless with anticipation. This wasn\u2019t just a new city; it was the specific, chosen workshop for the life he was finally allowed to build. Sacramento was his foundation, but this foggy, humming city was the beginning of everything.\n\n3.\nOpening night of his first solo-led exhibit three years ago. He stood near the exit, anonymous in the crowd, heart pounding with a fear he hadn't admitted to anyone. He watched a teenager explain a complex astrolabe to her friend, her eyes wide with a rare, genuine wonder. The months of logistical nightmares and sleepless nights dissolved into a quiet, profound wave of relief and pride. It wasn't just his project anymore; it belonged to them. In that moment, his professional identity finally solidified, forged in public.\n\n4.\nA specific morning bike ride through Golden Gate Park last spring. The fog was so thick it dripped from the eucalyptus trees, muting the world to just the whir of his wheels and the scent of damp earth. He emerged from the mist near the de Young, the museum\u2019s copper skin glowing faintly. It felt like passing through a portal from a primeval world into his modern life. This brief, daily journey wasn\u2019t a commute; it was a ritual that recalibrated his soul, reinforcing his deep connection to the city.\n\n5.\nDown in the museum archives a year ago, he found them: a set of exquisitely crafted, yet mislabeled, glass anatomical models from the 1920s. They were beautiful, forgotten, and their story was completely misunderstood. A surge of protective frustration hit him, followed by a clarifying spark. He realized he didn\u2019t just want to manage objects; he wanted to give them their true voice on a global stage. That dusty box wasn\u2019t just a curatorial problem; it was the quiet birth of his greatest ambition."
