Raised in the quiet, predictable suburbs of Sacramento, his childhood was defined by a landscape of manicured lawns and practicality. His father, an accountant, and his mother, a high school administrator, encouraged a stable career path, but David was always drawn to the narratives hidden in objects and images. This pull led him not to art school directly, but to UC Santa Cruz, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature, captivated by how stories are constructed and told.\n\nArriving in San Francisco in the early 2000s, David felt he had finally found his native language. He took a low-paying job at a scrappy Mission District gallery, doing everything from sweeping floors to writing press releases. It was here he discovered his true talent: a preternatural calm and organizational prowess amidst the chaos of art installations. He wasn't the artist, but he was the one who ensured the artist's vision could be seen. A key turning point came in his early thirties when a long-term relationship ended over his refusal to leave the city for a more conventional life. Quietly heartbroken but resolute, David doubled down on his commitment to the art world.\n\nNow, at 43, David\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. He lives in a SoMa live/work loft, with his personal space on a mezzanine overlooking the ground-floor gallery he manages. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a spiral staircase. His days are a mix of meticulous planning\u2014coordinating with artists, shippers, and lighting designers\u2014and the physical work of exhibition prep. His social circle is a tight-knit group of curators, artists, and fellow gallery workers who gather for drinks at a nearby converted warehouse bar.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is not fame, but significance. He dreams of one day curating a major retrospective for an overlooked artist, crafting a narrative that re-contextualizes their career. He feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s legacy as a haven for creators and contrarians. In his quiet, detail-oriented way, David Miller sees himself as a custodian of that legacy, ensuring the city\u2019s stories continue to be told, one perfectly lit exhibition at a time."
