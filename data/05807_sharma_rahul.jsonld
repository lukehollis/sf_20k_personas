Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants who ran a small grocery store, his childhood was a lesson in tireless work and quiet ambition. While his parents dreamed of him becoming a doctor or engineer, Rahul was more pragmatic. He saw the financial strain on his family and opted for a direct path to a stable career, earning an Associate's degree in Network Administration from De Anza College.\n\nHe began his career on a corporate help desk in Silicon Valley, a long, draining commute on BART. For years, he was the calm, patient voice on the other end of the line, untangling the technical frustrations of others. A key turning point came a decade ago when he landed a better-paying IT Support Specialist role in San Francisco and found a coveted rent-controlled apartment. He left the suburbs behind, embracing the city's energy.\n\nThe pandemic was another pivot. His mid-sized tech company went fully remote, erasing his commute and anchoring his existence entirely within his neighborhood. Now, Rahul\u2019s San Francisco is not the downtown skyline, but the four-block radius around his home. His days follow a peaceful rhythm: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and a pastry, followed by hours spent resolving support tickets from his spare-bedroom office. He knows the names of the baristas, the mail carrier, and the other regulars at Golden Gate Park.\n\nSocially, Rahul is reserved. A long-term relationship ended a few years prior, leaving him content with a small circle of friends and the quiet company of his hobby: restoring vintage electronics. His apartment is dotted with half-assembled 1970s radios and early computer consoles. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup or become a tech executive. Instead, he harbors a quiet, persistent hope of one day being able to afford a small condo in his neighborhood\u2014a place where he can build a proper workshop and secure his small, peaceful corner of the city. For Rahul, success is stability, and his greatest aspiration is to simply remain."
