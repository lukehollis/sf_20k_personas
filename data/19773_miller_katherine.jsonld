Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a librarian mother, Katherine\u2019s world was one of order and predictability. Her escape was the static-filled jazz station on her clock radio, a portal to a world of improvisation and soul that felt a universe away. This private passion seemed at odds with her practical choice to study Hospitality Management at UMass Amherst, but for Katherine, it was about learning the rules before she could artfully break them.\n\nHer early career was a steady climb through Boston\u2019s hotel event scene. She was good at it\u2014meticulous, calm under pressure\u2014but by her early 30s, the endless cycle of corporate conventions and cookie-cutter weddings felt stifling. The turning point came during a vacation to San Francisco in 1999. The city\u2019s vibrant, eclectic energy was intoxicating. Six months later, she accepted a position at a boutique hotel in Union Square, trading New England stability for West Coast uncertainty.\n\nThe first decade in San Francisco was professionally successful but personally unfulfilling. A marriage in her late 30s ended amicably after five years, a mutual agreement that their paths were diverging. It was this moment of recalibration that led her to SFJAZZ. The job as Director of Events wasn\u2019t just a career move; it was a homecoming. Here, her systematic planning supported the very spontaneity she\u2019d cherished as a girl.\n\nNow, at 53, Katherine\u2019s days are a familiar rhythm. She leaves her modest home in Oakland\u2019s Dimond District before sunrise, catching BART for the cross-bay commute into the city. Her role at the Hayes Valley center is all-consuming, a whirlwind of logistics, artist relations, and donor galas. She thrives on the energy, cherishing the moment the lights go down and the first notes fill the hall she helped prepare. Her personal life is a curated collection of close friends, wine on her small patio overlooking the Oakland hills, and weekend hikes in Redwood Regional Park. Her aspiration is no longer to climb higher, but to deepen her impact\u2014to mentor young women in her field and ensure the legacy of the music she loves continues to find a home in the city she chose."

The dial on her clock radio was a prayer wheel, landing on a saxophone solo that felt like a secret language. It was messy, human, and alive\u2014everything her ordered world wasn\u2019t. The music didn\u2019t just fill the room; it carved out a space inside her for a different kind of future, one built on soul instead of spreadsheets. It was the first time she felt truly herself, a quiet rebellion in the dark.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, on the ferry back from Sausalito. The wind was sharp, and the city emerged from the fog like a promise. Back in Boston, life was a known quantity. Here, the air itself vibrated with a chaotic, brilliant energy that spoke directly to the girl who\u2019d listened to jazz in her room. Looking at that skyline, the immense risk of moving suddenly felt smaller than the profound risk of staying. It was a visceral, wordless decision to trade predictability for possibility.\n\n3.\nAround her 42nd birthday, she and her husband sat at their small kitchen table, the silence broken only by the hum of the fridge. There were no tears, just a shared, heavy acknowledgment. \u201cWe\u2019re good people,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cjust not good for each other anymore.\u201d The end wasn\u2019t a failure, but a painful, necessary recalibration. It hollowed her out, but also cleared the space she would soon fill with the resonant sound of SFJAZZ, giving her the courage to pursue a life that was wholly her own.\n\n4.\nHer first opening night at SFJAZZ. She stood at the back of the hall, her clipboard a familiar weight in her hands, every contingency meticulously planned. Then, the house lights dimmed. From the darkness came the first, bright notes of a trumpet. She felt a jolt\u2014a perfect fusion of the methodical planner she\u2019d become and the breathless girl who once found solace in static. For the first time, the chaos she was controlling was the very thing that had once set her free.\n\n5.\nLast year, watching her young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Maria, expertly handle a last-minute crisis before a major gala, Katherine felt a new kind of satisfaction. It wasn't about her own success, but about seeing the legacy continue. Later that week, a glass of wine in hand on her Oakland patio, she looked out at the hills. The ambition to climb had softened into a desire to deepen her roots and help others grow. She wasn't just building events anymore; she was building a community."
