Born in Oakland to a practical Korean-American engineer and a storytelling Irish-American librarian, he grew up between two worlds: the precise logic of schematics and the boundless wonder of fiction. He was a reserved child, more comfortable with a sketchbook than a conversation, filling pages with detailed renderings of the world he saw from his window.\n\nThe pivotal moment came not in a classroom, but in his own home. His younger sister\u2019s crippling anxiety found an unlikely outlet when Liam began drawing with her. He discovered that a paintbrush could articulate feelings a voice could not, and that the act of creation could be a powerful anchor in a storm of panic. This experience steered him away from a traditional university path. He pursued a patchwork education of community college psychology courses, life drawing workshops, and certifications in therapeutic art, believing direct impact was more valuable than a formal degree.\n\nFive years ago, a position as an Art Therapist at \"The Sketchpad,\" a small non-profit youth center in the Mission District, felt like a calling answered. He lives in a small in-law unit attached to a Victorian just a block away, making his commute a literal zero-mile journey. This proximity has fused his life with his work and his neighborhood. His days begin with coffee from a local panaderia and are spent prepping supplies\u2014clay, paint, charcoal\u2014for the kids who filter in after school. He helps them channel trauma, frustration, and joy into tangible forms.\n\nLiam\u2019s social life is woven into his community. His closest friends are fellow non-profit workers and local artists he\u2019s met through the Mission\u2019s vibrant mural scene. He is a familiar, calming presence in the neighborhood, known for his patient demeanor and the faint scent of turpentine that clings to his clothes.\n\nHis aspirations are grounded and immediate: secure a grant to build a small digital art lab for the center, and see the teenagers he mentors graduate high school with a stronger sense of self. For Liam, success isn\u2019t measured by gallery shows or acclaim, but in the quiet confidence he sees blooming in a child who has finally found their voice on a blank canvas."
