Born in Oakland to a practical Korean-American engineer and a storytelling Irish-American librarian, he grew up between two worlds: the precise logic of schematics and the boundless wonder of fiction. He was a reserved child, more comfortable with a sketchbook than a conversation, filling pages with detailed renderings of the world he saw from his window.\n\nThe pivotal moment came not in a classroom, but in his own home. His younger sister\u2019s crippling anxiety found an unlikely outlet when Liam began drawing with her. He discovered that a paintbrush could articulate feelings a voice could not, and that the act of creation could be a powerful anchor in a storm of panic. This experience steered him away from a traditional university path. He pursued a patchwork education of community college psychology courses, life drawing workshops, and certifications in therapeutic art, believing direct impact was more valuable than a formal degree.\n\nFive years ago, a position as an Art Therapist at \"The Sketchpad,\" a small non-profit youth center in the Mission District, felt like a calling answered. He lives in a small in-law unit attached to a Victorian just a block away, making his commute a literal zero-mile journey. This proximity has fused his life with his work and his neighborhood. His days begin with coffee from a local panaderia and are spent prepping supplies\u2014clay, paint, charcoal\u2014for the kids who filter in after school. He helps them channel trauma, frustration, and joy into tangible forms.\n\nLiam\u2019s social life is woven into his community. His closest friends are fellow non-profit workers and local artists he\u2019s met through the Mission\u2019s vibrant mural scene. He is a familiar, calming presence in the neighborhood, known for his patient demeanor and the faint scent of turpentine that clings to his clothes.\n\nHis aspirations are grounded and immediate: secure a grant to build a small digital art lab for the center, and see the teenagers he mentors graduate high school with a stronger sense of self. For Liam, success isn\u2019t measured by gallery shows or acclaim, but in the quiet confidence he sees blooming in a child who has finally found their voice on a blank canvas."

Instead of using words, which always failed, he grabbed a roll of butcher paper and charcoal. He unrolled it across her floor and began drawing a frantic, messy black spiral, mimicking the chaos in her head. Her sobs quieted. He handed her the charcoal, and she added her own lines, transforming the storm into a galaxy. It was the first time he truly understood that art wasn't just observation; it was a language.\n\n2.\nHis father had laid out a Caltech brochure on the kitchen table, a path of clear logic. Liam, 18, simply slid his sketchbook next to it, open to a drawing of his sister\u2019s hands, calm and steady, holding a paintbrush. \"This is my schematic, Dad,\" he\u2019d said quietly. He remembers the long silence, then his father's slow nod. It wasn't full understanding, but it was acceptance. That nod gave him the courage to forge his own, less certain path, away from formal engineering and toward human connection.\n\n3.\nThere was Marco, a 14-year-old who radiated silent fury. For weeks, every prompt was met with a shrug. One Tuesday, Liam simply placed a block of gray clay on his table, no words exchanged. Ten minutes later, he heard a thump. Marco was slamming the clay onto the table, over and over. He wasn't breaking anything; he was reshaping his anger. He wasn't lashing out; he was creating. Liam just watched, his heart aching with a quiet, triumphant pride. It was the first time Marco had spoken.\n\n4.\nHe recalls his first day at The Sketchpad, five years ago. It wasn't the kids\u2014they hadn't arrived yet. It was the quiet of the empty room, smelling of old paint and dust motes dancing in the light from the tall Mission windows. He ran his hand over a clay-spattered table, a future artifact of some child\u2019s creation. A wave of profound rightness washed over him, a feeling of having walked through a door he was always meant to find. This wasn't a job; it was an arrival.\n\n5.\nStanding on the corner of 24th and Balmy Alley late one summer evening last year. The air was thick with the smells of frying carnitas and his friend Maria\u2019s spray paint as she touched up a mural. The lowrider music from a passing car mixed with the chatter from a taqueria. He felt invisible and completely seen all at once\u2014just another part of the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant, layered painting. In that moment, he realized he wasn't just working in the Mission; he was a thread woven into its fabric."
