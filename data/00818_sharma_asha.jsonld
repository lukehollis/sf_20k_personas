She grew up in the two-bedroom apartment directly above \u201cSharma Imports,\u201d the shop her immigrant parents poured their life savings and boundless energy into after arriving from Rajasthan. Her childhood was a sensory collage of fragrant spices, the shimmering textures of silk scarves, and the constant, friendly chatter of neighbors and customers. For her parents, the store was a lifeline\u2014a tangible piece of home and their key to survival in a new country. For Asha, it was simply home.\n\nHer escape, and her rebellion, was earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History from UC Davis. Asha dreamed of a different life, one spent in the quiet, hallowed halls of a museum, curating exhibits and writing academic papers. She envisioned a clean break from the world of retail, inventory, and family obligation. However, a turning point came during her senior year when her father had a significant health scare. Seeing her parents\u2019 vulnerability and realizing the store couldn\u2019t run without one of them, Asha made the difficult decision to return to San Francisco after graduation, putting her curatorial ambitions on an indefinite hold.\n\nNow 32, Asha is the full-time manager of Sharma Imports. Her commute is the thirteen steps from her apartment door to the shop floor. She has slowly, thoughtfully, begun putting her own stamp on the family business. While honoring her parents\u2019 traditional inventory, she has used her art history background to curate a selection of modern artisanal crafts, independent jewelry, and ethically sourced home goods, attracting a new generation of customers.\n\nHer daily routine is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. Mornings start with coffee from the cafe next door, afternoons are a blur of customer interactions and supplier calls, and evenings are often spent quietly upstairs, sketching new layout ideas for the store. Her social life is small but strong, consisting of other local business owners and a few friends from college. Though she sometimes feels a pang of longing for the life she once planned, Asha\u2019s hope has transformed. Her dream is no longer to escape, but to expand\u2014to one day take a sourcing trip to Japan or Morocco, blending her family\u2019s legacy with her own global, artistic vision, proving that she didn\u2019t have to leave home to find her world."
