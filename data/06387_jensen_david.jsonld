Raised in a working-class family\u2014his father a factory foreman, his mother a bank teller\u2014he was taught the value of practicality and a steady paycheck. He pursued that path at a local community college, studying business administration, but the theory felt disconnected from reality. The real education was happening at his part-time job waiting tables at a bustling local steakhouse, where he discovered a natural talent for managing chaos and reading people.\n\nHe never finished his degree. At 22, he chose the restaurant floor over the lecture hall, quickly working his way up to a supervisory role in Chicago. But he felt a ceiling approaching. The turning point came at 28, when a mentor told him, \"If you're serious about this, you go to San Francisco.\" He sold what he could, packed a suitcase, and moved to a city he\u2019d only seen in pictures, drawn by its reputation as a culinary mecca.\n\nNow 47, David is the quintessential restaurant manager. His 0.0-mile commute is the short walk downstairs from his rent-controlled apartment to the polished brass doors of \"The Cypress Table,\" a well-regarded North Beach institution he has managed for over a decade. His life is a routine dictated by the restaurant's pulse: morning coffee while checking the previous night\u2019s receipts, placating vendors, a pre-service staff meeting, and then the nine-hour performance of dinner service.\n\nHis staff is his family. He\u2019s the firm but fair patriarch to a rotating cast of ambitious young chefs and career servers. A serious relationship dissolved nearly a decade ago, a casualty of his all-consuming career, leaving a quiet void he fills with work. His connection to San Francisco is street-level; he knows the names of the produce delivery drivers, the owner of the laundromat, and the old men who play chess in Washington Square Park. He dreams of one day owning a small percentage of The Cypress Table\u2014not for wealth, but for a true stake in the world he helped build. His quietest hope is for a future that includes a partner who understands his life, and perhaps a Sunday morning that doesn't smell faintly of garlic and marinara sauce."
