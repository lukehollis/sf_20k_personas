Born in Guangzhou, China, she was the first in her family to attend university abroad, arriving in San Francisco at 19 with a scholarship and a fierce determination to study Art History. She dreamed of becoming a museum curator, of spending her life surrounded by the beauty and stories captured in ancient artifacts.\n\nThat dream was put on hold two decades ago. During her last year of college, her father fell gravely ill back home, and the family\u2019s finances became precarious. Suddenly, the need for a stable income overshadowed her passion. Wei took the first well-paying job she could find: a temporary administrative position at a downtown financial firm. The temp job became permanent. Her meticulous nature and quiet competence made her indispensable, and over the years, she became the institutional memory of her department, a calm anchor in a sea of ambitious, fast-moving financiers.\n\nThe pandemic shifted her work entirely from a bustling office to her rent-controlled apartment, and the commute became a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her desk. Her world shrank but also deepened. Her daily routine is a ritual: green tea in a porcelain cup from her childhood, hours of focused work, and an afternoon walk through Golden Gate Park or along the foggy expanse of Ocean Beach. Her social life is small but cherished, consisting of weekly calls with her mother in Guangzhou and conversations with the owners of her favorite bakery on Balboa Street.\n\nAt 45, Wei is content but not without aspiration. The art history books still line her shelves, and she nurtures a quiet dream of traveling to see the great museums of Europe. More immediately, she hopes to one day volunteer at the de Young Museum, to finally touch the world she once planned to inhabit. Her connection to San Francisco is not in its loud, trendy heart, but in its misty, residential edges\u2014a silent observer who has built a life of dignity and peace, one meticulously organized day at a time."
