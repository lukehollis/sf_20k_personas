Raised in a family of mechanics and farmhands near Bakersfield, his upbringing was practical, valuing calloused hands over abstract theories. School was a means to an end, and when he enrolled at the local Cal State for Business Administration, it felt more like an obligation than a passion. He lasted three semesters, restless in classrooms and bored by spreadsheets. The turning point was a summer job he took on a road crew to pay for tuition he wasn't sure he wanted. He was assigned to help a surveying team, and something clicked. The work was tangible, precise; a world of angles, elevations, and concrete results. It was a language he understood.\n\nHe dropped out of college, trading a bachelor's degree for a set of certifications in land surveying and geomatics. The decision disappointed his parents initially, but David had found his calling. He followed the work north, drawn by San Francisco\u2019s relentless construction boom. Now, at 35, he\u2019s a senior field technician for a major infrastructure firm.\n\nHis connection to the city is rooted in its very foundation. He doesn't just live in San Francisco; he lives *inside* his work. To save on rent and act as an on-site manager for expensive equipment, David resides in a small, modern loft built within his company\u2019s sprawling Dogpatch warehouse. His 0.0-mile commute means his mornings start with the smell of diesel and the metallic clang of the roll-up door. His social life is tight-knit, consisting of post-work beers with his crew at a nearby brewery and occasional phone calls to his family back south. He\u2019s private and observant, more comfortable with a theodolite than small talk.\n\nDavid measures the city for a living, from high-rise foundations in SoMa to seismic retrofits in the Marina. While he appreciates the foggy mornings over the bay, his dream isn't urban. He\u2019s meticulously saving his income, hoping one day to buy a few rugged acres in the Sierra foothills\u2014a quiet piece of land he can survey, map, and build on himself, finally plotting a piece of the world to call his own."
