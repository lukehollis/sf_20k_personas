Raised by nomadic parents who chased artistic grants and academic whims across the country, she never stayed in one place long enough to plant roots. Her identity wasn\u2019t tied to a single culture or community, but rather to the quiet observation of human nature in bus stations and laundromats. Her early education was a patchwork of inconsistent public schools and self-directed reading, leaving her with a sharp intellect but no formal pedigree.\n\nThe pivotal moment of her life arrived at nineteen, when her younger brother\u2019s spiraling mental health crisis collided with a bureaucratic and indifferent system. Priya became his fierce, albeit unprepared, advocate. Fighting for his care, she navigated a labyrinth of paperwork, dismissive doctors, and dead-end resources. While her brother eventually found a fragile stability, the experience ignited a fire in Priya. She saw her life\u2019s purpose: to be the guide she and her family never had. She enrolled in a state university, working two jobs to earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree, followed by a Master of Social Work.\n\nNow, at 39, Priya has built the life of profound stability she once craved. She lives in a small, cozy apartment in Hayes Valley, which doubles as her office. Her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to the armchair where she conducts telehealth sessions as a clinical social worker. She specializes in helping families navigate trauma and mental health systems, her practice built on the empathy forged in her own past.\n\nHer daily routine is a quiet ritual: a morning walk to a local bakery for black tea, followed by hours of intense, focused work with her clients. Evenings are for herself\u2014reading by the bay window overlooking the street, attending a yoga class, or meeting her small, fiercely loyal circle of friends for dinner. These friends are her chosen family, a testament to her belief in building connections on shared values, not shared history. Her dream is to one day open a small non-profit that offers free advocacy services for families like her own, ensuring no one has to face the system alone. For Priya, San Francisco isn't just a city; it\u2019s the anchor she finally dropped, a place where a rootless girl could build a home and a purpose."
