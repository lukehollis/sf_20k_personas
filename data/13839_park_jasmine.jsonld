The daughter of pragmatic Korean immigrants who built a successful chain of grocery stores in the East Bay, Jasmine\u2019s childhood was a study in contrasts. While she learned the value of discipline and inventory management stocking shelves after school, her inner life was filled with colors and forms her parents didn't quite understand. They hoped for a lawyer or a doctor, not an artist.\n\nHer rebellion was quiet but firm. She pursued an undergraduate degree in Art History, and then, feeling the need for a more practical application, earned a Master's in Public Humanities from an East Coast university. It was there she honed her philosophy: that art shouldn't be confined to sterile white walls but should be a living, breathing part of the community, often best experienced alongside food and conversation.\n\nA pivotal internship at a scrappy Brooklyn arts collective taught her how to stretch a budget and produce compelling events. When a new, ambitious arts foundation in San Francisco sought a director who could blend high-concept exhibitions with accessible community programming, her unique resume stood out. They offered her the role of Curator and Programming Director for their new space, \"The Locus,\" which included a gallery, a performance stage, a professional kitchen, and live-work lofts upstairs for resident artists and staff.\n\nNow, at 32, Jasmine lives and breathes her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of steel stairs from her minimalist loft into the gallery below. Her day is a fluid mix of grant writing, coordinating with visual artists for the next installation, and planning a pop-up dinner series with an up-and-coming chef. Her social life is inextricably linked to her profession; her friends are the poets, painters, and chefs who cycle through The Locus. Her aspiration is to transform the space into a sustainable cultural cornerstone, proving to her family\u2014and herself\u2014that a life built around art is not just viable, but vital. She is deeply rooted in her corner of San Francisco, a tireless cultivator of the very creative energy that drew her back to the Bay."
