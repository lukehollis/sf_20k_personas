The only son of hardworking immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and fresh produce in his parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Richmond District. They instilled in him the values of relentless work ethic and quiet humility, saving every possible dollar to ensure he would have opportunities they never did. To honor their sacrifices, Winston pursued a practical business degree at San Francisco State University.\n\nAfter graduation, a brief, soul-crushing stint in corporate accounting pushed him toward a more dynamic field. He found his calling in the cutthroat, high-stakes world of commercial real estate. The dot-com boom of the late '90s was his trial by fire. While his tech-focused peers coded, Winston brokered the deals for the office spaces where fortunes were made and lost. He survived the subsequent bust through sheer tenacity and deep knowledge of the city\u2019s landscape, cementing his reputation as a broker who understood the long game.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce at 41. It was amicable but left him feeling unmoored, prompting him to trade his suburban family home for a sleek condo in Hayes Valley. This move placed him in the heart of the city he was professionally reshaping. His current life is one of disciplined routine: a 6 AM workout, a scan of financial news, and a short Muni ride to his Financial District office\u2014a practical choice that reflects both his humble upbringing and a deep disdain for downtown parking.\n\nSocially, Winston maintains a small circle of long-time friends, mostly other professionals who, like him, remember a different San Francisco. He feels a certain irony in his work, leasing gleaming towers to tech giants that have priced out families like the one he grew up in. His connection to the city is a complicated love affair.\n\nNow, at 50, his ambitions have shifted. The thrill of the deal has softened, replaced by a desire for legacy. He dreams of mentoring younger brokers, perhaps investing in a small, community-focused business reminiscent of his parents' store. More privately, he hopes to find a meaningful partnership, someone to share quiet dinners with and watch the fog roll in over the city he helped build."

The *click-clack* of the wooden beads was a language he didn\u2019t speak but deeply understood: the sound of survival, of a future being built for him, bead by painstaking bead. That sound became the baseline for every deal he\u2019d ever make, a constant, quiet reminder of what was truly at stake beyond the commission percentage.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998, a converted warehouse in SoMa. The air smelled of fresh paint and irrational exuberance. A 24-year-old CEO in a hoodie signed the massive lease Winston had brokered, barely looking up. In that moment, Winston felt the city tilting on a new axis. He wasn't one of the tech visionaries, but he realized he was providing the physical stage for their digital revolution. This was his power: the concrete reality beneath their virtual dreams.\n\n3.\nAt 41, he stood in the doorway of his empty Orinda home. His wife was gone, the movers too, leaving only pale squares on the walls where family photos once hung. It wasn't the divorce that broke him, but the deafening silence of a life he\u2019d outgrown. The echo of his own footsteps on the hardwood floors was the sound of a chapter slamming shut. He locked the door and drove toward the city lights, seeking noise and a new beginning.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, standing on Folsom, he admired a gleaming glass tower his firm had just leased. Then he remembered the greasy-spoon diner that stood there before\u2014the one with the cracked vinyl booths where he\u2019d mourn the dot-com bust with friends. He felt a sharp pang of complicity: a quiet pride in the deal, warring with the sorrow of being an agent of the city\u2019s vanishing past. This was the central, complicated contract of his career.\n\n5.\nLast week, watching the fog pour through the Hayes Valley corridor from his condo window, the city hummed below, a machine he knew intimately. The thrill of a closed deal felt distant, replaced by a quiet ache. He wasn't looking at a skyline of assets anymore. He was looking at a home, and for the first time in years, he felt the profound, unambiguous desire for someone to watch it with him."
