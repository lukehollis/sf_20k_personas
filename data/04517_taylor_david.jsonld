His parents, immigrants from Guangdong, had arrived in San Francisco in the 1970s with little more than the clothes on their backs and a fierce will to provide. They Anglicized their son\u2019s name, hoping it would smooth his path in a new world. David\u2019s childhood was a landscape of foggy streets, the rhythmic clang of the N Judah streetcar, and the savory scent of his mother\u2019s cooking mingling with the salt air.\n\nHe attended local public schools, a quiet boy who excelled more in observation than in academics. College was a distant, abstract idea. His reality was the family's small corner store, where he worked every day after his final class at Lincoln High. He learned inventory, customer service, and the subtle art of being a neighborhood fixture. After graduation, his path was set: he would help his parents run the store until they could retire.\n\nThe turning point came at age 32. A combination of his father\u2019s declining health and the arrival of a corporate chain grocery store two blocks away made the business unsustainable. The closing of the store felt like a personal failure, leaving David adrift. For years, he took odd jobs, from stocking shelves to making deliveries, but nothing stuck. Then, he saw a posting for a school bus driver with SFMTA. It promised stability, a pension, and a purpose. He earned his Commercial Driver's License and found his calling.\n\nNow, at 49, David\u2019s life is one of dependable routine. He lives in a small in-law unit a few blocks from the bus depot, his commute a short walk. He is the first face many neighborhood children see in the morning and the last one before they get home. He knows which kids are having a bad day by the slump of their shoulders, and who needs an extra moment to find their forgotten lunchbox. His social life is woven into his work\u2014the easy camaraderie with other drivers, the polite waves from parents at the bus stop, the familiar nod from the owner of the cafe where he gets his coffee at 5:30 a.m.\n\nDavid\u2019s dreams are modest. He hopes to one day take a long road trip across the country, to see the vast landscapes beyond the city limits he has so faithfully served. But for now, he finds quiet contentment in his role\u2014a silent, steady guardian of the city\u2019s next generation, navigating the same foggy streets he once walked as a boy."

Before David could say anything, his father nodded from behind the counter. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Wei,\u201d he said softly in Cantonese. \u201cShe is our neighbor.\u201d In that moment, David understood the store wasn\u2019t about money. It was about trust, about the invisible threads that held their foggy corner of the city together. It\u2019s a lesson he carries with him on every route.\n\n2.\nAt 32, after the last of the inventory was sold off, he swept the store\u2019s bare, dusty floor. He turned the key in the lock one final time, the click echoing in the empty space. His father\u2019s hand rested on his shoulder, a silent weight of shared disappointment. David couldn\u2019t look at him. The closing wasn\u2019t just a business failure; it was a personal one. He felt he had erased his parents\u2019 American dream with one turn of a key, leaving him adrift in a city he no longer recognized.\n\n3.\nYears later, sitting in a drab employment agency, he felt utterly invisible. He idly scanned a newspaper when a small ad caught his eye: *SFMTA. Serve Your Community.* It promised stability, a pension\u2014things he desperately needed. But it was the word \u201cserve\u201d that struck him. It was a purpose, a role he hadn't felt since the store closed. In that sterile room, under fluorescent lights, David felt a flicker of hope. He wasn\u2019t just looking for a job; he was looking for a way back to being a neighbor.\n\n4.\nA few years into the job, a quiet first-grader named Leo, who always looked sad, pressed a folded paper into his hand as he stepped off the bus. David opened it later. It was a crayon drawing of his bus, with a ridiculously oversized smiling sun. He wasn't just the driver; he was part of this child\u2019s world, a fixed point of safety. The simple drawing felt more valuable than any day's profit at the old store. It was proof that he was, once again, a neighborhood fixture.\n\n5.\nJust last week, standing with his coffee before dawn, he watched the fog blanket the avenues. The air was damp and smelled of salt, the exact scent of his childhood. He heard the distant, familiar clang of the first N Judah streetcar of the day. In that quiet moment, the boy who hid behind the counter and the man who drove the bus became one. He wasn't a failure or a success. He was simply David, a steady part of the city\u2019s rhythm, faithfully navigating its streets."
