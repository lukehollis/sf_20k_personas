Raised by a dental hygienist mother and an electrician father, his upbringing was one of practicality and tangible results. So, when Nathan announced he was majoring in Philosophy at the University of Oregon, his parents were lovingly perplexed. He spent four years wrestling with Kant and Camus, honing a mind for abstract logic and complex systems, which, ironically, prepared him perfectly for a future he never envisioned.\n\nAfter graduating, the ethereal nature of his degree collided with the hard reality of rent. A natural troubleshooter who had always been the family\u2019s designated \u201ccomputer guy,\u201d Nathan took a low-level help desk job. He discovered a deep satisfaction in untangling digital knots and bringing order to technological chaos. He earned certifications, built an impressive resume, and five years ago, made the quintessential millennial pilgrimage to San Francisco for a lucrative IT Support Specialist position at a major tech firm.\n\nToday, Nathan\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of his Inner Richmond apartment, his commute a ten-step journey from his bed to his desk. His days are a steady stream of support tickets and video calls, a disembodied voice solving problems for unseen colleagues across the globe. To combat the digital isolation, he has cultivated a rigorously analog life. Evenings are for the physical problem-solving of bouldering at Dogpatch Boulders, where he\u2019s found a small, tight-knit group of friends, or long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond suits his temperament; it offers city life without the frantic energy of downtown. He feels a quiet kinship with the neighborhood\u2019s blend of legacy businesses and new arrivals. Though stable and comfortable, a familiar philosophical restlessness persists. Nathan dreams of moving beyond just fixing things. He aspires to transition into a UX design or technical writing role where he can use his unique understanding of both human logic and machine language to create, not just maintain. He seeks a deeper connection, both in his work and in his personal life, hoping to find a sense of true purpose in the city he now calls home."
