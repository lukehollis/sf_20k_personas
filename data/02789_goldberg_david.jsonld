Born in Philadelphia to a lawyer father and a history professor mother, his upbringing was one of academic expectation and East Coast tradition. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History, a choice that pleased no one but himself, finding a strange beauty in the composition and texture of Renaissance paintings. However, a post-graduation trip to Seville, Spain, rerouted his entire future. In the boisterous tapas bars, surrounded by communal plates and lively conversation, he found his true calling\u2014not on a canvas, but on a plate.\n\nHe returned to the States and dove into the culinary world from the bottom, trading museums for the sweltering heat of professional kitchens. He worked as a line cook in New York, absorbing technique and discipline, but felt constrained. In his late twenties, he moved to San Francisco, drawn by its legendary food scene and access to unparalleled produce. For years, he saved every dollar, working for other chefs while sketching out menus in a worn notebook.\n\nThe turning point was securing a lease on a small, neglected storefront in Hayes Valley. With a shoestring budget and loans from skeptical family members, he opened \"Solana,\" a Cal-Med tapas restaurant. His life became the restaurant. He lives in the apartment directly above it, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to his complete immersion. The pandemic was his crucible; pivoting to takeout and outdoor parklets forged an unbreakable bond with his staff and loyal neighborhood regulars, who have become his surrogate family. A long-term relationship withered years ago under the demands of the business, a quiet sacrifice he rarely acknowledges.\n\nNow 40, his days are a ritual of farmer\u2019s market runs, menu tweaks, and long nights working the floor, greeting familiar faces. David dreams not of expansion, but of perfection\u2014of earning a quiet, respected reputation for quality and community. He hopes one day to find a better balance, but for now, his entire world, his history, and his art are all created and served downstairs."
