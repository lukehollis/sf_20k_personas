The only child of a Korean immigrant mother, a nurse, and a second-generation Mexican-American father, a mechanic, Leo grew up in Richmond, California. His childhood home was a loving fusion of two worlds, filled with the scents of both kimchi-jjigae and carne asada. He learned early on to navigate the nuances of different cultures and saw firsthand how language barriers and socioeconomic status could create immense obstacles, especially in accessing healthcare and education for his parents\u2019 communities.\n\nThis upbringing directly inspired his educational path. He attended San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's in Social Work, driven by a desire to be the bridge he wished his family and neighbors had. His career began in case management, but he found his true calling as a Community Health Worker. A key turning point came when he spent weeks helping a recently-arrived monolingual Cantonese family navigate the complex medical system for their diabetic child. Securing translation services, appointments, and insurance coverage solidified his belief that direct, empathetic intervention was his purpose.\n\nNow 36, Leo lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. He loves the neighborhood's vibrancy, which reminds him of his diverse childhood. His daily routine is grounded: a morning Muni ride to the clinic where he works, a day spent empowering vulnerable families, and evenings often spent cooking or decompressing with his long-term partner, Clara, a public school teacher. Weekends are for recharging\u2014playing in a casual soccer league at Golden Gate Park or hiking in the Marin Headlands.\n\nConnected by a close circle of friends from college and work, Leo\u2019s social life is built on shared values rather than expensive outings. He and Clara dream of one day buying a small home, perhaps further out in the East Bay, and starting a family. Professionally, Leo aspires to eventually move into a leadership role at a community-focused non-profit, hoping to scale his impact and advocate for systemic changes that would make his own job less necessary."

Leo translated the teacher\u2019s praise and concerns, carefully choosing words in Korean, feeling the weight of his mother\u2019s hopeful, trusting gaze. It was the first time he felt the immense responsibility and quiet power of being a bridge between two worlds. That feeling of being essential, of closing a gap, never left him and became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nIt was the small kitchen in her family\u2019s SRO. After weeks of calls and clinic visits, the monolingual Cantonese mother finally held the correct insulin pen, her shoulders relaxing for the first time. She turned to Leo, her eyes shining with tears, and pushed a small plate of homemade dumplings towards him. In that moment, accepting the warm, savory gift, he felt a profound click of purpose. This was it. This weary gratitude, this shared humanity across a language barrier, was the reason he was put on this earth.\n\n3.\nOne rainy Sunday after a muddy soccer game at Golden Gate Park, his entire team was huddled under the thin cover of a cypress tree. They had lost spectacularly, but no one cared. They were just laughing, sharing a thermos of coffee, their breath fogging in the cool air. Leo felt a surge of uncomplicated joy. It was a vital reminder that community wasn\u2019t just about shared struggle, but also about the shared, pointless happiness that recharges the soul for the week ahead.\n\n4.\nHe and Clara were cooking on a Tuesday, both exhausted from their respective days serving the public. The tiny Mission apartment was filled with the smell of garlic and tomatoes. She leaned against him while stirring the sauce, her head on his shoulder, and spoke about a student\u2019s small victory. He felt a wave of profound peace wash over him. This was the foundation of their life\u2014not grand gestures, but the quiet, steadfast partnership of finding refuge in each other when the world felt too heavy.\n\n5.\nHe can still feel the summer heat in his parents\u2019 Richmond backyard. He was a teenager, watching his dad expertly flip carne asada on the grill while his mom\u2019s cousins laughed, sharing a giant bowl of her kimchi. The air was a mix of Spanglish, Korean, and sizzling meat. He saw no division, only a loud, loving, chaotic fusion. That memory became his internal compass, the image of the vibrant, blended community he always seeks to build, both in his work and in his own life."
