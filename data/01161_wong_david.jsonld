Born to a first-generation father from Hong Kong who ran a small grocery in the Outer Richmond, and an Irish-American mother whose family had been in the Sunset District for generations, David grew up navigating two distinct worlds. He never felt wholly one or the other, identifying simply as a San Franciscan. School was never his arena; he was more interested in the city\u2019s pulse, the chatter in his father\u2019s store, and the ever-changing storefronts along Clement Street. He absorbed lessons in negotiation, value, and human nature over the counter, not in a classroom.\n\nAfter high school, he bypassed college, taking a series of jobs that kept him on the streets: courier, event setup, barback. It was during the first dot-com boom that he found his calling. Watching neighborhoods transform overnight, he convinced a small real estate firm to hire him as an unlicensed assistant. He had an uncanny memory for floor plans and an innate sense of a property's potential. He studied for his license at night and quickly carved out a niche in commercial real estate. The 2008 financial crash was his true trial by fire. While others floundered, David\u2019s street-level resourcefulness allowed him to help struggling businesses find viable spaces, building a network of loyalty that became his foundation.\n\nToday, David lives the ultimate San Francisco professional\u2019s dream: a zero-mile commute. His office is a designated space in his sleek SoMa live/work loft. His days begin not with a drive, but with a walk with his rescue terrier, Mac, to his favorite local coffee shop, where he invariably runs into a client or a contact. His life is a blur of site visits, client calls, and networking dinners. His social circle is almost indistinguishable from his professional one, built on years of trust and successful deals.\n\nAt 45, David feels a shift in his ambitions. The thrill of closing a deal is being replaced by a desire to create something lasting. His dream is to transition from agent to developer, to acquire a neglected property and build a mixed-use project that includes affordable spaces for local artisans or a community-focused non-profit. He wants to leverage his success to give back to the city that shaped him, creating a legacy that is more than just a series of transactions."

Mrs. O\u2019Connell, smelling of lavender and tweed, was trying to ask for a specific tea, but the language barrier was a wall. David, without thinking, translated her request into his father\u2019s Cantonese. The flash of gratitude on both their faces wasn\u2019t about tea; it was about connection. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t split between two worlds; he *was* the bridge. It taught him his real value lay not in choosing a side, but in understanding both.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he was a bike courier, delivering to a dusty SoMa warehouse. While waiting for a signature, he ignored the grime and saw the bones of the place: the high ceilings, the morning light hitting the brick. He could almost hear the echo of what it *could* be\u2014an office, a gallery. It was the first time he looked at a forgotten space and felt not emptiness, but a jolt of pure possibility. That feeling became his compass, pointing him toward a future he couldn't yet name.\n\n3.\nIt was 2008. The city felt bleak. Maria, who ran a tiny Panaderia in the Mission, was losing her lease. Everyone told her it was hopeless. David spent days walking the streets, calling in favors from his old courier routes. He found her a smaller, cheaper spot on a side street, convincing the landlord to take a chance. He remembers her tearful hug over the new counter. The commission was tiny, but saving a piece of the neighborhood\u2019s soul felt like winning the lottery. That success redefined wealth for him.\n\n4.\nOn his 40th birthday, he closed the biggest deal of his career, a downtown tower. His team celebrated with champagne at a rooftop bar overlooking the city lights. He felt the familiar rush of the win, but it faded quickly, replaced by a strange hollowness. Looking down at the grid, he didn't see assets or square footage. He saw thousands of individual lives, stories completely separate from his transaction. The view from the top suddenly felt incredibly lonely, sparking a deep need to reconnect with the street-level city he loved.\n\n5.\nJust last month, walking Mac past a boarded-up auto-body shop he\u2019d been eyeing for a client. He saw a young artist sketching the building\u2019s decaying sign. They chatted for a moment about the beauty in overlooked things. Walking away, the deal in his head evaporated. Instead, he saw studios with roll-up doors, a community kitchen, a place for that artist. The thrill wasn't about the transaction anymore. It was about creating a space where the city\u2019s next story could be written."
