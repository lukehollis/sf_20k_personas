            "value": "Aiko Diallo is a product of two distinct worlds, harmonized by the fog and ambition of the Bay Area. Her father, a Senegalese professor of Francophone literature at SF State, and her mother, a second-generation Japanese American ceramicist from San Jose, raised her in a Berkeley home filled with books, clay dust, and the scent of thieboudienne one night and ramen the next. This dual heritage, a blend of West African oral tradition and Japanese quiet resilience, instilled in Aiko a profound curiosity about how culture shapes a person\u2019s inner life.\n\nHer path to social work wasn\u2019t immediate. She started as a sociology major at UC Santa Cruz, fascinated by societal structures. The turning point came during her junior year when a close family friend suffered a debilitating medical diagnosis. Aiko witnessed firsthand how a compassionate hospital social worker navigated the family\u2019s terror and grief, becoming their anchor in a storm of bureaucracy and fear. It was a revelation. She saw a way to bridge her academic interests with tangible human impact. She pursued her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, specializing in clinical practice within healthcare settings.\n\nNow 25 and a newly Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Aiko\u2019s life is both intensely focused and geographically contained. Her 0.0-mile commute is a product of the post-pandemic world; she provides telehealth therapy from a dedicated corner of her small, sunny apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her days are a series of deeply confidential video calls, supporting patients navigating chronic illness, new diagnoses, and end-of-life care.\n\nTo decompress from the immense emotional weight of her work, Aiko\u2019s routine is sacred. Mornings begin with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear her head before the day\u2019s sessions. Evenings are for herself: experimenting with her parents\u2019 recipes, reading dense novels, or meeting a small circle of friends for ramen on Irving Street. Aiko dreams of one day opening a private practice specializing in cross-cultural counseling for young adults. For now, she finds fulfillment in the quiet, vital work of listening, helping others find their footing from her sanctuary just a few blocks from the park."
