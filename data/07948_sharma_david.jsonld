The only son of Indian immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, he was raised in a home filled with the scent of spices and the weight of expectation. His father, a successful software engineer, envisioned a similar path for David. However, David\u2019s trajectory was irrevocably altered in his teens when his older cousin, whom he adored, suffered a severe mental health crisis. The family\u2019s response\u2014a mixture of confusion, shame, and silence\u2014ignited in David a quiet, burning need to understand the unseen forces that shape the human mind.\n\nRejecting a future in tech, he pursued psychology at UC Berkeley, a decision that caused a gentle but persistent rift with his father. He went on to earn his Psy.D., specializing in cross-cultural psychology and trauma. For over a decade, David worked in community health clinics, dedicating himself to underserved populations. It was demanding, often heartbreaking work, but it cemented his belief in the power of compassionate listening. At 40, seeking a more sustainable pace, he opened a private practice.\n\nHe lives in a meticulously kept apartment in the Inner Sunset, which has also served as his office since the pandemic normalized telehealth. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to the comfortable leather chair in his study. The divorce from his wife, an architect, was amicable five years ago; they remain friends, co-parenting their daughter, Priya, who is now studying marine biology at UCLA. His days are a structured rhythm of 50-minute virtual sessions, punctuated by walks through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a necessary ritual to decompress.\n\nNow at 50, David finds himself in a reflective state. His connection to San Francisco is deep but quiet; he loves the anonymity of the city, the way he can be a part of its fabric without being overwhelmed. His aspirations have shifted from professional ambition to personal legacy. He dreams of writing a book aimed at destigmatizing mental healthcare within the South Asian diaspora, bridging the cultural gap that first set him on his path. He seeks not fame or fortune, but the quiet satisfaction of a life spent untangling the knots within others, and, in doing so, his own."
