Born in a quiet Oregon suburb to a Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) mother and an Irish American father, Aiko grew up navigating the subtle complexities of a mixed identity in a predominantly white community. This early experience of being a cultural bridge instilled in her a profound empathy and a fascination with how people construct their sense of self, which would later define her professional life.\n\nShe pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology before earning her Master of Social Work (MSW), driven by a desire to help others navigate the invisible systems that shape their lives. Her early career was spent in the demanding environment of a large Portland hospital, where she felt the constant strain of bureaucratic limitations. Seeking a city that better matched her inclusive values, Aiko moved to San Francisco in her late 30s, drawn to its reputation as a haven for outsiders.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 45, an amicable but deeply reshaping experience that solidified her independence and deepened her professional focus on resilience and life transitions. She settled in the Inner Sunset, falling in love with the fog-laced quiet and the proximity to Golden Gate Park. When the pandemic hit, her community health clinic shifted entirely to remote work. This change, initially jarring, ultimately suited her reflective nature.\n\nNow, at 53, Aiko\u2019s life has a calming rhythm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her small home office, overlooking a patch of green garden. Her days are a structured sequence of telehealth sessions, providing counseling to patients facing chronic illness and new diagnoses. She begins each morning with a walk through the park, finding solace in the eucalyptus groves. Her evenings are for herself\u2014reading, tending to her plants, or catching up with her adult son who lives across the bay. Aiko\u2019s future aspirations are not of radical change, but of deepening her craft. She dreams of developing a specialized practice for caregivers and finding new ways to help her clients, like herself, find peace within their own complex stories."
