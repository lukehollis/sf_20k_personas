Born and raised in San Francisco to a firefighter father and a school secretary mother, Liam\u2019s upbringing was pragmatic and grounded. His parents, deeply rooted in the city's working-class Irish-American community, hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable, practical career.\n\nRebelling quietly, Liam enrolled at SF State, not in business, but in philosophy. He spent his early twenties engrossed in existentialism while working part-time at a bookstore, feeling intellectually stimulated but professionally adrift. After graduating, a series of unfulfilling gig-economy jobs left him questioning his purpose. The turning point came while volunteering for a mental health crisis line. In the anonymous, late-night conversations, he found a profound sense of connection and utility, realizing he didn\u2019t just want to ponder the human condition; he wanted to help people navigate it.\n\nThis newfound passion gave him direction. He pursued a Master of Social Work, a rigorous path that finally synthesized his empathetic nature with a concrete skill set. After several years at an overwhelmed community health clinic, he grew weary of the bureaucracy. He took a leap of faith, becoming a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and opening a small private practice from a converted room in his apartment, a decision that dropped his commute to zero.\n\nNow 36, Liam\u2019s days are structured around his clients, who he sees both via telehealth and in person. He specializes in anxiety and life transitions, issues he understands intimately. His routine is his anchor: morning walks in Golden Gate Park, sessions with clients, and evenings spent decompressing with a book or meeting a small circle of old friends for a burrito on Clement Street. He remains deeply connected to San Francisco, not the city of tech booms, but the city of neighborhoods, resilience, and hidden struggles. His dream is simple: to continue offering a space for healing, to stay grounded in the community that raised him, and to prove that a meaningful life can be built not on grand ambitions, but on the quiet, vital work of listening."
