Raised by a union carpenter father and a teacher\u2019s aide mother, she learned early about the power of collective action and the quiet injustices faced by communities of color. The defining struggle of her youth was watching her grandmother battle type 2 diabetes, a fight exacerbated by the scarcity of fresh, affordable food and culturally competent healthcare in their neighborhood. This personal tragedy became Nia\u2019s political awakening.\n\nDriven by a fierce desire to dismantle the systems that failed her grandmother, Nia excelled academically. She earned a sociology degree from UC Berkeley, where she was an outspoken activist, before heading to the East Coast for a Master of Public Health. Her graduate thesis focused on the impact of \"food deserts\" on chronic health outcomes in urban Black communities\u2014a direct tribute to her family\u2019s experience. After a few years working for a nonprofit in New York, the pull of the Bay Area and a desire to serve her home community brought her back.\n\nHer career was a steady climb from outreach worker to her current role as Program Director. The key turning point was securing a major federal grant to launch a mobile health clinic for underserved neighborhoods in SF. Seeing it roll through the Bayview for the first time was the most profound moment of her professional life.\n\nToday, Nia lives in a bright, art-filled apartment in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute means her home is her command center, a hub of Zoom calls with city officials, late-night grant writing, and strategy sessions with community leaders. Her life is her work, a reality that contributed to the end of a serious relationship in her mid-thirties. While she\u2019s open to finding a partner who shares her values, her \"chosen family\"\u2014a tight-knit group of activists, artists, and fellow nonprofit warriors\u2014is her anchor.\n\nNia\u2019s dream is to see her initiatives become self-sustaining, creating permanent fixtures like community gardens and wellness centers. She wants to build something that will outlast her tenure and her grants. Deeply connected to the vibrant, complex soul of San Francisco, she fights daily to ensure the city\u2019s promise of innovation and progress extends to every resident, not just the privileged few."
