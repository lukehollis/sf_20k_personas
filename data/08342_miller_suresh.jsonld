His father, a white American academic from Ohio, met his mother while on a research fellowship in Chennai, India. Their marriage created a household in Berkeley that hummed with the tension and harmony of two worlds: the scent of rasam and roasting coffee, the sounds of Carnatic music and Bob Dylan. Growing up, Suresh often felt like an observer, never fully belonging to his Indian relatives' traditions nor his father's American family gatherings.\n\nHe found solace in structure. Following an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, he shied away from his father's abstract academic world and pursued a practical Master's in Library and Information Science. This degree was his entry into the burgeoning tech scene of the late 90s, not as a coder, but as an organizer of information. He was the one who built the first technical libraries and internal wikis. Over the decades, as the industry evolved, so did his role. He became what he is today: a project coordinator at a major tech firm, a quietly indispensable figure who ensures the engineers and creatives stay on track. He survived the dot-com bust by being useful, not flashy, a lesson he never forgot.\n\nA key turning point was the passing of his parents a decade ago. Suddenly, he was the sole custodian of their letters, photographs, and memories\u2014the physical archive of his own hybrid identity. This loss cemented his preference for a solitary, ordered life. He lives in a meticulously kept apartment in the Inner Richmond, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his bedroom to his standing desk.\n\nHis days follow a predictable rhythm: strong pour-over coffee, a morning of virtual meetings, a long afternoon walk through the foggy trails of Lands End, and evenings spent with a book. His social circle is small\u2014a bi-weekly trivia night at a neighborhood pub and occasional calls with his sister in Boston. Suresh\u2019s main aspiration isn't a promotion, but to finally digitize and organize his parents' entire history. He dreams of creating a private digital archive, a project that would perfectly mirror his professional skills and personal longing\u2014to finally bring order to the beautiful, complicated story of where he came from."
