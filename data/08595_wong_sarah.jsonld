Born and raised in the Richmond District, her childhood was scented with ginger, star anise, and the gentle roar of the woks from her parents\u2019 small, beloved Cantonese restaurant, \"Golden Dragon.\" She was the dutiful daughter, bussing tables after school, but her heart yearned for a world beyond the steam-filled kitchen. For her, the restaurant represented obligation, a future she was determined to avoid.\n\nAt nineteen, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, not in business, but in Art History. It was her escape. She left after two years, pulled into the vibrant, chaotic arts scene of the early 90s Mission District. With a group of friends, she co-founded a small, scrappy performance art collective, becoming its unofficial managing partner. For over a decade, she thrived on passion, grant-writing, and cheap rent, feeling a world away from her upbringing.\n\nThe turning point came when her father passed away. Her mother, lost and overwhelmed, was ready to sell the now-struggling Golden Dragon. In a moment of clarity, Sarah realized she wasn't just losing a restaurant; she was losing her family's history. She stepped in, putting her arts career on hold.\n\nBut Sarah didn\u2019t just revive the restaurant; she remade it in her own image. She renamed it \"Jade & Jook\" and transformed the space. The walls now feature a rotating gallery of local artists, and the back room hosts spoken word nights and intimate concerts. The menu fuses traditional family recipes with modern, sustainable California ingredients. Her role as \"Managing Partner in Arts\" never truly ended; it just found a new, more permanent stage.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in the apartment above the restaurant, her commute a short walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a blend of vendor negotiations and artist collaborations. Her partner, a musician she met during her Mission days, often helps curate the nightly playlists. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer to escape her past, but to build upon it, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where food supports art, and her family's legacy nurtures the city\u2019s next generation of creators."
