The children of immigrants from Hong Kong, Mei and her brother were raised amidst the quiet diligence of running a small business, their lives governed by inventory, long hours, and the expectation that they would achieve a more stable, professional success. Her parents dreamed of her becoming a doctor, a path she dutifully began at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer shift at a free clinic in the Tenderloin. It wasn't the physical ailments that captured her, but the tangled stories of trauma, addiction, and systemic neglect. She saw that true healing required more than a prescription. Defying her parents' initial disappointment, she switched her focus and pursued a Master of Social Work at SF State, finding her calling in the unseen wounds of the human psyche.\n\nFor two decades, Mei worked within the city\u2019s sprawling healthcare systems, eventually becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) embedded in an oncology department. She became an anchor for patients and families navigating the storm of diagnosis and loss. The pandemic shifted her practice entirely to telehealth, and she discovered a profound solace in working from her quiet Inner Sunset apartment, creating a sanctuary from the secondhand trauma she absorbed daily. Her 0.0-mile commute became a non-negotiable form of self-preservation.\n\nNow at 50, Mei\u2019s life is a tapestry of practiced calm. Her mornings begin with a walk through the fog in Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear her mind before a day of intense video sessions. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique weight of their work. She remains close to her aging parents, her role now shifting to that of a caregiver, a responsibility she accepts with grace. Her dream is no longer about climbing a ladder but about deepening her impact. She aspires to open a small, private practice focused on providing support for other healthcare workers, helping the healers who are so often forgotten. San Francisco isn't just her home; it\u2019s the complex, resilient community she has dedicated her life to understanding, one quiet, compassionate conversation at a time."
