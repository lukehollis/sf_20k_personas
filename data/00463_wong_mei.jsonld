The children of immigrants from Hong Kong, Mei and her brother were raised amidst the quiet diligence of running a small business, their lives governed by inventory, long hours, and the expectation that they would achieve a more stable, professional success. Her parents dreamed of her becoming a doctor, a path she dutifully began at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer shift at a free clinic in the Tenderloin. It wasn't the physical ailments that captured her, but the tangled stories of trauma, addiction, and systemic neglect. She saw that true healing required more than a prescription. Defying her parents' initial disappointment, she switched her focus and pursued a Master of Social Work at SF State, finding her calling in the unseen wounds of the human psyche.\n\nFor two decades, Mei worked within the city\u2019s sprawling healthcare systems, eventually becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) embedded in an oncology department. She became an anchor for patients and families navigating the storm of diagnosis and loss. The pandemic shifted her practice entirely to telehealth, and she discovered a profound solace in working from her quiet Inner Sunset apartment, creating a sanctuary from the secondhand trauma she absorbed daily. Her 0.0-mile commute became a non-negotiable form of self-preservation.\n\nNow at 50, Mei\u2019s life is a tapestry of practiced calm. Her mornings begin with a walk through the fog in Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear her mind before a day of intense video sessions. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique weight of their work. She remains close to her aging parents, her role now shifting to that of a caregiver, a responsibility she accepts with grace. Her dream is no longer about climbing a ladder but about deepening her impact. She aspires to open a small, private practice focused on providing support for other healthcare workers, helping the healers who are so often forgotten. San Francisco isn't just her home; it\u2019s the complex, resilient community she has dedicated her life to understanding, one quiet, compassionate conversation at a time."

He placed a calloused hand on her shoulder. \"For a doctor's hands,\" he said in Cantonese, his voice thick with hope. The weight of his dream felt heavier than the cases of soda she had to stock. It wasn't a burden of pressure, but of love, and it became the silent engine that drove her all the way to Berkeley.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, a pre-med volunteer, she was wrapping an elderly man\u2019s foot in the Tenderloin clinic. He spoke not of his physical pain, but of a loneliness so profound it felt like a terminal diagnosis. She offered gauze and antiseptic, feeling the utter inadequacy of her textbook knowledge. In that moment, she knew the most profound wounds weren't in the flesh. That was the day she stopped seeing patients as charts and started hearing them as stories, abandoning her parents' dream for a truer calling.\n\n3.\nShe was 32, sitting at her parents\u2019 kitchen table, translating a confusing Medicare document for them. Her father, who had been stoically silent about her career for years, finally looked at her clinical social worker business card. \"You help people with life's difficulties,\" he said quietly. \"A different kind of doctor.\" That small, earned acknowledgment healed a decade-old rift, finally convincing her that her path, though different, honored the very compassion they had instilled in her.\n\n4.\nShe was 45, leaving the oncology ward after a session with a young widow. The woman\u2019s raw grief clung to her like the city fog, following her on the MUNI ride home and seeping into the walls of her apartment. She sat in the dark for an hour, unable to shake the feeling of carrying it all. That night crystalized her need for a sanctuary. It was no longer about work-life balance, but about psychic survival, a realization that would eventually make her home practice non-negotiable.\n\n5.\nLast winter, walking through a deeply foggy Golden Gate Park, she stopped by the Conservatory of Flowers. The world was muffled, silent, and hers alone. She felt the prior day's tension finally unspool from her shoulders, dissolving into the mist. It wasn't an epiphany, but a quiet recognition: this ritual was her anchor. This practiced calm was the foundation upon which she could build her next chapter\u2014no longer just surviving the work, but creating a space to help other healers do the same."
