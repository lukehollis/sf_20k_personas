She was born in the Soviet port city of Vladivostok to a Russian naval engineer father and a Chinese mother, a linguist who had settled there decades earlier. Raised speaking Russian and Mandarin, Mei grew up a quiet, observant child, straddling the line between two powerful, demanding cultures. Her Soviet education was rigorous and practical; she earned a degree in industrial engineering from a state polytechnic, her path seemingly set.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 shattered that path. At 19, her degree became a relic and her future a void. With little left for her in the chaotic new Russia, she used a distant family connection to emigrate to San Francisco. The city was a shock of color, noise, and bewildering freedom. Her engineering credentials meant nothing; she was just another immigrant with broken English. For years, she worked grueling jobs\u2014cleaning kitchens, stocking shelves\u2014slowly building a new life from scratch.\n\nHer turning point came not from her old education, but from her innate disposition. Organized, pragmatic, and fluent in three languages, she found a low-level position with a shipping import/export company. Here, in the world of timetables, customs forms, and bills of lading, her mind found its rhythm. She thrived on solving logistical puzzles. Over three decades, she has become a highly efficient, entirely remote Logistics Coordinator, a crucial, unseen gear in the machine of global trade.\n\nMei lives a contained and meticulously ordered life in a small apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0-mile commute is a walk from her bedroom to her living room desk, a command center overlooking the fog-dusted rooftops. Her daily routine is a dance across time zones, coordinating shipments from Shanghai to St. Petersburg. Her social circle is small, composed mostly of other immigrants who understand the quiet pride of reinvention. She finds comfort in her neighborhood, a place where she can buy Russian rye bread from a bakery on Geary and authentic dim sum on Clement Street, a mirror of her own dual heritage. Her dream is not for wealth or recognition, but for the continued peace of a life she single-handedly built\u2014a life where every piece is finally in its right place."
