Raised in a small Ohio town by a practical, loving family, she was a quiet, observant child. While her parents encouraged good grades and sensible choices, Sarah found her voice not in words, but in sketchbooks filled with charcoal drawings and watercolors. It was her way of processing the world, a silent language no one in her family quite understood but benevolently tolerated as a \"phase.\"\n\nHer educational path was a compromise. She pursued a psychology degree at a state university, a field her parents deemed respectable, while secretly minoring in fine arts. It was in a dusty corner of the university library that she stumbled upon a book on art therapy, and her future clicked into place. This was it\u2014the synthesis of her innate need to create and her deep-seated empathy for others. She went on to earn her Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy, specializing in Art Therapy, from a progressive program in Portland.\n\nDrawn to its culture of acceptance and creativity, Sarah moved to San Francisco in her late twenties. She cut her teeth at a bustling community health clinic, but the relentless pace led to burnout. The key turning point was realizing she could create a better, more intentional healing space on her own. She took a leap of faith, becoming licensed and establishing a private practice.\n\nNow, at 43, her life and work are seamlessly integrated. Her \"commute\" is a walk across the hardwood floors of her Inner Sunset apartment to a light-filled spare room converted into her office and studio. Divorced amicably five years ago, she lives a quiet, fulfilled life with her rescue terrier, Gus. Her days are structured around virtual and in-person client sessions, where she helps others find the words they lack through paint, clay, and charcoal. Evenings are for her own art, losing herself in canvases that are purely for her own expression.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep and hyperlocal. It's the morning mist in Golden Gate Park during her walks with Gus, the familiar faces at her local bakery, and the freedom to be her authentic self. Sarah dreams not of expanding her practice, but of deepening its impact. She hopes to one day write a book for a lay audience about the healing power of everyday creativity, believing that inside everyone, there\u2019s a silent language waiting to be expressed."
