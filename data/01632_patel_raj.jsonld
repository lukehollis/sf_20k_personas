Born to third-generation Indian parents in Birmingham, England, his family relocated to Hayward, California when he was a boy. His parents were perpetually preoccupied, running a small, struggling motel off the interstate. Raj grew up feeling like a ghost in his own home, his childhood defined by the scent of chlorine and industrial cleaners. He was an unremarkable student, finding little purpose in textbooks and dropping out of community college after a single, aimless semester.\n\nAdrift at 19, he took the first job he could find: a dishwasher at a bustling Italian restaurant in Oakland. Here, surrounded by the clang of pans and the camaraderie of the line cooks, he found a structure and family he\u2019d never had. He was a relentless worker, graduating from the dish pit to prep cook, learning to butcher meat, perfect a sauce, and plate with precision. He absorbed everything, his education unfolding over stovetops and cutting boards, not in lecture halls.\n\nThe turning point came at 28 when he met Elena, a seasoned chef with a brilliant palate but no capital. She saw his raw talent and tireless work ethic. They became an inseparable team, saving every dollar for years. Their dream materialized as \"Turmeric & Thyme,\" a small, 20-seat restaurant in the Mission District, serving Californian comfort food reimagined with the spices of a South Asian pantry. They poured their life savings and a terrifying small business loan into the venture.\n\nNow 37, Raj\u2019s world is the single city block his restaurant occupies. With a 0.0-mile commute, he lives in the small apartment directly above the dining room. His day begins before dawn with trips to the market and ends late at night after scrubbing the kitchen down himself. His staff is his family, his business partner Elena his most trusted confidante. His connection to San Francisco isn't about landmarks; it's the intimate knowledge of his produce vendors, the greetings from neighboring shop owners, and the loyalty of his regulars. He dreams of earning a Michelin star\u2014not for ego, but as validation for his team\u2019s hard work. Raj\u2019s aspiration is simple: to keep the doors open and continue building a life, plate by delicious plate, in the only true home he\u2019s ever known."
