The only child of Indian immigrants\u2014a software engineer father and a meticulous homemaker mother\u2014her upbringing was a study in high expectations and academic discipline. While her peers were drawn to the promise of tech, Anika was captivated by a different kind of code: the invisible patterns of disease. A childhood memory of watching a news report on a cholera outbreak in a distant village, her parents\u2019 homeland hauntingly familiar, ignited a quiet but fierce determination to understand how communities are protected.\n\nThis led her to UC Davis for her undergraduate degree and later to UC Berkeley for a Master of Public Health, specializing in epidemiology. Graduating, she consciously rejected the suburban life she knew. She craved the city's chaotic, vibrant pulse and found a rent-controlled apartment in NoPa, steps from the Panhandle. This was her declaration of independence. Her career began at a public health non-profit, analyzing datasets to predict flu season severity and track chronic illnesses. Her days were a quiet rhythm of data visualization and statistical modeling from her home office, a routine she cherished for its focus.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was the defining turning point of her career. The quiet rhythm shattered, replaced by a relentless 24/7 crisis. Anika worked with a state-level task force, her models directly informing public policy. The work was vital but utterly consuming, pushing her to the brink of burnout. It solidified her purpose but also taught her a harsh lesson about her own limits.\n\nNow, at 35, Anika is rebuilding a life of intentional balance. Her 0.0-mile commute remains, but her days are structured differently. Mornings start with tea and a walk to Alamo Square, watching the city wake up before diving into her analysis of long-COVID data. Her social life is a small, cherished circle of friends from grad school and a weekly yoga class in the Mission. She dreams not of climbing a corporate ladder, but of one day taking a sabbatical to work with a global health initiative in Southeast Asia, bringing her story full circle. Anika\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of chosen sanctuary; a city that gave her the freedom to build a life, and the resilience to reclaim it."
