Raised across the bay in a Fremont cul-de-sac, she was the quiet observer in a home defined by cultural fusion. Her mother, a pragmatic first-generation Chinese-American engineer, and her father, a thoughtful Irish-American high school history teacher, gave her a dual lens on life. She learned early to navigate different communication styles and unspoken emotional currents, a skill that would later define her career.\n\nHer path was set in high school, not by a specific class, but by witnessing her father\u2019s quiet, persistent battle with depression after a series of school budget cuts threatened his job. The experience stripped away her teenage na\u00efvet\u00e9, replacing it with a fierce desire to understand the invisible struggles that shape people\u2019s lives. This drive propelled her through an accelerated program at UC Berkeley, where she earned her Bachelor\u2019s in Social Welfare and seamlessly transitioned into their Master of Social Work (MSW) program. She was relentless in accumulating her 3,000 hours of supervised clinical experience, becoming a fully licensed LCSW by an age when most of her peers were just starting their careers.\n\nNow, Sarah\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of her cozy Hayes Valley studio apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern reality of telehealth. Her days are a structured sequence of video calls with clients grappling with anxiety, identity issues, and the unique pressures of Bay Area life. Between sessions, she recharges by tending to her numerous houseplants or taking long, meandering walks to Alamo Square, finding comfort in the city\u2019s painted ladies and persistent fog.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a tight-knit group of friends from grad school who share her passion and understand the emotional toll of their work. Sarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its vibrant social scene and more about its spirit of acceptance. As a woman of mixed heritage who doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any box, she feels at home in a city that celebrates complexity. Her dream is to one day open a small, community-focused private practice, creating a physical healing space for young adults much like herself\u2014a quiet anchor in a loud, chaotic world."
