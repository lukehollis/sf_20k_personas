The son of an electrician and a dental hygienist, he grew up with a practical, hands-on understanding of how things worked. He was a quiet, observant kid who preferred taking apart old radios to playing team sports, fascinated by the intricate systems hidden from view.\n\nHis path to technology was accidental. At UC Santa Cruz, he pursued a degree in Communications, drawn to the art of storytelling and media theory rather than engineering. He graduated in the late 90s with vague dreams of working in documentary film, but the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom proved irresistible. He took a temp job in Quality Assurance at a burgeoning startup, a role that perfectly suited his meticulous nature. He found satisfaction in identifying flaws and ensuring a polished final product.\n\nThe dot-com bust was his key turning point. While idealistic founders and flashy marketers vanished, David, the reliable guy who ensured the code actually worked, remained. He had proven his value. Over the next two decades, he steadily climbed the operational ladder, moving from QA to project coordination and finally to Production Supervisor. He was never the visionary, but the essential manager who translated visions into reality, coordinating teams of engineers and designers across time zones.\n\nNow, at 46, David lives alone in a meticulously kept one-bedroom apartment in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a double-edged sword; the freedom of working from home is often blurred into a life of perpetual availability. His routine is disciplined: a pre-dawn run through the Presidio, coffee at his favorite local spot, and then a day of back-to-back video calls from his standing desk. Divorced for five years, his social life is a small, tight circle of old friends, most from outside the tech world.\n\nHe feels like a quiet observer of the city he\u2019s long called home, watching the waves of change from his peaceful neighborhood. His aspirations have shifted from career advancement to finding balance. He dreams of taking a real, disconnected vacation, reviving his old passion for photography, and one day having a job where he can shut his laptop at 5 PM and feel his day is truly his own."
