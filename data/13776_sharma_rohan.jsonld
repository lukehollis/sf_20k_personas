The eldest son of immigrants from Jaipur, India, he grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of San Francisco's Sunset District. His parents ran a small corner grocery store, a business that smelled of cardamom and cleaning supplies, and it was there Rohan learned his first lessons in inventory and customer service. The unspoken family dream was for Rohan to achieve a white-collar success they never could, a goal symbolized by a four-year university degree.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State University, dutifully pursuing a degree in Business Administration. For two years, he juggled classes with shifts at the family store. The turning point came during his junior year when his father suffered a health crisis, necessitating a long recovery. With medical bills mounting and the store needing a steady hand, Rohan made the difficult decision to leave school. He took a full-time job at a large downtown retail chain, promising himself it was temporary.\n\nHowever, \"temporary\" stretched on. Rohan discovered a natural talent for retail management. He was organized, calm under pressure, and had an intuitive understanding of people\u2014both staff and customers. Promotions followed, culminating in his current role as Assistant Store Manager. The $65,000 salary provides a stable, if modest, life, allowing him to help his parents while maintaining his own small apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHis daily routine is a familiar SF rhythm: an early alarm, a brisk walk to the Muni stop on Geary, and the 2.5-mile bus ride downtown. His days are a blur of shipment logs, staff scheduling, and de-escalating customer complaints. Socially, he remains close to a tight-knit group of high school friends and his family, sharing weekly dinners.\n\nWhile he\u2019s proud of the stability he\u2019s built, a quiet longing for his original path remains. Rohan\u2019s dream is to finish his degree online, not just for the credential, but for himself. His ultimate aspiration is to leverage his practical experience and formal education to buy his own business one day\u2014perhaps a modern, upscale grocery, honoring his family\u2019s roots while building a legacy of his own in the city that is etched into his identity."

The air was thick with the scent of his mother\u2019s chai brewing behind the counter and the sharp smell of floor polish. His father showed him how to face the labels forward, a small lesson in presentation that felt like a secret rite. It wasn\u2019t a chore; it was the rhythm of his family. That sense of order, of putting things right for others, settled deep inside him and never left.\n\n2.\nHis corporate finance textbook lay on the kitchen table, its spine still stiff. His mother, her face etched with worry after visiting the hospital, didn\u2019t have to ask. \"I'll take a semester off,\" he said, the words tasting like a lie even then. \"Just until Dad is better.\" The look of relief on her face was both a comfort and a cage. That evening, he quietly exchanged the dream his parents had for him for the duty he had to them, a trade that defined his adulthood.\n\n3.\nIt was his third Black Friday. The registers were down, a customer was yelling, and a new hire was close to tears in the stockroom. While others panicked, a strange calm descended on Rohan. He methodically rerouted the line, soothed the irate man with a store credit, and had the systems rebooted in ten minutes. His manager later said, \"You're a natural, Sharma.\" For the first time, he felt a surge of pride in this accidental life, a competence that was entirely his own.\n\n4.\nThe 38 Geary bus often passes kids with SF State sweatshirts, laughing and stressed about finals. Rohan sees them and feels the phantom weight of a backpack on his own shoulders. He remembers the feeling of walking across that campus, the future seeming like a clear, straight path. The sight brings a familiar, quiet ache\u2014not of regret, but of longing for a version of himself he\u2019d promised to one day finish. The bus ride is a daily reminder of that promise.\n\n5.\nLast year, a friend dragged him into a new grocery in Noe Valley. It was all polished concrete, local produce artfully displayed, and a curated aisle of international spices. He saw his father\u2019s diligence in the neat shelves and his own managerial skill in the efficient layout. It wasn't just a store; it was a vision. In that moment, surrounded by artisanal olive oils and bags of premium basmati rice, his vague yearning sharpened into a concrete goal. This, he thought, feeling a thrill of possibility. This is what I could build."
