Raised in Fremont, the son of Indian immigrants who saw success through the lens of engineering and medicine, Ravi was a quieter, more observant child. He was less interested in circuits and biology than in how the sprawling suburbs of his youth connected\u2014or failed to connect\u2014people. This fascination led him to San Francisco State University to study Public Policy, where he felt he was finally decoding the language of the community he loved.\n\nHis academic path was cut short during his junior year when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. As the eldest son, Ravi left school without hesitation to take a full-time job and help his mother manage their finances and care. The dream of a degree was deferred, but his passion for public service was not. He found an entry-level administrative position with the city, and through sheer diligence and a genuine talent for listening to people\u2019s frustrations, he worked his way up to his current role as a Community Liaison for the SFMTA.\n\nNow at 31, Ravi is a fixture in the Mission District, living in a small, rent-controlled apartment. His 3.8-mile commute on the 14-Mission bus isn't just a trip; it's fieldwork. He sees the overcrowding, hears the complaints, and feels the daily pulse of the city\u2019s circulatory system. His job is to be the bridge between bureaucratic planning and the lived reality of riders, a role he finds both draining and deeply rewarding.\n\nRecently out of a long-term relationship, Ravi pours his energy into his work and a tight-knit circle of friends he meets for rec league soccer at Garfield Park or trivia nights at a local bar. He\u2019s a pragmatic idealist, keenly aware of the city's flaws but fiercely devoted to its improvement. While he still hopes to finish his degree online one day, his true aspiration has grown: he dreams of running for District Supervisor. He believes real change comes not from the top down, but from the streets up, and he\u2019s determined to be the person who ensures everyone\u2019s voice is heard on the ride."

He didn't mourn the grass; he felt a strange unease watching the new fences go up, like walls between unheard stories. It was the first time he wondered not *what* was being built, but *who* was being connected, or cut off. That question, born from suburban sprawl, would follow him to San Francisco and define his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent hum of the hospital waiting room when he was twenty. His mother\u2019s quiet sobs were the only other sound. In his lap sat a public policy textbook, its theories on community suddenly feeling hollow and distant. He looked from the abstract words to his mother\u2019s face, a map of real, immediate need. In that moment, the decision was made without being spoken. He closed the book. His sense of duty became heavier, more tangible, than any degree.\n\n3.\nA year into his SFMTA job, an elderly woman, Mrs. Chen, had called for weeks about a broken light at her bus shelter. Ravi made it his mission, hounding the maintenance department until it was fixed. The following Monday, he saw her waiting for her bus under the new, bright light. She met his eyes across the street, offered a small, formal nod, and then smiled. In that silent exchange, Ravi felt more accomplished than in any classroom. It proved his diverted path had profound meaning.\n\n4.\nLast winter, on a rain-soaked 14-Mission, the bus was a crush of damp coats and frustration. A young mother struggled with a stroller and a crying child. Before Ravi could even move, an older man in work boots helped her fold it as a teenager immediately gave up their seat. No words were exchanged, just tired, knowing glances. In that moment of spontaneous, anonymous grace, Ravi felt a fierce surge of love for the city. This was the messy, human system he fought for.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, after a brutal community meeting, he was venting to his soccer friends at Garfield Park. He laid out all the bureaucratic nonsense, the missed connections, the unheard voices. His friend clapped him on the shoulder and said, \"Man, you should just run yourself.\" The words hung in the cool evening air. It was half a joke, but it landed like a prophecy. For the first time, Ravi saw a path not just to serve the system, but to lead it."
