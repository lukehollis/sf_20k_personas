Born in Fremont to Gujarati immigrants, his childhood was steeped in the scent of spices and the quiet diligence of running a family-owned convenience store. His parents envisioned a future for him in engineering or medicine, a stable path they had sacrificed everything for. Ravi, however, was drawn to the world of words. He attended San Francisco State University, secretly majoring in English Literature, dreaming of a life as a poet or professor.\n\nThis bachelor\u2019s degree is the \"unknown\" chapter of his life, a source of both pride and melancholy. The turning point came during his senior year when his father suffered a major health crisis, forcing Ravi to leave his studies and help manage the family business. The dream of academia was shelved, replaced by the immediate reality of invoices and inventory.\n\nAfter his father recovered, Ravi never returned to his literary path. He found he had a natural talent for hospitality and management, a skill honed by years of watching his parents. He worked his way through various restaurant jobs, eventually landing his current role as the manager of a bustling, high-end bistro located within a large retail market in Hayes Valley.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of his life; he lives in a quiet, rent-controlled apartment directly above the store. His days are a predictable rhythm: a pre-dawn walk through the still-sleeping neighborhood, unlocking the restaurant, briefing his staff, and overseeing the controlled chaos of service. Amicably divorced fifteen years ago and with no children, his staff has become his surrogate family. He's the stern but fair father figure, mentoring young chefs and servers.\n\nRavi\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and intense. He knows the names of the delivery drivers, the habits of his regulars, and the subtle shifts of his Hayes Valley block. His grand literary aspirations have faded, replaced by more tangible hopes: to see his lead server get into culinary school, to save enough for a long trip to visit his ancestral village in India, and to simply enjoy a quiet evening on his fire escape, reading a well-worn novel and listening to the city settle below."
