Born in Shiraz, Iran, he and his family fled the upheaval of the revolution in 1980, settling in Alameda when he was six. His father, a civil engineer in Iran, became a respected auto mechanic in the East Bay, and Cyrus\u2019s childhood was filled with the smell of oil and the satisfying click of a wrench tightening a bolt. He inherited his father\u2019s aptitude for mechanics but was drawn to the elemental power of joining metal with fire and electricity.\n\nWhile his friends pursued four-year degrees, Cyrus found his calling at Laney College, earning an Associate's in Welding and Fabrication. He loved the integrity of the craft: a weld was either strong or it wasn\u2019t. There was no room for bluffing. He started as an apprentice fabricator at a small shop in SoMa and, over two decades, honed his skills, eventually becoming the Lead Fabricator for a large-scale architectural metalworking company in the Bayview district.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce at 36. His ex-wife, a programmer, had never understood his dedication to a blue-collar profession, pressuring him to pivot into management or sales. The split was amicable but firm, cementing in Cyrus a quiet pride in his chosen path and a preference for a solitary, ordered life.\n\nToday, Cyrus lives in a small but immaculate one-bedroom apartment in Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial bones resonate with him. His daily routine is a ritual. He\u2019s up at 5:30 a.m., sips strong coffee while reading technical journals, and by 7:00, he\u2019s firing up his Triumph motorcycle. The 6.5-mile ride through city streets is his meditation, a blast of freedom before a day of intense focus. At work, he leads a team of ten, respected for his calm demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of alloys and stress points.\n\nHis social life is small and tight-knit: beers with his crew on Fridays, a monthly poker game, and occasional dinners with his sister\u2019s family in San Mateo. His dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to save enough to buy a small plot of land in Sonoma County. There, he envisions building a workshop from the ground up, where he can spend his retirement crafting custom motorcycle frames and bespoke metal furniture\u2014creating things of permanence and beauty, entirely on his own terms."

His father, a man who once designed bridges, pointed to a simple bolt. The satisfying *click* as it tightened felt like a secret language he suddenly understood. In that moment, he didn't just see a mechanic; he saw his father building a new world, one piece at a time. It taught him that dignity lived in your hands.\n\n2.\nHe recalls the intense blue-white light of the TIG torch at Laney College, the hum vibrating in his chest. For weeks his welds were sloppy, frustrating. Then, one afternoon, it all synchronized. He guided the torch, feeding the rod, and laid down a perfect, shimmering bead\u2014a stack of dimes. It wasn't just metal; it was order fused from chaos. In that flawless seam, he saw a truth more honest and permanent than any textbook his friends were reading. He knew he\u2019d found his craft.\n\n3.\nThe first morning after his wife moved out, he woke at 5:30 in his new Dogpatch apartment. The silence was absolute. He expected a hollow ache, but instead found a profound calm. Making his coffee, he looked at his calloused hands, the ones she saw as a limitation. He saw them as his truth. The faint industrial hum from the street outside felt like a welcome. It wasn\u2019t a morning of loss, but of quiet, firm reclamation. He was exactly where he was supposed to be.\n\n4.\nHe stood across from the Public Safety Building in Mission Bay on a rare day off. His team had fabricated the massive, perforated metal screens that formed its skin. He remembered the arguments over alloys, the stress calculations, the sweat. Now, seeing the sun filter through the complex patterns he helped bring to life, he felt an anonymous, immense pride. His work was part of the city\u2019s bones, a permanent, functional piece of beauty. It was a legacy stronger than any title or salary.\n\n5.\nHe was riding his Triumph north of Petaluma last autumn, the engine a perfect thrum against the golden hills. He pulled over by a field with a lone oak tree and killed the engine. The air smelled of dry grass and distant woodsmoke. In the sudden silence, the vision hit him with crystalline clarity: a small workshop right there. The sound of his own welder, the scent of hot steel, the freedom to build what he wanted. It wasn't a dream of retirement, but of a final, perfect purpose."
