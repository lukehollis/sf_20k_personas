The only child of Indian immigrants, her father an electrical engineer and her mother a lab technician, Sarah was raised in a world of high expectations. The prescribed path was clear: a STEM degree from a top UC school, followed by a lucrative, stable career in Silicon Valley.\n\nFor a time, Sarah tried to fit the mold. However, a high school volunteer position at a shelter for unhoused families planted a seed of dissent. Witnessing the systemic barriers and quiet desperation of people just miles from tech-industry wealth became a pivotal turning point. She enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, initially undeclared, before committing to a Bachelor's in Sociology, a choice that caused a rift with her pragmatic parents. For them, it was a path to financial uncertainty; for Sarah, it was a calling.\n\nAfter graduating, she took an entry-level job at a nonprofit in Oakland before landing her current role as a Case Manager in San Francisco. She chose to live where she worked, finding a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Tenderloin, just two blocks from her agency\u2019s office. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her commitment; she is not just an employee in the community, but a resident.\n\nHer days are a whirlwind of navigating bureaucracy, connecting clients with housing resources, and offering a steady presence in moments of crisis. The emotional toll is immense, but she finds solace in her routine: a morning coffee from a corner cafe, an evening run through the Panhandle, and weekend potlucks with a tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom also work in social services. Her relationship with her parents has slowly mended; they now see the profound impact of her work, even if they still worry.\n\nAt 31, Sarah dreams of a future beyond individual cases. She hopes to one day pursue a Master's in Public Policy, wanting to dismantle the broken systems she fights against daily. She loves San Francisco not for its landmarks, but for its resilience and the vibrant, complex humanity she serves on its streets every day."
