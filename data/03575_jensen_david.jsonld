Raised by a high school science teacher and a librarian, his childhood was a quiet immersion in the natural world, spent exploring forested trails and learning the names of native flora and fauna. This upbringing instilled in him a deep, almost cellular, respect for the environment, viewing it not as a resource to be exploited but as a complex system to be understood and protected.\n\nHis path led him south to California for his graduate studies at UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master of Science in Environmental Management. The Bay Area's blend of intellectual rigor and progressive environmental policy felt like a natural fit. After graduating, David took a position at a large environmental services firm in downtown San Francisco. For a decade, he navigated the corporate world, working on environmental impact reports for major development projects. While the work was challenging, he grew increasingly disillusioned by the compromises and the corporate \"greenwashing\" that often prioritized compliance over genuine conservation.\n\nThe turning point came at 38. After a particularly disheartening project, he resigned, cashing in his savings to launch his own independent consultancy from his home. It was a quiet rebellion, a reclaiming of his original purpose. Now, at 47, David operates from a sunlit office in his Inner Sunset apartment, overlooking a small, meticulously kept garden. His 0.0-mile commute offers a life of intention. Mornings begin with a run through Golden Gate Park, which he considers the very lung of the city, before he settles in for a day of analyzing data, advising non-profits, and helping smaller companies develop sustainable practices.\n\nSocially, David maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow academics and outdoor enthusiasts. His romantic life has been a series of meaningful but ultimately divergent paths; he is comfortable in his own company but remains open. His deepest connection is to his neighborhood and the city\u2019s green spaces. His dream isn't of wealth, but of legacy: to one day lead a pro-bono restoration project for a Bay Area wetland, a tangible gift back to the ecosystem that first drew him here."

The cold dread that settled in his stomach was the feeling of being complicit. He saw his father\u2019s disappointed face in the reflection of the screen. That evening, at 38, he drafted his resignation. It wasn't just leaving a job; it was a desperate act to reclaim the boy from Oregon who cared more about frogs than profit margins. It set him on his current path.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe first Monday morning after quitting, age 38. Instead of a sterile office, he was in Golden Gate Park. The smell of eucalyptus and damp earth was overwhelming after a decade of recycled air. He stopped running, hands on his knees, not from exhaustion but from the sheer, crushing relief of it. The fog felt like a cleansing baptism. This run wasn't an escape from his day; for the first time in years, it *was* his day. This memory is the cornerstone of his new, intentional life.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe was nine, turning over a damp log with his father. Beneath it, a rough-skinned newt, impossibly orange. His dad didn't just name it; he explained its toxic skin as a defense, a small but powerful story of survival. Holding its delicate weight in his palm, David felt he\u2019d been let in on a secret of the forest. This quiet, foundational moment of awe is why he sees ecosystems not as lines on a map, but as a collection of intricate, interdependent stories worth protecting.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe recalls standing on a high-rise balcony in SoMa with a former partner, around age 42. She spoke of promotions and city lights, a life lived above it all. He just kept looking down at the tiny, manicured park below, thinking of the soil. There was no anger in their eventual parting, only a quiet, sad recognition that she wanted the view from the window, and he wanted to be the one tending the garden. He learned then that his roots ran too deep to be a potted plant.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast summer, while sipping his morning coffee, he saw it. A Western tiger swallowtail, fluttering over the native pipevine he\u2019d planted two years prior. It was a small, fleeting moment, but it felt like a profound validation. He hadn\u2019t just created a garden; he had created a habitat, however tiny. This quiet triumph, at 46, confirmed his purpose wasn't in grand corporate reports, but in these tangible, living results. It was a microcosm of his ultimate dream, right outside his window."
