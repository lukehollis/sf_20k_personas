Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants who ran a small grocery store, she inherited their relentless work ethic and an intimate understanding of the sacrifices required for a small business to survive. Her parents, hoping for a more stable path for her, were proud when she earned a Bachelor's in Business Administration from San Jose State.\n\nShe tried the corporate world for three years, a blur of spreadsheets and meetings in a sterile San Jose tech park that felt profoundly disconnected from real life. The turning point came during her divorce at 29; she realized her stable-but-passionless life was a construct for others. She quit her job, moved to San Francisco, and took a server position at a trattoria in Hayes Valley just to pay the bills. To her surprise, she thrived in the controlled chaos. She loved the immediate feedback of a happy diner, the camaraderie of the kitchen staff, and the tangible result of a well-executed service.\n\nHer business degree wasn't wasted. She quickly identified inefficiencies and impressed the owners with her sharp mind and calm demeanor under pressure. Over a decade, she rose from server to assistant manager and, five years ago, became the General Manager. Her life is now intricately woven into the fabric of the restaurant. Since her commute is a 0.0-mile walk downstairs, her days start with coffee while reviewing inventory emails and end long after the last table has left, often sharing a glass of wine with the head chef to deconstruct the night.\n\nAt 43, her social life is a tight-knit circle of staff and industry peers. She feels a fierce, maternal protectiveness over her \"work family.\" While she sometimes misses the idea of a conventional life, she finds deep satisfaction in her domain. Her dream isn't to escape but to elevate\u2014perhaps to become a part-owner one day. For now, she is the quiet, essential heartbeat of one of Hayes Valley's most beloved dining spots, her world thriving in the space between the front door and the kitchen."
