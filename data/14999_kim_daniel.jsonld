The eldest son of Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Daly City, Daniel spent his childhood as the family\u2019s de facto translator and cultural navigator. From arguing with landlords to filling out medical forms, he witnessed firsthand how language and poverty could become insurmountable barriers. His parents urged him toward medicine, a stable and respected path, and he dutifully enrolled as pre-med at UC Davis.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer shift at a student-run clinic. Daniel found himself far more interested in helping a non-English-speaking family access housing resources than he was in diagnosing their child\u2019s flu. He switched his major to Sociology the next semester, a decision that initially disappointed his parents but ignited a true passion within him. He later earned his Master of Social Work from SF State, focusing on children and families.\n\nNow 39, Daniel is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for the San Francisco Unified School District. His 2.3-mile bicycle commute from his Inner Richmond apartment takes him through Golden Gate Park, a brief, green respite before a day spent navigating crises. He helps students struggling with everything from housing insecurity and trauma to learning disabilities, acting as the crucial link between the school, healthcare systems, and social services.\n\nHis life is structured and intentional. Evenings are for decompressing\u2014a run around Stow Lake, cooking simple Korean dishes that remind him of his mother, and connecting with his close circle of friends, many of whom also work in service-oriented fields. Though single, he maintains deep, supportive relationships.\n\nDaniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is complex. He loves its diversity and progressive ideals but is acutely aware of the deep inequality his work confronts daily. He isn\u2019t chasing a tech fortune; his dream is to one day move into a policy-advising role, using his frontline experience to advocate for systemic changes that could help families long before they reach a breaking point. He remains in the city not for its glamour, but for the fundamental, human work that needs to be done."

Daniel, translating, had to make his own child\u2019s voice firm, arguing about the broken radiator his parents had already reported twice. He felt the weight of their discomfort, their shame at needing their son to fight for basic warmth. It wasn't helplessness he felt, but a cold, burning anger. That day, he learned that justice wasn\u2019t given; it had to be demanded in the right language.\n\n2.\nAt the UC Davis student clinic, the pre-med checklist in his head\u2014fever, cough, duration\u2014vanished. The little girl had the flu, but her mother\u2019s real sickness was fear; her eyes pleaded for help with an eviction notice, not a prescription. In that moment, scribbling a housing resource number on a pamphlet felt more healing than any diagnosis ever could. He walked out of the clinic at age 20 knowing he wasn't meant to mend bodies, but to mend the systems that broke families. The relief was terrifying and absolute.\n\n3.\nThe silence after he told his parents he was dropping pre-med was heavier than any argument. His father walked away, but his mother stayed. Later that night, without a word, she placed a bowl of his favorite *jjigae* before him. It wasn't forgiveness, not yet, but it was a bridge. It was her way of saying, *'I don't understand your path, but you are still my son.'* He remembers the steam warming his face, a silent promise to make her proud in his own way.\n\n4.\nHis first year at SFUSD, he was assigned a third-grader, newly arrived from El Salvador, who refused to speak in class. Daniel saw the boy\u2019s parents, exhausted and overwhelmed by the city, and recognized the familiar fear. He spent weeks just sitting with the family, speaking slowly, bringing them forms he had already filled out. The day the boy finally whispered 'gracias' to him was not a victory, but a quiet affirmation. At 28, he was finally the person his own family had so desperately needed.\n\n5.\nJust last Tuesday morning, he coasted his bike past the Conservatory of Flowers. The world was muted grey and green, the air thick with eucalyptus and damp earth. He was heading to a parent meeting he knew would be contentious, a battle of limited resources and raw emotions. For those five minutes, cocooned in the park\u2019s quiet embrace, he wasn't a social worker. He was just a man breathing, gathering the peace he knew he would need to give away for the rest of the day."
