His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a creaky flight of stairs from his second-floor apartment to the ground-floor space of \"The Painted Nest,\" his small, arts-focused preschool in the Mission District.\n\nRaised in the quiet, manicured suburbs of Walnut Creek, David was the son of a pragmatic accountant who guided him toward a degree in Business Administration. David dutifully followed the plan, spending his twenties and early thirties in the sterile ambition of San Francisco\u2019s burgeoning 90s tech scene. He wore the suits, sat through the meetings, and felt a profound hollowness. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s, which cost him his job, felt less like a disaster and more like a parole hearing.\n\nAdrift and disillusioned, he began volunteering at a community center\u2019s after-school program. It was there, helping a group of six-year-olds create messy, wonderful clay monsters, that something clicked. The uninhibited joy and raw creativity were a powerful antidote to years of optimizing spreadsheets. This was his turning point. He used his severance to get a certificate in early childhood education, focusing on art therapy.\n\nHe met his partner, Mateo, a community garden organizer, during this time. Together, they embodied a different San Francisco dream. They pooled their savings a decade ago to buy the mixed-use building, transforming the former corner store into a vibrant school and making the apartment above their home.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are a whirlwind of finger paints, storytelling, and navigating the emotional landscapes of three- and four-year-olds. Evenings are quiet: dinner with Mateo, tending to their rooftop container garden, and listening to the sounds of the neighborhood. His connection to San Francisco isn't in its iconic skyline but in the murals of Clarion Alley and the families who entrust him with their children. David's aspiration is simple: to keep the doors of The Painted Nest open, fostering a space where creativity is valued above all else. He isn\u2019t building a fortune; he\u2019s building a quiet legacy, one glitter-covered masterpiece at a time."
