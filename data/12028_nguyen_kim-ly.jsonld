Born in 1971 in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, she was only four years old when a chaotic escape from Vietnam defined her family\u2019s future. After a harrowing journey and time in a refugee camp, her family was sponsored and settled in San Jose. Watching her parents navigate a new world with fierce determination, yet stumble against language and cultural barriers, instilled in Kim-Ly a profound sense of purpose. She would be a bridge for others.\n\nThis drive led her to pursue social work, earning her undergraduate degree at SF State and a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Her early career was spent on the front lines as a caseworker for immigrant and refugee youth in the Mission District. Her shared experience gave her an almost immediate rapport with families wrestling with trauma and systemic challenges. She was tough but deeply empathetic, known for her ability to secure resources others deemed impossible.\n\nA key turning point was a difficult divorce in her late thirties, a period that coincided with a major promotion. The strain of her demanding career had contributed to the marital split, leaving her to raise her son largely on her own. Instead of breaking her, the experience solidified her independence and deepened her resolve. She poured her energy into her work and her son, rising steadily through the ranks.\n\nToday, Kim-Ly lives in a quiet but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her son is now grown and attending college in San Diego, leaving her with an empty nest she fills with purpose. Her daily routine is grounded: an early morning walk in Golden Gate Park, then the #38-Geary bus to her downtown office. As the Director of Behavioral Health Services, she manages budgets, mentors a new generation of social workers, and shapes policy that affects thousands of students. Evenings often involve cooking simple Vietnamese dishes that remind her of her mother, and weekends are for the farmers' market and dinners with a small, tight-knit circle of female friends. Her dream is to one day return to Vietnam, not as a refugee, but as a visitor, to see her homeland through eyes of peace and understanding."

What she recalls most clearly is the texture of her mother\u2019s black silk *\u00e1o b\u00e0 ba* against her cheek. Huddled in her mother\u2019s lap, the scent of diesel and fear was everywhere, but that small patch of familiar fabric smelled of home. It wasn\u2019t a memory of trauma, but of an anchor in a terrifying sea. It was the first, deepest lesson in how a small, steady presence can make the unbearable, bearable.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe was a teenager from El Salvador, mute with trauma for weeks in her Mission District office. One afternoon, she brought a small bowl of *ch\u00e8 chu\u1ed1i*, the sweet coconut pudding her own mother made. He stared, then tentatively took a bite. \"Gracias,\" he whispered. In that one word, she felt her entire past\u2014the boat, the strange new country\u2014transform into a bridge, not a barrier. It was the moment that affirmed her life's purpose, a quiet exchange that felt louder than any policy meeting.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe call confirming her promotion to a senior role came on a Tuesday. She stood in her kitchen, phone pressed to her ear, staring at the empty space where her ex-husband\u2019s coffee maker used to be. The elation of professional success crashed against the profound silence of her new life. In that jarring moment, she felt both utterly alone and fiercely capable. It was the instant her grief began hardening into resolve, the realization that she, and she alone, was the architect of her and her son\u2019s future.\n\n***\n\n4.\nAfter leaving her son at his dorm in San Diego, the drive back felt impossibly long. She didn't cry. Instead, she remembered his confident wave goodbye. Pulling over at a vista point overlooking the ocean, she felt a quiet click, like a lock settling into place. Her most important project\u2014raising him to be a good man\u2014was complete. The emptiness of her apartment wouldn't be a void, but a clear, open space. She had gotten him safely to his own shore.\n\n***\n\n5.\nIt\u2019s a Sunday evening, the Richmond fog pressing against her windows. The rich scent of star anise, cinnamon, and charred ginger from the simmering ph\u1edf broth fills her kitchen. The aroma is her mother\u2019s kitchen in San Jose, a ghost of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u she never truly knew. In that scent, she isn\u2019t a Director or a San Franciscan; she is just her mother\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s a quiet act of defiance and remembrance, a reminder that the flavors of home can sustain you anywhere in the world."
