Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a history professor father and a librarian mother, David\u2019s childhood was quiet and ordered. That order was shattered when his younger sister battled a severe case of meningitis at age nine. While his parents focused on her bedside, a terrified 14-year-old David became fascinated by the hospital itself\u2014a chaotic, yet functional, ecosystem. He saw not the medicine, but the logistics: the flow of patients, the scheduling of nurses, the supply chain for sterile gauze. It was there he found his calling, not as a healer, but as a guardian of the system that allows healing to happen.\n\nHe pursued a business undergraduate degree followed by a Master of Health Administration (MHA), his focus unwavering. He was recruited by a major San Francisco medical center right out of his graduate program and has been there ever since, methodically climbing the ranks. The key turning point in his life was a promotion five years ago to Operations Manager, which came with an offer to lease a modern apartment in a hospital-owned building directly across the street. His commute became a 90-second walk.\n\nThis proximity defines David's current existence. His life is his work. He wakes before sunrise, his window offering a panoramic view of the city he rarely explores, and is often the last manager to leave the campus. His social circle consists almost entirely of colleagues\u2014doctors he coordinates with, nurses he supports. A long-term relationship dissolved years ago, unable to compete with the constant demands of the hospital. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t through its parks or cafes, but through the diverse patient population his hospital serves and the city lights he sees from his office window late at night.\n\nHis dream is not one of escape, but of perfection. He fantasizes about implementing a new intake protocol that shaves seven minutes off ER wait times. At 41, a quiet part of him sometimes wonders about the life happening in the glittering city below, but then a code is called or a logistical puzzle presents itself, and David is exactly where he needs to be."
