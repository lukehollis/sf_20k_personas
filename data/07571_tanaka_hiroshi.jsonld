A fourth-generation Japanese-American, Hiroshi grew up in Japantown, caught between his parents' pragmatic hopes of him joining the tech boom and the quiet, traditional world of his grandmother, his *obaachan*. He was always closer to her, listening to her stories of post-war San Francisco while helping her tend to orchids in her small apartment.\n\nUnsure of his path, he pursued an Associate's degree in Graphic Design from City College, thinking his artistic eye might find a commercial outlet. But the work felt hollow, creating logos for companies he didn't care about. The true turning point came when his *obaachan*'s health began to fail. Hiroshi became her primary caregiver, a role that felt more natural and meaningful than any design project. He learned to manage medications, provide comfort, and, most importantly, to listen with profound empathy.\n\nAfter she passed away, the direction of his life became clear. He used his savings to get a Medical Assistant certification. He now works at Sakura Gardens, an assisted living facility for Japanese-American seniors in the Richmond District. The 0.0-mile commute is a unique perk; he lives in a small, subsidized staff apartment on-site. His days are a routine of checking vitals, assisting with meals, and distributing medication, but his real work happens in the quiet moments\u2014sharing tea with a retired fisherman or reading the newspaper to a woman who remembers the old Fillmore.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting of a few co-workers and the residents he has come to see as family. The stories they share are his strongest connection to the city. Hiroshi\u2019s dream is no longer artistic but built on care. He is diligently saving money and taking preparatory classes, aspiring to become a Registered Nurse specializing in geriatrics. He wants to give others the same dignity and compassion he was able to give his grandmother, honoring her memory with every life he touches."
