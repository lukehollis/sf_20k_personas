Born in Daly City to Indian immigrants, her childhood was a blend of her parents\u2019 ambition and Californian optimism. They poured their life savings into a small home goods and gift boutique, \u201cSurabhi,\u201d filling it with the scent of sandalwood and cardamom-infused candles. For them, the store was the American Dream, and their dream for Anya was even grander: a stable, professional career far from the uncertainties of retail.\n\nShe enrolled at UC Davis, pursuing graphic design, a compromise between her creative spirit and her parents\u2019 desire for a practical degree. But in her sophomore year, a severe stroke left her father unable to work. Without hesitation, Anya left school and returned to San Francisco to help her mother run Surabhi. What was meant to be a temporary measure slowly became her life. The \u201csome college\u201d on her resume is a quiet monument to a path not taken.\n\nNow, at 34, Anya is the store's manager and beating heart. Her commute is a short flight of stairs from the small two-bedroom apartment she shares with her mother above the shop. Her days are a routine of inventory management, charming regulars who have watched her grow up, and discovering local artisans to feature. She transformed the store, integrating her keen design eye to give it a modern, minimalist aesthetic that appeals to the neighborhood\u2019s newer residents while honoring its original spirit.\n\nHer social life is deeply woven into her work; friendships are with other local shop owners, and a past relationship frayed under the pressure of her near-constant presence at the store. A quiet yearning persists for the life she abandoned. Late at night, after the streets have quieted, she sketches designs for her own line of textiles, dreaming of a day when Surabhi won\u2019t just be her family\u2019s legacy, but a canvas for her own creativity. She is a permanent fixture of her neighborhood, a woman who sacrificed one dream for another and is now figuring out how to merge the two."

Through a crack, she watched her father gently explain the weave of a pashmina to a customer, his voice a warm, steady hum. Anya felt a profound sense of safety, believing this small, fragrant world her parents built was the strongest, kindest place on Earth. It was a feeling she would spend her adult life trying to protect, and at times, escape.\n\n2.\nThe phone call came on a Tuesday. She was in her dorm at UC Davis, charcoal dust on her fingers from a life drawing class, the clean lines of a typography project mocking her from her desk. Her mother\u2019s voice was a fractured thing she\u2019d never heard before. \u201cYour father\u2026\u201d Anya remembers nothing else, only the sudden, silent weight that crushed the airy California light in her room. In that moment, her future, once a wide-open canvas, shrank to the size of a storefront on Hayes Street.\n\n3.\nHer hands trembled when she first rearranged the front window, five years after returning home. She replaced her mother\u2019s beloved, crowded display of brass gods with a single, elegant ceramic vase and a spray of eucalyptus. Her mother watched, her silence a heavy blanket of disapproval. But then, a young couple stopped, pointing. \u201cSo clean, so beautiful,\u201d they murmured through the glass. It wasn\u2019t just relief Anya felt, but a thrilling spark of ownership. The store could be her canvas, too.\n\n4.\nHe stood in the doorway, the little bell announcing his arrival and, she would later realize, his departure. \"I can't compete with a stockroom, Anya,\" he said, his voice tired. She stayed behind the counter, a row of cardamom candles between them like a barricade. He left, and the bell chimed again, a sound now imbued with a specific, hollow loneliness. She learned then that the shop both held her and walled her in, its four walls the exact dimensions of her sacrifice.\n\n5.\nJust last week, long after the last cable car had rumbled past, she sat at her desk above the sleeping store. The streetlights cast a soft glow on a blank page in her sketchbook. With a quiet defiance, she began to draw. A repeating pattern of marigold petals took shape under her pen, a design for a textile that existed only for her. In the stillness, with the faint scent of sandalwood rising from the floorboards, she felt a flicker of her own dream, separate and whole."
