The only child of Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Koreatown, she spent countless hours waiting for buses with her mother, watching the city\u2019s lifeblood flow unevenly through its sprawling arteries. She saw firsthand how a late bus or a missed connection directly impacted her parents' long workdays and their quality of life. This early observation planted a seed: cities could be designed better, for everyone.\n\nHer path led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology before earning her Master's in Urban and Regional Planning. Berkeley, with its vibrant public spaces and robust transit system, felt like a revelation compared to the car-centric world she grew up in. It was during a graduate seminar on transit equity that her childhood experiences crystallized into a career ambition. She wasn't just interested in schedules and infrastructure; she was driven to design systems that offered dignity and opportunity.\n\nNow 28, Jessica is a transportation planner for a San Francisco public agency. Her days are a blend of data analysis, contentious community meetings, and site visits. Her 2.1-mile commute from her Hayes Valley apartment to her SoMa office via the Muni bus is daily fieldwork. She notices the-wear patterns on seats, the timing of traffic lights, and the crowds at rush hour, constantly cross-referencing reality with the models on her screen.\n\nJessica\u2019s social life is a close-knit circle of friends from grad school and a weekly climbing group at Mission Cliffs. Recently out of a long-term relationship, she navigates her newfound single life with a planner\u2019s pragmatism, enjoying the freedom to explore the city\u2019s hidden culinary gems and hiking trails on her own terms.\n\nLiving in Hayes Valley, she feels deeply connected to the urban fabric she works to improve. She loves the neighborhood's walkability and its mix of old Victorians and modern condos. Her dream is to one day lead a major project, like a new Bus Rapid Transit corridor, that tangibly improves the daily lives of thousands. More personally, she hopes to afford a small condo of her own\u2014a tangible stake in the city she is dedicating her life to shaping."

Her mother, smelling of starch and fatigue, sighed as another full bus sped past without stopping. They were just one block from their store, but it felt a world away. Jessica watched the sleek cars glide by, a river of freedom she couldn't access. In that moment of shared helplessness with her mother, a hot, quiet anger settled in her chest\u2014a certainty that the world could be fairer than this. It was the first problem she ever wanted to solve.\n\n2.\nIt was a cool Tuesday night during her first month at Berkeley. On a whim, she\u2019d hopped on an AC Transit bus heading into the hills, just to see where it went. The bus was clean, on time, and full of students reading and laughing. It felt less like a necessity and more like a shared public living room. Looking out the window at the city lights twinkling below, she felt a profound sense of relief and possibility. This was how a city was supposed to feel: connected, accessible, full of promise.\n\n3.\nHer first community meeting was a disaster. She stood under the harsh fluorescent lights of a library basement, pointing to a diagram for a new bus bulb-out, her voice shaking. An elderly man in the front row stood up, his voice thick with rage, accusing her of destroying the neighborhood he'd lived in for fifty years. She felt her data-driven confidence crumble into shame. It was a humbling lesson: plans weren't just lines on a map. They were people\u2019s homes, memories, and fears. Her work required not just intellect, but deep empathy.\n\n4.\nA month after the breakup, she found herself alone at the top of Bernal Hill at sunset. The wind whipped her hair as the city lights began to sparkle across the basin below, a sprawling circuit board of human connection. She had always shared this view, but now, it was entirely hers. There was a sharp pang of loneliness, followed by a surprising, quiet strength. The city wasn\u2019t his or theirs; it was her home. She felt her own geography click back into place, solid and self-reliant.\n\n5.\nRiding the 14-Mission home last week, she watched as a woman using a walker boarded at a stop where Jessica had spent months fighting for a new, accessible boarding island. The woman didn't need help; she simply rolled on, paid her fare, and found a seat. No one noticed the seamlessness of the event, the quiet dignity of it. But Jessica saw. A fierce, invisible pride warmed her entire body. This was it. This was the point of all the spreadsheets, the angry meetings, the endless reports."
