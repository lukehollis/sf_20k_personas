The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a bustling laundromat in the Sunset District, David\u2019s childhood was a lesson in relentless work ethic. His parents, smelling of steam and detergent, poured their life savings and hopes into their only son, seeing his academic success as their ultimate validation. David never disappointed. He was the classic overachiever: valedictorian at Lowell High, a pragmatic economics degree from UC Berkeley, and finally, a coveted MBA from Stanford.\n\nHe followed the blueprint for success perfectly, landing a high-stakes job as a management consultant for a top-tier firm. His life became a series of flights, client decks, and financial models. When the pandemic normalized remote work, his company went fully distributed. David seized the opportunity to buy his sleek condo, trading a life in the sky for a life in a sky-rise. His commute is a ten-step walk from his espresso machine to his standing desk.\n\nThis efficiency, however, has bred a profound disconnect. At 30, David has achieved the immigrant son\u2019s dream but feels estranged from the city he calls home. His days are a blur of international Zoom calls, data analysis, and catered lunches from Doordash. Social connections are transactional; he has colleagues and contacts, but few deep friendships. Relationships are managed like projects, often swiped into existence on an app and fizzling out due to misaligned schedules or emotional bandwidth.\n\nA key turning point is brewing within him. Staring out at the Bay Bridge lights one evening after a 12-hour workday, he realized he hadn't spoken to anyone in person besides a barista all day. He misses the chaotic energy of Clement Street markets, the damp fog rolling over Twin Peaks\u2014the tangible city of his youth. David\u2019s current aspiration isn\u2019t a promotion, but a reconnection. He dreams of finding a life beyond the spreadsheet, perhaps by coaching a youth basketball team or finally learning to surf at Ocean Beach. He wants to find a way to make his 0.0-mile commute feel less like a cage and more like a foundation from which he can truly explore his own city."
