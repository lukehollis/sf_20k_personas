The daughter of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small grocery on Geary Boulevard, Mei was raised amidst the pragmatic dreams of building a new life. Her parents, practical and hardworking, envisioned a future for her in business. Obediently, she enrolled at UC Berkeley, pursuing a business degree that felt more like a duty than a passion.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year when her father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Navigating the healthcare system, Mei witnessed not only his physical decline but also the emotional and psychological toll on her family. She saw the gaps\u2014the lack of culturally competent support, the impersonal nature of care\u2014and felt a profound calling to bridge them. After her father\u2019s passing, she changed her path completely, enrolling in a Master of Social Work program.\n\nFor over two decades, Mei has worked as a clinical social worker, primarily with elderly patients and their families within the city\u2019s complex healthcare networks. Her career evolved with technology; the pandemic transitioned her practice to a fully remote model, which she has maintained. Now, her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her kitchen to a sunlit spare bedroom in her Inner Richmond apartment, the same neighborhood she grew up in.\n\nHer days are structured by telehealth appointments, offering a digital bridge of empathy to clients wrestling with grief, illness, and difficult life transitions. She begins each morning with a walk in Golden Gate Park and finds comfort in the bustling familiarity of Clement Street's markets. Though single, her life is rich with connection; a tight circle of friends, a complex but loving relationship with her aging mother, and the deep, trusting bonds she forms with her clients. Her aspiration is not for radical change but for depth: to mentor young social workers and advocate for more humane elder care policies, ensuring others find the compassion her family so desperately needed. Hers is a life of quiet purpose, lived out in the city that has always been her home."

            "value": "1.\nShe remembers being ten, stacking oranges into a pyramid at her parents\u2019 grocery. Her father, smelling of cardboard and ginger, didn't scold her when they tumbled. He just started over with her, patiently showing her how to build a stable base. \"Everything needs a strong foundation, Mei,\" he\u2019d said in Cantonese. It wasn't about the fruit; it was about building a life. That quiet lesson in diligence became the bedrock of her own character, long after the store was gone.\n\n2.\nIn the sterile, beige hospital room during her junior year of college, the doctor discussed treatment options, his gaze sliding right past her father in the bed as if he were furniture. Her father, always so proud, was suddenly invisible. In that moment of cold, clinical dismissal, a fierce, protective vow formed in her heart. Her business degree studies felt hollow; she knew then she would spend her life making sure no one's father was ever made to feel so small again.\n\n3.\nShe was a brand-new social worker, sitting with Mr. Chen and his frustrated, American-born son. The son saw stubbornness; Mei heard fear, spoken in Cantonese phrases her own father used. She gently translated not just his words, but his terror of being a burden. The son's expression softened into understanding. Securing his in-home care felt less like a professional victory and more like mending a tear in the fabric of her own past, finally providing the bridge her own family never had.\n\n4.\nDuring her first week of mandatory remote work in 2020, her elderly client, a recent widow, went silent. Mei\u2019s heart sank, fearing the digital connection was too cold, too distant. But the woman returned, holding a framed photograph of her late husband up to the laptop camera. \"This was him,\" she whispered, her eyes wet. In that moment of shared grief across the Wi-Fi signal, Mei knew. Empathy didn't need a room; it just needed an open window.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on her morning walk, the fog rolled thick through the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. She\u2019d just finished a difficult call helping a family place their mother in care, and she thought of her own aging mom. There was no grand ambition pulling at her, only the quiet, steady rhythm of her work, her neighborhood, and the city\u2019s misty embrace. She felt a profound sense of rightness, of being rooted exactly where she was always supposed to be."
