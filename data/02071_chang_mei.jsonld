The daughter of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small grocery on Geary Boulevard, Mei was raised amidst the pragmatic dreams of building a new life. Her parents, practical and hardworking, envisioned a future for her in business. Obediently, she enrolled at UC Berkeley, pursuing a business degree that felt more like a duty than a passion.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year when her father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Navigating the healthcare system, Mei witnessed not only his physical decline but also the emotional and psychological toll on her family. She saw the gaps\u2014the lack of culturally competent support, the impersonal nature of care\u2014and felt a profound calling to bridge them. After her father\u2019s passing, she changed her path completely, enrolling in a Master of Social Work program.\n\nFor over two decades, Mei has worked as a clinical social worker, primarily with elderly patients and their families within the city\u2019s complex healthcare networks. Her career evolved with technology; the pandemic transitioned her practice to a fully remote model, which she has maintained. Now, her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her kitchen to a sunlit spare bedroom in her Inner Richmond apartment, the same neighborhood she grew up in.\n\nHer days are structured by telehealth appointments, offering a digital bridge of empathy to clients wrestling with grief, illness, and difficult life transitions. She begins each morning with a walk in Golden Gate Park and finds comfort in the bustling familiarity of Clement Street's markets. Though single, her life is rich with connection; a tight circle of friends, a complex but loving relationship with her aging mother, and the deep, trusting bonds she forms with her clients. Her aspiration is not for radical change but for depth: to mentor young social workers and advocate for more humane elder care policies, ensuring others find the compassion her family so desperately needed. Hers is a life of quiet purpose, lived out in the city that has always been her home."
