The son of a Mauritian Creole father and a second-generation Indian-American mother from Sacramento, Andre grew up in the East Bay navigating a unique blend of cultures. His name itself\u2014a French first name paired with a common Indian surname\u2014was an early lesson in existing between worlds.\n\nHis educational journey led him to a Bachelor's degree in Art History from UC Berkeley. Andre was fascinated by the stories objects could tell, from Renaissance triptychs to minimalist sculptures. He envisioned a life in museums or galleries, but the reality of low pay and fierce competition led him to a pragmatic pivot. He took a job at a high-end furniture boutique in San Francisco to pay his rent and discovered an unexpected talent. He had a natural gift for connecting with clients, using his art history background to explain the lineage of a chair or the craftsmanship of a light fixture.\n\nThe key turning point was his promotion to Lead Sales Associate a decade ago. It cemented his path, offering stability and a sense of mastery, but quietly shelving his dream of a career in the art world. Now 41, Andre\u2019s life is marked by a deliberate lack of friction. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from his chic, compact apartment to the showroom floor. His days are a routine of advising discerning clients, managing inventory, and being a familiar, sophisticated presence in the neighborhood.\n\nSocially, Andre is well-liked but keeps a polite distance. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and since then, his connections have been more casual\u2014friends from work, acquaintances at his local coffee shop. His dream is no longer to work in a museum, but to one day open his own small, highly curated shop blending vintage art and modern design. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration he nurtures, a future where he is not just selling stories, but finally telling his own."
