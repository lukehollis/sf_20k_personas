Raised in a meticulously planned Ohio suburb by a CPA father and a nurse mother, her childhood was a comfortable blueprint for a life she never wanted. Her parents envisioned a stable career in finance or law, so when Sarah enrolled in college, she chose a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration as a compromise, secretly tacking on a minor in Art History that felt more like her native language.\n\nThe turning point came during a summer internship at a sterile investment firm. The soullessness of spreadsheets quantifying wealth pushed her into action. The following year, she interned for free at a small, struggling arts collective in Columbus. It was there, amidst the scent of turpentine and the chaotic energy of creation, that she found her purpose: she had the organizational mind her parents gave her, but the soul of an artist. She wasn't meant to make art, but to make art *happen*.\n\nAfter graduation, she packed two suitcases and moved to San Francisco for an entry-level coordinator role at \"ArtSpan SF,\" a non-profit dedicated to supporting emerging local artists. She fell hard for the city\u2019s vibrant, unapologetic spirit and even harder for the Mission District. Eight years later, she\u2019s the Program Manager, living just three blocks from the office. Her zero-mile commute is a testament to how deeply she\u2019s embedded in her community.\n\nHer days are a hybrid of grant writing from her bright, plant-filled apartment and on-site management of artist showcases and workshops. Her social life is woven from the same fabric\u2014friends are the muralists, ceramicists, and fellow non-profit workers she champions. Though she maintains a loving, if sometimes bewildered, relationship with her family back east, her chosen family is in the Mission. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of sustainability: to secure a major endowment for ArtSpan that guarantees its future. She hopes to one day launch a mentorship program connecting established artists with underserved youth, creating the same spark of possibility that once saved her from a life in a cubicle."
