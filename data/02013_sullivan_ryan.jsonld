Raised in a Sacramento suburb by a mechanic father and a dental hygienist mother, his childhood was scored by the sound of socket wrenches and the smell of WD-40. While his friends were playing video games, Ryan was in the garage, meticulously disassembling and reassembling lawnmower engines, fascinated not by what things did, but *how* they were made. This practical inclination led him away from the abstract world of code and toward the tangible satisfaction of engineering.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, thriving in its \"Learn by Doing\" environment. He spent more time in the machine shop than the library, his hands calloused from milling parts for a formula racing team. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted role as a Manufacturing Engineer for a major consumer electronics company in San Francisco. The catch, however, was in the nature of the work. His \"factory floor\" was thousands of miles away in Shenzhen.\n\nThis was Ryan\u2019s key turning point. He moved into a sleek, minimalist loft in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial past resonated with him. His 0.0-mile commute meant his days started with 6 AM video calls, remotely troubleshooting assembly line issues with a team in China. He became an expert in process flow, data analysis, and cross-cultural communication, yet he felt a growing disconnect from the physical craft he loved.\n\nTo compensate, his life outside of work is intensely tactile. He\u2019s a regular at the local rock-climbing gym, drawn to the problem-solving nature of a difficult route. He spends weekends cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge or tinkering with a 3D printer in his living room. His social circle is small, built around these hobbies rather than the tech party scene. While he appreciates the innovation and energy of San Francisco, he often feels like an analog soul in a digital city. His dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to eventually open his own small-batch manufacturing workshop, creating bespoke, high-quality products\u2014a way to finally close the distance between his hands and his work."
