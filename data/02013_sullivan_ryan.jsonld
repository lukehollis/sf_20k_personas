Raised in a Sacramento suburb by a mechanic father and a dental hygienist mother, his childhood was scored by the sound of socket wrenches and the smell of WD-40. While his friends were playing video games, Ryan was in the garage, meticulously disassembling and reassembling lawnmower engines, fascinated not by what things did, but *how* they were made. This practical inclination led him away from the abstract world of code and toward the tangible satisfaction of engineering.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, thriving in its \"Learn by Doing\" environment. He spent more time in the machine shop than the library, his hands calloused from milling parts for a formula racing team. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted role as a Manufacturing Engineer for a major consumer electronics company in San Francisco. The catch, however, was in the nature of the work. His \"factory floor\" was thousands of miles away in Shenzhen.\n\nThis was Ryan\u2019s key turning point. He moved into a sleek, minimalist loft in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial past resonated with him. His 0.0-mile commute meant his days started with 6 AM video calls, remotely troubleshooting assembly line issues with a team in China. He became an expert in process flow, data analysis, and cross-cultural communication, yet he felt a growing disconnect from the physical craft he loved.\n\nTo compensate, his life outside of work is intensely tactile. He\u2019s a regular at the local rock-climbing gym, drawn to the problem-solving nature of a difficult route. He spends weekends cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge or tinkering with a 3D printer in his living room. His social circle is small, built around these hobbies rather than the tech party scene. While he appreciates the innovation and energy of San Francisco, he often feels like an analog soul in a digital city. His dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to eventually open his own small-batch manufacturing workshop, creating bespoke, high-quality products\u2014a way to finally close the distance between his hands and his work."

After a week of careful disassembly, he finally tightened the last bolt on the lawnmower engine. He pulled the cord, and it coughed to life on the first try. The pride he felt wasn't just in the roar of the engine, but in the quiet, approving nod from his dad. That afternoon solidified a core belief: true satisfaction came from understanding and mastering the physical world, piece by piece.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in the Cal Poly machine shop, the air thick with the smell of cutting fluid. He held the finished aluminum upright for the formula racing car, its surface still warm from the mill. It was flawless\u2014lighter, stronger, and more elegant than the stock part. This wasn\u2019t an abstract problem on a screen; it was a physical piece of a faster whole, shaped from a raw block by his own hands. That night during his junior year, he felt an exhilarating sense of purpose he\u2019s been chasing ever since.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe recalls the jarring disconnect of his first \"line down\" emergency. Sitting in his silent, minimalist loft, he stared at a grainy webcam feed of a jammed robotic arm in Shenzhen. He guided a technician through a fix by pointing at his monitor, feeling like a ghost in the machine. A mechanic without a wrench. That 6 AM call, just two months into his new job, was the first time he truly understood the immense, frustrating distance between his hands and the work he was meant to do.\n\n***\n\n4.\nAfter weeks of failing on the same bouldering problem, his fingers finally stuck to the tiny crimp hold. He remembers the precise shift in his hips and the calculated tension in his core\u2014it was a problem of leverage and friction, solved not with software, but with sinew and grit. Reaching the top of the wall at Dogpatch Boulders, his whole body humming with effort, was a revelation. A year into living in SF, he realized climbing was engineering with his own body, a tangible success he could feel in his bones.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a recent quiet Saturday, he held the small, warm bracket he\u2019d just 3D-printed. It was a simple piece designed to stop his bike\u2019s frame pack from rattling, but it was perfect. He\u2019d identified a problem, designed a solution, and created a physical object in his living room. That little piece of plastic felt more real and significant than an entire week of optimizing a factory overseas. This, he realized as the printer cooled, was the seed of his dream\u2014small, useful, and real enough to hold in his hand."
