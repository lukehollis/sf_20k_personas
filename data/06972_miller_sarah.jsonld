Raised in a small town by a high school teacher and a hardware store owner, her childhood was a collage of hiking trips, tide pooling, and an innate understanding of the natural world\u2019s delicate balance. A contentious logging debate that threatened an old-growth forest near her home during her teens was the turning point, transforming her passive appreciation into an active calling.\n\nShe pursued a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science at UC Santa Cruz, where her passion found an academic and social home. Surrounded by peers who shared her drive, she thrived, interning with a local conservation group that monitored watershed health. After graduating, a job offer as an Environmental Consultant brought her north to San Francisco, a city she saw as a fascinating paradox of progressive ideals and immense environmental challenges.\n\nNow 25, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her small Outer Richmond apartment, which also serves as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing her to begin each day not with traffic, but with a brisk, foggy run through Golden Gate Park. Her work involves guiding corporate clients through the labyrinth of environmental regulations, a pragmatic role she sometimes struggles with. She finds satisfaction in nudging a corporation towards sustainability but feels a persistent pull to do more direct, hands-on work.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. She knows the baristas at her corner coffee shop by name and spends weekends hiking the Marin Headlands with a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow UCSC alumni. Her social life is built around bonfires at Ocean Beach and exploring the city\u2019s farmers' markets. While content, Sarah aspires to transition from consulting to policy, hoping to one day work for the city or a land trust where she can help shape the environment directly, not just advise on it. She dreams of a future where her efforts are visible in a restored creek or a newly protected green space within the urban sprawl she now calls home."
