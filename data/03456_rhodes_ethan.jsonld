Raised in a sprawling Sacramento suburb, his childhood was defined by the family minivan and the frustrating independence that only a driver's license could grant. The son of a pragmatic CPA father and a high school history teacher mother, Ethan\u2019s upbringing was stable, middle-class, and thoroughly car-dependent. This environment spurred a deep curiosity for how cities worked, or in his view, how they could work better.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct path toward this passion. He pursued an undergraduate degree in Sustainable Environmental Design at UC Davis before obtaining his Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA. It was in Los Angeles, studying the city\u2019s infamous traffic and fledgling metro system, that his theoretical interest became a professional calling. Upon graduating, he accepted a coveted role as a Transportation Planner for a San Francisco city agency, eager to apply his ideals to a city dense with potential.\n\nFor the past seven years, San Francisco has been his home, but his relationship with it has recently shifted. The most significant turning point was the city-wide transition to remote work. Now, his commute is a zero-mile walk from his bed to his desk in his NoPa apartment. He spends his days analyzing GIS data, modeling traffic flows for the new Van Ness BRT, and reviewing community feedback on proposed bike lanes. He is an architect of the city\u2019s arteries, yet he feels increasingly detached from its bloodstream. A recent breakup with a long-term partner has amplified this sense of isolation, leaving his social life centered on a small, close-knit group of friends from grad school and a weekly climbing session at Mission Cliffs.\n\nEthan\u2019s routine is disciplined: a morning run through the Panhandle, hours of focused work, and evenings spent either cooking or exploring a new neighborhood restaurant on foot\u2014a personal mission to reconnect with the streets he plans. His greatest aspiration is to see a project through from conception to completion, to one day ride a bus or bike in a lane he helped design and feel the tangible impact of his work. He dreams of a future where he feels less like an observer viewing the city through a screen and more like an integral part of its vibrant, complicated, and ever-moving whole."

To his left, a BART train, sleek and silver, glided past them, its windows filled with anonymous people reading, talking, living. It wasn\u2019t just a train; it was a different kind of freedom, a shared public life he\u2019d never known. The longing he felt in that moment was sharp and definitive. It set the coordinates for his entire future, a quiet rebellion against the suburban inertia he was trapped in.\n\n2.\nHis first weekend in San Francisco, he bought a Clipper card and rode the 5-Fulton from his new NoPa apartment all the way to Ocean Beach. The bus lurched and hissed, a mechanical beast navigating the city\u2019s dense grid. Pressing his face to the glass, he watched neighborhoods shift and blend, each stop a new story. He felt an electric sense of arrival, of finally being in the right place. That bus ride wasn't a commute; it was a promise of the vibrant, connected life he had come to build.\n\n3.\nIt was a stuffy community meeting room in the Richmond, three years ago. He\u2019d just finished presenting a plan for a new protected bike lane. An elderly woman with a cane approached him afterward, her voice thin but clear. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThat corner is terrifying. Now I might be able to bike to my daughter\u2019s house.\u201d In that moment, the GIS layers and traffic models dissolved, replaced by a profound, humbling sense of purpose. Her face became the reason why he navigated the bureaucracy\u2014a tangible link between his screen and the street.\n\n4.\nThe sun was bright and unforgiving over Dolores Park. He and his ex, Chloe, sat on their blanket, a half-eaten burrito between them. The silence was heavier than the distant sound of bongos. They were talking about the future, but it was clear theirs had diverged. He looked at the familiar skyline, a view they once cherished together, and felt like a tourist in his own life. The park, once a symbol of their shared joy, became a beautiful, painful monument to their ending, deepening the city\u2019s new layer of loneliness.\n\n5.\nLast week, on his morning run through the Panhandle, he stopped to catch his breath. In the distance, a new red articulated bus\u2014part of the Van Ness BRT project\u2014slid smoothly into its dedicated lane. He\u2019d spent hundreds of hours modeling its flow. A surge of pride mixed with a profound sense of detachment washed over him. He was the architect of that efficiency, yet he was standing outside of it, watching through an invisible pane of glass. He desperately wanted to be on that bus, not just the one who drew its path."
