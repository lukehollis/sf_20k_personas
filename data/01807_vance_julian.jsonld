The only child of a stoic history professor and a meticulous landscape designer, his upbringing was a quiet study in structure, form, and the weight of the past. He pursued an undergraduate degree in architecture from Cornell, but it was his graduate work at Columbia\u2014a Master's in Historic Preservation\u2014that truly defined his path. He wasn't interested in just building new things; he was fascinated by the dialogue between the old and the new.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in his late twenties, drawn by a fellowship to work on the seismic retrofitting and modernization of a cultural institution in the Presidio. The city, with its audacious tech-fueled future and its dearly-held Victorian past, was the perfect canvas. After a decade of rising through the ranks of a prestigious firm, he founded Vance Collaborative. As Principal Architect, he specializes in arts spaces: galleries, theaters, and private homes built to showcase significant art collections.\n\nA key turning point was the dissolution of his long-term partnership a few years ago. The split was amicable but painful, a casualty of his consuming devotion to his work. Since then, Julian has poured himself entirely into his craft. His 0.0-mile commute is to his own drafting table, located in a sprawling, meticulously minimalist live-work loft in Dogpatch. The space, a converted warehouse, is a testament to his philosophy: exposed original brick and steel beams frame hyper-modernist furniture and a state-of-the-art kitchen. His mornings begin before dawn with an espresso and a review of blueprints, often followed by a run along the waterfront before his small team arrives.\n\nJulian's social life is curated and intertwined with his work\u2014dinners with clients, gallery openings, and quiet drinks with a tight-knit circle of artists and designers. He loves San Francisco for its relentless ambition and its acceptance of obsession. His ultimate aspiration is to design a truly iconic public arts building, a structure that will become part of the city\u2019s permanent cultural and physical landscape. He seeks not just success, but a legacy etched in concrete, glass, and the soul of his adopted city."
