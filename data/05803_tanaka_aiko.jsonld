As a third-generation Japanese-American, she was raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a mother whose grace was slowly eroded by a chronic illness. From a young age, Aiko became the family\u2019s emotional navigator, translating complex medical jargon for her father and providing the steady, silent support her mother needed. This challenging experience forged her path; she saw firsthand how broken the system was for patients lost in a sea of appointments and insurance paperwork.\n\nHer educational journey was a straight line toward her calling. After completing her undergraduate degree at UC Davis, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, determined to become the advocate her family never had. Aiko started her career at a bustling downtown hospital, but the frantic pace led to burnout. A few years ago, she transitioned to a role as a medical social worker specializing in palliative care via telehealth. This change eliminated her commute entirely, turning her quiet Inner Richmond apartment into both her office and her sanctuary.\n\nA key turning point was the end of a long-term relationship in her late thirties, which coincided with her career shift. The breakup left her feeling untethered but also gave her the space to rebuild a life centered on her own well-being. Her days are now structured and deliberate. Mornings begin with a ritual of genmaicha tea and a walk through Golden Gate Park, a necessary buffer before a day of emotionally taxing video calls with patients and their families. She helps them navigate end-of-life decisions, find resources, and process grief, all from the spare room in her apartment. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends\u2014a nurse and a physical therapist\u2014who understand the unique pressures of healthcare.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond grounds her. The fog rolling over the avenues, the proximity to the park, and the easy access to authentic Japanese groceries connect her to both the city and her heritage. Her dream isn't about climbing a career ladder but about finding balance. Aiko has recently taken up pottery, finding immense satisfaction in creating something solid and beautiful with her hands. Her aspiration is simple: to cultivate a life where she can offer herself the same gentle, patient care she has spent her entire life giving to others."
