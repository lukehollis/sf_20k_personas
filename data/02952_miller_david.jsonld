Born in the East Bay, he was the quiet synthesis of two worlds: his mother, Elena, who brought the warmth and resilience of Jalisco, Mexico, to their modest Hayward home, and his father, a second-generation Irish-American mechanic who gave him the Miller name and a love for how things fit together. David grew up navigating these dual identities, feeling most himself while drawing intricate cityscapes in the back of his notebooks.\n\nThis passion led him to San Francisco State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Urban Planning. He was fascinated by the theory of city-making, but the abstract nature felt disconnected from the tangible world of rebar and wet cement he\u2019d admired on trips into the city. Pragmatism won out. He took an entry-level job as a site coordinator for a local construction firm and found his true calling. He was a natural liaison, able to translate the architect\u2019s vision to the foreman\u2019s reality. His ascent was steady, built on a reputation for being unflappable under pressure as he managed projects through the dot-com boom and bust.\n\nA pivotal and painful turning point was his divorce at 41. The demanding career had taken its toll on his marriage, and the split left him feeling unmoored. He channeled his energy into his work and his relationship with his daughter, Sofia. Now, at 53, his greatest pride is that Sofia is studying architecture at Cal Poly, inspired by the blueprints she saw on his desk as a child.\n\nDavid\u2019s life has settled into a disciplined rhythm in his SoMa loft, where his commute is a zero-mile walk from his kitchen to his home office. His days are a controlled flurry of Zoom calls with clients, digital blueprint reviews, and virtual site inspections. In the evenings, he unwinds by walking his neighborhood, a silent observer of the skyline he helped shape. His connection to San Francisco is visceral; he sees his career\u2019s history in the towers glinting in the evening sun. He hopes to one day scale back, perhaps mentor young builders or finally take an extended trip to Mexico to reconnect with his mother\u2019s roots, trading project timelines for unhurried time."
