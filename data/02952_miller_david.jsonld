Born in the East Bay, he was the quiet synthesis of two worlds: his mother, Elena, who brought the warmth and resilience of Jalisco, Mexico, to their modest Hayward home, and his father, a second-generation Irish-American mechanic who gave him the Miller name and a love for how things fit together. David grew up navigating these dual identities, feeling most himself while drawing intricate cityscapes in the back of his notebooks.\n\nThis passion led him to San Francisco State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Urban Planning. He was fascinated by the theory of city-making, but the abstract nature felt disconnected from the tangible world of rebar and wet cement he\u2019d admired on trips into the city. Pragmatism won out. He took an entry-level job as a site coordinator for a local construction firm and found his true calling. He was a natural liaison, able to translate the architect\u2019s vision to the foreman\u2019s reality. His ascent was steady, built on a reputation for being unflappable under pressure as he managed projects through the dot-com boom and bust.\n\nA pivotal and painful turning point was his divorce at 41. The demanding career had taken its toll on his marriage, and the split left him feeling unmoored. He channeled his energy into his work and his relationship with his daughter, Sofia. Now, at 53, his greatest pride is that Sofia is studying architecture at Cal Poly, inspired by the blueprints she saw on his desk as a child.\n\nDavid\u2019s life has settled into a disciplined rhythm in his SoMa loft, where his commute is a zero-mile walk from his kitchen to his home office. His days are a controlled flurry of Zoom calls with clients, digital blueprint reviews, and virtual site inspections. In the evenings, he unwinds by walking his neighborhood, a silent observer of the skyline he helped shape. His connection to San Francisco is visceral; he sees his career\u2019s history in the towers glinting in the evening sun. He hopes to one day scale back, perhaps mentor young builders or finally take an extended trip to Mexico to reconnect with his mother\u2019s roots, trading project timelines for unhurried time."

But David was watching his mother, who squinted and murmured in Spanish about all the families the building would one day hold. In that moment, the cold steel and the warm humanity fused in his mind. He went home and drew not just the structure, but the ghosts of windows, filled with life. It was the first time he truly understood what he wanted to build.\n\n2.\nHis first day as a site coordinator, fresh out of SF State at 23. The air hummed with generator noise and smelled of diesel and wet concrete; an ironworker yelled a greeting as a rebar cage was hoisted into the sky. The ordered chaos was more beautiful than any textbook diagram. He felt a profound sense of belonging, a click of everything falling into place. That day he knew he wasn't an urban planner; he was a builder. The theoretical world was gone for good, replaced by the satisfying grit of reality.\n\n3.\nHe was 41, standing in the echoing silence of his new, sparsely furnished apartment after the divorce. On the kitchen counter sat a single framed photo his ex had left for him: a much younger Sofia on his shoulders at a work site, both of them grinning. He stared at it, the weight of his professional success and personal failure pressing down on him. It was then he made a silent vow. His marriage was a structure he couldn\u2019t save, but he would pour every ounce of himself into building a future for her.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the topping out ceremony for the SoMa tower he\u2019d bled for during the dot-com recovery. He stood on the bare concrete roof, the wind whipping his tie, feeling an omnipotent pride as he looked out at the Bay Bridge. He was in his late thirties, at the peak of his game. Then his phone buzzed\u2014another missed call from his wife. The triumphant feeling was instantly laced with a familiar, quiet guilt. The view was incredible, but he was admiring it entirely alone, and the foundation of his own home was cracking.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a call with Sofia. She was excitedly explaining her Cal Poly studio project, talking about fa\u00e7ade articulation, public space, and a building\u2019s \u201cbreath.\u201d He listened, looking at the familiar blueprints on his own screen. But he wasn\u2019t seeing steel tonnage or timelines; he saw his concrete world through her artistic eyes. The pride he felt was staggering, a quiet and deep validation. At 52, he realized his true legacy wasn\u2019t just on the skyline, but sitting in her university dorm room, designing its future."
