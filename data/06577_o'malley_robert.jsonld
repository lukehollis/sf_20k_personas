            "value": "Robert O'Malley\u2019s name suggests a story of foggy Outer Sunset avenues and Irish pride. While the avenues are true, the rest is more complex. Adopted as an infant by a kind, working-class couple, Robert grew up in a small row house, the only Filipino kid in his Irish-American family. He loved his parents deeply, but the name on his birth certificate and the face in the mirror created a lifelong question mark, a feeling of \"Other\" he couldn't shake.\n\nHe was never one for abstract academics. Instead, he found solace in the tangible world of circuits and wires, taking apart VCRs and radios just to see how they worked. This practical curiosity led him to an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology from City College of San Francisco. His career began just as the first dot-com boom was reshaping the city. While others coded, Robert wrenched. He became a field service technician, the person who shows up when the digital world's physical infrastructure breaks. His office is a company van, and his 0.0-mile commute simply means his home is his dispatch point. He is the city's technological ghost, crisscrossing town to install servers in SOMA data centers or troubleshoot network failures in FiDi high-rises.\n\nThe key turning point in his life came at 38, after his adoptive parents had passed. He finally sought out his birth mother, discovering a quiet woman who had been a young, unsupported immigrant. The meeting didn't erase his O'Malley upbringing but added a vital layer, finally giving his internal sense of self an anchor.\n\nNow 51, Robert lives a contained, quiet life, still in the Sunset District. He\u2019s a regular at the local coffee shop and knows his neighbors by name. He is comfortably single, his social life consisting of a few old friends and a bowling league. His dream isn't fame or fortune; it\u2019s contentment. He hopes to one day visit the Philippines, to walk the streets his mother knew. More immediately, he fantasizes about opening a small, specialized repair shop\u2014a place where things, like people, can be put back together and made whole again."
