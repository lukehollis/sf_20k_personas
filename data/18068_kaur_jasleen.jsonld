Her parents, Sikh immigrants from Punjab, instilled in her a profound sense of *seva*, or selfless service, a principle she witnessed daily in the tight-knit community centered around their local Gurdwara. When she was a teenager, her family moved to Daly City, chasing better opportunities and bringing them to the edge of the metropolis that would define Jasleen's adult life.\n\nDrawn to the city's vibrant, complex social fabric, she attended San Francisco State University. A volunteer placement at a family resource center in the Mission District became her turning point. There, witnessing the daily struggles and immense resilience of immigrant families navigating a bewildering system, she found her calling. She graduated with a Bachelor's in Social Work, determined to be an advocate, not just an observer.\n\nHer career began in the trenches as a case manager, a demanding role where burnout was common. But Jasleen\u2019s calm demeanor and fierce dedication saw her through. She steadily climbed the ranks, earning a reputation for being both compassionate with clients and effective at cutting through bureaucratic red tape. Now, at 43, she is a Case Manager Supervisor, guiding a team that helps at-risk youth access educational and health services.\n\nJasleen lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is a quiet rhythm: a 2.1-mile ride on the MUNI bus to her office near Civic Center, a day of managing crises and mentoring her staff, followed by an evening walk through Golden Gate Park or sharing a meal with her close circle of friends\u2014a mix from work and her Sikh community. Though single, her life is rich with connection.\n\nSan Francisco is more than her home; it\u2019s her purpose. She knows its beautiful facade and its challenging reality intimately. Her quiet dream is to one day launch her own non-profit, creating a mentorship program that pairs established professionals with first-generation students. For Jasleen, *seva* remains her guiding star, a legacy from her parents now woven into the very fabric of the city she serves."

She served an elderly man whose turban was the color of a marigold. He spoke no English, and she little Punjabi, but his grateful nod was a complete conversation. It wasn't charity; it was community. In that silent exchange, Jasleen didn't just learn the word *seva*; she understood it as the quiet, dignified act of seeing and serving another human being. It became her foundation.\n\n2.\nCollege, around twenty. A Guatemalan mother sat across from her at the Mission resource center, overwhelmed by school enrollment forms. The woman\u2019s shoulders were slumped in defeat. Jasleen spent two hours patiently translating, line by line. When they finished, the mother\u2019s look of profound relief was like a key turning in a lock inside her. All the academic theories vanished, replaced by a simple, powerful truth: this was her work. She wasn't an observer anymore; she was a bridge connecting people to possibility.\n\n3.\nShe was 28, on the verge of burnout. A teen client had run away again, and she felt the crushing weight of the system\u2019s failure. On a cold, damp evening, she found him huddled in a bus shelter near UN Plaza. Instead of a lecture, she just sat with him, sharing a bag of chips from a corner store. They didn't solve everything, but he came back to shelter. It was a small victory that taught her a huge lesson: her job wasn't to fix people, but to consistently and calmly show up for them.\n\n4.\nA memory from her late thirties, after a particularly draining day. She got off the 5-Fulton bus, the fog so thick it muffled the city's noise. She walked into Golden Gate Park, the scent of damp earth and eucalyptus filling her lungs. Standing under a cypress tree, she felt the day's stress dissolve into the mist. It was a profound realization that this wasn\u2019t just a place she worked. This park, this neighborhood, this quiet, gray peace\u2014it was her sanctuary. It was truly home.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, she was helping a brilliant student from a Bayview shelter navigate college applications. The girl had the grades but was terrified of interviews, having never met a professional in her desired field. Jasleen connected her with a friend for a practice run. The student\u2019s transformation from anxious to empowered after one conversation was a revelation. Jasleen saw the missing piece: not just resources, but relationships. The seed for her own non-profit was planted then, a direct answer to a need she witnessed firsthand."
