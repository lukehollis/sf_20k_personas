Adopted from a South Korean orphanage as an infant, he was raised by a boisterous, loving Irish-American family in the dense fog of Daly City. His father was a union carpenter and his mother a school secretary; they gave him their name, their love for San Francisco, and a pragmatic, no-nonsense approach to life. Growing up, Leo felt caught between worlds, never quite fitting the mold of his Irish surname or his Asian features, a quiet kid who preferred listening to talking.\n\nHis directionless high school years ended abruptly when he was 17. He was home when his father suffered a massive heart attack. Leo remembers the sheer panic, the feeling of absolute helplessness, and then the swift, competent arrival of the EMTs. The terrifying calm of the paramedics who saved his father\u2019s life became his calling. He bypassed college applications and, after graduating, enrolled in the EMT program at City College of San Francisco, finding his purpose not in textbooks, but in practical, life-saving skills.\n\nNow 30, Leo\u2019s life is a rhythm of sirens and silence. He lives in a small, fog-laced apartment in the Outer Sunset, a world away from the city\u2019s tech gloss. His 7.5-mile commute in his aging Honda Civic takes him across the city to the central station, where each shift presents a new test of his composure. Socially, he\u2019s closest to his fellow EMTs; they share a dark humor and an unspoken understanding that outsiders can\u2019t grasp. He decompresses by surfing the chilly waves at Ocean Beach or grabbing a quiet pint at a neighborhood pub on Irving Street.\n\nLeo\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched onto its streets. He\u2019s seen its beauty and its brutality, responding to calls from Nob Hill penthouses to Tenderloin alleys. He dreams of becoming a full-fledged paramedic to gain more skills and a better salary. His ultimate aspiration isn't wealth but stability: a small condo of his own somewhere in the city he serves, a place to finally, fully, put down roots."
