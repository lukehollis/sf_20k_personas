Born in Dearborn, Michigan, she was the only child of Lebanese Christian immigrants who had fled Beirut during the civil war. Her home was a vibrant enclave of memory and tradition, filled with the scent of za'atar and the sound of Fairuz on the stereo, a stark contrast to the Midwestern landscape outside. Her parents, a mechanic and a seamstress, preached practicality, but Layla was drawn to the abstract beauty of the art history books she discovered in the library.\n\nShe pursued this passion at the University of Michigan, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Art History. The degree, however, left her with a deep appreciation for culture but few job prospects. A post-graduation stint working in the registrar's office at the Detroit Institute of Arts became her turning point. While her classmates dreamed of curating, Layla found a deep satisfaction in the unseen, complex dance of logistics: customs forms, climate-controlled crating, and international shipping schedules. She realized she didn't need to analyze the art; she could be its essential guardian on its journey.\n\nIn her late twenties, she followed the art world west to San Francisco, drawn by its experimental energy. She took a job with a boutique firm specializing in fine art handling and shipping. Here, her meticulous nature and calm demeanor in high-stress situations saw her rise quickly. A key moment was managing the transport and installation of a massive, fragile glass sculpture for a major gallery\u2014a project others deemed impossible. Her success cemented her reputation.\n\nNow 51, Layla lives a life of curated independence in a Dogpatch live/work loft, her commute a simple walk down a flight of industrial stairs to her office and workshop below. Her personal life is intertwined with her professional one; her close friends are artists, gallery owners, and technicians. A decade-long partnership ended amicably years ago, leaving her with a quiet self-sufficiency she treasures. Her days are a mix of coordinating with international galleries and supervising crating on her warehouse floor. Her dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder but about legacy: she hopes to mentor young women in her field and one day use her expertise to organize a traveling exhibition of contemporary Lebanese artists, finally bridging the two worlds of her upbringing."

It was a tangible piece of a Beirut she\u2019d never seen, a fragrance more real than any photograph. This ritual taught her a fundamental truth: the most precious things are often fragile and require careful preservation. This instinct to be a guardian, long before she knew what it meant, was born from the scent of thyme and sesame in a Dearborn, Michigan kitchen.\n\n2.\nIt was a late night in the registrar\u2019s office at the Detroit Institute of Arts. She was twenty-three, surrounded by the ghosts of masterpieces. But Layla wasn\u2019t looking at the art; she was studying a crate manifest for a Dutch landscape. The specific humidity controls, the customs forms, the sheer choreography of it all\u2014it was a complex, elegant dance. A profound sense of purpose settled over her. She didn't have to be the critic; she could be the one who ensured the art arrived safely to be seen.\n\n3.\nThe silence in the gallery was absolute as the final, impossibly delicate glass panel was lowered into its frame. Every contractor and curator held their breath, but Layla, then in her mid-thirties, just felt a deep, focused calm. When it clicked perfectly into place, the room erupted in applause. She didn\u2019t cheer. She simply felt the quiet satisfaction of knowing her meticulous planning and steady nerve had made the impossible possible. That day cemented her reputation, but more importantly, it taught her to trust her own quiet composure under fire.\n\n4.\nThe first morning after her partner moved out, she woke to the sharp angles of light in her Dogpatch loft. She was forty-one. Making coffee, the only sound was the hum of the warehouse outside. Surrounded by her own books and tools, she felt not a void, but a powerful sense of ownership. This quiet, solitary space wasn\u2019t an absence of someone else, but the full presence of herself. That feeling of contented self-sufficiency became one of the most treasured installations she would ever curate.\n\n5.\nA visiting Lebanese painter, a woman old enough to be her mother, was touring her workshop and spotted the faded photo on her desk. She pointed and shared a story of a caf\u00e9 near where Layla's parents had lived. For Layla, then in her late forties, the two halves of her life suddenly fused. The logistics expert and the daughter of immigrants became one. In that moment, the dream of a traveling exhibition of Lebanese artists became a concrete mission\u2014a way to finally bridge the worlds of Beirut and San Francisco."
