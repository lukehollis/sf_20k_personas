Born to Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Irving Street, David grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of diligence and the expectation of a stable future. He spent his youth not stocking shelves, but hunched over a secondhand computer, fascinated by the nascent digital world.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley for a Computer Science degree, graduating just in time to ride the crest of the first dot-com wave. He experienced the exhilarating highs and the crushing lows of the bust, a formative lesson in the industry\u2019s volatility. Shaken but not defeated, he pursued an MBA at night, determined to be the one managing the projects, not just coding them. This pivot defined his career, leading him through a series of senior roles until he landed his current position as an IT Director for a major fintech company.\n\nA key turning point was the dissolution of a long-term relationship in his late thirties, a casualty of his relentless ambition and 80-hour workweeks. The silence in his apartment after she left was louder than any server fan. Now, at 46, his life is a model of structured efficiency. He lives in a sleek Mission Bay condo, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his Nespresso machine to his standing desk. His days are a blur of Zoom calls, Slack channels, and architectural diagrams. For social connection, he relies on a weekly running club that traces the Embarcadero and a monthly board game night with old college friends.\n\nThough he has achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of for him, a quiet restlessness has set in. David looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows at the skyline he helps power and wonders what\u2019s next. His aspirations have shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to finding a different kind of value\u2014perhaps mentoring young engineers from backgrounds like his, or finally finding the time to build something for himself, not for a corporation. He is a man who successfully built a life in the new San Francisco, and is now trying to build a soul for it."
