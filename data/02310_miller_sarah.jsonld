Born in Daly City to first-generation Korean immigrants, she was named Sarah to ease her path in America, a hope her parents held as tightly as their own traditions. They ran a small, beloved dry-cleaning business, instilling in her a formidable work ethic and a deep, unspoken sense of filial duty. Growing up, Sarah was the bridge between her parents' world and the one outside their door, a role that honed her empathy but also created a silent pressure that would later define her career.\n\nSeeking a world beyond the Bay Area fog, she attended college on the East Coast, initially studying art history. However, she found herself consistently drawn to the stories of others, recognizing the familiar weight of unspoken trauma and cultural dislocation. This realization prompted a pivot. She returned to California, earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, driven by a desire to give others the language and support she and her family never had.\n\nHer early career was a baptism by fire in the chaotic emergency rooms of a large San Francisco hospital. The work was vital but emotionally depleting. A major turning point came in her late thirties when, facing severe burnout, she realized she was absorbing her patients' trauma without tending to her own. She resigned, took a year-long sabbatical, and rebuilt her professional life from the ground up.\n\nNow 49, Sarah runs a private therapy practice entirely through telehealth from her serene apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her zero-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing her to curate a tranquil space for both herself and her clients. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: a foggy morning walk in Golden Gate Park, sessions with clients navigating life\u2019s complexities, and evenings spent with a book or a small circle of close, long-term friends. Though single after an amicable end to a long-term relationship, she feels deeply connected to her community. Her dream is no longer about changing the world, but about providing a steady, healing presence within it, one conversation at a time, while nurturing the quiet peace she has so carefully cultivated for herself."
