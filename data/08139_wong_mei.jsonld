The daughter of hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, she grew up amidst the clatter and aromas of their small grocery store in the Sunset District. Her parents, who spoke of education with a reverence usually reserved for gods, saw in Mei Lin their hopes for a life beyond the grind of stocking shelves and working the register. She met their expectations with fierce determination, excelling in science and earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley.\n\nHer intended path was a PhD and a life in a research lab. However, during a grueling post-graduate fellowship in biochemistry, a turning point arrived. She found the solitary nature of pure research stifling; she craved structure, application, and argument. This epiphany led her to law school, a decision that initially bewildered her parents. She earned her Juris Doctor from Santa Clara University, expertly blending her scientific acumen with legal theory. Her early career was a blur of 100-hour weeks at a top-tier law firm, building a formidable reputation in the cutthroat world of intellectual property.\n\nNow 44, Mei Lin is Senior Patent Counsel for a major gene-editing company. The grueling law firm years are behind her, replaced by the focused intensity of an in-house role. Since the pandemic, her commute has been zero miles. She lives and works in a minimalist Hayes Valley condo with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. Her days are a disciplined routine: an early start with strong coffee and patent filings, a midday walk to a favorite cafe to feel the city's pulse, and long afternoons defending her company's innovations.\n\nSocially, her circle has shrunk to a few trusted friends from her law school days. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of competing career ambitions. Though she has achieved the success her parents dreamed of, a quiet restlessness has settled in. She looks out her window at the city she was born in\u2014a city constantly reinventing itself\u2014and wonders about her own reinvention. Her aspirations are no longer about career advancement, but about connection. She dreams of traveling without a laptop, of taking up watercolor painting again, and perhaps one day using her formidable legal skills pro-bono, to protect the dreams of those who remind her of her own parents."
