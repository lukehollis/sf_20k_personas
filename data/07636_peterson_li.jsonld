Born in Berkeley, she is the only child of David Peterson, an American sociology professor, and the artist Li Na, who emigrated from Guangzhou in the late 1980s. Her childhood was a blend of her father\u2019s methodical world of academic theory and her mother\u2019s beautifully chaotic art studio, filled with the scent of turpentine and the vibrant disarray of creation. While she adored her mother\u2019s passion, she was often stressed by the disorganization that hampered her career\u2014missed gallery deadlines and lost invoices. From a young age, Li Na found deep satisfaction in creating order, arranging her mother\u2019s brushes by size and color-coding her paint tubes.\n\nThis impulse led her to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering. For Li Na, it was the perfect application of her skills: a way to bring elegant, functional order to complex systems. She was recruited by a major San Francisco tech company upon graduation and quickly found her niche as a Process Improvement Engineer. She thrives on untangling convoluted workflows and designing streamlined processes, finding a satisfaction in her work that mirrors the peace she felt organizing her mother\u2019s studio as a child.\n\nNow 30, Li Na lives alone in a meticulously kept one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Working entirely from home, her days are structured with disciplined precision. A 7 a.m. run through Golden Gate Park is followed by focused work blocks, punctuated by a walk to a local bakery on Clement Street for a midday pastry. Her social life is small but strong, revolving around a handful of college friends and weekly dim sum with her parents. While she excels at optimizing corporate systems, the unpredictable nature of romance remains a system she has yet to crack.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but quiet\u2014rooted in the foggy avenues of her neighborhood and the proximity to her family. Li Na\u2019s ultimate dream is to bridge her two worlds. She aspires to leave the corporate sphere and launch a consulting business or B-corp dedicated to helping independent artists, like her mother, build sustainable careers by providing them with the operational tools they need to thrive. For Li Na, the goal isn't just efficiency; it\u2019s about creating systems that allow fearless, beautiful creativity to flourish."
