Raised in a practical, no-nonsense Ohio family, his childhood was filled with lessons on carburetors and crop rotation, not color theory. Art was a frivolous mystery to his parents. Owen\u2019s quiet rebellion began in the high school library, where he lost himself in books on Abstract Expressionism and the Bauhaus movement, worlds away from his own. He knew he didn\u2019t belong.\n\nAt twenty-one, with a few hundred dollars saved from a factory job, he boarded a bus to San Francisco, drawn by its promise of reinvention. He landed a job sweeping floors and building shipping crates at a small, struggling gallery in SoMa. He had no formal education, but he had an insatiable curiosity and a natural instinct for composition. The aging owner, a sharp woman named Eleanor, saw his potential. She taught him how to stretch a canvas, light a sculpture, and, most importantly, how to talk to artists. Owen became her apprentice, prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and eventually, her successor. When Eleanor retired, she sold him the gallery on a payment plan he could just barely afford.\n\nThat gallery is now his entire universe. His 0.0-mile commute is the walk from his spartan loft apartment down a flight of industrial steel stairs to the polished concrete floor of Miller Arts. His life partner became the gallery itself; a serious long-term relationship ended a decade ago, unable to compete with the demands of a new exhibition. His social connections are now almost exclusively the artists he represents and the collectors he cultivates. His daily routine is a ritual of coffee, emails, and quiet contemplation among the pieces he\u2019s chosen to champion.\n\nNow, at 48, Owen is a respected, if somewhat solitary, figure in the city\u2019s art scene. He lives and breathes for the thrill of discovering a new voice and the satisfaction of placing a piece in the perfect collection. His dream is to cement the gallery's legacy by launching an artist who will redefine a genre. He occasionally wonders about the life he didn\u2019t lead, but a walk through his gallery\u2014his home\u2014is always enough to remind him that he curated the exact life he was meant to live."
