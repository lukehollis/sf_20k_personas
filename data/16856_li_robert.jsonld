The name he carries today came much later, a gift from the love of his life. His upbringing was stable but uninspired, and after high school, he pursued an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college, seeing it as a practical, no-fuss path to a steady job.\n\nHe began his career in the polished but impersonal world of department store management. It was there, during a stint overseeing the jewelry and watch counter, that his life found its focus. An elderly Swiss watch repairman, impressed by Robert\u2019s quiet curiosity, began teaching him about the intricate mechanics and timeless artistry of horology. Robert was captivated. He moved to San Francisco in his late twenties, chasing a role at a dedicated timepiece store.\n\nThe city is where he met Elena Li, a brilliant and fiercely independent graphic designer. Their bond was immediate. As a symbol of their modern partnership and a departure from a family name he never felt connected to, he chose to take her surname when they married. Their thirty years together were the centerpiece of his life, until a sudden illness took her from him six years ago.\n\nNow, at 54, Robert\u2019s life is a study in precise, quiet routine. He lives in a small but well-appointed Hayes Valley apartment, filled with Elena\u2019s art. Every morning, he takes the MUNI F-line to his boutique near Union Square. He is a master of his craft, known for his ability to connect a client with a watch that feels like an extension of their soul. His $110,000 income affords him a comfortable, if solitary, existence.\n\nHis social life is small; a weekly dinner with another couple they were friends with, and conversations with longtime customers. He finds solace in the city's structure\u2014the familiar rumble of the streetcar, the specific slant of light through his shop window in the afternoon. His dream is no longer of career advancement, but to one day take the trip to Switzerland\u2019s Vall\u00e9e de Joux that he and Elena always planned. He aspires to pass on his knowledge to a young, eager apprentice, honoring the mentorship that first set his own life in motion."

With trembling hands, he seated a gear, feeling a tactile click that vibrated up his arm. In that moment, the world of sales quotas and inventory fell away, replaced by a universe of perfect, intricate order. It was the first time he felt he was seeing his own future, a path of purpose clicking precisely into place. This was in his early twenties, in a Sacramento department store.\n\n2.\nShe didn\u2019t come to buy a watch. Elena entered his small San Francisco shop with a sketchbook, capturing the light on the glass cases. She asked not about prices, but about the story of his oldest timepiece. Her intense curiosity and vibrant energy were a shock to his quiet system. In her eyes, he wasn't a salesman, but a keeper of stories. It was the moment his meticulously ordered world was first disrupted by a beautiful, welcome chaos. He was twenty-nine.\n\n3.\nAt city hall, he held the pen over the marriage license. *Robert Schmidt.* The name felt like an ill-fitting coat. He glanced at Elena, who gave him a small, confident nod. He slowly wrote *Robert Li*. A quiet liberation settled over him; he wasn't just taking her name, he was shedding a past that never felt his and choosing a future built entirely with her. For the first time, the name he signed felt like his own. It was the true beginning of their life.\n\n4.\nTen years before the illness. A rainy Sunday in their Hayes Valley apartment. He was at his workbench, the soft ticking of a restored movement filling the air. Across the room, Elena was sketching, the scratch of her pen on paper a perfect rhythm to his work. No words were exchanged for an hour, yet the silence was the most profound conversation they ever had. It was the memory of true contentment, a shared, peaceful industry that defined the best decade of his life. He was forty-four.\n\n5.\nThe first time he rode the F-line to the shop after she was gone. The familiar rumble of the streetcar felt hollow, each stop an echo of a routine they once shared. He clutched the worn leather of his briefcase, staring at his ghostly reflection as Hayes Valley slid by. The city, their shared playground, was now just a collection of landmarks for his grief. That morning, the commute became a pilgrimage\u2014a daily act of remembering how to exist alone within the world they had built. He was forty-eight."
