The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong who arrived in the 1970s, Mei grew up observing the city not through its scenic vistas, but through the struggles and triumphs of its small business owners. She watched her parents navigate a labyrinth of permits, tax codes, and shifting neighborhood dynamics, planting in her a deep-seated desire to understand the systems that governed their lives.\n\nThis drive led her to UC Berkeley, where she discovered the field of public policy. It felt like finding a blueprint for the city she\u2019d only known from street level. She excelled, earning a Master's in Urban Planning, her thesis focusing on preserving commercial corridors for legacy businesses. Her career path was a straight line to San Francisco\u2019s City Hall. For over two decades, Mei has been a policy analyst in the Planning Department\u2014not a politician, but a vital cog in the machine. She\u2019s the person in the weeds, analyzing zoning impacts and drafting language for initiatives aimed at helping small businesses, a quiet tribute to her parents' hard work.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce ten years ago. The split, amicable but draining, coincided with her decision to purchase a small condo in Cole Valley. Freed from the expectations of partnership, she poured her energy into her work and her neighborhood. Now, her 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life. Her mornings begin with a walk to her favorite local cafe, followed by hours of analysis from a desk overlooking the street.\n\nMei\u2019s social life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood and a small circle of lifelong friends. She knows the local grocer by name and attends community planning meetings as a resident, not just a city employee. Her relationship with San Francisco is one of profound love and deep frustration. She sees its potential smothered by its problems. Her quiet aspiration isn\u2019t to climb the ladder of power, but to see one of her policies create a tangible, lasting positive effect\u2014to leave the city a little more equitable and functional than she found it, ensuring there\u2019s still a place for a family like hers to build a life."
