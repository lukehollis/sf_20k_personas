Her parents, first-generation immigrants from Taiwan, ran a small but thriving dim sum restaurant.  Growing up surrounded by the aroma of steaming dumplings and the murmur of diverse voices instilled in Mei a deep appreciation for heritage and community.  While her parents hoped she might eventually take over the restaurant, Mei found herself drawn to the hushed halls of local museums, particularly the Asian Art Museum, where antique scrolls and vibrant ceramics whispered stories of distant lands.\n\nHer academic journey was steeped in this fascination. She excelled in art history at UC Berkeley and pursued a Master\u2019s in Museum Studies, a testament to her dedication to preserving and presenting cultural narratives. Her early career involved internships and junior roles, each step building her expertise and network within the curatorial world. A significant turning point arrived when she was instrumental in securing a rare collection of Qing Dynasty porcelain for a regional museum, showcasing her keen eye and meticulous research skills. This success paved the way for her return to the Asian Art Museum, the institution that had first ignited her passion, where she ascended to the role of Curator.\n\nMei's personal life is a tapestry of close relationships. She remains deeply connected to her family, and Sunday dim sum at her parents\u2019 restaurant is a cherished ritual. She never married but maintains a strong circle of friends, many of whom are fellow artists and museum professionals, providing a rich intellectual and social landscape. Their evenings are often spent discussing exhibitions, sharing meals in various San Francisco neighborhoods, or attending cultural events.\n\nCurrently, Mei\u2019s life revolves around the rhythm of the museum. Her days are filled with exhibition planning, research, and engagement with artists and collectors. Her commute on public transportation offers a quiet moment to observe the city and mentally prepare for the day ahead or reflect on its accomplishments. She resides in a well-loved apartment not far from the museum, a neighborhood she chose for its convenience and its blend of old and new San Francisco.\n\nMei\u2019s aspirations extend beyond her current role. She dreams of curating a groundbreaking exhibition that bridges historical Asian art with contemporary work, exploring the evolving dialogue of the Asian diaspora. She also envisions establishing a mentorship program for aspiring curators from underrepresented backgrounds. San Francisco is more than just a city to Mei; it is the backdrop of her history, the source of her inspiration, and the community she is dedicated to enriching through her work."

Crouched under a table at their dim sum restaurant, a child Mei traced patterns on the dusty floor, overhearing conversations she barely understood. It was a warm, chaotic world of family and flavor, instilling in her a deep-seated sense of belonging and the quiet strength of her heritage. This was her earliest world.\n\n2.  Standing in front of a vast painted scroll at the Asian Art Museum, a teenage Mei felt a profound stillness wash over her. The ink flowed like water, telling a story across centuries. It wasn't just art; it was a bridge to a world beyond her neighborhood, sparking curiosity and planting the first seed of her future path. The hushed reverence of the museum felt like coming home.\n\n3.  The call came unexpectedly: they had secured the Qing Dynasty porcelain collection for the regional museum. Mei, clutching the phone, felt a wave of exhilaration and relief. Months of tireless research and advocacy had paid off. This success solidified her confidence and proved her ability to make a tangible impact in the museum world.\n\n4.  Sunday mornings at her parents\u2019 restaurant, slurping noodles and sharing laughter with her family, became an anchor for Mei in her busy adult life. Amidst exhibition deadlines and research, these meals were a comforting return to her roots, a reminder of the love and sacrifices that made her life possible. It grounded her amidst the demands of her career.\n\n5.  Walking through the museum halls she now curated, Mei paused by a case holding modern ceramics by local Asian artists. A vision sparked \u2013 an exhibition weaving together ancient and contemporary stories. This moment solidified her aspiration not just to preserve the past, but to build a bridge for future generations, connecting history to the vibrant present of her community."
