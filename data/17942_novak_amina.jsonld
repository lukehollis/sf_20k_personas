The daughter of a Czech political science professor who fled Prague in the late '70s and a second-generation American social worker, Amina\u2019s dinner table conversations were about housing policy, not pop culture. This upbringing shaped her worldview, teaching her that a community\u2019s health is measured by its compassion for its most vulnerable.\n\nShe stayed local for college, earning a Bachelor's in Urban Studies from UC Berkeley. Her academic interest became a fervent mission during the first dot-com boom. Watching beloved local businesses and neighbors in the East Bay get displaced by skyrocketing rents was her turning point. Theory wasn't enough; she needed to be on the ground. She moved across the bay to San Francisco and took an entry-level position at a small Community Development Corporation (CDC) in the Mission District. Over two decades, she methodically worked her way up from project coordinator to her current role as Program Director, driven by a quiet, relentless determination.\n\nNow 43, Amina lives a life deeply woven into the fabric of her Hayes Valley neighborhood. Her rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment is her sanctuary, filled with books and local art. Her 0.8-mile walk to work is a daily ritual of observation\u2014noting new graffiti, checking on the progress of a new parklet, and greeting the owner of the corner market. Her days are a whirlwind of grant writing, community meetings, and navigating city bureaucracy to advance affordable housing and small business support programs.\n\nAmina is amicably divorced from a man whose tech-driven ambitions eventually diverged too far from her own community-focused values. Her social life is rich but contained, centered on a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow non-profit workers, artists, and activists\u2014who share her commitment. Her greatest aspiration isn't a higher salary or a bigger home; it's seeing the 75-unit affordable housing project she\u2019s championed for three years finally break ground. For Amina, that would be the true measure of a life well-lived in the city she tirelessly works to serve."

He\u2019d unrolled an old, fragile map of Prague, his finger tracing a street near the Vltava River. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, his voice quiet, \u201cThis was our home, before it wasn't.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a story of loss, but of fact. In that moment, Amina understood that a home wasn't permanent. It was a precious, precarious thing to be defended. That quiet conviction settled deep within her, a bedrock for the work she would one day choose.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, her senior year at Berkeley. The air on her block, which always smelled of the pan dulce from La Familia Bakery, now smelled of paint and drywall. She watched Elena, the owner, load the last of her baking pans into a van, her face a mask of quiet defeat. The rent had tripled. Amina felt a hot, useless anger. It was the moment abstract theory became a visceral wound; a promise to herself that she wouldn\u2019t just watch as the city she loved devoured its own.\n\n3.\nThe cold weight of the brass keys in her palm felt impossibly heavy. It was 2002, and she was just a project coordinator. She\u2019d spent weeks buried in paperwork for the Rojas family\u2019s new subsidized apartment in the Mission. When she handed the keys to Mrs. Rojas, the woman\u2019s seven-year-old daughter grabbed them and ran to unlock her very own door for the first time. The sound of the deadbolt sliding home was the most beautiful sound Amina had ever heard. It was proof this work mattered.\n\n4.\nIt was the night of his company\u2019s IPO party, about eight years ago. Amid the champagne and loud congratulations, her then-husband turned to her, eyes shining with an unfamiliar fever. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cWe can finally move to Marin, get a real house.\u201d A chasm opened in the space between them. He saw the city as a ladder to be climbed and then abandoned. She saw it as a home to be healed. She knew then, with a deep, aching sadness, that they were walking in opposite directions.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a tense community meeting for the 75-unit project, a homeowner accused her of destroying the neighborhood. The words stung, seeding a familiar exhaustion. Just as she was about to respond, a woman who\u2019d lived in a nearby building for forty years stood up. \u201cMy daughter can\u2019t afford to live in the city she was born in,\u201d the woman said, her voice trembling but clear. \u201cAmina is fighting for her.\u201d That single sentence refilled every empty well inside her, a reminder of who she was fighting for."
