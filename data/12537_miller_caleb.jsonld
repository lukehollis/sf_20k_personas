The son of a public school teacher and a university librarian, Caleb was raised in a home where civil service was a quiet, noble calling. His childhood was one of structured curiosity, but it was a summer internship during his undergrad years at the University of Michigan that set his course. Tasked with analyzing ridership data for a local bus initiative, he saw firsthand how a well-plotted route could connect a senior to a grocery store or a student to a job. This was policy made tangible.\n\nThe lure of Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy pulled him west, trading the Midwest's predictable seasons for the Bay Area's microclimates. The transition was a jolt of energy and opportunity. He threw himself into his studies, fascinated by the complex, often-conflicting needs of a major metropolis. Upon graduating, a position as a Policy Analyst at the SFMTA felt like destiny. Now, two years in, he spends his days wrestling with the very systems he experienced as a student: fare structures, route efficiency, and the endless puzzle of moving millions of people.\n\nHis 11.8-mile commute from his Outer Sunset apartment is a daily field study. Aboard the N-Judah, crammed between surfers and service workers, he isn't just a passenger; he's an observer. He sees the delays, overhears the frustrations, and feels the satisfaction of a smooth ride. This intimate connection fuels his work with a sense of purpose that his colleagues, who may drive or live closer, don't always share. His life is a quiet routine of foggy morning runs along Ocean Beach, long hours staring at spreadsheets, and evenings spent with a close circle of grad school friends, often debating city politics over beers in the Mission.\n\nCaleb isn\u2019t in San Francisco for the glamour. He\u2019s here for the gridlock. He dreams of a day when the city\u2019s public transit is so seamless and equitable that it becomes the default for everyone. His ambition isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to untangle the knots of urban mobility, one policy brief, one improved bus line at a time."

Caleb, powerless, could only offer a clumsy explanation of signal issues. The weight of her anxiety felt heavier than any data set. That moment of shared helplessness wasn't a failure; it became his fuel. Her face is what he sees when he reviews delay reports, transforming abstract numbers into a deeply personal mandate. This was about a year and a half ago.\n\n2.\nHis first morning run in the Outer Sunset. He\u2019d expected California sun but was met by a wall of cold, damp fog rolling off the Pacific. The sheer, gray immensity shocked his Midwestern senses; it felt like running at the edge of the world. In that disorienting quiet, punctuated only by waves, he didn't feel lost. He felt anchored. That moment, right after moving in two years ago, was his true arrival\u2014an embrace of the city's beautiful, unexpected abrasiveness.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't a major overhaul, just a memo confirming a stop adjustment for the 29-Sunset. He\u2019d spent weeks arguing for it, armed with census data and ridership projections. Seeing the official approval email made his chest tighten with a quiet, fierce pride. This was the whole point: a few blocks, a shorter walk for seniors, a policy made real. That small victory, achieved about a year ago, affirmed his path wasn't just theoretical; it was a tangible, necessary craft.\n\n4.\nArguing over beers in the Mission with his grad school friends. They were cynical, ripping into the city\u2019s incompetence. For the first time, Caleb felt a defensive fire rise in him. He wasn't just agreeing anymore; he was explaining the trade-offs, the budget constraints, the impossible politics behind a single bus shelter. He left that night feeling isolated but also strangely galvanized. It cemented his identity not as a critic, but as someone on the inside, actually trying to untangle the knots.\n\n5.\nHe was on a crowded N heading home. At the transfer point, he watched through the window as a young man with a catering cooler got off and walked directly onto a waiting 44 bus, the doors closing right behind him. A perfect, seamless connection. For a fleeting second, the entire complex, messy system worked in perfect harmony. That beautiful, invisible choreography, seen a few months back, is the core of his belief. It\u2019s the proof that his quiet, data-driven dream for the city is possible."
