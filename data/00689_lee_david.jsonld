            "value": "David Reyes Lee is a man defined by the steady hum of logistics. Born in the Mission District to a Chinese-American father who worked the woks in Chinatown and a determined mother from Oaxaca, Mexico, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of cultures, languages, and the shared experience of working-class immigrant life in San Francisco. He learned the value of showing up, day in and day out, from parents who held multiple jobs to keep the family afloat.\n\nSchool was never David\u2019s passion. While he was intelligent, the abstract world of academia felt distant from the tangible needs of his family. He graduated from Mission High School and, bypassing college, went straight to work. He started unloading trucks at a large retail warehouse in the city\u2019s industrial southern corridor. For David, a neatly stacked pallet was more satisfying than a well-written essay. He was quiet, efficient, and unflinchingly reliable. Over two decades, he moved from the floor to forklift operator, to team lead, and finally, to Warehouse Supervisor. His authority comes not from a degree, but from having done every job he now oversees.\n\nA key turning point was the first dot-com bust. While tech companies imploded, the need for goods remained. His company restructured, and his former supervisor, an old-timer, took an early retirement. Management, valuing David\u2019s consistency over flashier candidates, offered him the job. It cemented his career and provided a stability he cherished.\n\nHis personal life has been quieter. A brief marriage in his late twenties ended amicably; his devotion was to the warehouse\u2019s unforgiving schedule. He remains close with his daughter, now a student at SF State, and is the primary caretaker for his aging mother, who still lives in their family home in the Excelsior.\n\nDavid\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is the most telling detail of his life. He lives in a small supervisor\u2019s apartment adjoining the massive warehouse he manages in the Dogpatch. His days start before sunrise with the roar of diesel engines and end long after the last truck has departed. He is a fixture of an older San Francisco, the one that makes the city run. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup, but to save enough to ensure his daughter graduates debt-free and his mother lives comfortably. He aspires to a quiet retirement, perhaps in a small coastal town, where the only deadline is the tide."
