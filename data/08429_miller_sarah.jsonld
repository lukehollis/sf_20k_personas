Growing up in a suburb of Modesto, she was the daughter of a pragmatic home builder who taught her the language of floor plans and property lines before she had a driver's license. While she respected her father's tangible work, she yearned for the dynamic energy of a major city.\n\nThe pull of the coast led her to UC Santa Cruz, where she pursued a degree in Urban Studies. She was fascinated by how cities functioned as living organisms, dreaming of a career in community planning that would shape urban spaces for people, not just for profit. However, upon graduating, the reality of San Francisco\u2019s job market and the weight of student loans guided her toward a more lucrative path. She landed a job as a Commercial Real Estate Coordinator, a role that leveraged her organizational skills and understanding of urban landscapes, albeit in service to corporate clients.\n\nThe key turning point was her move into a sleek, new high-rise in SoMa, the same building that houses her firm\u2019s satellite office. This created her current 0.0-mile commute, an elevator ride from her apartment to her desk. Her days are a model of efficiency: a 6 AM workout in the building\u2019s gym, coffee from the lobby caf\u00e9, and a full day coordinating leases and managing documentation for senior brokers. She is good at her job, respected for her meticulous attention to detail.\n\nSocially, Sarah exists in a bubble of convenience. Her friends are mostly work colleagues or other young professionals she meets at the building\u2019s rooftop mixers. While she appreciates the city's pulse from her 20th-floor window, she sometimes feels a pang of guilt, aware that her work contributes to the very gentrification she studied with a critical eye in college.\n\nHer aspiration is to become a full broker, to achieve financial independence in a city that demands it. But a deeper ambition lingers\u2014to one day pivot into sustainable development, using the capital and connections she\u2019s gaining to build projects with community benefit. For now, she lives in the city\u2019s fast-paced heart, a transplant still trying to reconcile the idealistic student she was with the pragmatic professional she has become."
