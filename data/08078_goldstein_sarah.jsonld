The daughter of a sociology professor and a librarian, her childhood home was a place of spirited debate and quiet reading. Her path was irrevocably shaped by watching her mother navigate a chronic autoimmune disease, an experience that gave Sarah an early, intimate understanding of the intersection between physical illness and mental anguish.\n\nThis formative experience propelled her west to UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work, where she fell in love with the Bay Area's blend of natural beauty and progressive thought. After graduating, Sarah began her career at the UCSF Medical Center, specializing in oncology support. For over a decade, she guided patients and their families through the devastating emotional terrain of cancer diagnoses. While fulfilling, the institutional weight eventually led to burnout, prompting a major life pivot.\n\nThe turning point came at age 42. Following an amicable divorce from a marriage that had defined her thirties, she used her share of their assets to purchase a classic Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. She took a leap of faith, leaving the hospital system to open a private practice from a converted front parlor. This decision eliminated her commute and gave her the autonomy to provide the deep, sustained therapeutic work she craved.\n\nToday, Sarah's life is one of structured tranquility. Her mornings begin with tea and a walk through the eucalyptus groves of Golden Gate Park before she sees her first client, either via telehealth or in her cozy, book-lined home office. Her clients are often grappling with grief, illness, or major life transitions. She is a quiet anchor in her neighborhood, known for her thoughtful presence at the local farmers' market and her patronage of Kezar Pizzetta. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of other professionals\u2014a monthly book club and hikes in the Marin Headlands keep her connected.\n\nAt 51, Sarah hopes to distill her years of experience into a book on finding meaning after loss. She dreams of taking a sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago, a testament to her belief in the healing power of a long journey. For now, she finds profound purpose in her work, a quiet healer living and working within the heart of the city she has long called home."
