Born in the Excelsior District to a Filipino mother and an Italian-American father, his childhood was a vibrant tapestry of flavors. The family home was a constant negotiation between the sharp, bright notes of adobo and the rich, savory depth of his father's rag\u00f9. This culinary duality became the foundation of his identity.\n\nHe resisted the expectation to take over his parents' humble neighborhood diner, craving a more refined stage. After earning a Hospitality Management degree from the University of San Francisco, Julian honed his craft in the demanding kitchens of downtown hotels, absorbing French techniques while secretly dreaming of ways to elevate the home-cooked flavors of his youth. His first attempt at a solo venture was crushed by the 2008 financial crisis, a devastating turning point that forced him into private catering. This period, however, built his resilience and reputation among the city's elite.\n\nIn 2012, he partnered with a savvy front-of-house manager to open \"VITA,\" a critically acclaimed restaurant in Hayes Valley. The menu is a testament to his life: Filipino-Italian fusion that celebrates California's produce. At 54, Julian is a respected figure in the SF food scene. His days are a disciplined ritual: a pre-dawn ride on his Vespa from his Noe Valley flat to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, followed by long, intense hours orchestrating his kitchen staff, whom he considers his second family.\n\nDivorced for over a decade\u2014a casualty of his professional ambition\u2014he is now in a steady, loving relationship with an architect who appreciates his passion without being consumed by it. His commute is a cherished 2.8-mile journey that cuts through the city's heart. Julian has no dreams of a restaurant empire; his ambition has softened into a desire for legacy. He hopes to mentor young, diverse chefs and perhaps write a cookbook that honors his parents\u2019 culinary traditions, ensuring the Rossi story, much like San Francisco\u2019s, continues to be told."

His mother\u2019s hands guide his, showing him how to twist the small, green calamansi from the branch without bruising it. The sharp, citrus perfume fills the air. It wasn\u2019t just a fruit; he realizes now it was his first lesson in heritage, a bright, acidic counterpoint to his father's slow-simmered sauces. That scent became his anchor, the flavor he would always chase.\n\n2.\nThe key felt cold and sharp in his palm in late 2008. His first solo venture, empty. The silence inside was louder than any dinner rush he\u2019d ever orchestrated. Turning that lock for the last time wasn't just admitting financial failure; it was a profound, gutting shame. The moment stripped him of his youthful arrogance, forcing him to rebuild not just a career, but a stronger, more humble version of himself. He never forgot the weight of that single key.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday night in 2012. He watched from the pass as his parents sat at table seven in VITA. His father, a man of few words, quietly ate the lamb adobo, then looked at his mother and nodded. In that simple gesture, Julian felt decades of unspoken tension dissolve. It was more than approval; it was an understanding. They finally saw their story\u2014the adobo and the rag\u00f9\u2014reflected on his plate. His ambition had finally led him home.\n\n4.\n\u201cThe kitchen gets the best of you,\u201d his ex-wife had said, not with anger, but with a tired resignation that broke his heart. They were in their Noe Valley flat, the evening light fading. \u201cI just get the leftovers.\u201d Her words were a quiet indictment, revealing a blind spot carved by his relentless drive. It was the moment he understood that passion, left unchecked, is a fire that consumes everything around it, not just the person who holds it.\n\n5.\nJust last week, riding his Vespa before dawn. The air was cool and salty off the bay. He zipped past the dark windows of the Mission, the city still asleep. Crossing Market Street, he saw the Ferry Building lights cutting through the fog. It wasn't a race to the market, but a moment of pure synthesis\u2014the hum of the Italian engine, the scent of the Pacific air, the promise of California produce. This small journey, he thought, was its own perfect, satisfying recipe."
