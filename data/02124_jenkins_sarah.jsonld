Raised in a suburb of Cleveland by a high school history teacher and an accountant, her upbringing was defined by practicality, fiscal prudence, and the quiet dignity of stable, middle-class life. She absorbed their work ethic but yearned for a larger canvas.\n\nHer idealism led her to an elite East Coast university, where she pursued a Master's in Urban Planning. She arrived in San Francisco during the fever dream of the late 90s dot-com boom, intending to help build more equitable and humane cities. However, she quickly grew frustrated by the molasses-slow pace of municipal bureaucracy while watching tech startups rewrite urban rules in real-time. In a pivotal career shift, a friend recruited her to a boutique consulting firm. Sarah discovered her talent for systems thinking and long-range strategy was far more lucrative\u2014and impactful\u2014in a corporate boardroom than a planning commission meeting.\n\nThe subsequent decades were a blur of successful projects, navigating market crashes, and advising on IPOs. She earned a reputation as a sharp, no-nonsense strategist who could restructure a flailing company with surgical precision. This professional ascent came at a personal cost; a marriage in her late thirties dissolved, a casualty of two ambitious careers and divergent life paths. The experience solidified her fierce independence.\n\nNow, at 50, Sarah\u2019s life is a controlled, elegant ecosystem within her minimalist Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her bedroom to a home office with a view of the city she helps transform. Her days are disciplined: a 6 a.m. pilates class, followed by a focused block of video calls with clients from Berlin to Bangalore, and afternoons spent crafting strategy decks. Evenings are for herself\u2014a glass of Sonoma Chardonnay on her small balcony, a novel, or an intimate dinner with a tight-knit circle of fellow professional women.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is complex. She feels the deep irony of being a former urban planner who now advises the very tech giants often blamed for the city\u2019s affordability crisis. To reconcile this, she mentors young women entering the tech field and sits on the board of a non-profit focused on supportive housing. Sarah\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to wind down her consulting work in the next five years, using her capital and expertise to launch a social enterprise\u2014a final, tangible attempt to build the better city she came here to find."
