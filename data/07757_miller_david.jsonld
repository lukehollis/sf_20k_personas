His commute is a simple walk downstairs. For twenty-five years, he has lived in the rent-controlled apartment above the small private practice where he works as a Medical Assistant.\n\nBorn and raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, David was a sensitive, artistic boy who felt perpetually out of step with his practical, Midwestern family. He dreamed of the vibrant, accepting world he saw in magazines, and at 21, he finally made the leap, moving to San Francisco in the late 1980s. He enrolled at City College, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Graphic Design, hoping to forge a creative career.\n\nHowever, the city he adopted was in the grip of the AIDS crisis. David watched in horror as friends and acquaintances from his newfound community fell ill. The helplessness he felt reshaped his ambitions. Graphic design felt frivolous when people were dying. Driven by a need to contribute directly, he pivoted, taking a short-term certificate program to become a Medical Assistant.\n\nHe found his calling not in a large, impersonal hospital, but in a small family practice. When the apartment above the clinic opened up, it felt like fate. He settled in, becoming a quiet fixture in the neighborhood. His work became his life, and his patients became an extended, ever-changing family. He never married, having lost the love of his life in the early \u201890s, a quiet grief that softened his edges and deepened his empathy.\n\nNow at 53, David\u2019s days are a comforting routine of taking vitals, updating charts, and offering a calm presence to anxious patients. His social life consists of coffee with a neighbor and long, solitary walks through the park, where he photographs the changing seasons on his phone. His dream is no longer of artistic fame, but of something far simpler: to stay in his apartment, tend to his community until he can retire, and live out his days in the city that, through tragedy and grace, truly became his home."
