The daughter of a pragmatic union carpenter and a mother who brought the warmth and flavors of her native Oaxaca into their small apartment, Sarah grew up in a bilingual home filled with the scent of mole and the sounds of bustling 24th Street. She was a quiet, observant child, more comfortable listening to her family's stories than being the center of attention.\n\nAfter high school, Sarah\u2019s path was uncertain. She drifted through service jobs, feeling disconnected from the city\u2019s booming industries. The major turning point came at 22 with the birth of her son, Mateo. Raising him as a single mother, with the steadfast support of her own parents, clarified her purpose. Enrolling Mateo in a local cooperative preschool, Sarah began volunteering and discovered a natural talent for connecting with young children. Their unfiltered honesty and boundless curiosity resonated with her patient nature.\n\nThis newfound passion led her to the City College of San Francisco, where she earned an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education. Shortly after, she was hired as a teacher's assistant at a small, play-based preschool just one block from her childhood home. She never left. For over two decades, Sarah has been a quiet anchor in a city of relentless change. Her commute is a thirty-second walk from the same rent-controlled apartment she grew up in, now filled with her own memories and Mateo\u2019s childhood drawings.\n\nHer days are a gentle routine of circle time, mediating disputes over toy trucks, wiping tears, and celebrating the tiny triumph of a child learning to write their name. She is a beloved fixture, the keeper of neighborhood history for the new generations of parents who pass through her classroom. Her son, Mateo, is now a graphic designer living in Oakland, but they remain incredibly close. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status; she hopes to one day take Mateo to Oaxaca to see the village her mother grew up in. More than anything, she aspires to continue providing a safe, loving start for San Francisco\u2019s youngest residents, one finger-painting at a time."
