            "value": "Leilani Harrison\u2019s identity was formed in the space between two worlds. The daughter of a pragmatic Irish-American naval officer and a warm, spiritually-grounded Native Hawaiian mother, Leilani was born in Honolulu but raised in Alameda. She grew up navigating the contrast between her father\u2019s stoic discipline and her mother\u2019s emphasis on *'ohana* and communal well-being. This cultural duality made her a natural observer of human dynamics, the quiet confidante who listened more than she spoke, constantly trying to bridge the unspoken gaps between people.\n\nThis innate curiosity led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies in psychology, followed by a Master's in Counseling Psychology from the Wright Institute. Her early career was spent in the demanding environment of a community health clinic in the Mission District. While she found the work deeply fulfilling, the overwhelming caseloads and bureaucratic constraints led to significant burnout. The turning point came during the pandemic; witnessing the city\u2019s collective trauma while managing her own exhaustion, she realized she needed a more sustainable way to practice healing.\n\nNow 41, Leilani has crafted a life of intentional balance. She runs a successful private MFT practice entirely from her serene Inner Sunset home, her commute a mere walk from her bedroom to her office. Specializing in family systems, cross-cultural identity, and professional burnout, she helps clients navigate the very complexities she once grappled with herself. Her days begin with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park with her rescue terrier, Kai, followed by a schedule of telehealth sessions.\n\nSocially, Leilani cultivates a small, tight-knit circle of friends, preferring intimate dinners and long talks at local wine bars over large crowds. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, she is currently focused on her own growth. Her deepest aspiration is to write a book exploring the concept of \"third culture\" identity in modern America, hoping to expand her impact beyond her individual clients. Leilani has found her peace not by choosing a side, but by building a life in the gentle, thoughtful space in between."
