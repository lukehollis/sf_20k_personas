The daughter of a meticulous first-generation Korean immigrant mother and a free-spirited American literature professor, she grew up in a quiet university town in Ohio. Her childhood was a blend of disciplined piano lessons and long afternoons spent sketching maps of imaginary cities, a compromise between her parents' worlds that forged her unique perspective. This fascination with how people and systems connect led her to pursue a Master's degree in Urban Planning.\n\nHer initial career in municipal government, however, felt disappointingly slow. She saw technology reshaping cities faster than any zoning committee could, and a key turning point came while working on a frustratingly stalled public transit project. Realizing her skills in managing complex systems, stakeholders, and long-term goals were directly transferable, she pivoted. Sarah took a certificate course in Agile methodologies and leveraged her planning background to land a project coordinator role at a San Francisco startup. Her ability to translate human needs into technical roadmaps saw her quickly promoted to Project Manager.\n\nNow, Sarah\u2019s world is contained within her bright, plant-filled apartment in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are a blur of Slack notifications and Zoom calls, herding software engineers and designers toward product deadlines. To combat the digital isolation, she forces structure onto her life. Mornings begin with a brisk walk to Dolores Park before the crowds descend, followed by a cortado from a favorite local cafe. Evenings are for disconnecting\u2014a pottery class, a run along the Embarcadero, or intimate dinners with a tight-knit group of friends, many of them also transplants navigating the city's tech-driven pulse.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but deliberate. She chose the Mission for its vibrant, chaotic energy\u2014a living antidote to her hyper-organized work. Her ultimate dream is to bridge her two careers: to lead a project that uses technology to create more equitable and connected urban spaces. For Sarah, success isn\u2019t just about shipping a product; it\u2019s about finally building one of the better, more functional cities she used to dream up as a child."
