A third-generation Japanese-American, he grew up in the quiet suburbs of San Jose, the son of a pragmatic electrical engineer and a detail-oriented librarian. His childhood was a peaceful landscape of meticulously built Lego cities and weekends spent absorbing the quiet hum of the local library. He was methodical and observant, more interested in the systems behind things than in the things themselves.\n\nThis fascination with systems led him to pursue a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley. He was captivated by how cities functioned like living organisms, with flows of people, resources, and information. However, during a difficult internship with a city planning department, he realized he despised the bureaucracy but loved the demographic and traffic data. This was his turning point. He saw that the future wasn't in zoning maps but in the algorithms that could predict a city's every move. He pivoted, self-teaching coding languages and leveraging his statistical skills to land an entry-level analyst role during the early 2010s tech boom.\n\nNow a Senior Data Analyst, David works from his serene Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is a key feature of his curated life. The move to San Francisco followed a quiet, amicable divorce five years ago, an event that reset his personal life and deepened his reliance on order and routine. He found a sanctuary in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood small enough to feel known. His days follow a predictable rhythm: morning espresso from a local caf\u00e9, hours immersed in data, a midday walk through Patricia's Green, and evenings spent either at a climbing gym or refining a personal project analyzing neighborhood demographic shifts.\n\nHis social circle is small but solid, composed of a few old university friends and his climbing partners. While he finds deep satisfaction in his work, David\u2019s hope is to introduce an unruly variable into his controlled existence. He aspires not for a promotion, but for a genuine connection\u2014a relationship that can\u2019t be neatly graphed or predicted. He dreams of finding someone who appreciates his quiet world, adding a layer of warmth and spontaneity to his well-ordered life in the heart of the city."
