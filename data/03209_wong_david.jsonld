A second-generation Chinese-American, his world was shaped by the rhythms of his parents' small Cantonese bakery on Taraval Street. He spent his youth packing pineapple buns and watching the L Taraval streetcar rumble by, absorbing the city's cadence on a neighborhood level. This grounded upbringing\u2014focused on community, hard work, and the importance of a well-run family business\u2014instilled in him a deep, almost cellular, connection to the city's fabric.\n\nHe stayed local for college, attending SF State without a clear direction, initially thinking of business like his parents. The turning point was the first dot-com boom. As a student, he watched with a mix of awe and alarm as neighborhoods transformed overnight, rents skyrocketed, and the city\u2019s soul seemed up for sale. This ignited a passion to understand the forces behind the change, leading him to pursue a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley. He wasn\u2019t interested in building shiny new things, but in stewarding the city he loved.\n\nNow 41, David is a senior planner for the city, a veteran of countless community meetings and bureaucratic battles. His early idealism has been tempered by the hard realities of political compromise and budget cuts, but his commitment remains. From his condo in Hayes Valley\u2014a neighborhood literally reborn from a torn-down freeway, a fact he finds endlessly symbolic\u2014he works on zoning policies and transit-oriented development. His 0.0-mile commute means his professional and personal lives are deeply intertwined in this central corridor.\n\nA long-term relationship ended three years ago, leaving him to quietly re-evaluate a life largely defined by his career. His days are structured: morning coffee from a local cafe, hours spent analyzing municipal code and 3D models, and evening walks through the ever-changing streets he helps to shape. His connection to San Francisco is his defining feature\u2014he sees its flaws with a planner\u2019s critical eye but loves its beauty with a native son\u2019s unwavering heart. David\u2019s quiet aspiration is to leave behind one truly great public space\u2014a park, a plaza\u2014that will serve the city long after he\u2019s gone, a tangible legacy of a life spent trying to make his complicated, beloved hometown just a little bit better."

His father shows him how to tap the golden tops of pineapple buns, listening for the hollow sound of readiness. Just then, the L Taraval rumbles past, its vibration a familiar tremor through the floorboards and up his small body. It isn\u2019t a disturbance; it's the city\u2019s heartbeat. In that moment, nestled between the warmth of the ovens and the streetcar\u2019s passing, he feels an unshakeable sense of belonging that becomes his life's anchor.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, his sophomore year at SF State. Their favorite grubby taqueria in the Mission had been replaced, overnight, by a boutique selling minimalist grey sweaters. He just stood there staring at the new, sterile storefront, the familiar scent of carnitas replaced by nothing. It wasn't just a restaurant; it was a piece of his map of the city, erased. A hot, powerless anger bloomed in his chest\u2014a feeling that ignited his drive to understand and defend the city's soul, not just watch it be sold.\n\n3.\nThe community meeting over a handful of parking spaces on Page Street had lasted four hours. He was exhausted, having absorbed hours of vitriol. Then, an elderly woman stood up and calmly defended the plan for a small public parklet, using his own data points about pedestrian safety. The proposal passed by one vote. The victory felt small and fragile, but intensely real. It was the moment his youthful idealism hardened into a patient, stubborn resolve to keep fighting the small battles that make a city livable.\n\n4.\nIt wasn't a fight, just a quiet, final conversation three years ago. \"You're already married, David,\" she'd said, gesturing out their Hayes Valley window. \"To San Francisco.\" He had no defense. He looked at the city lights\u2014a landscape he analyzed in documents and 3D models daily\u2014and felt a profound, hollow truth in her words. The love for his city, his life's work, was a devotion so total it had left no room for her. The loss was immense, but the choice, he realized, had already been made.\n\n5.\nLast Thursday, on an evening walk, he sat in Patricia\u2019s Green. He watched a toddler chase a pigeon while a string quartet practiced nearby, the sound floating over the space where a freeway once roared. A familiar pang of loneliness hit him, but was quickly replaced by a quiet, fierce sense of purpose. This was the goal, tangible and alive. A place for people. The feeling solidified his life's quiet ambition: to build one thing this good, a legacy of shared joy for the city he loved."
