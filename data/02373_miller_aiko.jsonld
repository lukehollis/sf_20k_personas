Raised in the East Bay, Aiko was a dutiful daughter, though her soul yearned for the color and chaos of the art world. This led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Art History at SF State, a small act of rebellion that her practical parents tolerated.\n\nReality, however, demanded a steady paycheck. Aiko found an entry-level position at a Financial District firm, intending it to be temporary. But her innate organization and calm demeanor made her indispensable. Decades passed, and \"temporary\" became a career. She excelled as an administrative assistant, the reliable anchor in a sea of ambitious traders, her art history degree a secret she kept like a pressed flower in a book.\n\nThe key turning point came at 45. Her amicable divorce from Mark Miller wasn't a tragedy but a quiet unraveling of a life she had built out of obligation rather than passion. With her share of their suburban home, she made a deliberate choice: she bought a small, clean-lined condo in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. The neighborhood\u2019s foggy serenity and proximity to Golden Gate Park felt like a balm.\n\nNow 52, her 0.0-mile commute has redefined her existence. The pandemic shifted her company remote, and her world shrank to her condo and the surrounding blocks. Her daily routine is a gentle rhythm: a morning walk in the park, logging into a corporate server to manage calendars for executives she rarely sees, and enjoying lunch from a favorite Clement Street dumpling shop. Her social life is intimate, centered around a weekly pottery class where she reconnects with her artistic side, her hands finally shaping something tangible.\n\nAiko\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of ambition, but of sanctuary. She doesn\u2019t dream of climbing a corporate ladder; she dreams of a solo trip to Kyoto to see the gardens she once only studied in books. Her greatest aspiration is to one day fill a shelf with her own finished pottery\u2014imperfect, personal, and entirely her own."
