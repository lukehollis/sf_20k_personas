He was born and raised in the Inner Richmond, the only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Clement Street. His childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the fog-laced air of the city outside. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped he\u2019d pursue a lucrative career in medicine or engineering. David, however, was more observant and introspective, quietly noticing the health disparities among his neighbors\u2014the elderly struggling with prescription instructions, families delaying care due to cost, and the cultural disconnect with the healthcare system.\n\nThis firsthand observation guided his educational path. While his parents were slightly puzzled by his choice to pursue a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, David felt a clear sense of purpose. He wasn't meant to be a doctor treating one patient at a time, but an analyst who could shape systems to help thousands. His career at the Department of Public Health began steadily, but the COVID-19 pandemic became his defining professional trial. Suddenly, his work was no longer abstract. He spent grueling, 16-hour days analyzing infection rate data, tracking resource allocation, and providing the statistical backbone for city-wide policy decisions. The crisis solidified his role and transitioned him to a permanent work-from-home status.\n\nNow, at 41, David\u2019s life is one of quiet intention. His 0.0-mile commute means his day starts not with a bus ride, but with a walk from his bedroom to his small home office in his meticulously organized Inner Sunset apartment. He lives a structured life: analyzing datasets, writing reports, and taking a mid-day break to walk through Golden Gate Park, his constant, green neighbor. He maintains a small circle of close friends from grad school and visits his widowed mother every Sunday, bringing her groceries and listening to her stories.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not one of a transplant seeking excitement, but of a native son serving his community from behind the scenes. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but to see a measurable drop in health inequities in the very neighborhoods he grew up in. His aspiration is to use his data to build a healthier, more just San Francisco, one spreadsheet and one thoughtful analysis at a time."
