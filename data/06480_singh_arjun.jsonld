The only son of Punjabi immigrants who ran a small electronics repair shop in Fresno, he grew up translating not just English, but the complex bureaucracies of American life for his parents. Witnessing their quiet, tireless navigation of a system that felt indifferent to them instilled in Arjun a deep-seated desire to understand and reform that very system from the inside.\n\nThis drive propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he voraciously studied political science. His initial idealism was tempered by the stark realities he witnessed working for a housing non-profit in Oakland after graduation. He saw good people crushed by eviction notices and well-meaning programs tangled in red tape. This was his crucial turning point; fighting from the outside wasn't enough. He realized true, lasting change was written in the language of policy. This conviction led him back to Berkeley to earn a Master of Public Policy.\n\nNow, at 38, Arjun is a Senior Policy Advisor for the City of San Francisco, specializing in transportation and infrastructure. His 0.0-mile commute ends at the desk in the second bedroom of the Inner Sunset apartment he shares with his partner, Lena, a UX designer for a health tech company. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, data analysis, and drafting policy briefs that aim to make the city more equitable and accessible.\n\nHis life is deeply woven into the fabric of his neighborhood. Mornings start with a foggy walk to a local cafe on 9th Avenue, and he de-stresses from dense legislative text with long runs through Golden Gate Park. His social life is a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of policy wonks and creatives\u2014who prefer dinners in and brewery meetups to the downtown scene. Arjun\u2019s greatest aspiration isn't a higher office but the quiet satisfaction of seeing a project he championed, like a new protected bike lane or a more efficient MUNI line, become a tangible part of the city he loves. He dreams of a future where his work makes life discernibly better for San Franciscans, allowing him and Lena to build their own quiet, stable life in the city he works so hard to improve."
