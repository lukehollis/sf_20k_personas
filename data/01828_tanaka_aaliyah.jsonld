The daughter of a meticulous Japanese American architect and a passionate Black community organizer from Oakland, she grew up navigating the dualities of structure and soul. Her childhood was a blend of her father\u2019s blueprints and her mother\u2019s protest signs, teaching her that every system, whether a building or a society, is fundamentally about the people within it. This perspective shaped her intellectual curiosity and led her away from the predictable path.\n\nHer educational journey culminated in a Master's degree in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. She was fascinated by how cities functioned as living organisms, driven by the data of human movement and need. However, graduating just after the dot-com bust revealed a stark reality: urban planning jobs were scarce, but the burgeoning tech industry was ravenous for people who could understand complex systems. In a pivotal career turn, Aaliyah leveraged her understanding of societal patterns into the world of data analytics, teaching herself the necessary coding languages and statistical models to translate human behavior into actionable insights for tech companies.\n\nNow a Director of Data Analytics, Aaliyah works from her serene Noe Valley flat. The 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet control she cherishes after a brief, tumultuous marriage in her thirties taught her the value of a well-guarded private life. Her days follow a distinct rhythm: a 6 AM start with strong coffee and data models, a mid-day break for a walk through the fog-laced streets to a local bakery, and afternoons spent in virtual meetings, guiding her team.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She appreciates the city not for its frantic energy but for its pockets of calm. She knows the names of the baristas and the best time to find a quiet bench in Douglass Park. Her social circle is small and tight-knit\u2014a mix of old university friends and former colleagues.\n\nAaliyah\u2019s aspiration is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. Having achieved financial security, she dreams of applying her skills to civic-minded projects, perhaps mentoring young women of color entering tech or using data to support non-profits. She wants to honor both her parents\u2019 legacies\u2014to translate data not just into profit, but into progress."
