Adopted at ten months old, he was given his name by his loving, second-generation Russian-American parents, a literature professor and a civil engineer who raised him in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond. Growing up, Alexei existed in a loving but liminal space; he ate borscht and pelmeni, listened to his father read him Pushkin, and felt a profound disconnect with the Korean face staring back at him from the mirror.\n\nThis search for solid ground led him to embrace logic and order. He devoured math and systems, finding comfort in things that had a right answer. He pursued a degree in Economics at UC Berkeley, where the predictable curves of supply and demand were a welcome antidote to the ambiguities of his own identity. The world of finance was a natural progression. As a management analyst, he thrives on dissecting complex data and streamlining inefficient systems for a major financial firm, a job he performs with monastic focus from his apartment.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was the sudden death of his mother three years ago. The loss fractured his primary link to the culture that raised him, amplifying a long-dormant curiosity about his origins. It was a quiet, internal crisis that work could not solve.\n\nNow, at 29, Alexei lives a life of curated efficiency in a sterile SoMa high-rise. His 0.0-mile commute from bed to his standing desk is a testament to his controlled world. His days are a structured rhythm of market analysis, solo workouts in the building\u2019s gym, and precisely timed walks along the Embarcadero. He has work colleagues and acquaintances but no deep, anchoring friendships.\n\nSan Francisco is the only home he has ever known, yet he often feels like a tourist in his own life. His deepest aspiration has nothing to do with a promotion or a larger bonus. He dreams of buying a plane ticket to Seoul. He\u2019s secretly begun learning Korean through apps, the unfamiliar sounds feeling both foreign and strangely resonant. His ultimate hope is to one day walk the streets of his birth city, not to replace the family that raised him, but to finally understand the other half of himself and make Alexei Novikov feel whole."
