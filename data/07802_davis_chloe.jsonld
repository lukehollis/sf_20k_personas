Raised in the sprawling, sun-baked suburbs of Sacramento, Chloe\u2019s upbringing was one of comfortable predictability. Her parents, loving and pragmatic, encouraged her to attend a state college to study marketing. She complied, spending a year and a half at Sacramento State, drowning in theories she couldn\u2019t connect with and a future she didn't want. The turning point was not a dramatic explosion but a quiet implosion; a realization that she was performing a life rather than living one.\n\nIn an act of self-preservation, she dropped out, packed a single duffel bag, and used her saved-up barista money to move to San Francisco. She landed, as many do, in a shared apartment with a room barely big enough for a bed. Her 0.0-mile commute is a product of necessity; she works as a sales associate in a chic, independent boutique on the ground floor of a building just two doors down from her apartment. She\u2019s good at her job, her keen eye for aesthetics making her a natural at helping customers, but finds it unfulfilling.\n\nHer true life begins after her shifts. In the apartment she shares with another aspiring artist, Chloe sheds her retail persona. Her evenings are spent hunched over a drawing tablet, creating intricate digital illustrations inspired by the city\u2019s eccentric characters and fog-laced architecture. Her social circle is small and tight-knit: her roommate, a few regulars from the neighborhood coffee shop, and a friendly bartender at a nearby dive. Chloe\u2019s dream is to one day see her own prints and designs for sale in a boutique like the one she works in. For now, she lives a life of artistic ambition funded by retail necessity, finding her inspiration in the vibrant, compressed world of her chosen San Francisco neighborhood, waiting for her moment to break out."
