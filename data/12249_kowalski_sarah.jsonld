The daughter of a union steelworker and a public school librarian, she grew up with a deep appreciation for community institutions and the social safety nets that held her neighborhood together during economic downturns. This foundation propelled her to the University of Michigan and later to UC Berkeley for her Master's in Public Policy, drawn by the Bay Area's progressive ideals.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches of various San Francisco non-profits, writing grants and fighting for funding. While she valued the work, she grew frustrated by the limited scale. A key turning point came during a city-wide initiative where she witnessed firsthand the maddeningly inefficient digital tools citizens were forced to use. She saw government not as a broken machine, but a powerful engine in need of a modern tune-up. This epiphany guided her into public administration, where she methodically climbed the ranks.\n\nNow, as the Director of Digital Services, Sarah is a pragmatist fueled by idealism. Her personal life was shaped by a significant turning point a decade ago: a divorce from a tech founder whose \"move fast and break things\" ethos was fundamentally incompatible with her own belief in building sustainable, equitable systems. The experience left her more self-reliant and deeply committed to her work.\n\nResiding in Cole Valley, Sarah\u2019s life is woven into the city\u2019s fabric. Her 3.8-mile commute on the N Judah is a daily ritual, a time for listening to policy podcasts or simply observing the diverse cross-section of San Franciscans she serves. Her social life is a close-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow civil servants, an architect, a teacher\u2014with whom she shares dinners and hikes in the Presidio.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a corner office or a venture-backed exit. Her core aspiration is to launch a unified, human-centered digital portal for all city services, a project she believes could genuinely improve millions of lives. For Sarah, fixing the city\u2019s digital front door isn\u2019t just a job; it\u2019s an act of ensuring the San Francisco she fell in love with is accessible to everyone who calls it home."

He\u2019d called her latest project\u2014digitizing aid applications for low-income families\u2014a \u201csentimental waste of time.\u201d It wasn't the dismissal that stung, but the chasm it revealed between them. His world was about disruption for profit; hers was about stewardship for people. That night, a decade ago, the marriage ended, but a hard, clear sense of self-reliance settled in its place. She would build things that lasted, not just things that launched.\n\n2.\nIt was a pop-up clinic in the Bayview, about fifteen years ago. Sarah was trying to help an elderly man apply for a utility subsidy on a clunky city website. The page timed out for the third time, and he just sighed, defeated, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, dear. Too complicated.\u201d In his quiet resignation, she felt a flash of hot, clarifying anger. The problem wasn\u2019t the man or the program; it was the broken digital bridge between them. She knew then she couldn't just advocate from the outside. She had to get in and fix the machine herself.\n\n3.\nHer clearest memory of her father wasn\u2019t in the steel mill, but in the public library where her mother worked. After a round of layoffs, she saw him there, hunched over a computer with his friends, quietly helping them navigate unemployment forms. He looked smaller, but the library felt immense\u2014a place of dignity and second chances. She was ten, smelling old paper and dust, and understood for the first time that public institutions were the quiet hands that caught you when you fell. It was a lesson that became her life\u2019s work.\n\n4.\nJust last winter, on her morning N Judah commute, the train jolted to a stop underground. A collective groan went through the car. But then, a young woman started humming an off-key tune, an older man chuckled and joined in, and soon a small pocket of strangers was laughing together in the dark. It was a fleeting, perfectly San Franciscan moment of shared vulnerability and grace. It reminded her that beneath all the policy debates and budget lines were just people, trying to get through the day, together.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, her team launched a tiny pilot: a simplified, mobile-friendly interface for disputing a parking ticket. A week later, she got a screenshot of a tweet. It was from a new mom, who wrote, \u201cI just dealt with a parking ticket on my phone while nursing my baby. This is the first time a city website has ever felt like it respected my time.\u201d Sarah saved the image. It wasn't a major project, but it was proof. It was the fuel she needed, a quiet validation that better was possible."
