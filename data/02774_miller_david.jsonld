Born and raised in the apartment directly above \"Miller & Son Hardware\" in Cole Valley, he is a third-generation San Franciscan, a rarity he wears with quiet, weary pride. His childhood was a symphony of jingling keys being cut, the scent of sawdust, and the gruff but loving guidance of his father, who inherited the store from David\u2019s grandfather.\n\nHe never planned to take over the family business. After graduating from Lowell High, David resisted the future laid out for him. He enrolled in a few business classes at City College of San Francisco but quickly dropped out, finding more education in his jobs as a bike messenger navigating the city's steep hills and as a bartender in a gritty SOMA dive bar. In his twenties, he dreamed of being a photographer, capturing the city\u2019s unpolished soul. He saw the store as a trap, a symbol of a life too small.\n\nThe turning point came when David was 31. His father had a severe stroke, leaving him unable to manage the store. The choice was stark: sell the family legacy or step up. David chose duty. He moved back into the upstairs apartment, the dreams of an artist's life fading with each inventory count and supplier call. The transition was rocky, straining his long-term relationship to its breaking point; his girlfriend couldn't understand why he was giving up his ambitions for a dusty shop.\n\nNow, at 48, David is the store. His commute is a single flight of stairs. His day starts with coffee from the cafe next door, where the barista knows his order by heart, and ends with him locking the heavy front gate. He is a neighborhood institution, a friendly face who can find the exact screw a customer needs or offer advice on fixing a leaky faucet. His social life is woven into his work\u2014the brief chats with regulars, the shared beer with the owner of the pub across the street after closing.\n\nDavid's hopes are now more pragmatic. He dreams of keeping the store afloat against the tide of online retailers and big-box chains. He secretly hopes a younger relative might one day show interest, but he doubts it. More than anything, he hopes to preserve this small piece of tangible, old San Francisco, a place built on community and trust, for as long as he can."
