The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond, David grew up surrounded by the scent of produce and the weight of his parents\u2019 dreams. They envisioned a Dr. Kim or a Lawyer Kim, a path of clear prestige and financial security. He obliged them through his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley, dutifully slogging through pre-med requirements until a volunteer gig tutoring at a Mission District youth center changed everything. There, he discovered a profound talent for connecting with teenagers, for seeing the spark of potential through layers of adolescent defiance.\n\nAbandoning medicine, he enrolled in a Master's in Education Administration program at SFSU, a choice his parents eventually accepted with reluctant pride. David began his career teaching history at the very high school he now leads. He wasn\u2019t the loudest teacher, but he was the one students sought out. He climbed the ranks from teacher to vice-principal, and finally, to principal eight years ago. When the position opened, he made a pivotal choice: he moved into the small, spartan faculty apartment on the edge of the school campus. His commute is a 30-second walk across a quad.\n\nHis life is governed by the school bell. Mornings start before dawn with a walk around the silent campus, coffee in hand, planning for the day\u2019s controlled chaos. His personal life has taken a backseat; a serious relationship ended a decade ago, unable to compete with his 24/7 commitment to his 1,200 students. His social circle is his staff, and his closest confidante is his vice-principal. For leisure, he runs along Ocean Beach, the cold Pacific air a necessary reset.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is no longer for himself, but for his students. He fights for funding, navigates complex social issues, and sees his younger self in the eyes of first-generation kids striving to find their own way. He dreams of building a state-of-the-art tech lab and, perhaps someday, of having a quiet weekend where his phone doesn\u2019t ring with a school emergency. He is a fixture of his community, a man who traded a life of his own for the potential of thousands of others."

David asked about her grandmother\u2019s journey from El Salvador, and her eyes suddenly lit up. As she talked, he wasn't just tutoring; he was unlocking a story. In that small room, the sterile world of organic chemistry dissolved, replaced by the profound, messy work of helping someone find their voice. It was the first time his future felt like his own, occurring during his junior year at Berkeley.\n\n2.\nWeeks after he announced he was abandoning medicine, the silence at the dinner table was still heavy. Then one evening, his father, who hadn't spoken a word on the topic, silently placed a worn envelope next to his rice bowl. It held cash for his first SFSU textbooks. No words were exchanged, but David understood. It wasn't approval, not yet. It was a reluctant, painful acceptance; a father's love overriding a broken dream. The weight of that gesture, just before he started his master's, allowed him to move forward.\n\n3.\nHe remembers standing in his old apartment, phone in hand. His girlfriend, Clara, was waiting, her bag for their Napa weekend packed by the door. But a student was in crisis, and the family only spoke Cantonese. \"They need me,\" he\u2019d said, the words feeling both true and like a betrayal. The look in Clara's eyes wasn't anger, but a quiet, final understanding. The silence after she left a decade ago was the cost of his calling, a choice that cemented the school as the central relationship in his life.\n\n4.\nHis first night as principal, he didn't unpack. He stood in the stark faculty apartment, the window overlooking the dark, silent quad. The faint hum of the school\u2019s hallway lights was his only company. There was no commute to escape to, no door to close on his responsibility. In that profound quiet eight years ago, he felt the weight of 1,200 futures settling over him. It wasn\u2019t just a job anymore; it had become the entire geography of his life. He was home.\n\n5.\nLast year, a quiet Korean student, a brilliant artist, was being pressured into engineering. David met with the boy in his office. \"Your parents want you to be secure,\" David said softly, \"Mine dreamed of a doctor.\" The student\u2019s head snapped up, his eyes wide with recognition. In that shared moment of first-generation weight and expectation, David saw his entire journey reflected back at him. His sacrifice wasn\u2019t a loss, but a map he could now offer to others trying to find their own way home."
