The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond, David grew up surrounded by the scent of produce and the weight of his parents\u2019 dreams. They envisioned a Dr. Kim or a Lawyer Kim, a path of clear prestige and financial security. He obliged them through his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley, dutifully slogging through pre-med requirements until a volunteer gig tutoring at a Mission District youth center changed everything. There, he discovered a profound talent for connecting with teenagers, for seeing the spark of potential through layers of adolescent defiance.\n\nAbandoning medicine, he enrolled in a Master's in Education Administration program at SFSU, a choice his parents eventually accepted with reluctant pride. David began his career teaching history at the very high school he now leads. He wasn\u2019t the loudest teacher, but he was the one students sought out. He climbed the ranks from teacher to vice-principal, and finally, to principal eight years ago. When the position opened, he made a pivotal choice: he moved into the small, spartan faculty apartment on the edge of the school campus. His commute is a 30-second walk across a quad.\n\nHis life is governed by the school bell. Mornings start before dawn with a walk around the silent campus, coffee in hand, planning for the day\u2019s controlled chaos. His personal life has taken a backseat; a serious relationship ended a decade ago, unable to compete with his 24/7 commitment to his 1,200 students. His social circle is his staff, and his closest confidante is his vice-principal. For leisure, he runs along Ocean Beach, the cold Pacific air a necessary reset.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is no longer for himself, but for his students. He fights for funding, navigates complex social issues, and sees his younger self in the eyes of first-generation kids striving to find their own way. He dreams of building a state-of-the-art tech lab and, perhaps someday, of having a quiet weekend where his phone doesn\u2019t ring with a school emergency. He is a fixture of his community, a man who traded a life of his own for the potential of thousands of others."
