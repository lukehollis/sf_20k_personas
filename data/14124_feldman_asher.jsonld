The son of a pragmatic engineer and a free-spirited ceramicist, he spent his youth surrounded by both blueprints and clay. This fusion of the technical and the artistic defined his path, leading him to Carnegie Mellon University for a graduate degree in Industrial Design, where he honed his ability to make beautiful things that worked flawlessly.\n\nHis early career was a disillusioning stint at a massive consumer electronics firm in the Midwest. While the work was stable, Asher felt creatively stifled, designing disposable plastic shells for products he knew would be obsolete in a year. The turning point came at age 31. Burnt out and craving meaningful work, he took a risk, liquidated his modest savings, and moved to San Francisco. He was drawn not by the tech gold rush, but by the city\u2019s vibrant undercurrent of artisans and makers. He landed a job at a boutique manufacturing company in the Dogpatch, one that valued sustainable materials and high-quality fabrication.\n\nNow, as Director of Product Design, Asher thrives. His 2.8-mile bicycle commute from his Potrero Hill apartment is a daily ritual, a rolling meditation through the city\u2019s waking streets. He lives with his partner of six years, Clara, a landscape architect whose love for organic systems complements his passion for structured design. Their evenings are spent cooking together, discussing projects, or enjoying a beer at a local brewery with a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014mostly other designers, architects, and craftspeople.\n\nAsher feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2019s tangible culture. He loves the smell of sawdust from the workshops near his office and the historic brick of his neighborhood. While he has achieved professional success, his ultimate dream is to open his own independent design and fabrication studio. He envisions a space where he can create a bespoke line of furniture and lighting, fully controlling the process from initial sketch to final product\u2014a perfect synthesis of his parents\u2019 worlds, realized in the city he now calls home."

Sitting in his beige Midwest apartment at 31, a wave of disgust washed over him\u2014not for the object, but for the disposable life it represented. That single, unsatisfying *snap* was the sound of his old life breaking. It was the moment the terrifying idea of moving to San Francisco, of chasing something real, became an absolute, undeniable necessity he had to act on.\n\n2.\nHis first week after landing the Dogpatch job, he walked from the Caltrain station through his new work neighborhood. The air, thick with the scent of cut lumber and welding steel, was intoxicating. It was the smell of things being *made*, of substance. He\u2019d left a world of sterile cubicles and planned obsolescence for this. Leaning against a warm brick wall, watching sparks fly from a workshop, a profound sense of relief settled in his bones. He wasn\u2019t just in a new city; he was finally, truly, home.\n\n3.\nHe met Clara seven years ago on a windy Bernal Heights rooftop. While others talked startups, she was quietly sketching the unruly bougainvillea spilling over the deck. He noticed her hands\u2014strong, smudged with charcoal and soil. She spoke of growth patterns and root systems with the same precision he used for joinery and materials. In her, he saw a more organic, living kind of design. That night, he didn't just meet his future partner; he found the missing half of his own creative language.\n\n4.\nThree years into his job, he ran his hand over the finished prototype: a chair of reclaimed cypress and brushed steel. The joints were perfect, the balance exquisite. He remembered the ghosts of his past designs\u2014ephemeral plastic husks. This chair had weight, history, and a future. It was the first time his work felt like a true extension of himself, not just a task for a paycheck. That feeling of quiet, abiding pride was the antidote to years of corporate burnout. Work had become craft again.\n\n5.\nLast spring, he was sketching a lamp at their kitchen table while Clara planned a client's native garden. He explained the hand-turned wooden base, the custom-milled brass fitting. She looked up from her blueprints of soil and stone and said, \"You talk about this like you've already built it. So why haven't you?\" Her simple question cut through all his doubts. In that instant, the abstract dream of \"Feldman Design & Fabrication\" became a tangible, urgent plan\u2014the final, necessary step in building a life of his own design."
