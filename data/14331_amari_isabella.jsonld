Raised in Daly City, the daughter of a pragmatic Italian-American electrician and a compassionate Filipino-American nurse, she grew up navigating two distinct cultures. Her home was filled with the scents of both adobo and marinara, and conversations often shifted between her father\u2019s union-hall pragmatism and her mother\u2019s deep-seated faith in community. This upbringing instilled in her a profound awareness of the subtle and overt ways systems either support or fail hardworking people.\n\nThis awareness guided her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Public Policy. A transformative internship at a community center in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin was her turning point. Witnessing firsthand the gap between well-meaning policy and on-the-ground reality, she committed her career to bridging that divide. She began as a case manager after graduation, steadily working her way up through the non-profit world with a quiet but fierce determination.\n\nNow, at 37, Isabella is the Program Director for \"Bay Area Forward,\" a non-profit that creates pathways for underrepresented youth into tech management and scientific roles. Her days are a blend of grant writing, mentoring staff, and forging partnerships with tech giants who she tirelessly pressures to move beyond performative allyship.\n\nHer home is a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood she loves for its vibrancy and grit. Her 2.8-mile bike commute to her SoMa office is a daily ritual, a moment to observe the city she serves\u2014its glaring inequalities and its resilient beauty. Evenings are often spent with a close-knit circle of friends, many from similar activist and non-profit backgrounds, decompressing at a local brewery or sharing a potluck dinner.\n\nIsabella\u2019s dream is not one of wealth, but of scale. She aspires to expand her program into a national model, proving that equitable professional development is a solvable problem. She holds a quiet hope for a partnership that aligns with her values, but her primary focus remains her mission: to ensure the city that has become her home offers a genuine future for everyone, not just a select few."

Her father\u2019s union pamphlet outlining new pension rules lay next to her mother\u2019s cash box for a neighborhood bake sale to help a sick neighbor. She didn\u2019t understand \u2018pension\u2019 or \u2018co-pay,\u2019 but she saw two ways of caring for people: the structured system and the immediate community. It was the first time she realized there was a gap between the two, a space she felt an inexplicable pull to understand and eventually bridge.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring her Berkeley internship, she tried to help an elderly Vietnamese woman in the Tenderloin fill out a housing form. The woman\u2019s hands trembled, but her dignity was immense. Isabella, armed with policy theory, felt utterly useless against the labyrinth of bureaucratic jargon. The woman just smiled wearily and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, mija.\u201d In that moment of complete failure, Isabella\u2019s abstract passion for policy became a visceral, lifelong commitment to making systems serve the people they were designed to help, not confuse them.\n\n***\n\n3.\nShe was 26, a case manager drowning in overwhelming caseloads. A teenager she\u2019d mentored, a kid who\u2019d missed three appointments in a row, showed up wearing a crisp new security guard uniform for his first day of work. He didn\u2019t say \u201cthank you,\u201d just gave her a clipped, almost imperceptible nod. It wasn't a policy win celebrated in a report; it was a human one. That silent acknowledgment fueled her for the next year, a quiet victory that reminded her the work mattered.\n\n***\n\n4.\nJust last week, biking down Folsom Street. The morning sun glinted off the windows of a gleaming new tech headquarters, while half a block away, a man carefully swept the patch of sidewalk around his tent. The sheer, unapologetic proximity of extreme wealth and basic survival is a daily gut punch. It isn\u2019t data for a grant proposal; it's the air she breathes on her commute. It focuses her frustration, sharpening it from abstract anger into the precise fuel that drives her work.\n\n***\n\n5.\nSix months ago, she sat in a sterile tech conference room. One of her program\u2019s first graduates, a young woman from the Excelsior, was confidently presenting project data to the very VPs Isabella had hounded for funding. Watching the young woman command the room, owning her expertise, Isabella felt a wave of profound, anonymous pride. It wasn't about her own success, but the tangible proof that the path she was building actually led somewhere. It was hope made manifest."
