Born in Sacramento to a white, literature-loving mother from Oregon and an ambitious immigrant father from New Delhi, David grew up feeling slightly out of sync. He inherited his mother\u2019s love for the written word and his father\u2019s pragmatic drive, a combination that would define his life. He identifies as white on forms, a simple checkbox that erases the complexity of his upbringing.\n\nHis journey to San Francisco began at UC Berkeley, where he pursued a Journalism degree with fierce idealism in the mid-90s. He dreamed of exposing corruption and giving a voice to the voiceless. He landed a coveted job at a Bay Area newspaper, chronicling the dizzying heights of the first dot-com boom. For a decade, he was in his element, chasing stories and living on adrenaline and coffee.\n\nThe turning point was slow and agonizing. He watched as the industry that had been his calling was hollowed out by the internet. Buyouts turned into layoffs, and by his late thirties, the career he\u2019d built was gone. Pragmatism, inherited from his father, took over. He pivoted, leveraging his writing skills for the burgeoning world of tech. He became a \"content creator,\" then a \"manager,\" and eventually a \"Director of Content Strategy,\" a title that felt both impressive and utterly devoid of the soul his younger self had sought. The six-figure salary was a comfortable balm on a wound that never fully healed.\n\nNow at 50, David\u2019s life is one of structured routine. He lives alone in the Outer Sunset, a neighborhood he chose for its quiet, fog-laced streets and proximity to the roar of the Pacific. A marriage in his thirties had dissolved amicably, leaving behind a quiet condo and a learned self-reliance. His daily 14.8-mile MUNI commute on the N-Judah is a cherished ritual, a non-digital space where he reads physical books. His friends are a small, tight circle of ex-journalists who understand his particular brand of melancholy success.\n\nHis deepest aspiration is to write a book\u2014a non-fiction account of the death of local news, told from the inside. It\u2019s a project he endlessly outlines but never begins, fearing it will mean finally admitting that the best version of himself was left behind in a noisy, ink-stained newsroom."

He wasn\u2019t just a reporter; he was a conduit for her fear and defiance. When his article ran, a local politician called, and the eviction was stayed. For a week, David felt indestructible, righteous. It was the purest feeling of purpose he has ever known, a high he\u2019s been chasing ever since.\n\n2.\nHe stood in their Glen Park apartment, dividing books with the woman who would soon be his ex-wife. She handed him their worn copy of Joan Didion. \u201cYou keep this,\u201d she said, her voice soft, not unkind. \u201cIt was always more you, anyway.\u201d There was no fight, just the quiet, aching acknowledgment of their divergence. In that moment, he learned that great losses can arrive without a sound, solidifying a self-reliance he never wanted but would come to depend on.\n\n3.\nHis first assignment at the startup wasn\u2019t a story, but a \u201cuser-journey messaging matrix.\u201d He was 38. Staring at the sterile corporate jargon on his new laptop, the silence of the open-plan office felt deafening compared to the newsroom\u2019s chaotic hum. It was the first time the money felt like a payment for his silence, a trade he made consciously. That day, a small, essential part of him went quiet, and he\u2019s never been able to coax it back.\n\n4.\nHe was 45, walking past the old newspaper building on Mission Street. The grand lobby, where he\u2019d once raced to meet deadlines, was now a sleek, minimalist tech office. A group of kids barely out of college laughed as they swiped their keycards. Seeing the ghost of his past so casually erased triggered not just sadness, but a hot flash of rage. In that instant, the vague idea for his book became a furious, necessary mission: to build a memorial out of words.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on the N-Judah, a young woman saw the battered William Gibson novel in his hands and smiled. \u201cPhysical copy, old school. I love it.\u201d For the rest of the ride through the Sunset Tunnel, they didn't speak again, but David held the book a little tighter. The simple, fleeting connection\u2014a recognition of his analog rebellion in a digital world\u2014felt more validating than any praise he\u2019d received in years. It affirmed his daily ritual as a quiet protest for his soul."
