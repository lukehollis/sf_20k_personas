Born in the Philippines, he was adopted as an infant by a warm, working-class Italian-American couple, Marco and Sofia Romano, and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Excelsior District. His father, a mechanic, filled their garage with the smell of motor oil and the sound of classic rock. It was there Leo learned to appreciate well-made things, developing a quiet fascination with how parts fit together to create a functioning whole.\n\nHe was never a star student in the traditional sense. After graduating from a local public high school, he enrolled in Industrial Arts at City College of San Francisco but found the classroom stifling. He craved the tangible feedback of metal and machinery. He dropped out after three semesters to take an apprenticeship at a machine shop in the Dogpatch, a decision that disappointed his parents initially but ultimately defined his life. He found his calling in the cold precision of the CNC machine, translating digital designs into tangible steel and aluminum parts.\n\nLeo has watched the city of his youth\u2014a city of dockworkers, mechanics, and artists\u2014morph into a hub of intangible digital products. He feels like a relic, a craftsman in a world of coders. A key turning point was the passing of his adoptive parents a decade ago, leaving him the sole carrier of the Romano name and its blue-collar legacy.\n\nNow 48, Leo lives a simple, structured life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days begin before dawn with a strong cup of coffee and the 3.5-mile MUNI ride to the shop. His work is his meditation. Socially, he keeps a small, tight circle of old friends and coworkers, preferring a beer at a quiet Outer Sunset bar to the city's trendier spots. His connection to San Francisco is deep and tactile; it\u2019s in the rumble of the bus, the fog rolling over the hills, and the hum of the machinery that still powers the city's hidden corners. His quiet dream is to one day save enough to open a small, specialty fabrication shop, creating bespoke metal parts for local artists and furniture makers\u2014a small but defiant act to keep the craft of making things by hand alive in his hometown."

Marco didn't talk much, just pointed. *\u201cHere, hold this steady.\u201d* The smell of oil, the scratch of Creedence on the radio. When the job was done, his dad wiped a smudge of grease from Leo\u2019s cheek and said, *\u201cSee? A Romano knows how to fix things.\u201d* In that garage, he wasn\u2019t the adopted kid; he was simply his father\u2019s son. It felt like home.\n\n2.\nThe silence at the dinner table was heavier than any machine part. He was 19, and the words \u201cI\u2019m dropping out\u201d had just landed. He saw the flicker of disappointment in Sofia's eyes and the tightening of Marco\u2019s jaw. He explained the feel of the lathe, the logic of the mill, how it all just *made sense* in a way the classroom didn't. When his father finally nodded, a quiet, reluctant acceptance, Leo felt the path of his life lock into place. It was the right kind of heavy.\n\n3.\nHe was walking down 3rd Street in the Dogpatch, maybe 37, when he saw it. The old ironworks, a place he\u2019d once delivered parts to, was gone. In its place stood a glass-fronted building with a minimalist logo he didn\u2019t recognize. Inside, young people sat on colorful couches, staring at laptops. The air didn\u2019t smell of welding fumes or rust; it smelled of nothing. He felt an invisible wall go up between him and his city, the quiet chill of being left behind by a world he no longer recognized.\n\n4.\nA week after the funeral, he stood alone in his parents\u2019 garage. He was 38. The air still held the faint scent of his father\u2019s motor oil. He ran his hand over the scarred workbench, his fingers finding the divots and cuts left by decades of work. He wasn't just clearing out tools; he was inheriting a history. Lifting his father's old toolbox, feeling its familiar, solid weight, he understood he was the last Romano now. The responsibility settled not as a burden, but as a purpose.\n\n5.\nA young furniture designer from the Mission, just a few years ago when he was 45, brought him a complex digital file for a single, custom table leg. She couldn\u2019t find anyone to make just one. Leo milled it from a solid block of aluminum, the finished piece cool and perfect in her hands. Her genuine awe\u2014not at the code, but at the object itself\u2014was a revelation. It wasn\u2019t about being a relic; it was about being essential. The dream of his own shop, a place for creators, began to feel real."
