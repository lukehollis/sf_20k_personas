            "value": "Keiji Miller, a man of 54, carries the quiet strength of someone who has built his life with careful calculation and steady effort. Born in San Francisco to a Japanese immigrant mother and a father of Irish descent, Keiji\u2019s childhood in the Richmond District was a blend of two distinct cultures. His mother, a seamstress, instilled in him the value of meticulous work and quiet resilience, while his father, a union carpenter, showed him the importance of practical problem-solving and community. Sundays were a mix of visits to Japantown for *manju* and attending mass at St. Monica\u2019s.\n\nHis knack for understanding systems and optimization led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at San Jose State University. College was less about the social scene and more about mastering the craft, a methodical approach that would define his career. He landed his first job as a junior engineer at a manufacturing plant in the East Bay, a role that blossomed into his current position as Operations Manager. His ascent wasn't meteoric, but a steady climb marked by efficiency improvements and a knack for streamlining production. The $145,000 income reflects decades of dedicated work and a deep understanding of his industry.\n\nA significant turning point was the closure of his previous plant, forcing him to navigate the job market in his late 40s. It was a sobering reminder of the transient nature of even established careers, leading him to value stability more than ever. His marriage to his wife, Sarah, twenty-five years ago, provided a bedrock of unwavering support. They have two adult children, a daughter pursuing a Ph.D. in the Midwest and a son working in tech in Seattle \u2013 a source of quiet pride. His social circle is small, consisting primarily of former colleagues and a few couples he and Sarah have known for years, often connecting over backyard barbecues and shared complaints about the ever-increasing cost of living in the Bay Area.\n\nKeiji commutes 15.8 miles by car from his comfortable, if not flashy, house in the Outer Sunset. His mornings begin with coffee and the Chronicle, a ritual that grounds him before the demands of his day. Evenings often involve tinkering in his garage or tending to his small vegetable garden. He dreams of retiring in the next decade, perhaps pursuing woodworking more seriously, a hobby he finds both relaxing and rewarding. He hopes to see his grandchildren grow up, a future generation enjoying the stability he worked hard to create. San Francisco, to him, is more than just a city; it\u2019s the backdrop of his entire life, the place where his roots run deep and where he plans to spend his remaining years, watching the fog roll in from his living room window."
