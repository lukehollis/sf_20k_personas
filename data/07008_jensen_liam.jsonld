Raised in Portland, Oregon, by two literature professors, his childhood was filled with books, intellectual debate, and the quiet assumption that he would follow a path in the humanities. He obliged, earning a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Oregon, where he relished dissecting Kant and debating ethics. The degree, however, felt less noble when paired with student loans and a starkly barren job market.\n\nThe key turning point came six months after graduation, while working as a barista. Watching his engineering-major friends accept lucrative job offers, a switch flipped in Liam's mind. He realized the systems and logic he loved in philosophy could be applied to a more practical, and profitable, field: finance. With intense discipline, he devoured books on market theory, taught himself advanced Excel, and passed the first level of the CFA exam. This demonstrated initiative was enough to land him an entry-level job at a firm in San Francisco.\n\nNow 34, Liam is a senior financial analyst who has worked from home since well before the pandemic made it standard. His 0.0-mile commute defines his existence in his minimalist Hayes Valley apartment, which serves as both home and office. His days are a blur of data sets, market trend reports, and video calls, a world away from his philosophical roots.\n\nTo counteract the sterile nature of his work, Liam curates his life with intention. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe for a pour-over, the one ritual that gets him out the door. After work, he sheds his analyst skin completely. He isn't chasing promotions; he's chasing equilibrium. He reads dense history books, attends lectures at the Commonwealth Club, and spends weekends exploring Muir Woods or losing himself in SFMOMA. His social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of a few friends who appreciate his dry wit and deep-seated curiosity.\n\nLiam\u2019s quiet aspiration is to bridge the two halves of his life. He dreams of writing a book exploring the philosophical underpinnings of modern economic theory, proving to himself, and perhaps the world, that his first intellectual passion was not a detour, but the foundation for a more meaningful understanding of the very system he now navigates."
