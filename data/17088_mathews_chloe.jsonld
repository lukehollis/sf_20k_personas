Raised in Fremont by her Korean-American ceramicist mother and a history-teacher father of Irish descent, her childhood home was a museum in miniature\u2014filled with her mother\u2019s pottery, her father\u2019s antique maps, and endless stories. Weekend trips to San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum or the Asian Art Museum weren't just outings; they were pilgrimages that ignited her imagination, teaching her that every object holds a narrative waiting to be told.\n\nThis passion guided her educational journey, from an undergraduate degree in Art History to a Master\u2019s in Museum Studies at the University of San Francisco. Moving to the city for graduate school was the definitive turning point. The quiet suburban observer became an active urban participant, trading her parents' tranquil garden for the vibrant pulse of city life. After a competitive internship, she landed her dream job as an Assistant Curator at the California Academy of Sciences, a role that perfectly marries her love for cultural artifacts with a rigorous scientific framework.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s life is rooted in the Inner Richmond. Her 2.8-mile commute on the 5-Fulton bus is a daily ritual, a time to people-watch and listen to history podcasts as the city wakes up. Her days are spent in the meticulous, climate-controlled world of the museum\u2019s archives, cataloging specimens and artifacts from historical expeditions. Evenings are for unwinding\u2014either with a yoga class, exploring the incredible restaurants on Clement Street with her close-knit group of friends from her master\u2019s program, or sketching in her apartment.\n\nThough content, Chloe is driven. Her ambition is to curate her own exhibit, one that explores the intersection of East Asian craft traditions and natural history. She dreams of giving a voice to overlooked artisans and untold stories, a goal deeply connected to her own bicultural identity. For Chloe, San Francisco is not just a place to work; it's the canvas on which she is carefully curating her own life\u2019s story."

Her father whispered about its journey through time, while her mother\u2019s hand tightened on her shoulder. In the vase\u2019s impossibly fine cracks, she saw the echo of her mother\u2019s hands at the pottery wheel. It wasn\u2019t just an artifact; it was an ancestor. That day, her passion for objects solidified into a calling\u2014a need to understand the lineage of human creation, connecting her own family's story to the grand sweep of history.\n\n2.\nHer first night in her graduate school apartment, the sounds of the 5-Fulton bus hissing outside were a jarring symphony compared to Fremont\u2019s silence. Unpacking boxes of books and her mother\u2019s pottery, she felt a thrill of terror and independence. This wasn\u2019t a day trip; this was hers. Looking out at the fog-dampened streetlights of the Inner Richmond, she understood she was no longer just visiting the story of San Francisco. She was finally beginning to write her own chapter within it.\n\n3.\nThe email from the California Academy of Sciences arrived on a foggy Tuesday morning. She read the subject line, \u201cOffer of Employment: Assistant Curator,\u201d three times before her breath returned. Sitting in her small apartment, the years of study, the unpaid internship, and her parents\u2019 unwavering belief all coalesced into a single, shimmering point of victory. It was the moment her carefully curated education became a real, living career. She wasn't just studying history anymore; she was now its steward.\n\n4.\nMonths into her job, deep in the climate-controlled archives, she found it: a brittle folder from a 1920s botanical expedition to the Korean peninsula. Tucked between pressed mountain flora was a small, crudely sketched map of a village, with an explorer's note: \u201cLocal artisans use this clay for pottery.\u201d The unexpected collision of science and craft made her heart race. It was the thesis for her dream exhibit, tangible proof that nature and human artistry were anciently intertwined.\n\n5.\nLast winter, crowded into a noisy Clement Street hot pot restaurant with her friends from grad school, she felt a profound sense of peace. Steam fogged the windows, their laughter mixing with the chatter from other tables as they debated museum politics and terrible dates. In that moment, surrounded by her chosen family, Chloe realized she had successfully curated not just a career, but a life. The city was no longer just a canvas; it was home."
