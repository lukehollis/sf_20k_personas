Raised in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, by a pragmatic accountant father and a high school history teacher mother, Ben\u2019s upbringing was stable and predictable. He was encouraged to find a practical, tangible career, which led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Urban Planning. He was fascinated by how cities functioned as living organisms, by the intricate dance of infrastructure, housing, and public space.\n\nUpon graduating, however, Ben found the reality of public sector work to be slow and mired in bureaucracy. A post-college job digitizing city planning archives for a municipal contractor was his unintentional entry into the tech world. He discovered a surprising aptitude for organizing digital assets and coordinating between departments, skills honed by his planning studies. When the contract ended, he took a leap and accepted an entry-level position at a San Francisco tech startup in his late twenties.\n\nBen was never the star coder or the visionary founder, but he was the indispensable anchor. He translated the chaotic energy of engineers and designers into actionable plans and clear timelines, slowly building a career as a project coordinator. The true turning point came with the pandemic-induced shift to remote work. Freed from the open-plan office and daily commute, Ben thrived. He found a new, profound sense of control and focus within the walls of his Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nNow 38, Ben\u2019s life is a testament to curated routine. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his coffee maker to his standing desk. His days are structured by virtual meetings and project tracking software, but his breaks are spent walking through Golden Gate Park or grabbing pho from a favorite spot on Clement Street. He has a small, tight-knit group of friends, remnants of a long-term relationship that ended two years ago, with whom he shares occasional dinners or trivia nights. Though professionally successful, Ben feels a quiet pull back toward his original passion. He dreams of eventually using his project coordination skills for a civic tech company or a non-profit focused on urban sustainability, hoping to finally merge the digital efficiency he\u2019s mastered with the tangible world he once set out to improve."
