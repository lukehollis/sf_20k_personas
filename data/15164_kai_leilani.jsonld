The daughter of a Filipino sailor who joined the U.S. Navy and a Native Hawaiian woman he met while stationed at Pearl Harbor, Leilani grew up in Alameda. She was neither fully one thing nor the other, a quiet observer navigating the cultural currents of her mixed heritage. This feeling of being an observer sparked a deep curiosity about how people think, communicate, and form communities, a curiosity that led her to study Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer entry into the workforce coincided with the tail-end of the first dot-com bubble. The subsequent bust was a formative experience, teaching her resilience as she pieced together contract work. She found her calling in User Experience (UX) Research, a field where her innate empathy and analytical mind could translate human behavior into better technology. Over two decades, she methodically built a reputation for insightful, human-centered work, climbing from junior researcher to her current role as Director of UX Research at a major software company in SoMa.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties after the amicable end of a long-term relationship. Instead of seeking another partnership, she invested deeply in her friendships and herself, creating a \"chosen family\" that became her anchor. This period cemented her independence and clarified her priorities.\n\nToday, Leilani lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her routine is a comforting ritual: a walk in the foggy expanse of Golden Gate Park, then the 5.5-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus, where she reads physical books, a small rebellion against her screen-filled profession. She loves her neighborhood for its dim sum, its Russian bakeries, and its unpretentious, family-oriented vibe.\n\nHaving achieved financial and professional security, Leilani's ambitions have shifted. She dreams of using her position to mentor young women of color entering the tech industry, helping them navigate a world she found challenging. Her ultimate aspiration is to one day buy a small plot of land on Kaua'i, reconnecting with the Hawaiian side of her heritage that has always called to her across the water."

Her mother\u2019s side brought poi and laulau, their conversations a soft, melodic hum. Leilani sat on the steps between them, a plate of both on her lap, feeling like a tiny island between two continents. It wasn\u2019t loneliness, but a quiet awareness of her unique place. That day, she learned to listen from the spaces in between, a skill that would define her life.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001. The cardboard box felt heavier than it was, filled with a wilted desk plant and a single mug. The startup\u2019s foosball table was already gone. Walking out into the bright San Francisco sun, the city felt indifferent to her new unemployment. The fear was a cold knot in her stomach, but beneath it was a flicker of resolve. She promised herself then that she would never again depend on a single company for her security. This was the moment her resilience was forged, contract by contract, piece by piece.\n\n3.\nHer first birthday after the breakup, in her late thirties. She'd planned for a quiet night, braced for a pang of loneliness. Instead, her two best friends showed up with a small ube cake from a Fillmore bakery and a bottle of ridiculously expensive wine. They didn't talk about her ex; they talked about a terrible movie they\u2019d seen. In the easy warmth of her Inner Richmond apartment, she realized this was her foundation. Partnership was a possibility, but this\u2014this chosen family\u2014was a certainty. It was a profound, grounding relief.\n\n4.\nShe was in a design critique, now a Director in her forties. A junior researcher, a young Pinay woman, was presenting her findings. She was brilliant, but her voice faltered when a senior designer interrupted her. Leilani saw a ghost of her own past\u2014the tentative, code-switching observer. After the meeting, she pulled the young woman aside, not with criticism, but with a simple, \"Your insights were the sharpest in the room.\" In that moment, her ambition shifted from climbing higher to building a ladder for those coming up behind her.\n\n5.\nOn a solo trip to Kaua\u02bbi a few years ago, she stood on a cliff overlooking Polihale. The red dirt was warm beneath her feet, the salty wind tangling her hair. Her mother once told her this was where souls departed. It wasn't a sad thought. Staring at the impossible blue, she felt a profound sense of recognition, a quiet hum in her bones. The dream of returning stopped being an abstract \"someday.\" It became a promise to a part of herself she had only ever known from a distance."
