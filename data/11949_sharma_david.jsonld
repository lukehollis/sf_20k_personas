Born in a small town in Punjab, India, he was the eldest son, shouldering the weight of his family's aspirations. They immigrated to Daly City when David was 17, chasing a vision of American prosperity that centered on education and a white-collar career. Dutifully, David enrolled in business courses at a local community college, his mind on spreadsheets while his heart remained in his mother\u2019s kitchen, where the true alchemy happened.\n\nThe turning point came not with a diploma, but with a family crisis. When his father suffered a heart attack, David dropped out of college to help run the family's small grocery store. It was there, surrounded by produce and spices, that his path clarified. He began cooking meals for the family, recreating his mother Maya's recipes with a precision and passion that surprised everyone, including himself. This newfound purpose led him on a two-decade journey through the underbelly of San Francisco's restaurant scene, working his way up from dishwasher to line cook, absorbing techniques in bustling kitchens from North Beach to the Mission.\n\nFifteen years ago, David poured his life savings and a mountain of debt into a small, neglected storefront in the Inner Richmond. He lived in the tiny apartment upstairs, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. He named the restaurant \"Maya's Kitchen,\" a tribute to the woman who inspired his craft. It is not a trendy establishment, but a neighborhood institution, known for its fragrant biryani and David\u2019s warm, if weary, presence behind the counter.\n\nHis devotion to the restaurant cost him his marriage years ago, and his relationship with his adult daughter, now a lawyer, is strained by his constant absence during her childhood. David's life is a cycle of early morning market runs, long hours of prep, the controlled chaos of service, and late-night clean-ups. His dream is no longer of expansion or fame, but of legacy. He hopes to one day reconcile with his daughter and, perhaps, find a young, passionate chef to whom he can entrust Maya\u2019s recipes, ensuring his corner of San Francisco continues to feel like home."
