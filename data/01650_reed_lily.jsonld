Raised in Richmond by a Filipina mother who worked as a certified nursing assistant and a white father who was a union carpenter, Lily learned early about the precarious line between stability and crisis. When she was 15, her father suffered a debilitating back injury on the job. The ensuing battle with chronic pain, opioid addiction, and a confusing healthcare system became the defining text of her adolescence. She became her family\u2019s unofficial case manager, spending more time on the phone with insurance companies and clinics than on homework.\n\nShe briefly attended community college after high school but found the classroom abstract and disconnected from the urgent realities she knew. She dropped out, working a series of service jobs while feeling adrift, her purpose yet to crystallize. The turning point came when her father, finally getting clean, credited a compassionate community health worker for helping him navigate detox resources and social services. In that story, Lily saw her own chaotic experiences reframed as a potential strength.\n\nDrawn by a desire to serve a community facing similar struggles, Lily moved to San Francisco at 22. She started as a volunteer at a Tenderloin harm reduction center, where her innate empathy and firsthand knowledge of systemic barriers quickly made her indispensable. The organization hired her, sponsoring her through certifications that valued lived experience over a formal degree.\n\nNow 26, Lily lives and works within the same few blocks, her commute a short walk from her small, rent-controlled studio to the clinic. Her days are a blur of patient advocacy, connecting unhoused clients with shelter, distributing naloxone, and offering a non-judgmental ear. Her social life is woven into her work; her friends are fellow activists and neighbors she\u2019s come to know intimately. Lily doesn't dream of a high-rise apartment or a tech salary. Her aspiration is simpler and far more complex: to build a more resilient community, one person at a time, and to find a way to sustain her own spirit in the heart of the city\u2019s most demanding neighborhood."
