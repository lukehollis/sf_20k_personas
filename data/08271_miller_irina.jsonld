The daughter of an engineer and a schoolteacher, her childhood was defined by hushed conversations, the weight of state authority, and a deep, unspoken yearning for a world beyond the Iron Curtain. The collapse of the Soviet Union in her early twenties was less a political event and more a seismic rupture in her reality. Amid the chaos and dizzying possibility, she saw a path out.\n\n sponsored by a distant relative, Irina arrived in San Francisco in 1994 with a suitcase and a fierce determination to build a life on her own terms. The city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy was a jarring but welcome antidote to her past. She worked odd jobs while mastering English, her keen observational skills drawing her to the struggles of others navigating the bewildering American system. This empathy guided her to her calling. She enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work, driven to help those caught in the cracks of society, just as she once was.\n\nFor over two decades, Irina worked in the demanding environment of public hospitals, providing emotional triage for patients facing trauma, chronic illness, and end-of-life crises. The work was fulfilling but draining, leaving little room for her own life, which included a short-lived marriage and the raising of her now-adult son, Alex. The pandemic served as an unexpected turning point. Burnt out and seeking a sustainable pace, she transitioned to a private telehealth practice, closing her commute to zero miles.\n\nNow, at 54, Irina\u2019s life is centered in her Inner Richmond apartment, a space filled with books and the comforting aroma of black tea. Her days are a quiet rhythm of virtual sessions with clients, followed by long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, the cypress trees reminding her of a resilience she understands intimately. Her connection to the city is deep but solitary. Her hope is no longer about survival, but about synthesis. She dreams of finally writing down her own story, not as a patient\u2019s case file, but as a memoir\u2014a testament to the quiet, persistent work of remaking a self."
