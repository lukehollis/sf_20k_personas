The son of a civil engineer, he grew up in a landscape of meticulous grids and predictable commutes, internalizing a deep appreciation for systems and infrastructure. This foundation led him to a Master's in Urban Planning from UCLA, pulling him to California with a desire to shape the chaotic, organic growth of cities.\n\nHis early career was in the public sector, working for Los Angeles's transportation authority. He was good at it, a steady hand analyzing traffic flows and bus routes. But by the late 2000s, he felt the tectonic shift. The future of movement wasn't being designed in city hall, but in the server farms and open-plan offices of Silicon Valley. A burgeoning ride-share company, seeking to legitimize its disruptive model, recruited him for his public policy expertise. This was his critical turning point. He moved to San Francisco, trading public service for the volatile, high-stakes world of tech.\n\nNow, at 53, David is a manager who orchestrates the movement of millions from a quiet, book-lined office in his Noe Valley home. His 0.0-mile commute is a private irony he enjoys. His day starts with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, observing the messy, human reality of traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians he later attempts to optimize through algorithms. He lives with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Alex, in a restored Edwardian flat. Their life is an exercise in curated comfort\u2014weekends spent hiking in Marin or browsing the Ferry Building Farmer's Market.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of both love and professional responsibility. He sees the city as a complex organism he is tasked with helping, yet he is acutely aware that his industry is part of the problem. His ultimate aspiration is to bridge the gap between technological possibility and genuine livability, hoping to one day help design a system so efficient and equitable that it renders private car ownership in the city obsolete. From his window, he watches the fog roll over Twin Peaks, a planner forever trying to map the beautiful, unpredictable chaos below."
