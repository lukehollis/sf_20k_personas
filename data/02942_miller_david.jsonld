The son of a civil engineer, he grew up in a landscape of meticulous grids and predictable commutes, internalizing a deep appreciation for systems and infrastructure. This foundation led him to a Master's in Urban Planning from UCLA, pulling him to California with a desire to shape the chaotic, organic growth of cities.\n\nHis early career was in the public sector, working for Los Angeles's transportation authority. He was good at it, a steady hand analyzing traffic flows and bus routes. But by the late 2000s, he felt the tectonic shift. The future of movement wasn't being designed in city hall, but in the server farms and open-plan offices of Silicon Valley. A burgeoning ride-share company, seeking to legitimize its disruptive model, recruited him for his public policy expertise. This was his critical turning point. He moved to San Francisco, trading public service for the volatile, high-stakes world of tech.\n\nNow, at 53, David is a manager who orchestrates the movement of millions from a quiet, book-lined office in his Noe Valley home. His 0.0-mile commute is a private irony he enjoys. His day starts with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, observing the messy, human reality of traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians he later attempts to optimize through algorithms. He lives with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Alex, in a restored Edwardian flat. Their life is an exercise in curated comfort\u2014weekends spent hiking in Marin or browsing the Ferry Building Farmer's Market.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of both love and professional responsibility. He sees the city as a complex organism he is tasked with helping, yet he is acutely aware that his industry is part of the problem. His ultimate aspiration is to bridge the gap between technological possibility and genuine livability, hoping to one day help design a system so efficient and equitable that it renders private car ownership in the city obsolete. From his window, he watches the fog roll over Twin Peaks, a planner forever trying to map the beautiful, unpredictable chaos below."

The brash young founder on the other end spoke of disruption and a new urban fabric. David looked out his window at the predictable, crawling traffic on the 101, a system he knew intimately. The offer felt like a choice between the concrete certainty he was raised on and the beautiful, terrifying fog of San Francisco. It was the moment he decided to step off the grid he understood and try to map a new one. This happened in his late 30s.\n\n2.\nIt was a contentious community meeting in the Mission about a new parklet design. David, then new to the tech world, was there to observe traffic flow. Amid the shouting, a man named Alex quietly unrolled a sketch, speaking not of data but of how sunlight would hit a bench in the afternoon. David saw the city not as a system of nodes, but as a series of human moments. That man was the landscape architect who would become his partner. At 41, this was the moment SF shifted from being a problem to solve to a home to share.\n\n3.\nThe algorithm he helped build failed spectacularly during a Giants game. On his monitor, he watched the data visualization of gridlock bloom like a toxic flower around the ballpark. He felt a cold shame, not for the flawed code, but for the thousands of families stuck in cars, the frustrated fans, the angry drivers. The clean abstraction on his screen became a visceral public failure. It was the night, around age 45, his ambition shifted from simple efficiency to a deeper, more humane sense of civic responsibility.\n\n4.\nJust weeks after moving to the city, he took a solo walk through the Presidio. He expected to see the bridge but found only fog. The scent of eucalyptus and salt was overwhelming. The mournful, periodic groan of the foghorn felt like the city\u2019s pulse. He wasn\u2019t analyzing it or trying to optimize it; he was simply a small part of its sublime, damp chaos. At that moment, he fell in love with San Francisco not for its systems, but for its profound, unmappable atmosphere.\n\n5.\nLast week, on his morning walk for coffee, he watched a MUNI bus, one of his company's cars, a cyclist, and a scooter all converge at a messy intersection. A beautiful, inefficient ballet. He felt a familiar twinge\u2014the planner's urge to fix it, followed by a wave of deep affection for the very unpredictability he was paid to tame. He sipped his oat milk latte, a quiet participant in the chaos. At 53, this daily ritual is his peace treaty between the city he manages and the one he loves."
