Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents who preached the gospel of engineering degrees and stable corporate jobs, David was the family tinkerer. While his older sister pursued medicine, David spent his youth taking apart VCRs and building rudimentary computers from scavenged parts. He found solace not in textbooks, but in the logical flow of circuit boards and code.\n\nHis educational journey was a disappointment to his family. He briefly attended De Anza College for computer science but found the academic pace frustratingly slow compared to his self-directed learning online. He dropped out after a year, opting instead for a series of IT certifications\u2014A+, Network+, Cisco\u2014that felt far more practical. This became a turning point; he had chosen his own path. He started at a small company\u2019s help desk before realizing that the freedom of freelance work suited his independent nature.\n\nNow 41, David works as a freelance IT Support Specialist from his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a core feature of the life he's carefully constructed. His days have a comfortable rhythm: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee and a pastry, a few hours troubleshooting for his small business clients across the country via Slack and remote desktop, and an afternoon run through the foggy trails of Golden Gate Park.\n\nSocially, David is more of a listener than a talker. A long-term relationship ended amicably several years ago, and he has since settled into a comfortable solitude, punctuated by a weekly trivia night with a small group of friends and occasional visits with his family. He feels deeply connected to his neighborhood, valuing its unpretentious, family-owned shops over the sleek, transient nature of downtown.\n\nHis aspirations are as practical as his profession. David doesn't dream of launching a startup or becoming a millionaire. Instead, he hopes to save enough to one day buy a small condo, perhaps in the Sunset District. His ultimate dream is simply to continue this life of quiet autonomy, solving problems for people who need him, secure in the city that has always felt like his true home."
