The only child of pragmatic Chinese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery, Sarah grew up amidst the quiet expectation that she would pursue a stable, lucrative career like engineering or medicine. However, her life\u2019s trajectory was irrevocably altered in her late teens while navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system during her grandmother's battle with cancer. It wasn\u2019t the doctors, but a compassionate hospital social worker who truly guided her family through their grief and fear. This experience planted a seed of purpose.\n\nDefying her parents' wishes, Sarah pursued sociology at UC Berkeley and then earned a Master of Social Work (MSW). Her early career was a trial by fire in the demanding environment of a downtown San Francisco hospital, where she supported patients and families facing traumatic injuries and chronic illness. She was brilliant at her job, possessing a profound empathy that allowed her to hold space for others\u2019 pain. This dedication, however, took a toll on her marriage, which ended amicably in her late thirties, both partners acknowledging they had grown into different people.\n\nThe true turning point came with the pandemic. Forced into telehealth, Sarah found an unexpected sense of peace. She sold her condo and moved into a modern apartment in Hayes Valley, transforming a spare room into a serene home office. Now, her commute is zero. Her days are structured by virtual patient sessions, punctuated by walks to a local cafe for an oat milk latte and strolls through Patricia's Green. Her world has shrunk to a few vibrant blocks, but her connection to it has deepened immensely.\n\nAt 47, Sarah is rebuilding her life on her own terms. She finds solace in her close-knit circle of friends, many of whom are also in healing professions. Her aspirations are no longer about career advancement but about personal reclamation. She dreams of taking a pottery class, of finally learning to surf at Ocean Beach, and of finding a partnership built on quiet companionship rather than intense passion. Sarah Davis remains a healer, but she is finally learning to be the primary caregiver for herself."
