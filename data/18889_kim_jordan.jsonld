Raised in Oakland by her African American mother and Korean immigrant father, she spent her childhood absorbing the rhythms of their small grocery store. She witnessed their tireless work ethic and the precariousness of their dream, especially when the 2008 financial crisis nearly wiped them out. That period of fear became her catalyst; she vowed to build a life of unassailable security, not just for herself, but for them.\n\nWith this mission, she pursued a Business Administration degree at UCLA, graduating with honors. She was recruited by a major consulting firm, where her sharp analytical mind and quiet tenacity set her apart. She thrived in the high-pressure environment, climbing the ladder quickly. Five years ago, a senior role at a boutique strategy firm brought her across the bay to San Francisco. She settled in a modern Hayes Valley apartment, a world away from her Oakland upbringing but a perfect hub for her new life.\n\nHer days are a structured blur of data analysis, client presentations, and strategic planning. The 1.5-mile MUNI ride to her Financial District office is her only quiet moment, a time for podcasts or mental prep. Evenings are often spent decompressing with her small circle of close friends, usually over dinner at a new restaurant or a glass of wine at a local bar. Weekends are for recharging: hiking in the Headlands, browsing the Ferry Building Farmers Market, and maintaining a steadfast Sunday call with her parents.\n\nNow, at 34 and financially secure, Jordan feels a familiar restlessness. The corporate wins feel less significant than they once did. Her long-term dream is taking shape: to leave consulting and launch a venture capital fund that invests exclusively in minority and immigrant-owned small businesses. She envisions a future where she can offer the strategic guidance and capital her own parents never had, turning her hard-won success into a legacy of empowerment for others like them."
