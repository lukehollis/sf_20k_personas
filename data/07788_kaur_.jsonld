The daughter of Punjabi immigrants who prized engineering and medicine, Priya was expected to follow a similar high-achieving path. However, she watched her older brother struggle silently with a deep depression, his pain misunderstood and stigmatized within their family and community. While her parents pushed for academic solutions, Priya saw a need for emotional ones, a gap in care that ignited a quiet but fierce calling within her.\n\nDefying her family\u2019s expectations, she pursued a degree in psychology at UC Berkeley before earning her Master of Social Work from the University of Michigan. Her early career was a trial by fire, working in the emergency department of a major San Francisco hospital. There, she confronted raw, acute trauma daily, honing her skills in crisis intervention but facing immense burnout. This intense experience was a critical turning point; it solidified her expertise but also clarified her need for a more sustainable, personally connected way to practice.\n\nNow 31, Priya has crafted a life of intentional balance. Her 0.0-mile commute is to the comfortable armchair by the bay window of her Inner Richmond apartment, where she runs a private teletherapy practice. Her days are structured around virtual sessions with clients, helping them navigate anxiety, burnout, and life transitions. She specializes in culturally competent care, drawing on her own background to support clients for whom therapy is a new or challenging concept. Her physical separation from an office allows her the mental space to decompress, often with long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park or exploring the neighborhood\u2019s many dim sum restaurants with a small circle of trusted friends.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees it as a city of beautiful contradictions, full of progressive ideals and deep-seated social challenges. Her dream is to expand her practice into a collective of therapists focused on serving immigrant communities, creating accessible mental health resources that bridge cultural and generational divides. For Priya, her work isn't just a profession; it\u2019s the fulfillment of a promise she made to her younger self\u2014to build the understanding and compassionate spaces she once wished her own family had."
