Raised primarily by his *t\u016bt\u016b* (grandmother), his childhood was steeped in the rhythm of storytelling and the intricate art of lei making. While his parents worked multiple jobs in Honolulu\u2019s tourism industry, his grandmother instilled in him a deep appreciation for the *mo\u02bbolelo* (stories) and cultural practices that defined their heritage. He saw art not as a luxury, but as the lifeblood of his community.\n\nDrawn by the vibrant, rebellious arts scene of the Bay Area, Kalani moved to San Francisco for college, a jarring but exhilarating transition. He pursued a degree in Arts Administration, a practical choice fueled by a passion to build sustainable platforms for artists like those he grew up with. His early career was a grind, working his way up from intern to coordinator at various small galleries. A key turning point came during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s; while others fled the city, Kalani secured a crucial grant for a project showcasing Pacific Islander artists, cementing his reputation as a tenacious and mission-driven leader.\n\nNow, as the Director of Programs for a prominent arts non-profit, Kalani has found his purpose. He lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose proximity to the ocean and foggy mornings feels like a distant cousin to his island home. His 3.5-mile commute on the Muni bus is a cherished ritual, a time to listen to podcasts and watch the city wake up. He shares his life and a rented flat with his partner, David, a landscape architect. Their social life is a close-knit circle of friends from diverse backgrounds, often gathering for potlucks that feature Kalani\u2019s attempts at re-creating his grandmother\u2019s recipes.\n\nHis greatest aspiration is to create a lasting endowment for his organization, ensuring its work continues long after he\u2019s gone. More personally, he dreams of establishing a cultural exchange program, bringing young Native Hawaiian artists to San Francisco to share their voice. For Kalani, the city is no longer a foreign shore; it is the place where he honors his roots by helping new stories take flight."

His small, clumsy fingers struggled to string the plumeria, but his grandmother\u2019s hands were patient, guiding his. \u201cEvery lei tells a story, Kalani,\u201d she\u2019d murmured. It wasn\u2019t just a craft; it was a lesson in patience, intention, and love. That feeling\u2014of art being an act of care\u2014became the foundational stone of his entire career, the quiet rhythm beating beneath everything he would later build in a city so far from home.\n\n2. During his first lonely autumn as a college student, he walked into the SF Botanical Garden. He stood before the cloud forest section, the misty air clinging to ferns and mosses that were so alien, yet so familiar. In that moment, the overwhelming homesickness gave way to a startling sense of wonder. San Francisco wasn't a replacement for O\u02bbahu, but a different kind of wild, a different song. It was the first time he felt he wasn\u2019t just visiting; he was learning a new land\u2019s story.\n\n3. The day the grant approval arrived in the early 2000s, the city felt like it was holding its breath. Tech companies were folding, and friends were packing up. Kalani stared at the email on his cheap desktop, the words \"REQUEST APPROVED\" glowing. It was for his showcase of Pacific Islander artists. The relief was so sharp it felt like a physical blow. That grant wasn't just funding; it was validation. It taught him that in times of scarcity, fighting for your community\u2019s visibility is the most critical work of all.\n\n4. On their second anniversary, David came home with a small, potted \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba lehua plant, its delicate red blossoms a shock of color in their foggy Inner Richmond flat. Kalani was speechless. He knew how hard it was to find, how much care it would need in this climate. It was more than a gift; it was David acknowledging the piece of Kalani that would always be rooted in Hawai'i. He felt seen, completely. It was the moment a rented flat truly started to feel like a shared home.\n\n5. At a recent showcase, a young Tongan artist finished his performance piece about navigating identity. The audience was rapt. For a moment, Kalani saw not the gallery, but his grandmother\u2019s porch, hearing the cadence of old mo\u02bbolelo in this artist\u2019s modern voice. It was a profound, quiet joy\u2014the feeling of a circle completing. He wasn\u2019t just an administrator; he was a conduit, helping the stories of his ancestors find new shores and new light. The work was worth every struggle."
