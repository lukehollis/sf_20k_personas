Her family emigrated from St. Petersburg to Daly City when she was eight, trading the Neva River for the Pacific fog. Her father found work in construction, her mother as a cleaner, and they poured their hopes into Elena and her younger brother, Alexei. Those hopes were fractured when Alexei, at age six, was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder. Elena, fluent in English where her parents were not, became the family\u2019s navigator through the bewildering world of pediatric healthcare. She translated for doctors, comforted her brother during long hospital stays, and witnessed the immense, often invisible, strain on families like hers.\n\nThis experience was the catalyst for her entire career. She pursued a bachelor's degree at San Francisco State University before earning a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, specializing in children and healthcare. Her goal was singular: to be the person she and her family had so desperately needed. She landed her dream job as a school social worker at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, working with long-term pediatric patients to ensure their education and emotional well-being don\u2019t become casualties of their illness.\n\nNow 32, Elena\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a modest apartment in a university-owned building in the Inner Sunset, just steps from the hospital complex. Her days are a marathon of empathy, navigating family crises, advocating for students with medical staff, and celebrating small victories. Her social circle is small, consisting mostly of nurses and therapists who understand the emotional toll of the job.\n\nFor Elena, San Francisco is less about vibrant nightlife and more about quiet sanctuaries. She decompresses with long runs through Golden Gate Park, finding solace among the eucalyptus trees and in the calm of the Japanese Tea Garden. Her dream is to develop a better support program for the siblings of chronically ill children, a project born from her own childhood scars. While she sometimes yearns for a life less defined by the hospital on the hill, she knows she is exactly where she needs to be, a quiet, steady presence for children adrift in a storm."
