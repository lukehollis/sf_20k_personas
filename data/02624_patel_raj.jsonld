Born in Fremont to Gujarati immigrants who ran a bustling convenience store, Raj\u2019s childhood was filled with the scents of spices and the hum of fluorescent lights. While his parents preached the value of a traditional professional degree, Raj found his calling in the guts of discarded electronics. He spent his teens taking apart radios and building rudimentary computers, seeing a logic and beauty that formal schooling couldn't offer.\n\nForegoing college, Raj earned a series of IT certifications, his practical skills far outpacing his peers' theoretical knowledge. He moved to San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom. He and a friend poured their savings into a small startup, a hub for freelance web developers. For two years, they lived on instant noodles and pure adrenaline until the bubble burst, leaving Raj with a profound sense of humility and a mountain of debt. That failure was his true education; it taught him the value of stability. He took a corporate IT support job and never looked back.\n\nNow, at 46, Raj lives a life of careful routine in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Outer Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute from his bed to his desk-in-the-corner is a cherished perk. His days are a predictable rhythm of solving remote employee tech issues, punctuated by misty afternoon walks along Ocean Beach. His social life is small but meaningful: a bi-weekly board game night with friends from his early tech days and calls with his sister back in Fremont. He is amicably divorced, a relationship that ended not with a bang but a quiet acknowledgment that they wanted different things from life.\n\nRaj\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its frantic innovation and more about the quietude of its western edge. He loves the fog, the salty air, and the feeling of being at the continent\u2019s end. His dream isn't to launch another startup. Instead, his garage houses his true passion: restoring vintage 80s arcade cabinets. The smell of solder and old wood is his therapy. His ultimate aspiration is to one day save enough to quit his IT job and run a small, niche business repairing and selling these relics of a simpler digital age\u2014a future built not on venture capital, but on tangible, joyful nostalgia."
