Her parents championed stability and prescribed a future in medicine, but Anjali found more elegance in economic theory than in biology. She pursued an economics degree at NYU, deliberately choosing a path paved with numbers rather than people.\n\nHer early career on Wall Street in the 1990s was a trial by fire. As a young South Asian woman in a testosterone-fueled environment, she learned to be sharper, faster, and more emotionally detached than her peers. It was during her MBA at the University of Chicago that she met Michael Vance, an aspiring architect whose gentle demeanor and passion for form balanced her fierce ambition. They married, and she took his name, a subtle act of assimilation and partnership that felt like a fresh start.\n\nThey moved to San Francisco in 1998, drawn by the energy of the first dot-com boom. While Michael began designing the sleek, minimalist homes that would make his name, Eleanor joined a boutique investment firm, quickly ascending the ranks. The 2008 financial crisis was her crucible; she navigated the carnage with a preternatural calm, protecting her clients\u2019 assets and cementing her reputation as a formidable portfolio manager.\n\nThe most significant turning point, however, was not financial. Five years ago, Michael died suddenly from a heart attack. The Pacific Heights condo he designed for them, once a shared sanctuary of light and glass, became Eleanor\u2019s fortress. Her 0.0-mile commute is not a matter of convenience; it is a conscious withdrawal. Her world is now confined to the glowing terminals in her home office, her routine a metronome of discipline: pre-dawn market analysis, virtual meetings, a solitary hour on her Peloton, and evenings spent with financial reports under the warm glow of an Artemide lamp.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is now primarily visual\u2014the fog rolling over the Presidio, the distant glimmer of the Bay Bridge. At 54, the thrill of the market has begun to fade. Eleanor dreams of a different kind of legacy, one that honors Michael. She aspires to create a foundation that funds young, innovative architects, turning the cold, hard capital she has masterfully accumulated into something tangible, beautiful, and enduring in the city she watches over from her window."
