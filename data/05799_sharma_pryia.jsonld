It\u2019s the same scent that fills the neighborhood market she manages on the ground floor, a business her parents, immigrants from Mumbai, poured their life savings into after arriving in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond in the late 1980s. Growing up, Priya was the dutiful daughter, her childhood spent stocking shelves and translating for customers, all while dreaming of a world beyond the shop\u2019s front door.\n\nThat world briefly opened when she enrolled at San Francisco State University, tentatively pursuing a degree in literature. For two years, she was intoxicated by poetry and critical theory, feeling her own identity finally taking shape. But in her junior year, her father suffered a major heart attack, leaving her mother unable to run the store alone. Priya dropped out, telling herself it was temporary. The temporary sacrifice slowly became her permanent reality.\n\nNow, at 42, Priya is the undisputed heart of the market. After her parents retired, she modernized the store, adding artisanal cheeses, local wines, and organic produce, ensuring its survival against encroaching chains. Her commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs. Her days are a comforting rhythm of greeting regulars by name, curating inventory, and managing the two part-time employees she treats like family. Her social life is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood; she knows who just had a baby, whose cat is missing, and who needs to talk over a cup of tea. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of her unwavering commitment to the store.\n\nWhile she finds deep satisfaction in her work, a quiet longing for the life she almost had persists. Late at night, after locking up, she sits in her small living room overlooking Clement Street and writes. Not novels or poems, but small, sharp vignettes of the people she sees every day. Her dream is no longer to escape, but to one day anonymously publish a collection of these stories\u2014a quiet tribute to the vibrant, complicated, and beautiful world that exists right outside her door."
