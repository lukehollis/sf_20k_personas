The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Sunset District. His parents, who ran a small laundromat, instilled in him the values of diligence and security. They hoped he would become an engineer or a doctor\u2014a stable profession far removed from the anxieties they faced. Aaron, however, was more interested in the quiet struggles of their neighbors, many of whom were priced out of the city during the first dot-com boom. This early exposure to displacement planted a seed of civic responsibility that would define his future.\n\nRebelling gently against his parents' wishes, Aaron pursued political science at UCLA before returning to the Bay Area for a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley. His graduate thesis, a data-driven analysis of eviction-prevention programs, caught the attention of a city supervisor. This led to an entry-level position at City Hall, where his sharp intellect and deep-seated empathy allowed him to rise quickly. Now a Senior Policy Analyst, he spends his days poring over housing data and drafting legislation aimed at protecting the vulnerable communities he grew up alongside.\n\nHis life is deeply woven into the city's fabric. Aaron lives with his long-term partner, Maya, a legal aid attorney, in a bright apartment in the Mission District. His 3.8-mile commute on the J-Church line is a daily immersion in the city he serves, taking him past murals, community gardens, and the very housing projects he analyzes. Evenings are often spent with a close-knit group of friends\u2014fellow public servants, artists, and teachers\u2014debating city politics over beers at a local brewery.\n\nAaron\u2019s dream isn't one of wealth or power, but of tangible impact. He aspires to shepherd a landmark piece of affordable housing legislation from a spreadsheet into a reality, creating permanent stability for thousands. He carries the weight of his parents' ambitions and the memory of his childhood neighborhood, driven by a quiet, fierce determination to ensure that the San Francisco that raised him remains a city for everyone."

She was holding a cardboard box, and a chipped ceramic cat, a gift he\u2019d seen on her mantel, peeked out. She was moving to Sacramento; the rent had doubled. Aaron, only ten, felt a hot, confusing anger. It wasn't just losing a neighbor; it was the first time he understood his city could discard people. That injustice became the foundation of his career.\n\n2.\nHis father visited him once at Berkeley, the scent of the family business still faint on his jacket. He silently studied Aaron\u2019s thesis charts\u2014dense maps of eviction filings. He didn't understand the statistics, but he recognized the street names. \u201cThe Lius lived there,\u201d his father had said, pointing to a red cluster in the Richmond. In that moment, the years of quiet disappointment in Aaron\u2019s career choice softened into something like respect. It was a bridge built between their worlds.\n\n3.\nOne rainy Tuesday, the J-Church crawled past a building on Dolores Street. He knew its parcel number by heart; he\u2019d spent months helping draft the policy that preserved its affordable units. He glanced up and saw a child\u2019s colorful drawing of a sun taped to a third-floor window. The spreadsheet cells and legal clauses dissolved into that simple, bright image. It was the first time he truly felt the tangible weight of his work\u2014not as a burden, but as an anchor.\n\n4.\nIt was nearly midnight in their Mission apartment. Aaron was buried in housing density maps while Maya, beside him, drafted a brief for a tenant facing an Ellis Act eviction. The only sounds were their keyboards clicking and the distant city hum. He looked at her, fighting the same battle from a different trench, and felt a love that was inseparable from their shared, stubborn hope. Their partnership wasn't just romantic; it was a quiet, relentless pact with the city.\n\n5.\nThe community meeting was brutal. He was a symbol of \"City Hall,\" a target for everyone\u2019s frustration. Exhausted, he was packing up when an elderly woman approached. She didn't shout; she just said, \u201cDon\u2019t give up on us.\u201d Her wrinkled hand briefly touched his arm, a small gesture that cut through all the noise. It was a stark reminder of who he was fighting for, a jolt of quiet purpose that would get him through the next spreadsheet and the next political fight."
