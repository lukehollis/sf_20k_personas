Born in Fremont to an Indian immigrant father, a software engineer, and a white mother from Ohio, a dental hygienist, Cody grew up with a name that prompted questions his fair complexion didn't answer. He navigated this by leaning into a laid-back, All-American persona, identifying as white and keeping his Indian heritage at an arm's length. School was never his arena; he was charismatic and social but disinterested in academics, barely clearing the bar for his high school diploma.\n\nThe post-graduation years were a drift of retail jobs and a growing sense of aimlessness. The turning point came during a shift at a coffee shop when he overheard a real estate agent exude confidence and competence while closing a deal on the phone. For the first time, Cody saw a path that valued hustle and social intelligence over a college degree. At 20, he threw himself into studying for his real estate license, a level of focus he\u2019d never applied before.\n\nStarting as an assistant at a big downtown brokerage, he absorbed everything. He ran errands, managed paperwork, and learned the art of the deal through osmosis. His natural charm and relentless work ethic quickly set him apart. He leveraged his social media savvy to build a personal brand, attracting first-time homebuyers his own age.\n\nNow 25, Cody lives in a small apartment in the Outer Sunset, the persistent fog a stark contrast to the sleek high-rises he shows clients. His 9.5-mile commute is a daily ritual on his trusty scooter, zipping past traffic as he heads toward the city\u2019s wealthier core. His $85,000 income feels both like a massive achievement and just enough to get by. His life is a whirlwind of showings, client calls, and networking events, leaving little time for serious relationships. He loves San Francisco for its architectural tapestry and the thrill of the market. His ultimate dream isn\u2019t just to sell the city, but to own a piece of it\u2014a small condo of his own. He aspires to one day open a boutique agency, a testament to the idea that drive, not degrees, defines success in the city by the bay."

The scent of cardamom and fried dough was thick, but he felt a different kind of heat from the other kids\u2019 stares. His last name was Sharma, but he looked like the kids from his baseball team. He felt like an imposter in his own family, a feeling that made him shrink away from that part of himself for more than a decade. It was the first time he realized it was easier to just be Cody.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he was refolding a mountain of rejected t-shirts at 10 PM. The fluorescent lights of the retail store hummed, and he caught his reflection in a security mirror\u2014a ghost in a red polo shirt. It wasn't just boredom; it was a profound sense of invisibility, a deep fear that this was it. That night, the aimlessness wasn't a phase anymore; it was a weight pressing down on him, creating a desperate hunger for a way out, for a way to be seen.\n\n3.\nHe was 22, standing outside a small NoPa studio. He handed the keys to a young couple, musicians who had saved for years. The look on their faces\u2014a mix of terror and utter joy\u2014hit him harder than the commission check ever could. He wasn't just closing a deal; he was handing them a life, a physical piece of San Francisco. In that moment, he felt a profound sense of purpose. He wasn't just a hustler; he was a gatekeeper to people's dreams.\n\n4.\nThe first time he paid his own rent for the Outer Sunset apartment, he celebrated with cheap pizza on the floor. It was a victory, but a quiet one. Later that night, the fog rolled in so thick he couldn\u2019t see the street. It hit him then, at 23, the immense pressure of the city. His $85,000 salary, a fortune back in Fremont, felt like just enough to keep his head above the fog. It solidified a stark realism that tempered his ambition with an all-consuming drive.\n\n5.\nJust last week, zipping down Lincoln Way on his scooter at dusk. The cold fog of the Sunset bit at his cheeks, a world away from the gleaming Pacific Heights condo he\u2019d shown an hour before. He passed rows of starter homes, their windows warm and inviting. A familiar ache settled in his chest\u2014the hunger of the outsider looking in. This daily ride isn't just a commute; it\u2019s a 9.5-mile promise to himself that one day, he won't just be selling the keys, he'll be turning his own."
