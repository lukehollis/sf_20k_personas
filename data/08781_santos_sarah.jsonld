Born in Daly City to a Goan father and a Filipina mother, she grew up in a home filled with the aromas of curry and adobo, and the unspoken pact that she would pursue a stable, lucrative career. Her parents, who had sacrificed much for a foothold in America, envisioned a doctor or an engineer, not the daydreaming girl who filled notebooks with sketches instead of equations.\n\nHer rebellion was subtle but firm. She enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, immersing herself in a world that felt more authentic than the suburban life she\u2019d known. It was during her MFA in Arts Administration that she found her true calling. While she loved creating, she discovered a deeper satisfaction in championing the work of others\u2014in writing the grants, curating the shows, and building the infrastructure that allowed art to exist. This pivot from creator to curator was the defining moment of her professional life.\n\nAfter a brief, early marriage to a fellow artist ended amicably, Sarah dedicated herself fully to her work. For the past fifteen years, she has been the director\u2014and sole full-time employee\u2014of the \"Vanguard Project,\" a small non-profit supporting emerging Bay Area artists. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her integrated lifestyle; she runs the entire operation from her Dogpatch live/work loft, a converted warehouse space where grant proposals share a table with her morning tea.\n\nNow at 49, Sarah\u2019s days are a blend of focused solitude and community engagement. Mornings are for emails and strategic planning, afternoons for virtual studio visits, and evenings are often spent at gallery openings or hosting intimate dinners for her tight-knit circle of artists and activists. Her social life is her professional life, and she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nHer deepest aspiration is to secure a permanent, physical space for Vanguard, an anchor against the tides of gentrification that threaten to wash away the city's creative soul. Sarah Santos isn't looking for wealth or fame; she dreams of legacy, of ensuring that the vibrant, struggling, and brilliant heart of San Francisco\u2019s art scene continues to beat long after she\u2019s gone."
