Born in Tehran in 1970 to a professor of literature and a celebrated poet, his childhood was steeped in words, art, and intellectual debate. This idyllic world was shattered by the 1979 Iranian Revolution. At nine years old, Kian and his family fled with little more than their documents and the stories they held in their heads, eventually settling in the academically-rich environment of Berkeley.\n\nThe abrupt erasure of his family\u2019s history in Iran instilled in him a profound mission. He found solace in American libraries\u2014quiet, orderly sanctuaries that held the world\u2019s knowledge. After earning a history degree from UC Berkeley, he pursued a Master of Library and Information Science at UCLA, specializing in archival studies. His career began in academic libraries, but he quickly found his calling at the forefront of the digital shift. He wasn't just saving things; he was ensuring their future accessibility.\n\nNow, as the Director of Digital Archives for a major San Francisco information consortium, Kian manages the city's new memory bank. His work is a quiet rebellion against the chaos of his youth. His key turning point was meeting his husband, Marcus, an architect, two decades ago. They share a deep appreciation for structure, history, and beauty.\n\nTheir Mission District apartment, filled with books and contemporary art, is a quiet haven. Kian\u2019s daily routine is predictable and comforting: a morning ride on the J-Church MUNI, a day spent leading his team in digitizing historical records, and an evening of cooking complex Persian stews with Marcus. San Francisco, for Kian, is a city that respects its layered past while relentlessly building the future\u2014a dichotomy he embodies. His dream is to eventually create a grant-funded digital archive dedicated to preserving the personal histories of the Iranian diaspora, ensuring that no more stories are ever completely lost."

The night before they fled, his mother gathered him close, not with a book, but with a story from memory\u2014a tale of Rostam from the Shahnameh. \"Keep this inside you,\" she whispered, her voice a fragile anchor. \"It is ours now. No one can take it.\" In that moment, Kian understood. A story, held in the mind, was the one possession that could never be confiscated. It was his first, and most important, archive.\n\n2.\nBerkeley, 1980. The world was a loud, confusing kaleidoscope of English. His father led him into the hushed sanctuary of the public library. The smell of aging paper and binding glue felt ancient and safe. He ran his hand along the orderly spines, a stark contrast to the chaos outside and within him. It was there, amidst the quiet promise of preserved knowledge, that he felt the first stirrings of peace. He wasn't lost; he was simply in a different section of the catalog.\n\n3.\nTheir first date. Kian and Marcus stood before the de Young Museum as the afternoon sun filtered through its perforated copper skin. Marcus, an architect, spoke of how the building was designed to oxidize and change, to record the passage of time on its very surface. Kian felt a profound click of recognition. This man didn't just see a building; he saw a living document, a structure that honored history by evolving. He saw the world the way Kian did.\n\n4.\nEarly in his career, he held a 19th-century daguerreotype\u2014a San Francisco family, their faces faded and ghostly behind the fragile glass. After his team's work, he stared at the screen. The digital image was luminous, the mother\u2019s gaze clear, a child\u2019s shoelace untied. He felt a jolt of pure victory. He hadn't just preserved an object; he had rescued these people from the erosion of time, making their moment permanent and clear. It was a tangible act of defiance against erasure.\n\n5.\nThe rich, earthy scent of *ghormeh sabzi* filled their Mission apartment, an aroma that instantly transported him back three decades and thousands of miles. He watched Marcus carefully chop parsley, his focus intense, learning the recipe Kian\u2019s mother had passed down. It was more than just cooking a meal. It was the gentle weaving of his fragmented past into the sturdy fabric of his present, creating a new memory that was wholly, and safely, their own."
