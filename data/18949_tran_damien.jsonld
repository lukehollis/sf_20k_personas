Born in Oakland and adopted as an infant by a loving Vietnamese-American couple, Damien grew up in a world of cultural fusion. His home was filled with the aroma of pho and the sounds of both Motown and traditional Vietnamese folk music. His parents, who had fled their homeland and built a new life running a successful grocery store, instilled in him a profound appreciation for resilience and storytelling. As a Black child in a largely Asian household, Damien became a natural observer, fascinated by the intersection of identities and the stories that often go unheard.\n\nThis fascination didn't translate well to the rigid structure of a classroom. After a few semesters at a local community college, Damien felt a stronger pull from the burgeoning world of online media. He dropped out, not from a lack of ambition, but from an abundance of it. He taught himself video editing, audio engineering, and graphic design, pouring his energy into creating small documentary shorts about Bay Area subcultures. This self-made portfolio became his real degree.\n\nToday, Damien is a freelance digital content producer working from his Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute affords him the quiet focus needed for his primary passion project: a popular history podcast called \"Fog & Footnotes,\" which unearths the forgotten stories of San Francisco's diverse communities. This work is his connection to the city, allowing him to explore its hidden layers from his own home office. To pay the bills, he creates sleek, informative training videos for tech companies.\n\nHis life is a quiet rhythm of creative work and personal connection. Mornings are for scripting and recording, afternoons for editing. Evenings are often spent with his partner, Maya, an illustrator, trying new recipes or taking long walks through the Panhandle. His core social circle is small but deep, consisting of friends from his Oakland youth. Damien\u2019s dream is to make \"Fog & Footnotes\" his full-time occupation, perhaps expanding it into a visual series. He aspires to a life where his creativity fully sustains him, honoring his parents\u2019 legacy of building something meaningful from scratch."
