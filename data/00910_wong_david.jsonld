Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset, David is the only child of hardworking immigrant parents who poured their life savings into a small neighborhood laundromat. Their dream for him was simple and practical: a college degree, a stable career, and a life easier than their own.\n\nDavid, however, felt adrift in the structured world of academia. After a year of listless attendance at City College, the pressure and his own lack of direction became overwhelming. He dropped out, a decision that created a quiet but persistent rift with his parents, who saw it as a failure to capitalize on their sacrifice. He spent the next few years bouncing between gig economy jobs\u2014food delivery, stocking shelves\u2014until landing his current role as a remote Loan Processor Assistant. The job is a concession to his parents' desire for stability; it's respectable, it pays the bills, but it exists entirely within the four walls of his small bedroom in a shared Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHis real life begins after he logs off. The turning point came a year ago when he found his late grandfather\u2019s camera in a box. Learning to shoot, develop, and print photos became his obsession. It gave him a reason to leave his apartment and a new way to see the city he\u2019d always known. His daily routine is now built around this passion. Mornings are for processing mortgage paperwork; afternoons and evenings are for roaming the city. He captures the unseen San Francisco: the ghost-like silhouettes of cypress trees in Golden Gate Park, the weary faces on the N-Judah line, the vibrant, fleeting murals in Clarion Alley.\n\nHis social circle is small, limited to a couple of high school friends and the obligatory weekly family dinners filled with love and unspoken disappointment. David dreams of turning his photography into something more than a hobby, perhaps a small gallery show or a published zine. For now, his clerical job funds his art. It provides the financial bedrock for a life spent chasing light and shadow, trying to frame a future for himself that feels authentic, one photograph at a time."
