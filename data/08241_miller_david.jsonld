            "value": "David Miller was born Devan Mistry in Fremont, the only child of Gujarati immigrants who arrived in the Bay Area during the late 1970s. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a bank teller, prioritized stability and assimilation. They named him David, hoping to smooth his path in a country that was not yet theirs. His childhood was a quiet negotiation between two worlds: the fragrant, spice-filled home where his parents\u2019 dreams were pinned on his success, and the suburban American landscape of school and strip malls.\n\nPressured toward medicine, David excelled at UC Berkeley as a pre-med student. However, during a hospital volunteer stint, he found himself drawn not to the patients, but to the intricate, often chaotic systems that governed their care. This was his first major rebellion; he broke the news to his disappointed parents that he wouldn\u2019t be a doctor. Instead, he pursued a Master of Health Administration, finding his calling in optimizing the very systems that had fascinated him.\n\nHe landed a coveted position at a major San Francisco hospital network, methodically climbing the ladder. His career was his anchor, especially after a long-term relationship dissolved in his late thirties, leaving him feeling adrift. The COVID-19 pandemic was a brutal, defining crucible. As an administrator, David worked relentlessly from his Hayes Valley condo, managing logistics for overwhelmed departments. The crisis solidified his value but left him with a deep sense of burnout and a new, permanent remote-work status.\n\nNow, at 43, his life is a study in controlled routine. His zero-mile commute means his world is often confined to his apartment, with its clean lines and view of Patricia's Green. His days are a sequence of Zoom calls and data analysis, broken up by walks to a local cafe for an oat milk latte or a run through the Panhandle. He remains close to his parents, but his social circle is small and tight-knit. He loves San Francisco for its vibrant energy, which he mostly observes from a slight distance. His secret dream is to one day leave the impersonal world of healthcare bureaucracy and open a small, independent bookstore\u2014a quiet place of tangible stories, a stark contrast to his life of digital reports and systemic abstraction."
