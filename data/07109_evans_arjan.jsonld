The son of a pragmatic software engineer from Pune, India, and a compassionate nurse from rural Oregon, Arjan grew up navigating the space between two distinct cultures. He was a quiet, observant child who found solace not on the playground, but in books. In the diverse, working-class classrooms of his youth, he often felt like an outsider\u2014too American for his Indian cousins, too Indian for some of his classmates. This feeling of being in-between would become the quiet engine of his ambition.\n\nHe attended UC Davis, initially pressured by his father to pursue a practical degree. He started in communications, but his heart was in the stories he\u2019d loved as a child. He switched his major to English Literature, a decision that caused mild friction at home but felt like a personal liberation. The turning point came during his junior year while volunteering as a tutor. He was paired with a surly seventh-grader who was failing English. Over several months, Arjan didn't just teach grammar; he connected with the boy over graphic novels and sci-fi, finding the key that unlocked his student\u2019s confidence. In that small victory, Arjan saw his future.\n\nAfter earning his teaching credential, he landed a coveted position as a 7th-grade English teacher at a prestigious private school in San Francisco's Presidio Heights. The job came with a critical perk: a small apartment in the faculty housing on campus, explaining his zero-mile commute. Now, his daily life is a contained loop. He wakes to the school bell, walks across a pristine quad to his classroom, and spends his days trying to make literature feel vital to twelve-year-olds. His social life is an insular bubble of fellow young teachers, sharing cheap wine and grading papers in their apartments.\n\nArjan feels a strange disconnect. He lives in one of the city's wealthiest enclaves but can barely afford a night out in the Mission, where he sometimes meets old college friends to feel connected to a grittier, more authentic San Francisco. His dream isn't fame or fortune, but stability. He hopes to one day save enough to live in a neighborhood like the Richmond or the Sunset, places whose foggy familiarity reminds him of home. More than anything, he wants to be the teacher he never had\u2014the one who sees the quiet kid in the back row and ensures they feel they belong."
