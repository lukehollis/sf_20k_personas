The only son of Lebanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store in Daly City, he grew up surrounded by the scent of spices and the constant hum of the cash register. He watched his parents work tirelessly, their resilience a powerful lesson in the value of every dollar earned. Determined to build a life of financial security they never had, he pursued a degree in Finance at San Francisco State University, eschewing more abstract studies for a practical path.\n\nHis timing was impeccable. Graduating in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis gave him a sober, risk-averse perspective perfectly suited for commercial real estate analysis. He started as a junior analyst, quickly earning a reputation for his meticulous spreadsheets and uncanny ability to spot underlying risks in a deal. His career became his central focus, and the steady climb to Senior Analyst at a prestigious firm in the Financial District felt like the fulfillment of his promise to his parents.\n\nA key turning point occurred two years ago. Arman was the lead analyst on a deal that would replace a block of older, mixed-use buildings with a sleek new office tower. He recognized one of the businesses being displaced: a family-run bakery whose owners reminded him of his own parents. While he felt professional pride in the successful deal, a quiet sense of loss lingered. For the first time, he saw the human ledger behind the financial one.\n\nToday, Arman\u2019s life is one of structured routine. He lives in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a short N-Judah Muni ride from his office. His days are long, filled with market data and investment models. Evenings are often spent at the gym or having a quiet dinner with a small, close-knit group of friends from college. He appreciates San Francisco for its dynamic economy and world-class food scene, seeing the city as a complex, fascinating asset to be understood.\n\nHis dream is evolving. While he still aims for a Vice President title, he now aspires to one day launch his own boutique investment fund\u2014one that focuses on sustainable, community-centric development projects. He hopes to find a way to honor his parents' legacy not just by succeeding, but by building something that adds value beyond the bottom line."

The surprising weight of the coins in his small hands felt sacred, the precise metallic clink a holy sound. Each coin was a customer, a long hour, a worry smoothed over. He didn\u2019t just see money; he felt the physical weight of his family\u2019s survival. That night, he vowed he would one day build something so heavy with security that his parents would never feel that worry again.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the cold dread sitting in his SF State dorm room in 2008, watching news of the financial collapse. While his classmates debated abstract economic theories, Arman felt a clarifying chill. The world wasn\u2019t a textbook; it was a fragile system where life savings could vanish. He pushed aside his elective readers and focused on his finance homework. He wouldn't just understand the system; he would master its unforgiving rules to protect the future he promised himself and his parents. This forged his meticulous, risk-averse approach to his entire career.\n\n3.\nTwo years ago, he was reviewing the final tenant displacement list for the Mid-Market tower deal. His finger traced down the column until it stopped: \"Helena\u2019s Pastries.\" He pictured the elderly couple behind the counter, their flour-dusted aprons smelling of cardamom, like his Teta's kitchen. The successful deal suddenly felt hollow, the profit margin meaningless against this quiet erasure. His spreadsheet was perfect, but for the first time, it felt incomplete, missing the most incalculable variable: the human cost.\n\n4.\nRiding the N-Judah home to Hayes Valley last week, he watched the city slide past. He used to see only cap rates and development potential. Now, he saw the light flick on in a third-floor window and wondered who lived there. He automatically calculated the value of the building, but the equation felt different. He was no longer just analyzing an asset; he was trying to understand a home, a neighborhood, a living system his work directly altered. The city was no longer just a fascinating balance sheet.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, over dinner in Daly City, his mother mentioned that the old neighborhood bakery was gone, replaced by a sleek condo building. Arman felt a familiar pang of guilt, but this time it sharpened into purpose. He looked at his father\u2019s hands, still strong from a lifetime of work, and the idea for his own fund solidified. It wouldn't just be for profit. It would be for building things that allow for legacies like his parents'\u2014and bakeries like Helena's\u2014to endure."
