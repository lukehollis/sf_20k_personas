Raised in Chula Vista by her Mexican-American mother, a dedicated nurse, and her Anglo father, a community college professor, Sarah\u2019s world was a blend of cultures. She spent weekends navigating complex bus routes with her abuela, whose limited mobility made the city feel vast and disconnected. These early experiences planted a seed: a conviction that access and movement were forms of social justice.\n\nThis conviction fueled her educational journey. After earning a B.A. at UCLA, she moved north to UC Berkeley, drawn to its prestigious Master of City Planning program. The Bay Area, with its legendary transit challenges and progressive ideals, felt like the ultimate puzzle. Upon graduating, she secured a coveted position as a Transportation Planner for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), a role that felt like the culmination of her life's purpose.\n\nNow 31, Sarah lives a life of professional irony. Her listed commute is 0.0 miles, as she works primarily from her bright, plant-filled apartment in the Mission District. While she analyzes traffic flow models and drafts proposals for new bike lanes from her standing desk, she is acutely aware of her detachment from the daily grind she seeks to improve. To compensate, she forces herself out into her living laboratory. Her evenings are spent not in a car, but intentionally riding the J-Church to Dolores Park, biking the \u2018Wiggle\u2019 to meet friends from her grad school cohort, or simply walking the Mission, observing how people navigate the streets she\u2019s trying to make safer and more efficient.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow policy wonks and urbanists who share her passion for civic life. Though currently single after a recently ended long-term relationship, her focus remains on her work and her city. Sarah\u2019s dream is to one day stand at a ribbon-cutting for a major transit project she helped shepherd from concept to reality\u2014a truly equitable bus rapid transit line, perhaps. More than anything, she hopes to build a life in the city she serves, a city whose complex, frustrating, and beautiful systems she is dedicating her career to improving, one bus route at a time."

The San Diego bus hissed to a stop, and she watched her grandmother\u2019s jaw tighten before tackling the steep entry steps. It was a climb that left her breathless. Sarah felt a hot surge of anger at the bus, the curb, the world that made movement an ordeal. It wasn\u2019t a thought, but a feeling: a deep, seated conviction that a city should never be a barrier to the people you love. This moment planted the seed of her life\u2019s work.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIn a late-night study session at UC Berkeley, Sarah stared at a map glowing on her screen. She\u2019d overlaid historic redlining data with current bus route frequencies in Oakland. The patterns of neglect were stark, a mathematical confirmation of stories her mother told. A cold, clarifying awe washed over her. It wasn\u2019t just about inefficient systems; it was about injustice encoded in concrete and asphalt. In that quiet library, her passion gained a sharp, analytical edge, transforming her empathy into a directed, data-driven mission.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHer first community meeting for SFMTA was a disaster. Presenting a plan for a new protected bike lane on Folsom, she was met not with applause, but with rage from a laundromat owner terrified of losing delivery access. His fear was more potent than any of her traffic models. She drove home that night feeling humbled and naive. It was a harsh lesson that cities aren't just systems to be optimized; they are homes, full of people whose fears and livelihoods are tangled in every curb.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe week after her long-term boyfriend moved out, the silence in her apartment was deafening. She forced herself onto the J-Church, riding aimlessly towards the ocean. As the streetcar rumbled past Dolores Park, she watched couples spread out on blankets, feeling a profound loneliness. Yet, the familiar motion, the rhythmic sway of the train car, was a comfort. The city\u2019s pulse was a steady, indifferent companion, a reminder that while her personal world had fractured, the larger system she was a part of kept moving forward.\n\n***\n\n5.\nStanding on a rainy Mission corner, she watched a mother struggle to fold a stroller while keeping her toddler from the curb as a crowded bus approached. Sarah saw it all: the inadequate shelter, the high bus step, the lack of space. It was a system failure in miniature, a human data point her spreadsheets could never capture. A jolt of purpose cut through her analytic detachment. These were the moments she worked for. She pulled out her phone, not to text, but to make a note."
