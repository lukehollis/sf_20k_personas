Raised in the orderly suburbs of Walnut Creek by a pragmatic engineer father and a reserved librarian mother, David was the family\u2019s gentle anomaly. While they valued certainty and structure, he was drawn to the evocative power of stories, losing himself in novels and poetry. This led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in English Literature at San Francisco State University, a world away from his parents' sensibilities.\n\nUpon graduating in the early 90s, David bowed to familial pressure and took a \"sensible\" job in technical writing for a software company. For over a decade, he translated complex code into user manuals, his creativity confined to finding clearer ways to write \"click here.\" The work was stable, but it left him feeling creatively hollow. The turning point came with his father's sudden passing. Staring at a life of unfulfilled potential, David quit his job within the year, cashed in his modest 401k, and took a significant pay cut to work part-time at a small community arts center in the Mission.\n\nHe started by simply answering phones and sweeping floors, but his quiet competence and genuine passion were undeniable. He began suggesting program ideas\u2014a poetry workshop, a life drawing class for beginners, a series on printmaking. Within a few years, he was promoted to Adult Program Coordinator.\n\nNow, at 53, David\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. He lives in a small apartment directly above the arts center, his commute a single flight of stairs. His days are a comfortable rhythm of coffee at a local cafe, scheduling instructors, ordering supplies, and connecting with the neighborhood artists who use the studio space. His social life blooms from his work; he\u2019s a beloved, steady presence, the facilitator who makes art accessible to everyone from retired accountants to young baristas. His dream isn't for personal fame, but to secure a lasting endowment for the center, ensuring this small bastion of creativity thrives long after he\u2019s gone, a permanent fixture in the ever-changing city he truly calls home."

His father wanted him reading about bridges, but David had secretly found Dylan Thomas. Tracing the verses, he felt a secret pulse against the library\u2019s hush. It wasn\u2019t defiance, but a quiet, thrilling discovery that some things weren't meant to be explained, only felt. That afternoon solidified a private world built from words, his first true act of self-definition against the backdrop of suburban order.\n\n2.\nIt was 1992, at a cramped cafe in the Haight. A fellow SF State student read a poem that felt raw and electric, the air thick with fog and cheap coffee. The applause wasn't polite; it was visceral. For the first time, the art he loved wasn\u2019t just in a book\u2014it was alive, breathing in the same room. He knew then that San Francisco wasn't just a university town for him. It was a promise that a life of passion was possible, cementing the city as his spiritual home.\n\n3.\nOn his 38th birthday, he spent an entire afternoon rewriting a single sentence in a user manual to make it more \"intuitive.\" His reflection was a pale ghost in the dark monitor. He realized he was using his love for language to drain it of all meaning, translating human ingenuity into sterile commands. The hollowness was immense; a feeling not of sadness, but of complete absence. It was the moment he knew he was becoming a schematic of a person, not a story.\n\n4.\nAfter quitting his job, his first task at the center wasn\u2019t creative; it was sweeping the studio floor. The scent of turpentine and clay dust filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the recycled air of his old office. With each push of the broom, he felt a decade of corporate numbness sloughing off. He wasn't a coordinator or a writer; he was just a man with a broom, making space for art. This simple, physical act felt more profound and meaningful than any bonus he\u2019d ever received.\n\n5.\nJust last year, during a beginner's printmaking class, he watched a retired accountant, a man who'd only ever worked with numbers, pull his first print. The man held it up, ink staining his fingertips, a look of pure, unadulterated wonder on his face. David caught the eye of the young barista teaching the class and they shared a quiet, knowing smile. In that moment, he felt no desire for his own name to be famous. This was his masterpiece: creating the room where that flicker of wonder could ignite."
