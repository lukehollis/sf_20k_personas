Raised in the intellectual cocoon of Evanston, Illinois, by a history professor father and a high school principal mother, she learned the value of a well-executed plan early on. Her childhood was one of academic decathlons and structured goals, which led her to Northwestern University and a high-pressure management consulting job in Chicago right after graduation. For five years, she excelled, but felt a growing disconnect; she was analyzing businesses, not building them.\n\nThe pivotal decision to pursue her MBA at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business was what brought her west. The Bay Area\u2019s intoxicating mix of ambition and innovation felt like coming home. Post-graduation, she dove headfirst into the tech world, finding her niche in product management. Her calm authority and strategic mind allowed for a steady ascent, culminating in her current role as a Director at a major SoMa tech firm.\n\nHer professional success, however, came at a personal cost. A long-term relationship crumbled under the weight of her 70-hour workweeks around her 38th birthday, a turning point that forced a painful self-assessment. Since then, Katherine has intentionally cultivated a life beyond the office.\n\nHer days are still meticulously scheduled, beginning with a 6 AM run through Duboce Triangle and ending on the corporate shuttle, but her weekends are her own. She\u2019s built a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other professionals, with whom she explores Sonoma wineries or new exhibits at SFMOMA. She lives in a modern, light-filled condo where she hosts intimate dinner parties, her connection to San Francisco deepening with each passing year. She came for a career but stayed for the challenging beauty of the city\u2014the fog rolling over Twin Peaks, the vibrant energy of the Mission where she volunteers, the easy access to the wild coast.\n\nNow at 44, Katherine finds her ambitions shifting. While a VP title is the logical next step, she dreams of something more. She aspires to leverage her experience to advise early-stage, mission-driven startups or mentor young women entering the tech field, hoping to build a legacy that is measured less by stock options and more by meaningful impact."

Looking out at the glittering lights across the Bay, she felt a profound click. This wasn't just a degree; it was an unlocking. Chicago had been a plan she executed perfectly; San Francisco was a future she was finally excited to build. It was the moment the plan became a passion, solidifying her decision to stay forever. This occurred during her MBA program, around age 32.\n\n2.\nThe true memory wasn\u2019t the champagne toast after her first major product launch. It was an hour before, in the tense server room, when a critical bug emerged. A quiet calm settled over Katherine as she methodically guided the frantic engineers to a solution. In that moment of shared focus, she felt the deep, satisfying authority of a builder, not just an analyst. It was a silent confirmation that she had found her true professional home, a pivotal moment in her career around age 35.\n\n3.\nShe was 38. The argument was over, and he was gone. Standing alone in her condo, the glittering skyline felt like a judgment. His words\u2014\u201cYour life is a spreadsheet, and I\u2019m just a cell you forgot to update\u201d\u2014echoed in the silence. The professional victories suddenly felt hollow, a pyrrhic victory against her own happiness. It was a devastating, necessary collapse. In that profound quiet, she knew her meticulously built life required an entirely new blueprint, one that finally made space for her.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the first dinner party she hosted after the breakup, nearly a year later. She\u2019d planned the menu with the same precision as a product roadmap. As the sound of her friends\u2019 laughter filled her condo, mingling with the aroma of roasted chicken and the city lights outside, she felt a profound sense of accomplishment. This, too, was a creation. It was the warmth of a community she had deliberately built, transforming her perfectly curated space into a genuine home, around age 39.\n\n5.\nLast spring, volunteering at a coding workshop in the Mission, she sat with a brilliant but hesitant teenage girl. Katherine didn't give her the answer, but asked the strategic questions that led the girl to her own breakthrough. The sudden, incandescent spark of understanding on the girl\u2019s face felt more vital and significant than any promotion or stock option ever had. In that moment, her ambition pivoted. The next step wasn't a title; it was cultivating more sparks like that one. This occurred recently, at age 43."
