Raised by a potter mother and a freelance writer father, Leo\u2019s education was a fluid, self-directed process of \u201cunschooling.\u201d While other kids studied algebra, Leo learned composition by framing his mother\u2019s ceramics for her website and typography by proofing his father\u2019s manuscripts. His world was built on curiosity, not curriculum. He didn\u2019t have a high school diploma, but by sixteen, he was more proficient in Adobe Creative Suite\u2014mastered through countless free tutorials and forum deep-dives\u2014than most college students.\n\nThe turning point came at 22. Feeling adrift in the comfortable bubble of his upbringing, Leo yearned for structure and a city that buzzed with an energy his mountain home lacked. He spent months building a sleek online portfolio, showcasing design concepts for imaginary brands. His break was a remote role as a Graphic Design Assistant for a small, vaguely defined branding agency. The job offered no benefits and modest pay, but it was his ticket out. He packed two suitcases and moved into a small, rent-controlled studio in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond.\n\nLeo\u2019s San Francisco is a city viewed largely through his window and on his screen. His commute is a ten-step walk from his mattress to his second-hand desk. Mornings are a blur of Slack notifications and minor design revisions for a senior designer he\u2019s never met in person. His social life is nascent, consisting of quiet nods to neighbors and a weekly online D&D session with friends from his old life. He feels more like a resident of the internet who happens to be located in San Francisco than a true San Franciscan.\n\nAfter work, however, Leo\u2019s real life begins. He explores the city methodically, taking long walks through Golden Gate Park, sketching the architecture in his notebook, and finding solace in the quiet hum of the N Judah streetcar. His dream isn't just to become a senior designer, but to one day lead a project that leaves a visible mark on the city's landscape. He hopes to build tangible connections that go beyond a username, to finally bridge the gap between his isolated digital world and the vibrant, foggy city just outside his door."
