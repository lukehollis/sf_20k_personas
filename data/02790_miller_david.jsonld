He was raised in a quiet, orderly suburb of Cleveland, the only child of a high school history teacher father and an accountant mother. His upbringing was stable, predictable, and rooted in the Midwestern values of pragmatism and hard work. This structured environment instilled in him a deep appreciation for systems, but also a quiet yearning for a place with more texture and unpredictability.\n\nHe pursued this interest at the University of Michigan, earning a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning. It was during a university-sponsored trip his final year that he first experienced San Francisco. He was captivated. The city was a chaotic, beautiful organism, defying the neat grids he was used to. It was a challenge, a complex puzzle he felt an immediate urge to solve. This visit became the pivotal turning point; he turned down a job offer in Chicago and moved to the Bay Area with little more than his degree and a formidable student loan.\n\nDavid began his career as an associate planner, diligently working his way up in the San Francisco Planning Department. His methodical nature, honed in the suburbs of Ohio, made him excellent at navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of city government. Now a Senior Planner, he finds a quiet satisfaction in shaping the city's future, one zoning variance and policy brief at a time.\n\nHis personal life reflects his professional one. He lives alone in a modern Hayes Valley condo, a decision made specifically for its proximity to City Hall, resulting in a 0.0-mile commute. His days are structured: Blue Bottle coffee, a focused eight hours analyzing development proposals from his home office, and an evening walk through his neighborhood, where he subconsciously critiques public space and pedestrian flow.\n\nSocially, David is reserved. His closest connections are a small circle of architects and policy analysts, with whom he debates housing density and public transit over drinks. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and he has since prioritized his work and his contained, manageable life. His great hope is to be the lead planner on a legacy project\u2014a new park or a major transit corridor\u2014that will tangibly improve the city he fell in love with two decades ago. He is a man who doesn\u2019t just live in San Francisco; he lives for it, trying to impose a gentle order on its beautiful chaos."
