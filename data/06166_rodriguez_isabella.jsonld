Her childhood was a blend of two cultures: speaking Spanish at home, surrounded by a boisterous and loving extended family, and navigating the English-speaking world of school. While her parents valued hard work and practicality, Isabella was a dreamer, losing herself in art books and the quiet halls of museums on school trips.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Santa Cruz, where she pursued a degree in Art History, believing she would one day curate exhibits. However, post-graduation reality set in. The art world was competitive and low-paying. Facing student loans, she took a temp job doing data entry for a San Francisco marketing firm. To her surprise, she discovered a knack for finding stories within the numbers, a different kind of curation. This pragmatic pivot led to a full-time position as a Research Assistant.\n\nA key turning point was her move to the city, initially with a college boyfriend. When the relationship ended a year later, a heartbroken Isabella chose to stay. The breakup forced a fierce independence, and she poured her energy into building a life on her own terms. She found an apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose quiet, residential feel and proximity to Golden Gate Park soothed her.\n\nNow 33, Isabella\u2019s life is defined by the four walls of her apartment, as her job has been fully remote since the pandemic. Her 0.0-mile commute means her day starts with a walk to a local cafe on Clement Street for a cortado, a small ritual to mark the boundary between home and work. Her work is a cascade of spreadsheets and reports, analyzing consumer behavior for corporate clients. To counteract the digital nature of her job, she finds sanctuary in Golden Gate Park for evening runs and has a tight-knit circle of friends met through a weekly pottery class\u2014a tactile connection to the artistic world she left behind.\n\nThough competent in her career, Isabella dreams of merging her two selves. Her ultimate aspiration is to open a small, curated boutique in the city, using her market research skills to build a viable business that showcases local artisans\u2014a place where data-driven strategy elevates beautiful, handmade things."
