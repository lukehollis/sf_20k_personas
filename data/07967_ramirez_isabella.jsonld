Growing up in the vibrant, pulsing heart of the Mission District, her childhood was scented with the aroma of pan dulce from her parents' bakery and echoed with the Spanglish spoken on the sidewalks. The daughter of hardworking immigrants from Oaxaca, she witnessed firsthand the silent struggles of her community\u2014friends and family members grappling with trauma, displacement, and depression, often stifled by stigma and a lack of culturally competent care. The turning point came when her favorite uncle, a man whose laughter once filled their small apartment, fell into a deep despair, unable to find a therapist who understood his language or his experience.\n\nThis formative experience fueled her path. Isabella remained local for her education, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from SF State before being accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Master of Social Work (MSW) program. There, she specialized in clinical therapy for underserved populations, driven by the memory of her uncle. After graduation, she cut her teeth in demanding community health clinics, learning to navigate the complex systems of care and advocate fiercely for her clients.\n\nNow, at 34, Isabella has built a life of intentional calm. She lives and works from her quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond, the 0.0-mile commute a deliberate choice to preserve her energy for her emotionally taxing work. Her days are structured: a foggy morning run in Golden Gate Park clears her head before she opens her laptop, where a digital partition separates her from the raw, vulnerable stories of her clients. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she provides telehealth services for a major healthcare provider, finally being the person she wished her uncle had found.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a \"chosen family\" who understand the need for restorative weekend brunches and wine nights. While deeply fulfilled by her work, Isabella dreams of more. Her ultimate goal is to open her own non-profit practice, offering sliding-scale, bilingual therapy back in the Mission. She remains a daughter of San Francisco, a city whose challenges shaped her purpose and whose spirit fuels her ongoing mission to heal her community from within."
