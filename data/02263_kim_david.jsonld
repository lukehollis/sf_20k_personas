Born to first-generation Korean immigrants, David grew up in the small apartment above the modest restaurant his parents poured their life savings and boundless energy into. His childhood was a soundtrack of sizzling pans, his parents' accented conversations, and the expectation that he would achieve a different, more \"American\" success.\n\nHe tried. To honor their sacrifice, David enrolled at San Francisco State University, dutifully pursuing a business degree. But the lectures felt sterile compared to the vibrant, chaotic rhythm of the family restaurant. He found more purpose in soothing a difficult customer or perfecting his mother\u2019s banchan recipes than in any textbook. The turning point came during his sophomore year when his father\u2019s health began to decline. Without hesitation, David left school to help full-time, a decision that disappointed his parents at first but ultimately became a source of quiet pride.\n\nNow 46, David is the manager and heart of \"Seoul Kitchen.\" His 0.0-mile commute is a simple walk down a flight of stairs each morning before dawn. His days are a ritual of inventory checks, staff scheduling, and greeting longtime regulars by name. He never married, his life so intertwined with the business that personal relationships often took a backseat. His closest confidante is Maria, his head chef of fifteen years, with whom he shares an unspoken understanding over the nightly dinner rush.\n\nDavid's aspirations are grounded and deeply personal. He dreams not of expansion, but of preservation\u2014maintaining the restaurant as an anchor in a city of constant change. He hopes to subtly modernize the menu, introducing new dishes while honoring his parents\u2019 original legacy. His connection to San Francisco is etched into the worn countertops and the foggy streets outside his window. He is a steward of his family\u2019s dream, finding profound meaning not in a life he was supposed to have, but in the one he purposefully built."
