The only daughter of hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, she was the vessel for all their American dreams. Her father, a cook whose hands were perpetually scarred from the wok, and her mother, a seamstress who worked from home, instilled in her a singular focus: education was the only way out and up.\n\nShe was a dutiful daughter, internalizing their sacrifices. Her youth was a blur of studying, first at Garfield Elementary, then Lowell High School, where she excelled in mathematics. While her peers were exploring the city, Mei was memorizing formulas. She attended San Francisco State University for her undergraduate degree in economics, a practical choice that kept her close to her aging parents. Feeling she had hit a glass ceiling early in her career, she enrolled in night classes, earning an MBA from Santa Clara University. This degree was her key, unlocking the doors to the gleaming towers of the Financial District.\n\nFor over two decades, her life ran on the schedule of the Muni bus and the corporate calendar. She built a successful career through sheer diligence, becoming a Senior Financial Analyst known for her meticulous, unshakable work. A brief, ill-fated marriage in her early thirties ended in a quiet divorce, a turning point that cemented her self-reliance. She poured her energy back into her work, finding a predictable comfort in spreadsheets and market projections.\n\nToday, at 54, her commute is a ten-step journey from her kitchen to a desk in her Inner Richmond condo. The pandemic shifted her work home permanently, and the silence of her apartment has become both a sanctuary and a challenge. Her days are structured by market hours and virtual meetings. Weekends are for solitary walks in Golden Gate Park or buying pastries on Clement Street, where the languages and smells remind her of her childhood.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her soul\u2014it\u2019s the fog obscuring the Sutro Tower, not the cable cars. Her aspirations have softened with age. She dreams not of a promotion, but of a trip to southern Spain, of finally learning to paint with watercolors, of a life where the numbers on a balance sheet are no longer the most important figures. She has achieved the stability her parents dreamed of; now, she quietly hopes to find the joy they never had time for."
