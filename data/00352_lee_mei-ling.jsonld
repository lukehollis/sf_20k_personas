The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up stocking shelves and running the register at her parents\u2019 small neighborhood grocery store. They were practical people who valued stability, and they watched their quiet, observant daughter with a mix of pride and confusion as she spent hours sketching the bay windows of their neighbors' homes and the distant silhouette of the Sutro Tower. For Mei-Ling, the city itself was a canvas of lines, textures, and human stories.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Master of Architecture program. However, her professional start was disillusioning. She landed a coveted job at a massive corporate firm in the Financial District, where her days were spent designing sterile office interiors and soulless condominium facades. The work felt anonymous, a betrayal of the artistic impulse that had driven her. The turning point came three years in, when she walked away from the high salary and security to join a small, avant-garde design studio.\n\nToday, Mei-Ling is the Senior Architectural Designer for a firm specializing in cultural and art spaces. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a drafting table in the corner of her SOMA loft, a sanctuary of concrete floors, exposed brick, and carefully curated art. Her work now involves designing immersive museum exhibits, public art installations for tech campuses, and gallery interiors. Her days are a focused blend of digital modeling, sketching, and client calls, punctuated by walks to the SFMOMA or Yerba Buena Gardens for inspiration.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of creatives\u2014a curator, a lighting designer, and a writer\u2014who often gather in her loft to debate art and share wine. While she isn't actively dating, she\u2019s open to a partnership with someone who understands her devotion to her craft. Mei-Ling\u2019s deepest aspiration is to leave a permanent mark on the city's landscape, not with a skyscraper, but with a public space that fosters community and wonder\u2014perhaps a new performance pavilion in Golden Gate Park or a reimagined library branch in the very neighborhood where she grew up. She wants to give back to the city that first taught her how to see."
