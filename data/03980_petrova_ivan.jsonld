His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life built on practicality and proximity. Born in Manila to a Filipino mother and a father of Russian-Filipino heritage, Ivan\u2019s last name is a family quirk, a matriarchal choice that stuck. The Petrova family immigrated to Daly City when Ivan was nine, trading tropical humidity for the persistent Bay Area fog.\n\nWhile his parents harbored quiet hopes of a university-educated son, Ivan was drawn to the tangible. He was the kid who took apart the family television not out of malice, but to understand its inner workings. Sidestepping a traditional four-year college, he earned an Associate's degree in Industrial Technology from City College. It was a practical choice that led him directly to the factory floor of a small, high-end furniture manufacturer in the Dogpatch.\n\nIvan started by operating a CNC machine, his focus and reliability quickly earning him respect. Over two decades, he steadily climbed the ladder from line worker to shift lead, and finally, to Production Supervisor. He witnessed the dot-com boom transform the city around him, watching warehouses become lofts and gritty workshops become artisan cafes.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce ten years ago. His ex-wife had yearned for a life beyond the factory\u2019s whistle, a world of travel and spontaneity that clashed with Ivan\u2019s structured existence. Since then, his life has become even more entwined with his work. He lives in a small apartment just down the street from the plant, his days dictated by production schedules and quality control. His social life consists of beers with his crew after a long week and the occasional Giants game.\n\nIvan is a quiet anchor in a city of perpetual change. He feels a deep, unspoken connection to the San Francisco that *makes* things. He hopes to mentor his replacement, ensuring the skills he\u2019s honed are passed down. His dream isn't of wealth or fame, but a quiet retirement, perhaps with enough savings to finally visit the Philippines and see the village his father left behind."

Inside, the television\u2019s guts were a city of their own: wires like streets, glowing tubes like strange buildings. His father\u2019s anger was a distant hum against the overwhelming thrill of seeing how things *worked*. It wasn\u2019t destruction; it was discovery. In that moment, he knew he was meant to build and understand, not just to watch.\n\n2.\nHis first solo run on the CNC machine felt like taming a beast. He was twenty-one, the factory floor electric with noise and the smell of cut walnut. He input the code, his heart pounding with the machine's deep thrum, and watched the robotic arm carve a perfect, flawless curve. It was a tangible prayer answered, a perfect translation from digital command to physical reality. For the first time, he felt powerful, precise, and perfectly in his place in the world.\n\n3.\nTen years ago, the silence in his apartment after the divorce was deafening. His ex-wife's longing for Paris and Bali echoed in the empty space. Ivan stood at his window, looking at the familiar factory smokestack. The 5:00 PM whistle blew, a sound she had hated. For him, it was a comfort, a promise of routine. He didn't feel despair, but a quiet settling. The pressure to want a bigger world was gone. This small map of street and steel was his, and it was enough.\n\n4.\nHe was on the factory roof five years ago, checking a ventilation unit, when he truly saw it: the glistening new skyline. The Salesforce Tower pierced the clouds, a monument to a city he barely recognized. Down below, in his world, he could hear the saw bite into wood and smell the varnish. He wasn\u2019t part of that new, glassy San Francisco. He was the foundation it was built on, the guy making the chair someone in that tower sat in. It gave him a quiet, stubborn pride.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a new kid named Marco botched a custom leg on the lathe, his face pale with panic. The kid expected to be yelled at. Instead, Ivan picked up the ruined piece of maple. \u201cSee the grain here? It fought you,\u201d he said softly, guiding Marco\u2019s hand over the wood. \u201cYou have to listen to it first.\u201d In the young man\u2019s look of dawning comprehension, Ivan felt a satisfaction deeper than any production quota. He wasn\u2019t just managing a line; he was passing something on. It felt like purpose."
