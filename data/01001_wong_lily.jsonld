A third-generation Chinese American, she was raised in the Richmond District, a world away from the tourist-filled streets of Chinatown where her grandparents had established a small bakery after immigrating from Guangdong. Her parents, a pragmatic accountant and a meticulous pharmacist, instilled in her the values of hard work and stability, envisioning a future for her in finance or law.\n\nLily, however, was drawn to the unspoken stories. She witnessed firsthand the quiet suffering of her grandfather, who battled a deep depression shrouded in cultural stigma and dismissed as old age. This feeling of powerlessness became the catalyst for her life's work. Defying her parents' expectations, she enrolled in Sociology at San Francisco State University, fascinated by the city\u2019s complex social ecosystems. She later earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on culturally competent care.\n\nHer professional journey began in the trenches of community health clinics, but a key turning point was experiencing burnout herself. Realizing she could better serve her community by first preserving her own well-being, she took the leap to open her own private practice.\n\nNow 30, Lily is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) with an office just a few doors down from her apartment, making her commute a short walk along Clement Street. Her days are a blend of telehealth sessions and in-person meetings with clients, many of whom are young professionals and fellow members of the AAPI community navigating the pressures of career, family, and identity in a hyper-competitive city.\n\nHer evenings are for herself: long walks through Golden Gate Park, exploring new restaurants with her close-knit group of friends, and navigating the complexities of modern dating. Lily\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees both its gentrifying pains and its resilient spirit. Her dream is to expand her practice into a non-profit wellness center, creating a sanctuary that specifically addresses the mental health needs of the AAPI community that raised her, ensuring no one\u2019s story goes unheard."
