The only child of immigrants who ran a small, beloved bakery on Clement Street, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American ambition. She spent her youth arranging pastries and absorbing the stories of neighborhood regulars, developing a keen sense for community and a disciplined work ethic.\n\nWhile her parents hoped she would pursue a practical career, Mei followed her passion for beauty and history, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Art History from San Francisco State University. However, she graduated into the uncertain economy of the early 2000s. Her dream of curating a gallery felt distant, so she took an administrative assistant job at a fledgling tech startup in SoMa to pay the bills. It was a pragmatic pivot, but one where she unexpectedly thrived. Her organized nature, honed in the bakery, and her visual acuity from her art studies made her a natural at creating marketing materials.\n\nOver two decades, Mei built a steady career from the ground up. She rose to Marketing Coordinator, witnessing the tech industry reshape her city firsthand. A key turning point was her company\u2019s shift to permanent remote work in 2021. For the first time, her commute was zero miles. This change anchored her even more deeply to her Inner Richmond neighborhood. She still lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment just blocks from her parents\u2019 now-retired bakery.\n\nHer days are structured. A morning walk through Golden Gate Park, a strong coffee from a local cafe, then hours spent coordinating campaigns from her sunlit living room. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014some from Lowell High School, others former colleagues. Though self-reliant and comfortable with her solitude, she values these deep, long-standing connections. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to launch a small online platform that promotes local Bay Area artists\u2014a way to finally merge her professional skills with her original passion, giving back to the city's creative soul that first inspired her."
