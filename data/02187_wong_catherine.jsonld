The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she was raised in the Richmond District amidst the scent of inventory from her parents' small grocery store on Clement Street. While they worked tirelessly stocking shelves and serving customers, Catherine devoured books, channeling their work ethic into academic excellence. She was a quintessential Lowell High School grind, driven by a quiet determination to build a life of influence and security her parents could only dream of.\n\nHer path was a straight, upward line: a political science degree from UC Berkeley, followed by a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law. She was recruited by a top-tier downtown firm and threw herself into the grueling world of corporate law. Catherine specialized in securities litigation, finding a thrill in the high-stakes, intellectually demanding combat of defending financial institutions. The relentless 80-hour weeks paid off; she made partner by 40, a remarkable achievement. However, the climb cost her a marriage in her thirties, a casualty of her all-consuming career.\n\nToday, Catherine\u2019s world is a vertical one, contained almost entirely within a sleek SoMa high-rise. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her minimalist condominium to her exquisitely appointed home office, which boasts a panoramic view of the Bay Bridge. Her days are disciplined: a 5:30 a.m. workout in the building\u2019s gym, followed by a twelve-hour onslaught of video conferences, legal briefs, and client management. Social connections are often transactional\u2014dinners with clients or drinks with a few trusted colleagues.\n\nAt 52, having reached the pinnacle of her profession, Catherine feels a new, unfamiliar stirring. The ferocity that fueled her rise has begun to soften into a desire for something more. She supports her aging parents, but feels a cultural chasm between their world and hers. Her aspiration is no longer about winning the next big case, but about finding a new definition of success. She dreams of mentoring young, hungry lawyers, taking a real vacation without her laptop, and perhaps finally learning to sail on the Bay, reconnecting with the city she conquered from a tower of glass."
