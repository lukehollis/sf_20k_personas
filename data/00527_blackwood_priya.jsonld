Born to Indian immigrants who ran a successful engineering consultancy, her childhood was a blueprint for predictable success: excel in math and science, attend a top university, and secure a lucrative career in tech. Priya, however, was always more interested in the unspoken anxieties of her high-achieving peers than in lines of code.\n\nHer first act of quiet rebellion was enrolling at UC Berkeley not for engineering, but for sociology. This pivot caused a rift with her parents, who saw her choice as a rejection of their sacrifices. It was there she found her calling, fascinated by the systemic pressures that shape individual lives. She followed her bachelor's with a Master of Social Work, dedicating herself to understanding the mechanics of empathy and support.\n\nDuring her residency at a large Oakland hospital, she met Colin Blackwood, a charismatic Irish architect. Their connection was immediate and intense, a collision of her structured empathy and his freewheeling creativity. They married and moved to a small, sun-drenched apartment in San Francisco's Inner Sunset. For a decade, life was a vibrant mix of challenging work and shared dreams. However, the emotional toll of Priya\u2019s profession\u2014absorbing the daily trauma of patients in crisis\u2014began to weigh on the relationship. Colin sought escape in new projects and travel, while Priya needed stillness and stability. They divorced amicably, and Priya, feeling the name Blackwood was as much a part of her hard-won identity as Sharma, decided to keep it.\n\nNow 43, Priya lives and works from that same Inner Sunset apartment. The pandemic shifted her practice to Telehealth, making her commute a 0.0-mile walk to her home office. Her days are a carefully balanced routine of intense virtual sessions with patients, followed by decompressing walks through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park. She knows the neighborhood intimately, from the best espresso at Arizmendi Bakery to the quietest benches in the Botanical Garden. Her social life is a small, tight circle of fellow therapists who understand the unique burdens of their work. Priya\u2019s aspiration isn't grand; she dreams of creating a small, specialized support group for healthcare workers, a space for the healers to be healed. She found her purpose not in fulfilling her parents' plan, but in patiently helping others redraw their own."

For a moment, she saw her parents\u2019 proud, expectant faces. Then, she saw the anxious eyes of her classmates in Fremont. With a surge of terrifying, liberating clarity, she checked the sociology box. It was not an act of anger, but the first true act of listening to herself. That decision cost her parental approval for years, but it was the moment she claimed ownership of her own life\u2019s design.\n\n2.\nHe was sketching in the chaotic Oakland hospital cafeteria during her residency. Colin didn\u2019t see her MSW badge or the exhaustion she wore like a coat; he just saw *her*. He looked up, his blue eyes crinkling, and asked if the flow of tired people ever overwhelmed her. The question was so direct, so creative. In that instant, she felt a jolt of connection, a sudden, brilliant color splashed across the monochrome fatigue of her professional life. It felt less like meeting someone and more like being discovered.\n\n3.\nColin was unrolling blueprints for a seaside house in Portugal, his voice buzzing with excitement. Priya had just spent an hour on the phone with the parents of a teenager who had overdosed. She looked at the elegant lines on the paper and felt nothing but a profound, hollow weariness. His vibrant dreams were a language she could no longer speak. It wasn't a fight, but a quiet, heartbreaking moment of seeing the chasm her work had carved between them, a space too wide for his optimism to cross.\n\n4.\nThe morning after Colin moved out, she woke to the Inner Sunset light hitting the wall where his architectural sketches used to hang. She braced for a pang of loss, of emptiness. Instead, a deep, surprising stillness settled in her chest. The silence in the apartment wasn't lonely; it was calm. It was hers. In that quiet moment, keeping the name Blackwood felt right. It wasn't just his name anymore; it was a marker of the woman she had become, a survivor of a beautiful, impossible love.\n\n5.\nAfter a brutal telehealth session with a grieving ER nurse, Priya shut her laptop and walked straight into Golden Gate Park. The fog was thick, muffling the city's noise. She sat on a damp bench in the Shakespeare Garden, breathing in the scent of wet earth and eucalyptus. As the cool mist settled on her skin, she felt the nurse\u2019s vicarious trauma slowly seeping out of her. This walk wasn\u2019t an escape; it was a necessary transfusion, the moment she understood that to heal others, she must first ritualistically heal herself."
