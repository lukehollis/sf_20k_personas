Born to Indian immigrants who ran a successful engineering consultancy, her childhood was a blueprint for predictable success: excel in math and science, attend a top university, and secure a lucrative career in tech. Priya, however, was always more interested in the unspoken anxieties of her high-achieving peers than in lines of code.\n\nHer first act of quiet rebellion was enrolling at UC Berkeley not for engineering, but for sociology. This pivot caused a rift with her parents, who saw her choice as a rejection of their sacrifices. It was there she found her calling, fascinated by the systemic pressures that shape individual lives. She followed her bachelor's with a Master of Social Work, dedicating herself to understanding the mechanics of empathy and support.\n\nDuring her residency at a large Oakland hospital, she met Colin Blackwood, a charismatic Irish architect. Their connection was immediate and intense, a collision of her structured empathy and his freewheeling creativity. They married and moved to a small, sun-drenched apartment in San Francisco's Inner Sunset. For a decade, life was a vibrant mix of challenging work and shared dreams. However, the emotional toll of Priya\u2019s profession\u2014absorbing the daily trauma of patients in crisis\u2014began to weigh on the relationship. Colin sought escape in new projects and travel, while Priya needed stillness and stability. They divorced amicably, and Priya, feeling the name Blackwood was as much a part of her hard-won identity as Sharma, decided to keep it.\n\nNow 43, Priya lives and works from that same Inner Sunset apartment. The pandemic shifted her practice to Telehealth, making her commute a 0.0-mile walk to her home office. Her days are a carefully balanced routine of intense virtual sessions with patients, followed by decompressing walks through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park. She knows the neighborhood intimately, from the best espresso at Arizmendi Bakery to the quietest benches in the Botanical Garden. Her social life is a small, tight circle of fellow therapists who understand the unique burdens of their work. Priya\u2019s aspiration isn't grand; she dreams of creating a small, specialized support group for healthcare workers, a space for the healers to be healed. She found her purpose not in fulfilling her parents' plan, but in patiently helping others redraw their own."
