His name was a source of constant questioning, a daily reminder of his dual identity. He grew up feeling slightly adrift, excelling academically as a way to ground himself in tangible achievement. This drive propelled him through an economics degree and eventually a prestigious MBA program on the East Coast.\n\nHe began his career at a top-tier management consulting firm in Boston, embracing the grueling hours and constant travel as a badge of honor. For years, his life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and hotel suites. He transferred to the San Francisco office a decade ago, drawn by the energy of the tech boom. The city, however, remained mostly a backdrop for his work\u2014a place to land between client engagements.\n\nThe key turning point was the global pandemic. Overnight, his travel-heavy existence screeched to a halt. Grounded in his Hayes Valley condo, his commute shrank to the 0.0 miles between his bedroom and his home office. The forced stillness was initially jarring but became transformative. Stripped of his identity as a road warrior, he had to confront the life he\u2019d built\u2014or rather, failed to build\u2014in San Francisco.\n\nNow, Michael's daily routine is more deliberate. He starts with a run through the Presidio, trades suits for comfortable athleisure, and connects with his team via endless Zoom calls. He\u2019s tentatively single after a long-term relationship buckled under the weight of his old lifestyle. He\u2019s begun exploring his heritage, taking a Korean language class online and frequenting restaurants in the Richmond District. His greatest aspiration is no longer a partnership at the firm, but a trip to Seoul\u2014not for business, but to connect with the city of his birth. Michael is slowly remaking his life, discovering that his true home isn\u2019t a place on a map, but the person he is finally allowing himself to become."
