Born David Rojas in Mexico City, he was adopted at eight months old by a loving Chinese-American couple who couldn\u2019t have children of their own. They raised him in San Francisco's Inner Richmond, a neighborhood of fog-laced streets and Cantonese bakeries. His parents gave him their surname, Wong, but honored his birth mother\u2019s wishes by keeping his first name. Growing up, David was a quiet, observant boy, navigating a dual heritage\u2014savoring his mother's jook for breakfast and developing a lifelong love for the Mission-style burritos his father adored.\n\nPragmatic by nature, David attended San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree. He entered the workforce just before the dot-com bubble burst, an experience that taught him the value of stability over hype. Seeing colleagues lose everything, he decided to fortify his career, earning a Master's degree in Information Systems. This positioned him perfectly as a translator between the ambitious ideas of business leaders and the practical realities of engineering teams. He excelled, his calm demeanor and analytical mind making him an invaluable Senior Business Analyst.\n\nHis personal life has been a quieter journey. A marriage in his late twenties ended amicably a decade later, the two simply growing in different directions. The union gave him his greatest joy: his daughter, Maya, now a student at UC Davis. With his commute now zero, David's home in the Inner Richmond has become his entire world. His days start not with a frantic BART ride, but a quiet walk into Golden Gate Park, grabbing a coffee from a familiar cafe on Clement Street. He spends his days in focused video calls and data analysis, the city\u2019s hum a distant soundtrack.\n\nAt 49, David is less concerned with climbing the corporate ladder and more with cultivating contentment. His aspirations are personal: finally becoming fluent in Spanish to connect with a part of his identity he\u2019s only known through stories, planning a trip to Spain with Maya after she graduates, and perhaps one day, mentoring younger analysts. He is a man deeply rooted in the city that raised him, a mosaic of cultures who has found a quiet, stable peace in the ever-changing landscape of San Francisco."
