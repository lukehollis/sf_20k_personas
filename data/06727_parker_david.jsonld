Raised in a quiet Cleveland suburb by a librarian mother and a history teacher father, David\u2019s upbringing was steeped in books and intellectual curiosity. He followed this path earnestly, earning a Master\u2019s degree in European History with the intention of pursuing a PhD and a life in academia.\n\nThe turning point came at 28, facing a bleak academic job market and mounting student debt. On a whim, he took an aptitude test at a friend\u2019s suggestion, which revealed a surprising talent for systems analysis. This led to an entry-level position at a Chicago consulting firm, where he discovered his ability to deconstruct complex historical narratives was perfectly suited to diagnosing corporate inefficiencies. He was a natural. The work was demanding but intellectually stimulating, and the financial security was a world away from the adjunct professor life he narrowly avoided.\n\nA promotion brought him to San Francisco fifteen years ago. He embraced the city\u2019s energy, a stark contrast to his Midwestern roots. He married, bought the flat, and climbed the corporate ladder, becoming a senior partner. However, the relentless travel and 80-hour workweeks that defined his 30s and early 40s took their toll, leading to an amicable but lonely divorce five years ago. Now, with a 0.0-mile commute, his days are a paradox: hours of high-stakes Zoom calls advising global corporations, followed by quiet walks through Golden Gate Park, just steps from his door.\n\nAt 49, David feels the pull of his original passions. He has achieved success but questions its substance. He volunteers on the board of a local historical society and spends evenings reading for pleasure, not for professional development. His great, unarticulated dream is to write a book\u2014a microhistory of a forgotten San Francisco event\u2014blending his analytical skillset with his love for storytelling. He aspires to a \"third act\" dedicated not to optimizing corporate futures, but to preserving a piece of the past in the city he now calls home."
