The only son of Filipino immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, Anthony grew up straddling two worlds. At home, the air was thick with the aroma of adobo and the sound of Tagalog spoken by his parents, a postal worker and a nurse\u2019s aide. They embodied the immigrant work ethic, saving every dollar and pinning their hopes on their son\u2019s academic success. They envisioned a business degree, a corner office, a life of stability they never had.\n\nHe tried to follow their path, enrolling at San Francisco State University. But the abstract theories of economics felt hollow compared to the tangible satisfaction of disassembling and rebuilding the family\u2019s desktop computer. After two years, weighed down by the ghost of his parents' expectations, he made the difficult choice to drop out. It was a quiet rebellion. He threw himself into technology, earning A+ and Network+ certifications. His first IT helpdesk job was a vindication, proving he could forge his own version of success.\n\nNow, at 45, Anthony is an IT Support Specialist for a major tech firm, a position he\u2019s held for nearly a decade. His 0.0-mile commute defines his existence; he\u2019s a native son of the Bay Area who rarely leaves his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. His days follow a soothing, predictable rhythm: log in at 8:59 AM, solve user issues via Slack and Zoom, and take a midday walk through the cool, eucalyptus-scented air of Golden Gate Park. His apartment is his fortress, a neat space where the soft glow of monitors and the low hum of a server rack are the primary ambiance.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but narrow. He isn't part of the bustling downtown scene but is a fixture at the pho restaurant on Irving Street and the local bookstore. His social life consists of a weekly online gaming session with old high school friends and occasional family dinners in Daly City. While content, a quiet longing persists. He dreams of taking a long trip to the Philippines to see the villages his parents described, to connect with a part of himself he only knows through stories. More than anything, he hopes to build a relationship that extends beyond a screen\u2014a connection as real and tangible as the computer hardware he so expertly understands."
