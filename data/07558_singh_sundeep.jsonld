Born and raised in a small village in Punjab, India, his upbringing was one of familial duty and hard work on his family\u2019s modest farm. He completed his schooling there, but saw no future for himself in the fields. At 21, with his family\u2019s pooled savings, he followed an older cousin to America, arriving in San Francisco with little English but a powerful work ethic.\n\nHis early years were a blur of dishwashing, construction labor, and any cash job he could find. He learned his trade not in a classroom, but through observation and necessity, picking up plumbing, electrical, and carpentry skills from grizzled veterans on various job sites. His turning point came fifteen years ago when he landed the position of live-in facilities maintenance worker. The job offered not just a steady income, but a home\u2014a small apartment in the building\u2019s basement. This explains his 0.0-mile commute; his life and work are intertwined within the same walls.\n\nA widower for seven years since his wife, Jasleen, passed from a sudden illness, Sundeep\u2019s life is one of quiet routine. He begins his day at dawn, walking the building\u2019s perimeter before the city fully wakes. His social connections are built on service and familiarity: the elderly Mrs. Chen on the second floor for whom he always carries groceries, the young tech couple in 3B he advises on houseplants, and the spiritual community at the local Gurdwara, where he volunteers on Sundays.\n\nSundeep harbors no grand dreams of wealth. His aspirations are simpler and directed outward. He diligently sends money back to his sister in Punjab, ensuring her children have the educational opportunities he never did. His greatest hope is to one day save enough to visit his village, not as a wealthy American, but as a son who fulfilled his duty. Sundeep\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not through its iconic landmarks, but through the building\u2019s very bones. He is the keeper of its warmth and light, a quiet, foundational presence in a city constantly reinventing itself around him."
