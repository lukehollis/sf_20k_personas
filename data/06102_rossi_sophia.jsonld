            "value": "Sophia Rossi is a living testament to an older, quieter San Francisco. Born at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital, she was raised in the heart of North Beach, the daughter of second-generation Italian-American bakers. Her childhood was scented with anise and espresso from her parents\u2019 bakery on Columbus Avenue, a world of local merchants and lifelong neighbors. She was expected to follow a practical path, and her Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications from San Francisco State University was meant to secure a stable job in marketing or public relations.\n\nHer life\u2019s defining turn came at 23. Needing a job after graduation, she took a temporary front-desk position at the Coda Gallery, a small contemporary art space just a few blocks from her family home. She intended to stay for six months; she never left. The gallery\u2019s eccentric, brilliant owner saw in Sophia not an art historian, but something more valuable: a steady hand, an intuitive understanding of people, and an unpretentious eye for compelling work. Over three decades, she evolved from receptionist to gallery assistant to her current role as Assistant Manager.\n\nSophia never married, though a serious relationship in her late 30s left a quiet mark on her. When it ended, she poured her devotion into the gallery. Her life is geographically tiny but emotionally vast. Fifteen years ago, the apartment above the gallery became available, and she moved in. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days are a comforting ritual: a cappuccino at Caffe Trieste, opening the gallery, corresponding with artists, and speaking with the collectors who have become familiar faces.\n\nAt 53, Sophia has no desire to own the gallery. Her ambition is one of stewardship. She dreams of discovering and launching the career of one more great Bay Area artist before she retires, ensuring the gallery\u2019s legacy continues. She is a quiet anchor in a city of constant change, a woman whose entire world exists within a few cherished blocks, guarding the art and soul of the neighborhood that raised her."
