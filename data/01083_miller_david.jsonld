He wasn't born to the fog; he was a product of the Central Valley's relentless sun. Raised in Bakersfield, his upbringing was straightforward: his father worked the oil fields, his mother managed the home, and the expectation for David was to find a steady trade and not ask for too much. He was a quiet boy who preferred tinkering with old engines to homework, graduating high school with a diploma but no particular direction.\n\nIn his early twenties, love, or what he thought was love, pulled him to San Francisco. He followed a girlfriend with artistic ambitions, feeling like a side character in her vibrant, bohemian story. He found work as a mover, then a barback, his powerful frame useful in a city that ran on service. The relationship-ended as they always seemed to for him\u2014fizzling out as her world expanded and his remained static. With no money to return home and too much pride to admit defeat, David was marooned.\n\nA temporary job at a wholesale distribution warehouse became permanent through sheer reliability. Fifteen years ago, a turning point came when the aging owner offered him a small, stark apartment attached to the main building in exchange for reduced rent and acting as the on-site caretaker. The 0.0-mile commute was a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse. It offered stability, but it cemented his isolation.\n\nNow 48, David\u2019s days are a metronome of routine. He\u2019s up before dawn, the groan of the roll-up door his alarm clock. He operates the forklift, manages inventory, and signs for deliveries from truckers who are his primary social contact. Evenings are spent in his small apartment, the noise of the city muffled by concrete walls. He watches old movies, reads worn paperbacks, and feels more a part of the city\u2019s industrial past than its tech-fueled present. His connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t through its parks or cafes, but through the rumble of the Caltrain and the foghorn echoing from the bay. His dream isn't grand; it's a quiet fantasy of saving enough for a used pickup truck and driving east, finding a small town where he can have a small yard and hear crickets instead of sirens."
