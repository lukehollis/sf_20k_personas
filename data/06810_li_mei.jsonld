The only child of pragmatic immigrant parents who ran a small laundromat, Mei\u2019s childhood was a lesson in hard work and tangible results. They envisioned a secure future for her, pushing her toward a business degree at San Francisco State University. Mei dutifully enrolled, but found herself suffocated by spreadsheets and marketing theory. Her escape was an elective in graphic design, a world of color, form, and texture that felt more real to her than any balance sheet.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year. After pulling an all-nighter not for a final, but to help a friend design and print a zine, she realized her path lay elsewhere. She dropped out of college, a decision that created a quiet, painful rift with her parents that took years to mend. Adrift but determined, she found a job as an assistant at a small, independent print shop in SoMa. The owner, a grizzled artist named Arthur, saw her meticulous nature and innate design sense, becoming her mentor.\n\nNow, at 45, Mei\u2019s life is wholly integrated. She lives in the loft apartment directly above the print shop, making her commute a simple walk down a flight of wooden stairs. Arthur has mostly retired, leaving the day-to-day operations to her. Her mornings start with strong coffee and the low hum of the offset press warming up. Her life moves to the rhythm of client deadlines and the mechanical ballet of her machines. The local artists, photographers, and activists who rely on her for their posters, books, and prints have become her chosen family. These relationships are her social life\u2014built on creative collaboration and mutual respect.\n\nMei\u2019s aspirations are as grounded as her lifestyle. She isn\u2019t dreaming of leaving; she is saving to buy the shop from Arthur outright. She envisions starting a small publishing imprint from the shop, giving a platform to the emerging artists she admires. For Mei, success isn't about wealth or acclaim, but about being the quiet, essential hub for a community, her hands ensuring their visions make it onto paper."
