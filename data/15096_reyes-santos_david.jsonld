The hyphen in his name connects his parents: a pragmatic Filipino-American father who spent thirty years with the postal service, and a warm, second-generation Irish-American mother who worked as a dental hygienist. Growing up, David absorbed their core lesson: success wasn\u2019t about prestige, but about relentless, practical work.\n\nHe enrolled in the Business Administration program at San Francisco State, but the theoretical nature of academia felt sluggish. A part-time job as an assistant at a busy brokerage in Noe Valley was a revelation. He was captivated by the tangible results, the fast pace, and the direct link between effort and reward. This was business in action, not in a textbook. At 21, in a defining turning point, he dropped out of college to get his real estate license. His parents were nervous, but they recognized his familiar drive and gave their blessing.\n\nThe first few years were a grind of open houses, cold calls, and living on a shoestring budget. But David\u2019s easy-going charm, coupled with his deep understanding of the Bay Area\u2019s micro-neighborhoods, began to pay off. He built a reputation for being honest, responsive, and willing to work at all hours.\n\nNow at 30, David lives in a tidy one-bedroom in the Inner Sunset, enjoying the neighborhood's quiet streets and proximity to Golden Gate Park. His 6.8-mile commute in his car is a cherished buffer between his personal and professional worlds, a time for podcasts and mental preparation. He\u2019s in a serious relationship with Maya, a graphic designer, and their conversations are increasingly about the future.\n\nDavid sees San Francisco not as a single entity, but as a complex tapestry of dreams and compromises\u2014a perspective that makes him a better agent. His ultimate aspiration isn't just about closing bigger deals; it's about ownership. He dreams of buying a home with Maya, laying down the kind of permanent roots his parents worked so hard to establish. Beyond that, the idea of his own boutique brokerage, \u201cReyes-Santos Properties,\u201d flickers as his ultimate professional goal."

His dad, a man of routine and pensions, was silent. Then, his mother placed her hand over his. \"If you're going to work this hard,\" she said, \"it should be for yourself.\" In that moment, fear turned into fuel. Their blessing wasn't just permission; it was a transfer of their relentless work ethic directly into his hands, a trust he was determined to earn. (Age 21)\n\n2.\nHis first sale was a cramped studio in the Tenderloin. The commission check felt heavier than gold. He remembers standing on the corner of Larkin and Eddy, staring at the paper in his hand as the city\u2019s noise faded away. It was more than rent money; it was tangible proof that his gamble was the right one. For the first time, he felt the solid ground of self-reliance beneath his feet, a foundation he had built with his own two hands on the city\u2019s pavement. (Age 23)\n\n3.\nHe was helping an elderly couple sell their Outer Richmond home of 40 years. They were priced out of retiring nearby. Handing over the keys after the final walkthrough, the wife cried softly, a complex mix of relief and loss. David realized then that he wasn't just selling property; he was managing the emotional weight of a city that both builds dreams and forces compromise. It was a humbling lesson that shaped his empathetic, story-first approach to real estate. (Age 26)\n\n4.\nIt was a rare, clear afternoon last year. He and Maya were on a blanket in Golden Gate Park, near the Dutch Windmill. She was sketching, and he was watching the light filter through the eucalyptus trees. Without any grand declaration, he just knew. All the hustle, the late-night calls, the grind\u2014it was all leading to this feeling of profound peace. The dream of ownership wasn't just about a building anymore; it was about building a future, right there, with her. (Age 29)\n\n5.\nDriving through Noe Valley a few months ago, he saw a 'For Lease' sign on a small, charming storefront\u2014not far from the brokerage where he'd started. For a fleeting second, he pictured a different sign: \"Reyes-Santos Properties.\" The name felt right, a fusion of his parents' legacies. It wasn't just a fantasy anymore; it was a blueprint. That single image gave his relentless ambition a new, more personal destination, a tangible goal for all his practical work. (Age 30)"
