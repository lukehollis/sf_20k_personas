Born to Iranian immigrants who fled the revolution, her engineer father and resilient mother instilled in her a formidable work ethic. They taught her that in America, one\u2019s success was built on reputation and relentless effort, lessons that became the bedrock of her character. While her friends were enjoying a carefree youth, Sarina was often helping at her aunt\u2019s small Persian market, absorbing the nuances of negotiation and customer service.\n\nShe chose San Francisco State University for its business program, drawn to the city's energy and architecture. Graduating in 2008 with a Bachelor's in Business Administration, she entered a world rocked by financial crisis. The real estate market was in ruins. While others fled, Sarina saw an opportunity. Her first job was as an assistant at a beleaguered brokerage, where she learned the industry from the ground up\u2014navigating short sales, foreclosures, and the palpable fear of clients. This trial-by-fire forged her into a calm, insightful, and unsentimental agent.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade later. After becoming a top agent at a major firm, she felt constrained. She cashed in her investments, earned her broker\u2019s license, and founded Nazari Properties, a boutique agency specializing in legacy San Francisco homes.\n\nToday, Sarina lives a life she meticulously constructed. Her apartment in the Marina is a short, 0.8-mile walk from her office on Union Street. Her days start with a run along the waterfront toward the Golden Gate Bridge, followed by coffee at a local cafe where she knows the baristas by name. Her life is her work, but she thrives on it. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of other professionals, and though recently single after a long-term relationship ended, she is fiercely independent.\n\nSarina feels intrinsically connected to San Francisco; she sells not just properties, but a piece of the city's soul. Her dream is to expand her brokerage, creating a mentorship program for young women entering the field. For herself, she hopes one day to find the time to buy and restore a classic Victorian home, not for a client, but for herself\u2014a permanent anchor in the city she has made her own."

They were crying, but Sarina methodically walked them through the final paperwork. As they left, Mrs. Garcia squeezed her hand and thanked her for being so calm. In that moment, Sarina understood her purpose wasn't to feel the panic with her clients, but to be the unwavering anchor in their storm. That \"unsentimental\" resolve became her greatest asset.\n\n2.\nAt thirteen, her aunt let her run the register at the market alone for the first time. A man tried to haggle aggressively over the price of saffron, speaking rapid-fire Farsi. Sarina held her ground, calmly repeating the price her aunt had set. He eventually paid, grumbling but impressed. The small victory felt enormous. It wasn't about the money; it was the quiet thrill of earning respect. That day, she learned that negotiation was a language, and she was determined to become fluent.\n\n3.\nThe day the sign for \u201cNazari Properties\u201d was installed on Union Street, she didn't celebrate with champagne. Instead, after the workers left, she stood across the street in the evening light and just looked at her name in clean, gold letters. It felt heavier and more real than any commission check. It wasn't just a business; it was a promise to her parents and to herself\u2014a legacy built not from fleeing a home, but from creating them for others.\n\n4.\nHer first run after the breakup was brutal. She pushed herself hard along the waterfront, her lungs burning, trying to outrun the hollow feeling in her chest. She stopped, gasping for air near Fort Mason, and stared at the unwavering structure of the Golden Gate Bridge. A wave of profound calm washed over her. The bridge was constant, her city was constant, and she would be too. She realized her independence wasn't a consolation prize; it was the foundation she had built for herself.\n\n5.\nWalking home through Pacific Heights last fall, she saw it: a grand, neglected Victorian with a sagging porch and peeling paint. She stopped, not seeing a teardown or a flip, but a future. She could practically feel the smooth grain of a restored banister under her hand. For the first time, her dream of owning a piece of the city wasn't an abstract goal, but a tangible, visceral ache. It was a promise of a final, permanent anchor for herself."
