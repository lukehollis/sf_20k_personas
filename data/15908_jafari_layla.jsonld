Her early childhood was one of relative comfort, but the world shifted beneath her feet with the 1979 Revolution. At seven years old, she, her parents, and her older brother fled, carrying little more than their education and memories. They settled in Berkeley, where her father, a former engineer, drove a taxi, and her mother, a literature lover, cleaned houses. Their resilience and constant emphasis on community support instilled in Layla a profound sense of duty to those navigating displacement and hardship.\n\nThis foundation guided her to San Francisco State University, where she pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work. Her first job was as a caseworker in the Mission District, a role that immersed her in the complex realities of immigrant families struggling with language barriers, healthcare access, and cultural integration. She saw her own family's story reflected in every case. Over two decades, Layla\u2019s sharp intellect and deep empathy saw her rise from the front lines to leadership. Today, as a Community Health Program Manager, she develops and oversees programs that provide crucial support to non-English-speaking families, ensuring they can navigate the city\u2019s educational and medical systems.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce twelve years ago. The amicable split from a man who didn\u2019t share her deep-seated passion for service solidified her path, making her work not just a career, but her life\u2019s purpose. Her greatest pride is her son, Amir, now a junior at UC Davis.\n\nLayla lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its quiet streets and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her daily routine is grounded. She takes the 38-Geary bus to her office near the Embarcadero, a 2.5-mile journey she uses for reading or simply observing the city wake up. Evenings involve cooking simple, fragrant Persian meals, video-calling Amir, and meeting with her close-knit circle of friends\u2014other professional women from immigrant backgrounds. Her hope is not for wealth, but to see the programs she built become self-sustaining. She dreams of her son finding a fulfilling life and, perhaps one day, of traveling to Iran to walk the streets of her childhood in peace."

The scent of her father\u2019s cologne couldn't mask the fear. Tucked in her pocket was a small, smooth rock from their garden, a final piece of Tehran. On the plane, looking at the disappearing lights, she didn't cry. A silent, heavy weight settled in her chest\u2014the first seed of understanding what it means to lose a world. It was a weight she would dedicate her life to lifting for others.\n\n2.\nAt eleven, she sometimes rode shotgun in her father's Berkeley taxi. The air freshener smelled of pine, a world away from jasmine. She watched him, a former engineer, carefully navigate the hills, his accent gentle as he spoke with passengers. One afternoon, he helped an elderly woman with her groceries, refusing a tip. His quiet dignity in that simple act taught her more than any book: purpose wasn\u2019t found in a title, but in the service you provided to the person right in front of you.\n\n3.\nIn her first year as a caseworker, a Guatemalan mother wept in her tiny Mission office, clutching a sick child. Layla spent four hours on the phone, navigating a maze of bureaucracy to secure a doctor's appointment. When she finally handed the mother the confirmation slip, the woman\u2019s look of profound relief was not just a professional victory. It felt like mending a tiny crack in her own seven-year-old heart, a powerful affirmation that this was exactly where she was meant to be.\n\n4.\nTwelve years ago, she spent the first night alone in her Inner Richmond apartment. The silence was deafening after her marriage ended. Unpacking, her hands found a framed photo of her parents in Berkeley, their faces worn but resolute. Looking at them, then around at her own empty rooms, she felt not loneliness, but a quiet clarity. Her work wasn't a job she did alongside her life; it was her life. This was the path, and she would walk it for herself and for Amir.\n\n5.\nLast week, on a video call, Amir described a volunteer project at UC Davis, helping farmworker families access legal aid. Layla listened, her heart swelling with a quiet, fierce pride. She saw her father\u2019s gentle resilience and her own life\u2019s work reflected in her son\u2019s earnest face. It wasn't about him following in her footsteps, but about the values taking root in new soil. This, she realized with a rush of emotion, was the self-sustaining program she had always dreamed of building."
