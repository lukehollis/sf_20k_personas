            "value": "Kenji Rodriguez\u2019s name tells the story of his parents: a quiet, second-generation Japanese-American father who worked as a handyman, and a vibrant Mexican-American mother who was a line cook. Raised in the working-class suburbs south of San Francisco, Kenji\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two cultures, defined more by practicality than tradition. He inherited his father\u2019s talent for fixing things and his mother\u2019s steady, uncomplaining work ethic. School was a place he endured, not one where he excelled; his mind worked best with tangible problems, like a sputtering engine or a leaky pipe, not abstract equations.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma. College was a distant, expensive dream that felt irrelevant to his skills. He started working alongside his father, learning the trades firsthand. The major turning point came at age 21, when his father died suddenly from a heart attack. The loss was devastating, and the responsibility to support his mother fell squarely on Kenji\u2019s shoulders. He needed stability, and fast.\n\nA year later, he found it in an unusual offer: a live-in custodian position for a grand, aging apartment building in San Francisco's Richmond District. The job came with a small basement apartment, meaning his commute was a flight of stairs. This move to the city wasn't about ambition; it was about survival.\n\nNow 24, Kenji\u2019s life is governed by the rhythms of the building. His days are a routine of sweeping fog-dampened steps, hauling recycling bins, and troubleshooting the groans of old plumbing. He is a silent observer of the tenants\u2019 lives, a familiar but often invisible presence. His social life is small, consisting of weekly calls to his mother and occasional beers with an old friend who lives in the Mission.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intensely hyperlocal. He doesn't see the skyline; he sees the cracked sidewalk he needs to report and the single window in his apartment that catches the afternoon light. In quiet moments, after the building has settled for the night, Kenji sketches plans in a worn notebook. He dreams not of wealth, but of independence: starting his own handyman business, \"Rodriguez & Son Repairs,\" a tribute to his father. Every dollar he saves is a slow, steady step toward turning his inherited skills into a future he can truly call his own."
