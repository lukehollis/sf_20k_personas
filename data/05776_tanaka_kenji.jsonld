A fourth-generation Japanese American, he was raised in the quiet, achievement-oriented suburbs of the South Bay. His family, who had rebuilt their lives after his great-grandparents\u2019 internment during WWII, envisioned a lucrative tech career for him. But Kenji was drawn to the hushed stories of his grandfather, a man who rarely spoke of the camps but whose quiet resilience and deep sense of community justice shaped Kenji\u2019s worldview.\n\nWhile his peers pursued computer science at prestigious universities, Kenji felt a pull toward the complex human fabric of the city. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially undeclared, but a volunteer opportunity in the Tenderloin changed everything. Witnessing the systemic neglect and the incredible fortitude of the residents, he found his purpose. He pursued and earned a Master of Social Work (MSW), turning his back on the comfortable future his parents had planned.\n\nThe key turning point was securing a position as a case manager for a supportive housing non-profit in the Tenderloin. To fully commit, he moved into an apartment in the building adjacent to his office. His life and work became one. His days are a whirlwind of crisis management, connecting clients with medical care, addiction services, and navigating the labyrinth of city bureaucracy.\n\nHis personal life is quiet. Relationships are difficult to maintain when your work is a 24/7 mental commitment. His closest friends are fellow social workers who understand the emotional toll. To decompress, Kenji practices street photography, finding stark beauty and dignity in the faces and cityscapes others ignore. His small apartment is filled with thriving houseplants, a small act of nurturing life amidst the chaos.\n\nKenji dreams not of escape, but of deeper impact. He aspires to develop a community arts program within his non-profit, using photography to help residents tell their own stories. For him, San Francisco isn't the gleaming tech hub of his upbringing; it\u2019s the gritty, resilient, and profoundly human neighborhood he calls home, where every small victory is a hard-won triumph."
