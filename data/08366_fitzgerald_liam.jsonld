The son of a union longshoreman and a stoic homemaker, he grew up in a household where love was shown through reliable provision, not emotional expression. The unspoken rule was to keep your troubles to yourself, a difficult task when his younger sister began a long and painful battle with addiction in her teens. It was a compassionate, perceptive social worker who finally broke through the family's wall of silence, an experience that planted a seed in Liam. He realized that understanding and navigating human suffering was a true calling.\n\nAfter earning a BA in Psychology from UMass, he pursued a Master of Social Work at Boston University, determined to be the person his family had so desperately needed. In his late twenties, feeling constrained by the familiar East Coast landscape, he moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation for progressive values and social innovation. He found work as a clinical social worker within a large hospital system, dedicating himself to patients and families grappling with catastrophic diagnoses and end-of-life decisions.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. The cumulative weight of his career\u2014the second-hand trauma and emotional labor\u2014had created a chasm in his marriage that they couldn't bridge. The experience left him humbled and more deeply attuned to the complexities of human connection. The recent shift to a permanent remote work model cemented his place in his Inner Sunset apartment, turning his commute to zero.\n\nNow 45, Liam\u2019s life is a quiet rhythm. Mornings are for telehealth sessions from his small home office, providing counsel through a screen. Afternoons are for decompressing with long, solitary walks through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, his constant backyard. He is a familiar face at his local coffee shop and the corner pub, preferring the low-key community of his neighborhood over the city's flashier scenes. Though content, he quietly hopes to find a lasting partnership again and dreams of one day transitioning to a small private practice, giving him the space to continue his vital work with a greater sense of personal balance."
