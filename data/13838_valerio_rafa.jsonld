The only son of a pragmatic Filipino engineer and a free-spirited white art teacher, he grew up in the San Jose suburbs navigating the dual influences of logic and creativity. While he respected his father's Silicon Valley career, he was drawn to his mother\u2019s world of color, form, and emotional resonance. This duality defined his path.\n\nFeeling creatively stifled after his undergraduate studies, Rafa left the South Bay for San Francisco, enrolling in a graduate program at California College of the Arts. He earned a Master's in Design Strategy, a degree that perfectly blended his analytical mind with his artistic soul. This was his turning point; San Francisco felt like home in a way San Jose never had. He shed his suburban skin and embraced the city's vibrant, demanding energy.\n\nUpon graduating, he landed a coveted role as the Brand Experience Manager for a high-end, sustainable apparel company. His current life is a testament to his success: he lives in a chic company-owned apartment directly above the brand's flagship store in Hayes Valley. His commute is a 0.0-mile walk downstairs. His daily routine is a seamless flow between Zoom calls in his sunlit living room and hands-on work in the retail space below, orchestrating product launches and in-store events.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow creatives, built on a foundation of gallery openings, pop-up dinners, and weekend trips to Muir Woods. Yet, his immersive work-life arrangement contributed to the end of his last serious relationship, leaving a quiet void. At 32, Rafa is at the peak of his professional game, yet he sometimes feels a pang of loneliness an perfectly arranged succulent can't fill. He aspires to become the company's global brand director, but also quietly hopes to build a future with someone who understands that for him, passion isn't just a job\u2014it\u2019s the entire architecture of his life."
