From the window of her Nob Hill apartment, which doubles as her office, the city unfolds like a living canvas. This serene existence, however, was hard-won. Born in Fremont to Indian immigrant parents who preached the gospel of engineering and medicine, Aanya\u2019s childhood was a quiet rebellion. She\u2019d spend hours in the library, losing herself not in textbooks, but in oversized books of Renaissance paintings and modern sculpture.\n\nTo appease her family, she earned a practical degree in Economics from Berkeley, but her heart was never in it. The true turning point came when she defied her parents\u2019 wishes and used her savings to pursue a Master's in Art History from the Sotheby's Institute in New York. The decision created a painful rift, but it set her on her authentic path. She cut her teeth in the demanding gallery scene of Chelsea, developing a formidable eye for spotting undervalued artists and a reputation for her calm, incisive negotiation style.\n\nAfter a decade on the East Coast, a lucrative offer to become a senior consultant brought her back to the Bay Area, but this time on her own terms\u2014in San Francisco. The city\u2019s blend of tech wealth and bohemian history provided the perfect market for her skills. Her success, now undeniable, slowly mended the relationship with her parents, who saw her featured in industry magazines.\n\nNow 47, Aanya\u2019s days are a mix of solitude and social engagement. Mornings are for research and calls, her apartment silent save for the hum of the city. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings at the Minnesota Street Project or intimate dinners with the close-knit circle of artists, curators, and collectors she calls her chosen family. Though fiercely independent after a difficult divorce in her thirties, she is deeply connected to her community. Her ultimate dream is to leverage her network to create a foundation that provides grants to emerging Bay Area artists, especially women of color. For Aanya, art was once an escape; now, she aspires to make it a gateway for others."
