His parents, an engineer and a librarian in Russia, found work as a handyman and a cleaner, pouring their hopes into their only son. Growing up surrounded by the Cyrillic signs and rye bread scents of Geary Boulevard, Dmitry was a bridge between two worlds. He was a dutiful son who spoke Russian at home, but in his room, he dismantled old radios and VCRs, obsessed with understanding how things worked.\n\nThis practical fascination guided his education. While his parents dreamed of him attending a UC school, the financial reality of immigrant life led him to a more pragmatic path. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It wasn\u2019t the prestigious engineering degree his father had, but it was a solid, hands-on foundation. Upon graduating, he was hired as an engineering technician at a mid-size robotics firm, a perfect fit for his skills in diagnostics and prototyping.\n\nA key turning point was his company\u2019s shift to a distributed hardware model during the pandemic. Dmitry thrived. He converted the small second bedroom of his Inner Richmond apartment into a meticulous workshop, neatly organized with soldering irons, oscilloscopes, and bins of components. His 0.0-mile commute became a source of deep comfort. His days are now structured and solitary: he wakes, drinks strong black tea, and begins testing circuits or assembling prototypes for the engineers he communicates with solely over Slack.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few trusted friends from childhood and weekly dinners with his aging parents. His dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day open his own small electronics repair and custom-build shop in the neighborhood\u2014a place where his tangible skills can serve the community he knows. For Dmitry, San Francisco isn't a city of disruption and IPOs; it's the foggy, familiar streets of the Richmond, the hum of his workbench, and the quiet satisfaction of making something work perfectly."
