            "value": "Adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese-American family, Caleb Leung\u2019s upbringing in the Sunset District was a unique blend of cultures. While he didn't share his parents' features, he shared their home, their language of Cantonese phrases mixed with English, and their Sunday tradition of dim sum on Clement Street. He was the white face in family photos, a gentle outsider on the inside, which taught him from a young age to observe and adapt. This duality defined him: Caleb, the all-American name, and Leung, the name that connected him to a heritage he embraced as his own.\n\nHe was a pragmatic student, choosing a business degree from San Francisco State University as a direct path to stability in a city known for its volatility. His parents, a postal worker and a seamstress, had preached the value of a secure career, and finance seemed the surest bet. He interned at a commercial real estate firm during his junior year and was hooked\u2014not by the glamour, but by the tangible impact of the numbers. He saw how financial models on a screen became steel and glass towers that reshaped the skyline he grew up watching.\n\nUpon graduating, he landed his analyst position. Now, his days are spent in a Financial District high-rise, deconstructing deals and assessing risk for multi-million dollar properties. His 3.8-mile commute on the N Judah from his Inner Richmond apartment is a daily reminder of the city's changing landscape. He passes the Victorians he loves, now selling for astronomical sums he calculates at work. This is his central conflict: he is a native San Franciscan whose job facilitates the very gentrification that pushes out families like the ones he grew up with.\n\nHis social life is a comfortable mix of college friends and his long-term girlfriend, Maya, a landscape architecture student who grounds him. His dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to afford a piece of the city that raised him\u2014perhaps a small condo in his old neighborhood. Caleb\u2019s ambition is to one day use his financial acumen not just for corporate profit, but to help build sustainable, community-focused housing. He hopes to reconcile the two halves of his life: the native son who loves his city\u2019s soul and the analyst who understands its unforgiving market."

A new waiter approached and asked his mother in Cantonese if Caleb was a friend\u2019s son. Without hesitation, she replied, \u201cG\u00f3 hai ng\u00f3h go j\u00e1i\u201d\u2014*That is my son*\u2014pulling his chair closer to her. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t an outsider. He was hers. That fierce, possessive love became the bedrock of his identity, teaching him that family was a bond of belonging, not biology. This occurred in his childhood.\n\n2.  During his junior year internship, he stood on a muddy SoMa construction site, holding a spreadsheet. He looked from the financial projections on the paper up to the massive steel skeleton rising against the gray sky. It was a jolt of connection\u2014the abstract numbers he manipulated in an office were becoming a physical piece of the city. It wasn't about wealth; it was about tangible creation. That feeling solidified his career path, giving his pragmatic choice an unexpected sense of purpose. This occurred in college.\n\n3.  Riding the N Judah home last spring, he overheard an elderly woman, a *poh poh*, speaking on the phone. Her Cantonese was the same as his mother's, her voice laced with weary resignation about her building being sold. He instinctively looked down at the deal memos in his own bag, which outlined the profitable eviction of tenants just like her. A wave of shame and hypocrisy washed over him. This moment made his internal conflict painfully real, planting the seed of needing to do something different. This occurred last year.\n\n4.  On their fire escape a few months ago, he watched Maya sketch a design for a community garden. She spoke passionately about plants that would attract native bees and benches placed for elderly residents. Her focus wasn't on return on investment, but on human experience. Listening to her, the noise of his financial models quieted in his head. Her values felt like an anchor in the turbulent waters of his career, reminding him that spaces were ultimately for people, not just for profit. This occurred recently.\n\n5.  At his parents' house for dinner last month, his father lamented that another legacy business in the Sunset was being replaced by a high-end chain. Instead of just nodding, Caleb found himself explaining co-op ownership models and how community land trusts worked. He saw a flicker of pride in his father\u2019s eyes\u2014not of full understanding, but of recognition that Caleb\u2019s esoteric financial world could be a tool for preservation. It was the first time he truly believed he could one day bridge his two selves. This occurred last month."
