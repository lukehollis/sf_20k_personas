The daughter of Indian immigrants who found success in Silicon Valley's tech boom, Priya grew up in a home that valued stability, academic rigor, and a career in engineering or medicine. However, her path diverged early on. Witnessing her younger brother struggle with an undiagnosed learning disability and the bureaucratic indifference of their school system ignited a fire in her. She saw how easily people could fall through the cracks and felt a pull not toward code, but toward community.\n\nDefying her parents' well-intentioned plans, she enrolled in the Social Work program at San Francisco State University. The city was an awakening\u2014a vibrant, chaotic mosaic of humanity that stood in stark contrast to Fremont's tidy uniformity. After earning her Bachelor's, she worked for several years in case management before returning to get her Master's and complete the rigorous process of becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).\n\nA key turning point was landing her current role, providing counseling to at-risk students at a public high school in the Mission District. This job is the nexus of all her passions and frustrations. It\u2019s demanding, emotionally draining, and doesn't pay what her tech friends make, but the breakthroughs with students provide a profound sense of purpose.\n\nNow 41, Priya lives a deliberately structured life from her cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her mornings start with the rumble of the 5-Fulton Muni bus, a 2.8-mile journey she uses as sacred time to read or listen to podcasts, mentally preparing for the day. Her evenings are for decompression: long walks in Golden Gate Park, cooking simple meals, and connecting with a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow social workers and teachers who understand the unique pressures of their work. Having navigated a few serious relationships that ultimately didn't last, she is currently single and finds deep fulfillment in her independence and close friendships.\n\nPriya feels deeply woven into the fabric of San Francisco. It\u2019s the city that allowed her to forge her own identity. Her quiet aspiration is to one day open a small private practice with a sliding scale, ensuring that adolescents from all backgrounds have access to the kind of support she once fought so hard to find for her brother."

She was 15, holding her brother's hand as a man in a cheap suit spoke of \"laziness, not disability.\" The condescending tone lit a fuse in her. In that stark, fluorescent-lit room, watching her brilliant brother shrink, Priya felt a fierce, protective rage. It wasn't just defiance against her parents she felt then, but against a world that refused to see. That moment became the foundation of her life's work.\n\n2.\nHer first Saturday as an SFSU freshman, she got on the 14-Mission bus alone. The chaotic symphony of Spanish, the smell of pan dulce from a bakery, the vibrant murals flashing past the window\u2014it was an assault on her suburban senses. Instead of feeling scared, she felt a profound sense of coming home. This beautiful, messy, complicated city was a place where everyone, including her, could belong. Fremont felt a world away, and for the first time, that felt right.\n\n3.\nHe was a sophomore who hadn\u2019t spoken a word in her office for months. Then one Tuesday, he slid a drawing across her desk. It was of a small boat in a raging storm, with a tiny lighthouse beam cutting through the darkness. He pointed to the lighthouse, then at her. The lump in Priya's throat was immense. All the bureaucratic headaches and emotional exhaustion of her job dissolved, replaced by the pure, solid weight of purpose that anchored her to that desk, in that school.\n\n4.\nIt was a month after Mark moved out. She found herself walking past the Dutch Windmills, a place they\u2019d loved. The memory stung, but as the salty wind blew in from Ocean Beach, a different feeling settled in: quiet solitude, not loneliness. She realized her happiness wasn\u2019t contingent on another person's presence in her rent-controlled apartment. Her life, like Golden Gate Park, was vast and full on its own. It was a melancholy but liberating peace she carried from that day.\n\n5.\nOn her morning commute last fall, the 5-Fulton lurched to a stop. Priya looked up from her book and saw a teenager at the bus stop, shoulders slumped, staring at their phone with a look of deep anxiety. She saw her brother, and a dozen of her students, in that single posture. The vague idea of a private practice with a sliding scale suddenly sharpened into a clear, urgent mission. It wouldn't just be a job; it would be a sanctuary."
