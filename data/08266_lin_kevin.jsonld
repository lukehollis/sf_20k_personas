The son of Taiwanese immigrants who built a life in Cupertino, Kevin grew up surrounded by the hum of Silicon Valley. His parents, a hardware technician and an assembly line worker, saw a clear path for their son: a STEM degree from a UC school and a stable tech career. Kevin tried to walk it, enrolling in a business program at a community college, but his heart wasn't in spreadsheets. It was in the charcoal sketches he\u2019d hide in his textbooks.\n\nThe turning point came during a final exam he couldn\u2019t bring himself to study for. Realizing he was living a life that wasn't his, he quietly dropped out, packed a single duffel bag, and took the Caltrain to San Francisco. The move created a painful rift with his parents, who saw his choice as a rejection of their sacrifices.\n\nIn the city, Kevin found both struggle and freedom. After months of working as a barista and sharing a cramped apartment, he discovered a small nonprofit offering free after-school art classes to local kids. He started as a volunteer, sweeping floors and prepping paint palettes. His quiet dedication and natural rapport with the children earned him a paid position as a Teacher\u2019s Aide.\n\nNow, Kevin\u2019s life is defined by a 0.0-mile commute. He lives in a small, rent-controlled studio above the very arts center where he works. His days are a chaotic symphony of children\u2019s laughter, the smell of turpentine, and the joyful mess of creation. In the afternoons, he guides small hands as they learn to shape clay or mix colors. At night, his small living space transforms into his personal studio, where he works on his own large, abstract canvases, expressions of the urban energy and inner conflict that fuel him.\n\nHis relationship with his parents remains strained, limited to tense weekly phone calls. His true family is in the Mission: his mentor at the center, the other tenants in his building, and the kids who look up to him. Kevin dreams of one day becoming a lead teacher and proving to his parents\u2014and himself\u2014that a life built around art isn't a failure, but a different, more vibrant, kind of success."
