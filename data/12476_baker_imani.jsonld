Raised in Oakland, she was the daughter of a meticulous city librarian and a free-spirited jazz musician. Her childhood home was a place of organized chaos, filled with the scent of old books and the lingering notes of a saxophone. This eclectic environment nurtured her love for structured narratives and the vibrant, often-overlooked stories within Black culture.\n\nHer path seemed set for academia when she enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a degree in Art History. The turning point came during an internship at a local museum. While archiving physical photographs of the Fillmore District's jazz age, she was struck by how many were deteriorating, their stories fading with each passing year. It wasn\u2019t enough to just study them; she felt a powerful urge to preserve and share them. This revelation pushed her toward the nascent field of digital humanities.\n\nNow 34, Imani is a Digital Collections Curator for a major university\u2019s special collections. Her job is a perfect synthesis of her parents' worlds: she meticulously digitizes and catalogues fragile materials\u2014from protest posters to oral histories\u2014but also crafts compelling online exhibitions that give these artifacts new life. Her daily routine is quintessentially San Franciscan. She takes the MUNI from her Hayes Valley apartment, a short 2.8-mile journey that allows her to people-watch and mentally prepare for the day.\n\nImani\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from the art and tech worlds who appreciate her dry wit. While she enjoys the city's vibrant gallery scene, she often finds solace in analog hobbies, like developing her own film photography. Her connection to San Francisco is deep; she sees herself as a modern-day griot, using technology to safeguard the histories of communities often pushed to the margins by the city's relentless forward march. Her dream is to spearhead a national digital archive dedicated to amplifying the work of underrepresented Black artists, ensuring their legacies are not just preserved, but celebrated for generations to come."

Her father\u2019s saxophone wove a sad, sweet melody through the air, which tasted of dust and old paper from the stacks of books her mother was meticulously cataloguing. In that harmonious chaos, Imani didn't see a conflict between the catalog card and the musical riff; she saw two ways of telling a story. It was the moment she understood that soul could be archived, a belief that would define her life's work.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during her museum internship, she held a photograph from the Fillmore District. A woman in a feathered hat laughed, but a spiderweb of cracks crept across her joyful face. Imani felt a pang of panic, a visceral fear that this story was turning to dust in her hands. It wasn't just history; it was a life about to be erased. In that moment, her academic interest ignited into a fierce, protective mission. She had to save them, not just study them.\n\n3.\nShe was twenty-nine when she launched her first major digital exhibition. Weeks later, an email arrived from the granddaughter of a man featured in one of the digitized oral histories. \"I heard my grandfather's voice for the first time in thirty years,\" it read. Imani sat back, the glow of the monitor illuminating tears in her eyes. The abstract data points on her screen had become a bridge across generations. This profound, human connection was the entire point of her meticulous work.\n\n4.\nJust last year, she was in her small darkroom, the sharp scent of fixer in the air. An image slowly emerged in the tray: an elderly couple she\u2019d photographed sitting on their Hayes Valley stoop. The man\u2019s hand rested on the woman\u2019s, a lifetime of stories etched in their wrinkles. It wasn\u2019t for an archive; it was just for her. The act of capturing that quiet dignity on film felt like a personal prayer, her own small, analog promise to remember the city\u2019s living history.\n\n5.\nRiding the MUNI a few months ago, the train lurched to a stop. In the window, her reflection was superimposed over a mural of jazz musicians on a Fillmore Street wall. For a fleeting second, she saw her father\u2019s profile in her own. She wasn\u2019t just a commuter; she was part of a lineage. He played the music, and now she was protecting its memory. The 2.8-mile journey suddenly felt like a pilgrimage, connecting the notes he played to the history she now guarded."
