Adopted at six months old by a loving, working-class Irish-American couple, he was raised in the foggy suburbs of Daly City. His parents, a plumber and a school secretary, gave him a stable, supportive home, but Kevin always navigated a subtle duality\u2014the Irish name and traditions at home, and the Korean face that looked back at him in the mirror. This experience forged a quiet but intense drive within him, a need to define himself on his own terms and prove his worth beyond any single identity.\n\nHis ambition led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued an Economics degree, fascinated by the systems that governed wealth and opportunity. Kevin began his career in traditional commercial real estate finance in the late 90s, but he watched the dot-com boom with keen interest. The turning point came after the 2008 financial crisis. Seeing the old guard of real estate flounder, he became convinced that technology was the key to unlocking efficiency and reshaping the industry. He pivoted, joining a nascent venture fund and leveraging his financial acumen to identify promising startups in the property technology\u2014or \"PropTech\"\u2014space.\n\nToday, as a Managing Partner, Kevin\u2019s life is a testament to his focused ambition. He lives in a minimalist Pacific Heights condo with sweeping views of the Bay. His days start before dawn with a run along the Marina Green, followed by a rideshare to his Financial District office. His work is all-consuming, a reality that contributed to an amicable divorce years ago. His social life is curated and small, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and old university friends.\n\nKevin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees the city as a dynamic portfolio he is actively helping to shape. His aspiration is no longer about personal wealth, but about legacy\u2014funding the technologies that will define how people live, work, and connect in future cities. He wants to mentor a new generation of founders, ensuring the city that gave him his start remains a beacon of innovation."

His father had just taught him to say, *\u201cL\u00e1 Fh\u00e9ile P\u00e1draig sona duit.\u201d* He practiced in the bathroom mirror, but the Korean face looking back at him didn't match the Gaelic words. For the first time, he felt a profound disconnect\u2014a boy named Donovan who looked like Park Hyun-woo. It wasn't loneliness, but the first spark of a fierce need to build an identity so strong it would contain both worlds, and then some.\n\n2.\nIt was a 2006 partner meeting in a stuffy Montgomery Street office. Kevin, then a junior analyst, presented a model for digitizing lease agreements. The senior partner chuckled, patting his shoulder. \"We close deals on handshakes, son, not clicks.\" Kevin felt a surge of claustrophobia. It wasn\u2019t anger, but a cold certainty that he was standing in a museum. The experience planted the seed: he didn't want to just play the old game; he needed to build a new one entirely.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a walk through SoMa in late 2008. The ghosts of the dot-com bust felt fresh again. \"For Lease\" signs papered over the windows of recently failed startups, the air thick with financial despair. But for Kevin, it was a moment of absolute clarity. The old structures were hollowed out, creating a vacuum. He saw not an end, but a clean slate\u2014a city begging to be rebuilt on a new foundation of technology. He pivoted his career that week.\n\n4.\nThe real turning point wasn't leaving his old job, but closing his first Series A in 2012. It was for a small team automating commercial building management. He shook the founder\u2019s hand in a tiny, cluttered office south of Market. That handshake felt more valuable than any multi-million dollar deal from his past life. It was the exhilarating feeling of being right\u2014not for ego, but for a belief in a smarter future. His conviction had finally found its footing in the real world.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young founder was pitching him. She was brilliant, driven, and Korean-American. As she spoke, Kevin barely heard the numbers; he saw her navigating the same subtle currents of identity he once had. In that moment, his ambition shifted from building a portfolio to building people. He realized his legacy wouldn't be the companies he funded, but the founders he empowered. It was the first time his past and his future felt perfectly, purposefully aligned."
