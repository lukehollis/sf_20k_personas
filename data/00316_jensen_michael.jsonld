Raised in a Minneapolis suburb by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his childhood was stable, predictable, and imbued with a sense of civic duty. He was the kid friends confided in, the one who could patiently listen without judgment, a trait that would define his future.\n\nHe pursued his undergraduate degree in psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but it was a volunteer stint at a crisis hotline that sharpened his calling. The raw, urgent need he encountered on the phone lines convinced him that talk was not cheap; it was a lifeline. This solidified his path, leading him to UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work, drawn by the program's reputation and the Bay Area's progressive approach to mental health.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire. Michael took a demanding job at a major San Francisco public hospital, working with patients facing acute trauma, chronic illness, and systemic neglect. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, and he saw firsthand the burnout that consumed many of his peers. The turning point came with the pandemic. Forced into telehealth, he discovered an unexpected benefit: a calmer, more focused therapeutic environment for both himself and his clients.\n\nNow 40, Michael runs a private practice entirely from his cozy Inner Sunset apartment, his commute a ten-foot walk to his home office. This 0.0-mile journey has granted him a work-life balance he once thought impossible. His days follow a gentle rhythm: a morning walk to a local cafe for coffee, followed by back-to-back virtual sessions. Afternoons are for decompression\u2014long runs through Golden Gate Park or cycling across the bridge into the Marin Headlands. After a long-term relationship ended amicably two years ago, his social life is centered on a small, tight-knit group of friends from his hospital days.\n\nMichael feels deeply rooted in his neighborhood, a quiet village within a bustling city. He aspires to eventually write a book on navigating grief in the healthcare system, a tribute to the patients who taught him his most profound lessons. His dream isn't one of wealth or recognition, but of sustainable purpose: to continue holding space for others' pain while diligently tending to his own peace."
