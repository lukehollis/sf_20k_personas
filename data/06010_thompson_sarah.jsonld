Born in Fremont to a software engineer father from Ohio and a food scientist mother from Mumbai, her childhood was a vibrant mix of Midwest practicality and Indian tradition. She grew up navigating the space between Christmas and Diwali, her palate shaped equally by her father\u2019s barbecue and her mother\u2019s fragrant curries. This bicultural upbringing fostered in her a unique ability to observe, adapt, and find harmony in contrasts.\n\nThe turning point that set her life\u2019s course came at sixteen during a family trip to India. While she was enchanted by the culture, she was horrified by the visible environmental degradation\u2014a once-sacred river choked with industrial runoff near her mother\u2019s ancestral village. The image seared into her mind, transforming a passive interest in nature into an urgent calling. She pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master\u2019s in Environmental Management, determined to be part of the solution.\n\nAfter a few years at a large corporate firm where she felt like a cog in a greenwashing machine, Sarah struck out on her own. As an independent environmental consultant, she now works from her bright, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet start to her day, usually with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park before diving into complex land use reports and sustainability audits for her clients.\n\nHer last name, Thompson, is a remnant of a brief marriage in her late twenties\u2014a relationship that taught her valuable lessons about her own independence and what she truly wants in a partner. Now, her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends, a monthly book club, and exploring the culinary landscape of Clement Street. San Francisco, for Sarah, is the perfect ecosystem: a city at the forefront of environmental policy, with wild, natural beauty just steps from her door. She dreams of one day moving from consulting on individual projects to shaping broader environmental policy, ensuring that the balance between the urban and the wild she cherishes is protected for generations to come."
