The only child of immigrants from Taiwan, he grew up in a home filled with the quiet but immense pressure to achieve a specific version of the American Dream: a stable, high-status career in engineering or medicine. Dutifully, Wei enrolled at San Francisco State University to study computer science, a path chosen more by his parents\u2019 hopes than his own passion. He was competent but uninspired, finding more satisfaction in organizing study groups than in debugging code.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life arrived during his sophomore year when his father suffered a major stroke. The long recovery and mounting medical bills forced Wei to drop out of college and find full-time work to support his family. He took an entry-level administrative assistant job at a small consulting firm downtown. It was there, amidst spreadsheets and scheduling conflicts, that Wei discovered his true talent: he was a natural at creating order out of chaos. He possessed an innate ability to manage personalities, anticipate needs, and streamline processes, making himself indispensable.\n\nOver two decades, he built a career not on a degree, but on demonstrable competence. Now 41, he is the highly respected Office Manager for a biotech research firm. Since the pandemic, his position has become fully remote, his commute shrinking to the few steps from his bedroom to his small home office in the same Sunset apartment he\u2019s lived in for years.\n\nHis daily routine is one of quiet discipline. Mornings begin with a walk to Ocean Beach, watching the surfers before logging on. His social life is intentional, centered around a tight-knit group of friends from high school. They meet for weekly dim sum in the Richmond or hikes in the Marin Headlands. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, he has remained single, content but open to connection.\n\nWei no longer chases the dream his parents had for him. His aspiration is to finally use his savings to visit Taiwan, to see the places his parents described but he has never known. He hopes to one day find a partner who values his quiet stability over flashy ambition, someone to share the simple pleasure of watching the fog roll in over the city he has always called home."
