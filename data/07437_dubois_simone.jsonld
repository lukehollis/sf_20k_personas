At 25, she is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist, navigating the demanding path toward licensure in a city that asks for everything you have.\n\nRaised in Portland, Oregon, Simone was the only child of two literature professors\u2014parents who provided a world of intellectual stimulation but were often emotionally distant. Family dinners were Socratic seminars, not confessionals. This quiet void of unexpressed feeling fueled her fascination with the hidden mechanics of human connection, leading her to pursue psychology as an undergraduate. Seeking both a top-tier MFT program and a definitive break from her muted upbringing, she moved to San Francisco to earn her master's degree.\n\nThe move was a profound turning point. The city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy was the perfect antidote to her structured childhood. However, her second year of grad school was marked by a painful breakup that nearly derailed her studies. Instead, it became her crucible, transforming abstract therapeutic theories into raw, lived experience. The event solidified her resolve, giving her empathy a new depth and her career choice an unshakeable sense of purpose.\n\nNow, her days are a structured blend of self-care and professional duty. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life and work are deeply intertwined. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe for a latte, a ritual that creates a crucial boundary before she returns to her apartment for back-to-back telehealth sessions with clients. Her social life is small but vital, consisting mostly of fellow MFT associates who understand the unique pressures of their work. They meet for dinner in the Mission or walks through Golden Gate Park, decompressing from the emotional weight they carry.\n\nSimone\u2019s primary dream is to complete her 3,000 supervised hours and become a licensed therapist. Beyond that, she aspires to open a small private practice specializing in relational anxiety among young adults. She loves San Francisco for its acceptance of complexity\u2014in culture, identity, and spirit. For Simone, building a life here isn't just about professional success; it's about honoring the journey that taught her how to help others find their own way."
