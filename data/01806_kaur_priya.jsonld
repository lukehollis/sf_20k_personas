Born to Punjabi immigrant parents in Fresno, her upbringing was a mix of traditional values and the relentless pursuit of the American dream. Her parents, who ran a small convenience store, pushed her toward a stable, respectable career. To please them, Priya earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration, a practical choice that felt entirely alien to her warm, nurturing spirit.\n\nShe spent six years as an administrative assistant in a downtown Fresno office, the silence of the cubicles a stark contrast to the lively, boisterous family gatherings of her youth. The turning point came not as a grand epiphany, but as a quiet realization while caring for her sister\u2019s newborn son. The simple act of comforting a crying baby and celebrating his first clumsy steps filled her with a profound sense of purpose that her spreadsheets never could. At 29, she quit her job, a move that disappointed her parents but liberated her soul.\n\nPriya moved to San Francisco, drawn by the promise of anonymity and reinvention. She enrolled in early childhood education courses at a community college and, through sheer luck, found both a job and a home in the same place. She became the assistant teacher at a small preschool on the ground floor of a classic Art Deco apartment building, and managed to secure a rent-controlled studio apartment on the third floor. This cemented her unique 0.0-mile commute.\n\nNow at 45, Priya\u2019s daily life is a comforting routine. She wakes to the distant sound of the N-Judah streetcar, walks downstairs to a world of finger paints and story time, and ends her day reading by her bay window overlooking the neighborhood. Her social life is woven into her community; she\u2019s on a first-name basis with the grocer, the librarian, and every parent who drops off a child. Though she never married, her life is full of love from the dozen toddlers in her charge. Her dream is to one day earn her lead teacher certification, though the cost is a significant hurdle. She holds a quiet hope of one day running her own small, in-home daycare, a safe and gentle haven in the heart of the bustling city she has made her own."
