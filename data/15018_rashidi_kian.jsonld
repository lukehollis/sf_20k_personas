Born in Shiraz, Iran, to an architect father and a university librarian mother, his early childhood was filled with the scent of jasmine and the intricate patterns of Persian gardens. This idyllic world fractured in 1979. At age six, he watched the foundations of his society crumble during the Islamic Revolution. His secular, intellectual parents saw no future for their family and fled, eventually settling in Berkeley, California, with little more than their education and a profound sense of displacement.\n\nThis formative experience of losing a home defined Kian\u2019s path. He excelled in school, driven by a quiet intensity, and was drawn to the systems that make cities work\u2014or fail. He earned his undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies and a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, focusing on how to build resilient, equitable urban spaces. He wasn't just choosing a career; he was trying to understand how to prevent the kind of societal collapse he had witnessed.\n\nUpon graduating, Kian was drawn to San Francisco's complex urban fabric and progressive ideals. He began his career as a junior planner and steadily rose through the ranks. Now a Principal Environmental Planner, he tackles the city\u2019s existential threats\u2014sea-level rise, seismic instability, and sustainable infrastructure. His 5.5-mile commute from his Inner Sunset home is a daily ritual of his principles: a bicycle ride to the N-Judah Muni line, book in hand, followed by a walk to his downtown office.\n\nKian shares his life with his wife, Lena, a landscape architect he met during a collaborative city greening project. They are a well-known pair in their community, their shared passion for public spaces blending seamlessly into their personal life. Weekends are spent hiking in the Marin Headlands or tending to their garden, a small but vibrant echo of the courtyards Kian remembers from his youth. His deepest aspiration is not promotion or wealth, but legacy. He hopes to leave behind a San Francisco that is more prepared, more green, and more enduring\u2014a permanent home to replace the one he was forced to leave behind."

Kian, six years old, didn't understand the hurried whispers or his mother's tear-streaked face. He only knew the garden, his world, was shrinking with the rising smoke. It was his first, indelible lesson in how quickly a foundation can turn to dust. That memory became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work: to build what could not be burned.\n\n2.\nOctober 17, 1989. He was a student at Berkeley when the ground began to roar. The Loma Prieta earthquake. For 15 seconds, the world felt as fragile as it had in Shiraz. The terror was familiar, but the aftermath was different. He watched reports of neighbors helping neighbors, of a city vowing to rebuild stronger. The abstract threat he studied became visceral, and his quiet academic drive ignited into a passionate, urgent mission. He knew then that San Francisco was where he had to be.\n\n3.\nIt was a blustery afternoon on a windswept patch of land slated for a new park. He saw her before they were introduced. Lena, a landscape architect, was kneeling, her hand tracing the curve of the land in a sketchbook, oblivious to the wind whipping her hair. In that gesture, he recognized the same instinct he felt: a desire not to impose on a place, but to understand and strengthen it. He felt a profound sense of recognition, the feeling of finding a partner to help build a home.\n\n4.\nThe first time he rode his bike down the Wiggle and saw the newly installed bioswales\u2014his project\u2014actually absorbing a winter downpour, he stopped. Rainwater, instead of flooding the street, was nourishing native plants. Commuters cycled past, unaware of the complex hydrology and political battles beneath their wheels. For Kian, it was a quiet, monumental victory. It was proof that his work could create pockets of resilience, small systems of defense against chaos. He felt a deep, anchoring satisfaction that day, a sense of purpose fulfilled.\n\n5.\nLast Sunday, kneeling in his Inner Sunset garden, he watched Lena prune a climbing rose. The fog was rolling in, muffling the city's sounds. He gently packed soil around a new lavender plant, the scent a faint ghost of his childhood. In this small, cultivated space\u2014a world they had built together\u2014he felt a quiet, profound sense of permanence. It wasn't the grand legacy of a completed seawall, but a tangible piece of home. A safe harbor, finally, after a lifetime of seeking one."
