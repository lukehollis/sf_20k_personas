Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants, his childhood was a vibrant mix of Californian suburbia and the rich traditions of his heritage. His parents, an engineer and a school administrator, pushed for a stable, conventional path. Rohan dutifully enrolled in a business program at San Jose State, but the lectures felt colorless compared to the sacred alchemy he witnessed in his mother\u2019s kitchen\u2014the blooming of mustard seeds in hot oil, the precise folding of a samosa.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. He dropped out, a decision that fractured his relationship with his father for nearly a decade. Rohan moved to San Francisco, taking a punishing job as a dishwasher in a classic French restaurant in North Beach. He was invisible, but he watched, learned, and absorbed everything. He worked his way up the line, from prep cook to sous chef, mastering European techniques while privately dreaming of applying them to the flavors of his youth.\n\nAfter fifteen years of disciplined saving and a small, reluctantly-given loan from an uncle, he found a modest, defunct taqueria in the Mission District. He poured his life into it, living in the small apartment directly upstairs. He named it \"Tarkari,\" and it became his sanctuary and his stage.\n\nNow, at 47, Rohan\u2019s daily routine is a ritual. He\u2019s at the Alemany Farmers Market by 7 AM, his hands selecting the freshest seasonal produce. His \"commute\" is a flight of stairs down to his kitchen, where he and his tight-knit staff\u2014his chosen family\u2014prepare for service. His food is a reflection of his journey: seasonal Californian ingredients transformed by traditional Indian spices. He\u2019s a neighborhood fixture, known for his intense focus during service and his warm, quiet presence at the bar after closing.\n\nRohan\u2019s dream is singular: to earn a Michelin star. Not for fame, but as the ultimate validation for his unconventional path. He hopes to one day hand the reins to his talented sous chef, but for now, he finds his purpose in the nightly buzz of the dining room, a testament to the life he built from scratch, one perfect plate at a time."

It was a perfect, triangular seal. He didn't just see a snack being made; he saw a sacred geometry, a preservation of home. The scent of turmeric and cumin was more real than any textbook. In that moment, he understood that his true inheritance wasn't a degree, but this craft, this legacy of flavor. It silently cemented his path.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, standing in the living room, the words \"I'm dropping out\" hung in the air like smoke. His father, an engineer who measured success in calculated certainties, simply stared. The silence was worse than shouting. It was a deep, shattering disappointment that broke something between them. Leaving home that day, Rohan felt a terrifying freedom. It was the decision that cost him a father but gave him a future, fueling a desperate need to prove his sacrifice was worth the profound loss.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-one, buried in steam at the dishwasher station in North Beach. In the chaos of service, he reached for a pan just off the stove. The searing pain across his palm was instant, but the chef didn't even look up. In that moment of complete invisibility, Rohan felt strangely initiated. It wasn't a glorious start, but a baptism by fire. It was the price of admission, a scar that taught him the brutal, unspoken respect the kitchen demands from the bottom up.\n\n4.\nThirty-six years old, holding the keys to the defunct taqueria. He stood alone inside, the air thick with the dust of someone else's failed dream. For a terrifying second, the weight of his uncle\u2019s loan and fifteen years of brutal work threatened to crush him. But then, a wave of pure resolve washed over him as he pictured his own sign. This rundown Mission space wasn't an end; it was his blank canvas. This was the moment his life finally, truly, became his own.\n\n5.\nHe was forty. His father, who hadn\u2019t visited in years, walked into Tarkari one quiet Tuesday. Rohan\u2019s heart hammered as he sent out a plate of his fenugreek-dusted halibut. He watched from the pass as his father took a bite, chewed slowly, and closed his eyes. After a long moment, the older man gave a single, deliberate nod. No words were needed. In that silent gesture, a decade of fracture was healed. It remains the only review that has ever truly mattered."
