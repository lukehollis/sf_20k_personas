The son of a quiet, disciplined Filipino father who served three decades in the U.S. Navy and a vibrant, storytelling Irish-American mother from South Boston, William grew up in San Diego feeling like a fascinating composite of cultures, but never wholly one or the other. This sense of existing on the periphery fueled his early passion for the arts, a realm where unique perspectives were assets.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor of Fine Arts, excelling as a painter. However, a key turning point came during his final thesis show. He found more joy and purpose in organizing the exhibition, writing the catalog descriptions, and helping his peers articulate their vision than he did in seeing his own work on the wall. He realized his calling wasn't creation, but curation and advocacy. This led him to San Francisco and a Master\u2019s degree in Curatorial Practice from the California College of the Arts.\n\nNow 48, William is the Department Manager for a respected non-profit arts foundation in SOMA. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his integrated life; he lives in a spacious live/work loft two floors above the foundation\u2019s main gallery. His days are a structured blend of chaos and calm: morning coffee while answering emails from artists, grant-writing sessions, followed by afternoon studio visits and planning meetings for upcoming shows.\n\nA long-term relationship ended five years ago, a painful but clarifying event that prompted him to pour his energy into his work and his community. His social circle is a tight-knit group of artists, writers, and gallery owners who gather for potlucks in his loft. He thrives in his SOMA neighborhood, loving the grit of the old warehouses standing defiant against encroaching tech offices. He finds peace in solo walks to Yerba Buena Gardens. William\u2019s primary aspiration is to launch a major fellowship for emerging artists from mixed-heritage and underrepresented backgrounds, creating the platform for others that he wished he\u2019d had. He wants his legacy to be not the art he made, but the artists he helped thrive."

Then his father, quiet in his civvies after a week at sea, brought out a small plate of lumpia he\u2019d fried. The combination wasn't confusing; it was just... home. In that moment, he didn't feel between worlds, but like he was the bridge connecting them. It was his first subconscious lesson in how disparate elements could create a perfect, harmonious exhibition.\n\n2.\nAt his BFA thesis show, he barely looked at his own canvases. Instead, he saw a friend floundering, unable to articulate the brilliant concept behind her sculptures to a gallerist. William stepped in, effortlessly translating her raw passion into a compelling narrative. The look of relief on her face, the spark of understanding in the gallerist\u2019s eyes\u2014that feeling of connection was a greater high than any brushstroke. In that instant, he wasn\u2019t a painter anymore. He was a conduit. It was a profound, life-altering relief.\n\n3.\nSoon after moving to SF for his Master's, he took a solo walk on a crisp October afternoon. He left the industrial clatter of his SOMA street and entered the sudden serenity of Yerba Buena Gardens. He watched a dance troupe rehearsing near the waterfall, with the glassy towers looming behind them. The contrast of street grit and curated beauty felt like a perfect metaphor for his own internal landscape. He knew then, with absolute certainty, that he had found his place.\n\n4.\nHe still feels the echo of the first night alone in his loft after the breakup five years ago. The cavernous silence felt like a judgment. He stood by the massive window, looking down at the darkened gallery, and realized the space wasn\u2019t just a home, but his purpose. The quiet wasn't an ending, but an invitation to fill it with his work, his community, his vision. That night, he didn't feel empty; he felt focused. The pain had carved out a space for clarity to grow.\n\n5.\nLast spring, during a studio visit, a young sculptor\u2014half-Peruvian, half-Korean\u2014confessed her fear that her work was \u2018incoherent.\u2019 William saw his own history in her eyes. He spent an hour not critiquing, but showing her how her unique heritage was the very source of her power. Driving home, the idea for the fellowship clicked into place with fierce urgency. It wasn't just a professional goal anymore; it was a personal responsibility. He wouldn't just curate shows; he would build the platform he never had."
