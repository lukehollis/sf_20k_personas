The only daughter of Punjabi immigrants who ran a small grocery store, Naomi was raised on the values of hard work, community service, and the quiet expectation that she would become a doctor. She followed the path dutifully, enrolling in pre-med at UC Davis, but found herself drawn more to the systemic issues affecting her volunteer patients than to their individual diagnoses. A summer internship at a community clinic in Oakland became her turning point; seeing the cycles of poverty and lack of access firsthand, she realized her calling wasn't in the emergency room, but in prevention and policy.\n\nShe pivoted, earning a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley, and was recruited by the San Francisco Department of Public Health straight out of school. For nearly three decades, she has been a steady, guiding force within the department. Rising to Senior Program Manager, her work has touched everything from vaccination campaigns during the H1N1 scare to developing outreach strategies for the city\u2019s unhoused population. She sees the city not just as a resident, but as a complex organism whose health she is personally invested in healing.\n\nNow at 51, Naomi lives a consciously cultivated life in a quiet Cole Valley flat. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a brisk walk through Golden Gate Park, coffee in hand. Her work is a demanding mix of Zoom calls with community partners and deep dives into public health data. Divorced amicably a decade ago, her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow civil servants and academics\u2014for potlucks and discussions at the Castro Theatre.\n\nThough proud of her career, Naomi feels a pull toward a different kind of future. She dreams of stepping back from management to mentor the next generation of public health advocates. She also harbors a quiet desire to travel through India for an extended period, not to simply visit family, but to connect with the land of her parents on her own terms. For now, however, her focus remains on San Francisco, the city she has dedicated her life to serving, one program and one policy at a time."
