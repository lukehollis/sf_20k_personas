Raised by itinerant botanist parents who eschewed formal schooling for field-based learning, her education was a tapestry of soil samples, Latin plant names, and tidal charts. She never attended a traditional university, instead absorbing a deep, practical understanding of ecological systems that no degree program could replicate. This unconventional upbringing instilled in her a quiet self-reliance and an innate ability to read the language of the land.\n\nHer career began not with an internship, but with muddy boots, volunteering for a land trust. She learned policy and environmental law by challenging development permits and writing impact reports from the ground up. Her unique, field-honed expertise eventually became her most valuable asset. A complex wetlands restoration project in the Bay Area first brought her to San Francisco two decades ago. The project's success established her reputation, and she decided to stay, launching her own independent consultancy.\n\nToday, Mei lives and works from her quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond, her commute a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her home office overlooking a small garden. Her daily routine is anchored by the rhythm of the city\u2019s nature. Mornings begin with a walk through Golden Gate Park, observing the interplay of fog, cypress, and migratory birds\u2014a constant source of both personal peace and professional insight.\n\nThough intensely private, Mei maintains a small, loyal circle of friends: a landscape architect, a ceramicist she met at a local studio, and an old colleague from her land trust days. Her relationships are deep but few, mirroring the focused nature of her work. Her great hope is to leave a tangible mark on the city's ecological health. She currently dreams of pioneering small-scale biodiversity corridors that connect private backyards and public parks, creating resilient pathways for native pollinators. For Mei, San Francisco isn't a city of startups and noise, but a complex, living ecosystem she is dedicated to understanding and healing, one consulting report at a time."
