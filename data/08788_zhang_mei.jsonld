She grew up in a small apartment above her parents' modest Cantonese diner in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. While other kids had playdates, Mei\u2019s afternoons were spent peeling shrimp and folding wontons, her small hands learning the rhythms of the kitchen. Her parents, however, saw the restaurant as a life of unrelenting work and pushed Mei toward a different future. They wanted her to have an office job, a stable 9-to-5, so they proudly watched her enroll at City College.\n\nHer associate\u2019s degree in Business Administration felt like a betrayal of her true self. For two years, she traded the sizzle of the wok for the fluorescent lights of a classroom. After graduation, she found a soul-crushing job as an administrative assistant downtown. The turning point came when her father fell ill. Mei quit her job to help her mother run the struggling diner. In the familiar chaos of the kitchen, surrounded by her father\u2019s handwritten recipes, Mei didn't just find her purpose; she realized her \"useless\" business degree gave her the tools to save the family legacy.\n\nAfter her father\u2019s passing, Mei took charge. She gave the restaurant a new name, \"Zhang's Table,\" and began to gently innovate, infusing California\u2019s seasonal produce into her father\u2019s traditional dishes. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her bed to the kitchen downstairs. Her life is a cycle of early morning trips to the Alemany Farmers' Market, long hours of prep, the controlled chaos of dinner service, and late nights planning menus. Her social life is woven into her work; her staff is her second family, and the neighborhood regulars are her most valued critics.\n\nNow 35, Mei is a quiet anchor in the bustling Inner Richmond. She is respected, but her personal life has been simmering on the back burner for years. Her dream isn't fame or expansion; it's simpler and more profound. She hopes to one day earn a Michelin Bib Gourmand, a recognition that would honor her father's memory and validate her own unique culinary voice. It would be the perfect symbol of her journey: a successful business built on the foundations of family love."
