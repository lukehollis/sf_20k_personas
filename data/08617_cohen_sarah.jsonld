Raised in Fresno, she was the daughter of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, who instilled in her a strong work ethic and a respect for stable, sensible choices. From a young age, Sarah was the designated tech expert of the family, the one who patiently fixed the Wi-Fi router and debugged her grandparents' computer over the phone. While her friends dreamed of moving to LA or New York, Sarah saw a more logical path in the tech-driven world just a few hours away.\n\nForegoing the debt and four-year commitment of a large university, she enrolled in a community college and earned an Associate's degree in Information Technology. It was a direct, no-frills path to a career. Her turning point came when she landed a job as an IT Support Specialist for a major San Francisco-based tech firm. The catch: it was a fully remote position, secured during the peak of the work-from-home era. She packed her bags and moved not for an office, but for the idea of a city.\n\nNow, Sarah\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of her small apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its slightly sleepier vibe. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her bed to her desk. Her days are a steady stream of support tickets, video calls, and troubleshooting guides. To combat the isolation, she makes a ritual of a daily walk through the park, watching the fog roll over the bison paddock.\n\nHer social life is small but intentional. Her roommate, a boisterous marketing student, is her main connection to a world outside of tech support, often dragging her to trivia nights at a local pub. Sarah is slowly building other connections through a weekend hiking group she found online, finding it easier to talk to people while tackling a trail than in a crowded bar. Her dream isn\u2019t to found a startup or become a CEO; it\u2019s to earn a cybersecurity certification and move into a more specialized role. More than that, she hopes to one day feel less like a remote worker living in San Francisco and more like a true San Franciscan who just happens to work from home."
