Born in a small village in Guangdong province, her upbringing was one of pragmatism and filial duty. Her modest education ended with the equivalent of high school, her future already charted: to marry, support her family, and honor her elders. At 23, she followed her husband, Wei, across the Pacific, leaving behind the only life she\u2019d ever known for the promise of a better future, not for herself, but for the children they hoped to have.\n\nTheir early years in San Francisco were a dizzying blur of shared rooms, learning functional English from shop signs, and taking whatever work they could find. The turning point came with the birth of their son, Alex. He became Mei\u2019s singular focus. Shortly after, she found a job at a small electronics assembly workshop tucked into the basement of a building just two blocks from their apartment. The commute was a short walk down the stairs and a stroll past the Stockton Street markets. For twenty years, her life has been defined by this routine. The hum of the conveyor belt and the precise, repetitive motion of fitting microchips into circuit boards is the soundtrack to her days.\n\nMei\u2019s social life is woven into the fabric of her work and neighborhood. Her closest connections are the other women on the line, with whom she shares lunch, gossip, and worries about their children. Wei works as a cook in a restaurant nearby, his long hours meaning their lives often run on parallel tracks. Her world is San Francisco, but not the one of tech campuses and Victorian homes. Her San Francisco is the scent of roast duck hanging in a window, the cacophony of Cantonese dialects, and the familiar faces of neighbors in Portsmouth Square.\n\nHer hopes are no longer for herself. They have been carefully transferred to Alex, now a promising student at Lowell High School. She dreams of him attending a university, securing a white-collar job, and having a life of choice and comfort she never did. Mei\u2019s aspiration is simple: to see her son succeed. Until then, her days will remain the same\u2014a testament to quiet resilience and a mother\u2019s unwavering sacrifice."
