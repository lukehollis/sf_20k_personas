He was raised not in a high-rise, but in a modest bungalow in Oakland\u2019s Dimond District. His father, a union electrician, and his mother, a public-school teacher, instilled in him a belief that hard work and education were the only non-negotiable currencies. He was a sharp, observant kid who saw the burgeoning tech boom across the bay not as a distant fantasy, but as a complex system to be understood and navigated.\n\nAfter earning his undergraduate degree at UC Davis, Rohan landed a corporate finance job in the East Bay. He performed well but saw a ceiling forming above him, one that felt both professional and systemic. This realization became his pivotal turning point. With his wife\u2019s full support, he took a calculated risk, pouring their savings into pursuing an MBA at the prestigious Wharton School. It was two grueling years that paid off handsomely, catapulting him into the world of top-tier management consulting.\n\nNow, as a Managing Director, Rohan\u2019s days are a whirlwind of high-stakes presentations and strategic problem-solving in a sleek Financial District office. He dissects corporate inefficiencies with the same focus he once used to fix his childhood bicycle. Yet, he conscientiously holds onto his roots. His 18.5-mile commute from their comfortable Lafayette home is a deliberate choice. The 40-minute BART ride is his sanctuary\u2014a buffer where he can shed his corporate armor, read a novel, and simply be another face in the crowd.\n\nHe and his wife, an architect, are raising their teenage daughter to understand the privilege they now have, often volunteering at community centers back in Oakland. Rohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of a key participant who remains a critical observer. He helps fuel its economic engine but remains acutely aware of the people it leaves behind. His future aspirations are shifting from climbing the corporate ladder to building one for others. He dreams of creating a venture fund focused on minority-owned businesses, a second act that would honor the values his parents instilled in him a lifetime ago, just across the bay."

They were in an old Alameda Victorian, his father patiently showing him how to trace a dead circuit. Rohan watched him bring order to chaos, making something broken work again with quiet confidence. It wasn\u2019t just about fixing wires; it was about respecting the system and the skill it took to master it. That lesson in precision and tangible results became the bedrock of his own analytical approach to the world.\n\n2.\nThe moment of clarity came not in a boardroom, but at his kitchen table in his late twenties. He and his wife stared at the Wharton acceptance letter next to a printout of their savings account. The numbers were terrifyingly far apart. He braced for a difficult conversation, but she simply put her hand over his and said, \u201cThis is the foundation we\u2019re pouring.\u201d The fear was submerged by an overwhelming wave of gratitude and responsibility. Her unwavering belief transformed his calculated risk into a shared mission, cementing a partnership he\u2019d value more than any degree.\n\n3.\nJust months after making Managing Director, he caught his reflection in the BART window as the train pulled out of West Oakland. His crisp, tailored suit felt like a costume superimposed over the gritty, familiar landscape outside. A woman in nurse's scrubs across from him looked exhausted before her day had even begun. In that instant, the 18.5 miles between his home and his office felt like a chasm. The commute became more than a routine; it became his necessary, daily penance\u2014a reminder of the disparate worlds he straddled.\n\n4.\nIt happened during a performance review at his first corporate finance job. He\u2019d crushed his metrics, but the promotion was given to a colleague with a better pedigree and less impressive results. His boss offered vague, deflecting praise that made the systemic nature of the decision clear. Rohan felt not a hot rush of anger, but a cold, clarifying calm. He saw the invisible architecture of the ceiling he was under. That evening, he understood that hard work wasn't enough; he had to learn to operate the entire machine.\n\n5.\nLast year, while volunteering at an Oakland youth center, he watched his own teenage daughter help a high schooler brainstorm a business plan for a small tech startup. Seeing the raw, unchanneled ambition in the student\u2019s eyes\u2014the same spark he recognized in himself decades ago\u2014crystallized his future. The abstract idea of his venture fund became an urgent, tangible purpose. It was no longer about climbing a ladder, but about taking all he had learned in the towers of finance and building one for those on the other side of the bay."
