Her father, a longshoreman, and her mother, a nurse\u2019s aide, viewed San Francisco as a city of daunting hills and endless opportunity. For Jessica, the first in her family to earn a four-year degree, it was simply home. She attended San Francisco State University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Communications, a practical degree she thought might lead to a stable corporate job.\n\nLife, however, had other plans. A part-time job at a downtown clothing boutique during college revealed her natural talent for retail. She had an intuitive sense for merchandising and a warm, disarming way with customers. After graduation, she chose the vibrant, chaotic world of the sales floor over a quiet cubicle. Her ascent was swift: from assistant manager to store manager, where she earned a reputation for turning around underperforming locations. This success propelled her into her current role as a Retail District Manager, overseeing a portfolio of high-end apparel stores across the city.\n\nA key turning point was the pandemic, which shifted her once road-warrior lifestyle to a home-based command center. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her bedroom to the sleek desk in the living room of her Hayes Valley apartment. Her days are a mix of video calls with store managers, data analysis, and frequent walks to the stores in her district\u2014many conveniently located nearby.\n\nNow 41 and single after a long-term relationship ended amicably a few years ago, Jessica\u2019s life is curated and independent. She has a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other professionals she's known for years. Weekends are for farmers' markets, gallery-hopping, and discovering new restaurants. While she is proud of her corporate success, a new dream is taking root. She envisions trading her district manager title for the keys to her own small, curated boutique, perhaps right in her own neighborhood\u2014a full-circle journey from selling other people's brands to building her own."
