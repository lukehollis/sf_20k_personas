The only child of a high school math teacher and a dental hygienist, she grew up in a loving but emotionally reserved household. Words often failed to capture the complex feelings of her childhood, so Sarah turned to sketchbooks and clay, finding her voice in color and form. Art became her private language, a safe harbor in a world that prized practicality over passion.\n\nThis passion led her to pursue a Fine Arts degree, but it was a psychology elective that provided the crucial spark. She realized she didn't just want to create art; she wanted to use it to help others navigate their own unspoken emotions. This epiphany set her on a new course, culminating in a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology and Art Therapy from a program in Northern California. The move west was a profound turning point, trading the vast, flat plains for the dynamic, foggy coast.\n\nSarah established her career in San Francisco, drawn to its embrace of creativity and social consciousness. Her early years were spent in demanding roles at community centers and under-resourced schools, where she witnessed firsthand the power of art to unlock trauma in children and adults who had no other way to communicate their pain. Her empathy and skill led to her current position as a Clinical Supervisor, where she mentors a new generation of therapists. A significant breakup in her late thirties, while painful, solidified her independence and deepened her appreciation for her strong network of friends.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a cozy, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is grounded: a 3.8-mile MUNI ride to work, days spent guiding her team, and evenings dedicated to decompressing through pottery classes or long walks in Golden Gate Park. She treasures her neighborhood\u2019s quiet streets, its proximity to the de Young Museum, and the authentic dim sum spots. Her hope is not for more money or a bigger title, but to one day open a small private practice offering sliding-scale art therapy, ensuring that the healing language she discovered as a child remains accessible to all who need it."

The crisp, salty air was a shock after Nebraska\u2019s humidity, the hills appearing like apparitions in the fog. It wasn\u2019t the picture-perfect postcard she\u2019d imagined; it was moody, withdrawn, and mysterious. In that moment, she felt a thrill of recognition. This city had its own unspoken language, just like her. It was a place she could finally learn to translate, both for herself and for others. This memory marks the true beginning of her adult life.\n\n2.\nYears ago, at a community center, a seven-year-old boy who hadn't spoken since a fire took his home silently worked with gray clay. After weeks of nothing, he violently slammed the lump onto the table, then meticulously sculpted a single, locked door. He pushed it across the table to her. It was his first communication, a pure, unvarnished expression of his trapped grief. In that silent gesture, she felt the entire weight and purpose of her calling settle upon her, affirming her path was the right one.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday alone in her Inner Richmond apartment after the breakup, she didn't cry. Instead, she spent the day rearranging furniture, not to erase him, but to finally fit herself into the space. She hung a piece of her own pottery on a newly empty wall. It was a quiet, deliberate act of claiming her life back. This wasn\u2019t emptiness; it was a blank canvas. That afternoon, she felt a foundational peace in her solitude, forging an independence she hadn\u2019t realized she was missing.\n\n4.\nIt was one of those brilliantly clear, crisp autumn days. On her lunch break, she sat on a bench in Golden Gate Park, watching the light filter through the cypress trees. She could hear the distant clang of a cable car and smell eucalyptus on the wind. There was no great event, just a profound sense of contentment. Omaha was her past, but this\u2014this quiet, perfect pocket of the city, minutes from her home and work\u2014was where she belonged. It was a feeling of being completely, peacefully rooted.\n\n5.\nShe recalls having to tell a family that their teenager\u2019s sessions were ending because a grant had run out, just as they were making a breakthrough. The mother\u2019s quiet devastation was more piercing than any outburst of anger. Sarah felt a surge of professional helplessness, a frustration with a system that placed budgets over healing. That day, the abstract hope for a private practice became a non-negotiable mission. She vowed to build a space where healing would never be terminated by a line item."
