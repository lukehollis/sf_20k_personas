The only daughter of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and the quiet hum of her parents\u2019 small grocery store. They envisioned a stable future for her\u2014a doctor or an engineer\u2014built on the foundation of their relentless work ethic. However, the polite, suffocating silence surrounding her older brother's struggle with depression and addiction during her teens became the defining event of her upbringing. Witnessing his pain, and the family\u2019s inability to address it due to cultural stigma, ignited in her a fierce desire to understand and heal such hidden wounds.\n\nThis path led her away from her parents' expectations and toward a degree in psychology at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State. She chose social work over psychology for its practical, community-focused approach. Becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker was a grueling but validating journey, proving to herself and her slowly-coming-around family that there was profound value in tending to mental health.\n\nNow 29, Sarah lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that feels like a more independent version of her childhood home. Her commute is a zero-mile journey from her bed to the spare-room-turned-office where she conducts telehealth therapy sessions for a major healthcare provider. Her days are a string of digital consultations, holding space for others' trauma and anxiety through a screen. To decompress, she relies on tactile, grounding rituals: long runs through Golden Gate Park, the steam and clatter of cooking a complex meal, and a weekly pottery class where shaping clay is a welcome antidote to the formless nature of her work.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends from her master\u2019s program who understand the emotional toll of their profession. While deeply connected to San Francisco, she sometimes feels adrift in its fast-paced social scene. Sarah dreams of eventually opening a private practice dedicated to providing culturally competent therapy for Asian-American families, helping them find the words her own family never had. She remains anchored to the city that shaped her, striving to heal its community, one session at a time."

He was just lying there, staring at the ceiling, the bowl of jook her mother had made sitting untouched and cold on his nightstand. The helplessness she felt was a physical ache, a knot of unspoken words caught in her throat. That silence wasn't peace; it was a ghost. It became the question she would spend her life trying to answer for other families, the reason she had to find the words.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, she sat at the worn Formica table in her parents' kitchen and told them she was leaving pre-med for psychology. Her father didn\u2019t look at her, focusing instead on wiping the counter with meticulous, angry strokes. Her mother just sighed, a sound that contained a whole ocean of disappointment. In that moment, Sarah felt the acute pain of letting them down, but also a sharp, terrifying surge of ownership over her own life. It was the first time she chose her own path over the one paved for her.\n\n3.\nDuring her master\u2019s internship, a stoic teenage boy had refused to speak for weeks. Then, one session, Sarah quietly asked, \"What does it feel like to carry all that by yourself?\" His head snapped up, his eyes meeting hers for the first time. \"No one's ever asked me that,\" he whispered. The quiet click of that connection was monumental. It was the first, tangible proof that her work wasn\u2019t just a rebellion against her family's silence\u2014it was a real, vital bridge for someone else.\n\n4.\nHer first night at pottery class, the lump of clay on the wheel kept collapsing. Frustrated, she was about to give up when her third attempt folded into a messy, lopsided heap. A laugh escaped her, surprising in its lightness. There was no client to hold space for, no diagnosis to find, just a failure she could wash away with water. It was a profound release. Embracing that tangible imperfection became her most essential ritual, a necessary antidote to the weight of her digital work.\n\n5.\nOn a solo Sunday run, she crested a hill in Golden Gate Park as the fog began to burn off, revealing the Dutch Windmills against the brilliant blue sky. The city\u2019s hum faded, replaced by the wind and the distant roar of the Pacific. For a single, breathless moment, she felt completely anonymous and yet more connected to San Francisco than ever before. It solidified her love for the city\u2014not for its ambition or tech, but for its quiet, wild spaces that held her."
