Born in the Richmond District to parents who emigrated from Hong Kong, his childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken over the dinner table and the foggy chill of the San Francisco avenues. His parents ran a small neighborhood grocery, and David spent his youth stocking shelves and running the register, learning the rhythms of responsibility before he could legally drive.\n\nHis path seemed set for something different when he enrolled at San Francisco State University, though his major remained undecided. He was the first in his family to attend college, a source of immense pride. However, during his sophomore year, his father suffered a major heart attack. Without a second thought, David dropped his classes to run the family store full-time, a temporary measure that slowly solidified into his new reality. The dream of a degree faded, replaced by inventory lists and vendor calls.\n\nAfter five years, his father recovered enough to manage the store again, but David\u2019s momentum was gone. He found a job as an administrative assistant for a small architectural firm in SOMA. He wasn\u2019t passionate about architecture, but he was exceptionally organized and reliable\u2014the same skills that kept the grocery afloat. Over two decades, he became the indispensable Office Manager, the calm center of the firm\u2019s creative chaos.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is a masterclass in efficiency. He lives in a loft apartment directly above his ground-floor office, making his commute a simple elevator ride. His days are structured and predictable. He is a fixture in his micro-neighborhood, known by the baristas at the corner cafe and the owners of the local ramen shop. His primary social connection is his elderly mother, whom he visits in the Richmond every Sunday without fail.\n\nAt 50, David feels a gentle restlessness. He recently bought a high-end digital camera, a nod to the photography class he never got to take. His quiet aspiration is to spend his weekends exploring and documenting the city\u2019s forgotten corners\u2014the parts of San Francisco that exist beyond his contained SOMA world. He doesn\u2019t dream of a new life, but of finally adding a chapter that is entirely his own."

The cool metal, a stark contrast to the scent of cilantro and oranges, was the first time he understood that his family\u2019s world was held together by small, heavy things. It wasn't a burden, but a simple fact. His job was to make sure the count was always right.\n\n2.\nThe phone call came while he was in the SFSU library, the book on art history open but unread. His mother\u2019s voice, a thin wire of panic stretched across the city, announced his father\u2019s heart attack. In that sterile, silent room, David felt no hesitation. He simply closed the book, marking a page he would never return to. The decision wasn't made; it surfaced, fully formed. Duty was a current, and it was pulling him home.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday night, three years after taking over the store. After mopping the floors, he stood in the quiet darkness, the neat rows of canned goods gleaming under the security light. He felt a profound, bittersweet sense of order. This was his creation, a perfectly balanced system of inventory and sales. The dream of a degree had finally evaporated, not with a bang, but with the quiet satisfaction of a job well done. He had become good at this.\n\n4.\nHis first week at the architectural firm, he reorganized the entire materials library. He handed a color-coded, cross-referenced binder to the lead architect, a woman who lived in a storm of blueprints and frantic energy. She paused, stared at the binder, and gave him a look of pure, unadulterated relief. In her gratitude, David recognized the same value he\u2019d provided at the grocery: creating calm from chaos. He might not design buildings, but he could build a foundation for those who did.\n\n5.\nHolding the new camera felt illicit, a luxury purchased for no reason other than want. He took it out on a Sunday, just after visiting his mother. Standing on a familiar SOMA corner, he aimed the lens not at a skyline, but at the rust patterns on an old fire escape. For the first time, he was framing a piece of the world just for himself. It was a small act of authorship, a quiet claim on a life beyond the ledger."
