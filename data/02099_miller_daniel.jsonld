Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, he is the only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small, bustling laundromat on Geary Boulevard. His childhood was filled with the rhythmic hum of dryers and the scent of detergent, where he learned the value of tangible, hard work. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a prestigious degree, Daniel was always more interested in the guts of the machines than the theories in books. He\u2019d spend hours tinkering with broken radios and VCRs, finding satisfaction in making things work again.\n\nThis practical inclination led him to a key turning point. Resisting the pressure for a four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco and earned an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It was a rebellion of the quietest sort, a choice for passion over prestige. The degree was his entry into the tech world, not as a programmer, but as a hands-on problem solver. For the past fifteen years, he has worked as a field service technician, a role that perfectly suits his nature.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is misleading; his apartment in the Inner Sunset is simply his dispatch point. Each morning, a service ticket sends him across the city\u2014to a data center in SOMA, a biotech lab in Mission Bay, or a downtown corporate office. He is a nomad in his own town, navigating the city\u2019s digital arteries and physical backstreets with equal expertise. His social life mirrors his understated personality. He maintains a tight circle of friends from CCSF, preferring a beer at a quiet pub in Cole Valley to the downtown nightlife.\n\nAt 38, Daniel is content but not complacent. He dreams of a future with more autonomy\u2014perhaps starting his own specialized repair consultancy for high-end lab equipment. More pressingly, he hopes to one day buy a small condo, a tangible stake in the city he services daily. Daniel Miller isn't part of San Francisco's flashy tech boom narrative; he is an unseen cog, a quiet expert who keeps the city\u2019s complex machine running smoothly."
