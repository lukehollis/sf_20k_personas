            "value": "Sarah Kim has lived her entire 29 years within the same ten-block radius of San Francisco\u2019s Outer Richmond. The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Geary Boulevard, she grew up to the rhythm of folding machines and the lingering scent of warm cotton. Her parents instilled in her a deep sense of duty and a quiet work ethic. In high school, Sarah was a bright, artistic student with a full scholarship awaiting her at SF State, her portfolio filled with charcoal sketches of the cypress trees at Lands End.\n\nHer life pivoted sharply the summer after graduation. Her mother, widowed five years prior, suffered a severe, debilitating stroke. The scholarship was deferred, then forgotten. Sarah\u2019s world shrank to the confines of their small, fog-grey house. Her career became one of love and obligation, an unpaid, all-consuming role as her mother's primary caregiver. The \"0.0 mile\" commute is the short walk from her bedroom to her mother's, a path she has trod for over a decade.\n\nHer daily routine is a meticulous cycle of medications, meal preparations, physical therapy exercises, and quiet companionship. The vibrant, dynamic San Francisco that tourists and tech workers experience is a world away; Sarah's city is the corner grocer who knows her by name, the pharmacist who asks about her mother, and the brief, solitary walks in Golden Gate Park where she can breathe in the eucalyptus-scented air and feel anonymous for a moment. Her high school friends have careers, partners, and lives she only glimpses on social media. They try to include her, but the logistics and emotional weight of her responsibilities make connection feel like a luxury.\n\nAt 29, Sarah feels a profound sense of arrested development. In the quiet hours after her mother is asleep, she pulls out an old sketchbook. Her dreams are no longer grand visions of gallery openings, but smaller, more desperate hopes: to sit in a cafe and read a book for three uninterrupted hours, to go on a date, to define herself by a word other than \"caregiver.\" She loves her mother fiercely, but grieves for the woman she never had the chance to become, hoping that one day, she can find a way to honor her duty while finally beginning a life of her own."
