The only child of Malayali immigrants from Kerala, her father a diligent software engineer and her mother a community-focused homemaker, Priya was raised with the expectation that she would pursue a stable, high-earning profession like medicine. She initially followed this path, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Davis, but a volunteer position at a youth crisis center during her sophomore year became her crucial turning point. The raw, complex needs of the teenagers she met resonated with her more deeply than biology ever could. Against her parents\u2019 gentle protests, she switched her major to sociology and set her sights on social work.\n\nThis new path led her to San Francisco for her Master of Social Work at SF State. The city, with its vibrant diversity and spirit of activism, felt like a true home. After earning her LCSW, Priya dedicated her career to the city\u2019s youth. For over fifteen years, she has worked within the public school system, currently serving as a clinical social worker at a high school in the Mission District. She is the steady, compassionate presence for students grappling with everything from family trauma and housing instability to academic pressure and identity issues.\n\nNow 42, Priya has cultivated a life of intentional balance. Her mornings start with yoga in her cozy Inner Richmond apartment before she catches the N Judah for her commute, a 3.5-mile journey she uses for reading or simply observing the city wake up. Her income affords her a comfortable, if not extravagant, life. Evenings are for cooking, long walks in Golden Gate Park, or dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends, many of them fellow \"helpers\" from different fields.\n\nThough deeply fulfilled by her work, Priya dreams of one day moving into a policy-advising role to advocate for systemic change in youth mental health services. She is content in her single life but remains open to a partnership built on mutual respect and shared values. More than anything, Priya aspires to continue being a source of stability for others while nurturing her own peace, a quiet anchor in the ever-shifting tides of San Francisco."

Then, he spoke\u2013\u2013a torrent of fear and abandonment. In that moment, simply listening felt more real and vital than any biology lecture. It wasn't about curing, but about being a steady witness. In his raw honesty, she found her own truth and the courage to change her life\u2019s course, trading a stethoscope for a seat on a worn-out couch.\n\n2.\nThe phone felt heavy against her ear in her UC Davis dorm, age 20. She explained sociology, social work, the *feeling* of it. She heard the gentle disappointment in her father\u2019s silence, the worry in her mother\u2019s voice asking, \u201cBut what about your security, mole?\u201d It was the first time she\u2019d truly diverged from their dreams for her. The conversation was heavy with love and fear, but it cemented her resolve. She was building her own definition of a stable life.\n\n3.\nHer first semester at SF State, age 22, she rode the N Judah all the way to Ocean Beach. Squeezed between a musician with a cello and a woman reading poetry, the city vibrated around her as the fog blurred the sunset. Fremont felt a world away. Here, surrounded by strangers, each on their own distinct journey, she felt paradoxically, profoundly at home. This was a city that made space for people like her. She knew then she would stay.\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday in her late thirties after a wrenching student crisis. She walked into Golden Gate Park as the light turned golden. Instead of thinking, she just listened: to the eucalyptus scent, the distant drum circle, the squawk of a parrot. She stopped by the AIDS Memorial Grove, a place of quiet reflection. In that stillness, she wasn't anyone's social worker; she was just Priya. She learned then that to be an anchor for others, she first had to anchor herself.\n\n5.\nA few years into her job at the Mission high, she met a student who communicated only through defiant silence. For months, she just sat with him during lunch, offering a granola bar and her quiet presence. The day he finally slid a drawing across the table\u2014a tiny, detailed bird taking flight\u2014felt like the sky opening up. It wasn't a cure, but a connection. It taught her that sometimes the greatest, most profound work is done in patient, trusting silence."
