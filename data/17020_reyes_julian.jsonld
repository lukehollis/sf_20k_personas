Born in Daly City to a Filipina immigrant nurse and a second-generation Irish-American union carpenter, he grew up navigating the cultural currents of his mixed heritage and the working-class realities of the Bay Area. From his mother, he inherited a deep empathy for community health; from his father, a pragmatic understanding of how complex systems are built and maintained.\n\nHis initial path at San Francisco State University in the late 1980s was unfocused, until the AIDS crisis devastated the city he was coming to love. Volunteering at a local clinic, he witnessed not only the human tragedy but also the systemic chaos of paper charts and disconnected data. This was his turning point. He saw a future where information, properly harnessed, could be as vital as medicine. He pivoted his focus, eventually earning a graduate degree in the nascent field of Public Health Informatics.\n\nJulian\u2019s career grew alongside the technology. He started as a data analyst, meticulously cleaning databases for a city hospital, and gradually rose through the ranks. He met his wife, Elena, a sharp-witted non-profit lawyer, while collaborating on a community health initiative in the Mission District. Today, they share a tastefully minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. As Director of Clinical Informatics, Julian no longer writes code; he manages teams, crafts strategy, and advocates for data-driven policies that impact thousands.\n\nHis daily routine is grounded in the city. He takes the N Judah MUNI for his 2.5-mile commute, using the time to read public health journals. Evenings are for quiet dinners with Elena, discussing their respective professional battles and triumphs. Weekends often involve long walks through Golden Gate Park or visiting their daughter, a graduate student at UC Berkeley.\n\nAt 53, Julian isn't driven by ambition for a higher title. His dream is to see the creation of a truly integrated public health data system for San Francisco\u2014a legacy project that could predict outbreaks and protect the city\u2019s most vulnerable. He sees the patterns, the connections, and the potential, still driven by the memory of those chaotic clinic days, forever working to bring order and hope to the system."

A kind man\u2019s chart was lost, delaying his care. It wasn\u2019t malice, just chaos. In that moment of profound helplessness, a quiet rage ignited in him. He saw not just a stack of paper, but a broken system. It was the moment he stopped drifting and found the problem his life would be dedicated to solving.\n\n2.\nHe\u2019s maybe nine years old, the Daly City fog thick outside. His father is building shelves in the garage, the air smelling of sawdust. A hammer slips, a sharp cry. His mother appears, her nurse\u2019s hands instantly calm and efficient, cleaning the wound. He remembers watching her methodical care and his father\u2019s sturdy handiwork. In that garage, he unconsciously learned his life\u2019s mission: to build strong structures that care for people. It was the blueprint for his entire career.\n\n3.\nThe community room in the Mission was stuffy, the air thick with frustration after hours of debate. He was presenting data; she was representing a family fighting eviction due to a health code issue. Elena stood up, her voice cutting through the fatigue\u2014sharp, passionate, and impeccably logical. He forgot all about his spreadsheets. He saw in her the human consequence of the data he managed, the fierce advocacy his systems needed. He fell in love with her argument before he fell in love with her.\n\n4.\nIt was 1998, long before he had a fancy title. He spent a sleepless week cleaning a corrupted dataset for TB contact tracing. Late one night, a pattern emerged\u2014a tiny, overlooked cluster in the Tenderloin linked to a single SRO hotel. There was no fanfare, just a quiet email to an epidemiologist. But knowing his meticulous work would prevent dozens of potential infections was a profound, private victory. It was the first time his abstract data felt like a tangible, life-saving intervention.\n\n5.\nHis daughter, maybe twelve then, was tracing the intricate patterns on a leaf inside the Conservatory of Flowers. He was explaining how different systems in the conservatory worked together to keep the delicate plants alive. She looked up at him and asked, \"Is that what you do, Dad? You help the city\u2019s systems work so people can stay alive?\" The simple, profound accuracy of her question struck him to his core. In that moment, his complex career felt beautifully, perfectly understood."
