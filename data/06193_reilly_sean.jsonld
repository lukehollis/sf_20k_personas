            "value": "Sean Reilly\u2019s name was the first story he learned, and the one that never quite felt like his own. Born Seo-joon Park in Busan, South Korea, he was adopted at eighteen months by a loving, boisterous Irish-American couple from Daly City. His father was a police officer, his mother a public school teacher. They raised him on stories of County Cork, the 49ers, and the simple virtues of hard work. Growing up, Sean was an outsider in his own skin\u2014an Asian face in a sea of Irish relatives, a Reilly who drew curious stares at family gatherings.\n\nThis search for narrative led him to study History at San Francisco State University. He was fascinated by the concrete stories of the past, a stark contrast to the blank pages of his own origins. After graduation, passion gave way to pragmatism. Insurance adjusting wasn\u2019t a dream, but a logical endpoint for a mind skilled at piecing together fractured accounts. For over two decades, he has sifted through claims, finding the truth in the wreckage of car accidents and house fires, a professional assessor of damage.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was a trip to Seoul in his late twenties. He\u2019d hoped to feel a sense of homecoming but instead felt like a tourist, his rudimentary Korean and American mannerisms marking him as a foreigner. He returned to SFO feeling more Californian, and more profoundly alone, than ever before.\n\nNow, at 45, Sean\u2019s life is a study in quiet routine. Since his company went fully remote, his commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to his desk. He lives in a meticulously kept one-bedroom condo in the Inner Richmond, where the fog rolls in like a familiar blanket. His days are structured: coffee from a Clement Street cafe, hours spent analyzing digital files, and a long, meditative walk through Golden Gate Park in the late afternoon. He has a few old friends from college, but his social circle is small.\n\nSean\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but subtle. He isn't part of the tech boom or the activist scene; he is the city's steady, often-unseen foundation. His dream is not to launch a startup, but to finally write the story he couldn't find in Korea\u2014the one that connects a boy named Seo-joon to a man named Sean. It remains a blank document on his laptop, a future he hopes he has the courage to finally adjust."
