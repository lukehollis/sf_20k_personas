            "value": "Mei Lin Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laced avenues and quiet resilience. Born in the Richmond District to first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, her childhood was scented with the yeast and sugar of her parents' small bakery on Clement Street. She watched them navigate a labyrinth of city permits and regulations, their quiet determination planting a seed in her: a desire to understand the systems that governed their lives. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a lucrative career in medicine or law, Mei was drawn to the less glamorous, more foundational work of public service.\n\nThis calling led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a Master of Public Administration. She saw it not as an academic exercise, but as a toolkit for tangible change. Mei began her career in a junior role with the Department of Public Works, steadily climbing the ladder through diligence and an unparalleled understanding of the city\u2019s inner workings. She wasn\u2019t a charismatic leader but a deeply effective operator, the person who knew which levers to pull to get a new community garden approved or a bus stop shelter installed.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 42. The end of her 15-year marriage was amicable but left her feeling untethered. Instead of retreating, she poured her energy back into her work and her city. She sold the marital home in West Portal and bought a modern condo in Hayes Valley, embracing a new, independent life.\n\nNow, at 50, Mei\u2019s life is a study in focused routine. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a small desk overlooking the street. Her days are a marathon of Zoom calls, managing budgets for homeless outreach programs and neighborhood improvement projects. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of old friends, with whom she shares dinners and walks through Golden Gate Park. She still visits the old bakery, now run by a new family, a bittersweet reminder of her roots. Her dream isn't grand; it's to retire knowing she left the city\u2019s machinery a little more efficient and a lot more humane than she found it, a quiet but lasting legacy for the only home she\u2019s ever known."
