The daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised in a home that valued education and stability above all. Her father, a successful software engineer, and her mother, a community pillar, envisioned a future for Sarah in medicine or law. Sarah, however, found her world in the hushed halls of museums and the vibrant chaos of street art.\n\nTo bridge the gap between her family's expectations and her own passions, she pursued a Master's degree in Cultural Anthropology at Stanford. It was the perfect compromise\u2014intellectually rigorous, yet focused on the human stories and artifacts that captivated her. Her thesis on the evolving visual language of diaspora communities became the bedrock of her future career.\n\nAfter graduation, Sarah spent nearly a decade working in the curatorial department of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco. While she valued the experience, she grew frustrated by the institutional pace and the difficulty of showcasing raw, emerging talent. The turning point came at age 35. Following a modest inheritance from a grandparent, she pooled it with every penny of her savings and took a monumental risk. She leased a ground-floor industrial space in the burgeoning Dogpatch neighborhood, renovating the apartment above it for herself.\n\n\"Vessel Gallery\" was born. Her 0.0-mile commute from her bed to her desk became the defining feature of her life. Her world is her work\u2014a meticulously curated space dedicated to contemporary artists exploring themes of identity, migration, and heritage. Her days are a blend of solitary focus\u2014researching artists, writing proposals\u2014and intense social engagement during openings and client meetings. Her social circle consists of the artists she represents, a few other local gallery owners, and the chef at the Italian restaurant next door.\n\nNow 44, Sarah feels a deep, symbiotic connection to San Francisco. Her Dogpatch neighborhood, with its mix of old industry and new creative energy, mirrors her own journey. Her dream is no longer just about personal success, but about legacy: to see one of her discovered artists receive a major retrospective. She finds contentment not in wealth, but in the quiet moments upstairs after a successful opening, knowing the stories on the walls below are finally being seen and heard."
