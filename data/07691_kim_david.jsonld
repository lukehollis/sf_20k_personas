The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a bustling grocery store in Los Angeles, his childhood was defined by the expectation that he would pursue a practical, stable career. He dutifully enrolled in UCLA\u2019s civil engineering program, a path that promised security but starved his soul. The turning point came during his junior year on a visit to the Getty Center, where the interplay of light, stone, and space felt more profound than any equation. It was a silent, seismic shift.\n\nAgainst his parents\u2019 initial disappointment, David pivoted, eventually earning a Master of Architecture from Columbia University. He returned to the West Coast, drawn to San Francisco's unique blend of technological innovation and bohemian history. After a stifling tenure at a large corporate firm designing sterile office towers, he took a significant risk. He left to found \"KIM Projects,\" a boutique studio run from his sprawling SoMa live/work loft, specializing in designing cultural spaces\u2014galleries, small theaters, and artists' residences. This explains his 0.0-mile commute; his work is his life, and his life is his home.\n\nNow at 45, David\u2019s daily routine is a ritual. He begins with pour-over coffee and classical music, his mornings spent sketching by a window overlooking the city's rooftops before transitioning to complex digital models. His social life is a close-knit circle of gallery owners, chefs, and fellow designers, connections forged over exhibition openings and late-night dinners in Hayes Valley. Though he is currently single after a long-term relationship ended amicably due to his intense focus on his work, he isn't lonely; his life is full, just carefully edited.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is etched into his professional ambition. He dreams of designing a significant public arts venue for the city, a legacy project that gives back to the community that fostered his artistic identity. For David, architecture isn't just about buildings; it's about creating the physical context for human connection and artistic expression, a principle he lives by within the concrete-and-glass walls of his SoMa sanctuary."
