Born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1976, his earliest memories are of sun-drenched courtyards and the intricate tilework of ancient mosques. His family, a blend of engineering pragmatism from his father and artistic sensibility from his mother, fled to Los Angeles after the revolution when Kian was three. He grew up in a bicultural world, absorbing the sun-bleached modernism of Southern California while his parents instilled in him a deep appreciation for Persian art and history.\n\nThis duality defined his educational path. He pursued architecture at UC Berkeley, where his graduate thesis explored how ancient Persian design principles\u2014like natural ventilation and interior gardens\u2014could be integrated into sustainable modern buildings. After graduating, Kian resisted the pull of large corporate firms, instead joining a boutique San Francisco practice where he could leave a more personal mark. Over two decades, he ascended to Principal Architect, known for his calm demeanor and an aesthetic that is minimalist yet warm, merging clean lines with organic materials.\n\nA key turning point came in his late thirties. The collapse of a long-term relationship, strained by his intense dedication to a career-defining project, forced him to re-evaluate his priorities. He realized that a well-designed life required balance, not just a beautiful facade. This led him to deliberately craft his current lifestyle. He chose an apartment in Hayes Valley, precisely 0.9 miles from his SoMa office, making his morning walk a cherished ritual. He\u2019ll stop for an espresso at a familiar caf\u00e9, observing the city's architectural layers\u2014the rebuilt freeway nexus, the classic Victorians, the sleek new condos.\n\nNow 48, Kian\u2019s social life is a close-knit circle of friends, many in creative fields, with whom he shares dinners and attends architectural lectures. He feels deeply connected to San Francisco's spirit of innovation and challenging geography. His greatest aspiration is no longer just to build beautiful homes for the wealthy, but to design a significant public space\u2014a library or a community arts center\u2014a legacy project that gives back to the city that has become his true home."

In his grandfather\u2019s courtyard, he would press his small hand against the cool, shaded wall, feeling the intricate relief of the turquoise tilework. The memory isn\u2019t visual so much as sensory: the contrast of intense sun and engineered shade, the feeling of a perfect, man-made sanctuary. This moment planted the seed of his entire architectural philosophy\u2014that a building\u2019s highest purpose is to provide a pocket of serene refuge from the chaos of the world outside.\n\n2.\nWurster Hall at Berkeley, well past midnight in his mid-twenties. Kian recalls staring at a blank sheet of vellum, struggling with his graduate thesis. Then, it clicked. He sketched a cross-section of a modern SF condo, but integrated the principles of a Persian windcatcher for natural cooling. In that moment, the two halves of his identity\u2014the sun-bleached modernism of LA and the ancient wisdom of Iran\u2014fused into a single, cohesive idea. It was a feeling of profound intellectual and personal wholeness, giving him the courage to forge his own path.\n\n3.\nIn his late thirties, he stood alone in the finished living room of the Pacific Heights residence that had won him acclaim but cost him his long-term partner. The sunset streamed through the floor-to-ceiling glass he had so meticulously detailed, illuminating dust motes in the empty air. The architectural perfection felt mockingly hollow. This stark moment of lonely triumph forced a painful realization: a beautifully designed structure is meaningless without a well-lived life inside. It was the catalyst for redesigning his own habits, priorities, and definition of success.\n\n4.\nIt happened on a random Wednesday morning a few years ago, during his ritualistic walk to the office. Holding his espresso, he stopped at the corner of Octavia andHayes, watching the diverse rush of the city against the backdrop of the freeway\u2019s skeletal memory. He suddenly felt not like an architect observing a city, but a cell within it, part of its living organism. The feeling wasn't dramatic, but a quiet, deep sense of arrival. This city was no longer a place he worked; it was irrevocably home.\n\n5.\nLast fall, while attending a lecture at the SFJAZZ Center, he found himself studying the crowd more than the speaker. He saw how the architecture encouraged connection\u2014strangers talking in the light-filled lobby, friends lingering on the wide staircases. He felt a sudden, sharp pang of professional purpose. Building private homes was a craft, but this\u2014creating a space that fosters community and gives back to the public spirit of the city\u2014was a calling. It was then his greatest aspiration crystallized into a clear, attainable goal."
