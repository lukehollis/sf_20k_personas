Raised in Daly City, the child of Filipino immigrants, Paolo saw the city through the eyes of his father, a career bus driver, and his mother, a nurse at SF General. He learned the city\u2019s arteries\u2014the 14-Mission, the 38-Geary\u2014as lifelines connecting working-class communities to their livelihoods. The turning point came during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At nine years old, he witnessed firsthand how a city\u2019s collapse was a collapse of its infrastructure, turning his father\u2019s familiar routes into impassable puzzles. The memory of that structured chaos planted the seed for his future.\n\nThis inspiration fueled his academic journey, leading him from UC Davis to a Master's in Urban Planning at UCLA. He returned to the Bay Area, eager to apply his knowledge. Paolo started as a junior planner at a regional transit agency, meticulously analyzing traffic flows and commuter data. Over two decades, he built a reputation for pragmatic, human-centered solutions, rising to become a Senior Infrastructure Strategist. He now tackles the city's most complex logistical challenges, from port modernization to creating resilient utility grids, always viewing spreadsheets and blueprints through the lens of the people they serve.\n\nToday, Paolo lives in a tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley with his partner of eight years, Alex, a graphic designer. His 1.6-mile commute is a point of professional and personal pride, taken daily via the N Judah or a brisk walk. His routine is disciplined: an early rise, coffee from a local cafe, and long days orchestrating the city's future. Evenings are for unwinding with Alex, dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends, or attending community planning meetings as an engaged citizen, not just a strategist.\n\nPaolo\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both his life's work and his deepest passion. He dreams of designing a public transit system so seamless and equitable that a new generation of immigrant families can thrive without the burden of car ownership. He envisions a city fabric strong enough to withstand the next big one, a legacy of resilience written in concrete and steel, ensuring the lifelines he learned as a boy remain open for all."

The city wasn\u2019t a map; it was the faces his father greeted by name, the rhythm of the farebox clinking. He felt an immense pride, watching his father navigate the city\u2019s veins with a steady hand. In those moments, he learned that transit wasn't mechanical; it was the circulatory system of a community, powered by people he loved.\n\n2.\nThe shaking stopped, but the world hadn't. He was nine. He remembers his mother\u2019s frantic calls to the Muni yard after Loma Prieta, and the bone-deep weariness on his father\u2019s face when he finally walked in the door. His dad described familiar routes turned into dead ends and impassable cracks. For Paolo, the city\u2019s reliable grid had fractured into a terrifying puzzle. It wasn't an abstract disaster; it was the failure of the lifelines he trusted, the moment his life\u2019s work unknowingly began.\n\n3.\nHe was 38, staring at a final blueprint for the 38R-Geary Rapid project. Years of data analysis and public meetings boiled down to this: a dedicated red lane. He pictured his father driving that route, the frustration of getting stuck in traffic. He pictured the nurses and cooks on board. That night, signing off on the plan felt less like a bureaucratic act and more like honoring a promise to his nine-year-old self. It was a tangible line of progress drawn on the city's asphalt.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a rainy Tuesday night riding the N Judah home with Alex. They shared an earbud, their shoulders pressed together as the train climbed the hill towards Duboce Park, the city lights smearing against the wet glass. In that warm, quiet bubble moving through the city\u2019s heart, he felt a profound sense of peace. The infrastructure he worked on all day wasn't just a system; it was the vessel carrying him home to the person he loved. It was the feeling of being perfectly placed.\n\n5.\nAt a community meeting in the Excelsior last year, a young Filipina nurse stood up to speak. She talked about taking two buses to get to SF General, about her husband\u2019s late-night commute. Paolo saw his own mother and father in her words. He wasn\u2019t just a strategist presenting a plan; he was the child from Daly City, seeing the faces behind the data points. That moment galvanized him. His work wasn\u2019t about concrete and steel; it was about giving that family thirty extra minutes together each day."
