She saw the automobile not as a symbol of freedom, but as a cage. This early observation fueled her academic path, leading her from a state university to UCLA for a Master's in Urban Planning. It was there, immersed in data analytics and transit theory, that she realized the future of planning wasn't in city hall, but in Silicon Valley.\n\nUpon graduating, Leah was recruited by a major tech firm in San Francisco to join their nascent autonomous mobility division. She bypassed traditional city planning for a role where she could analyze vast datasets to design efficient, dynamic transportation systems. Her move to SF was both a career choice and a personal mission. She settled into a modern one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose walkability and vibrant street life represented everything her childhood lacked. Her commute is zero; she works from a standing desk overlooking Patricia's Green, her days dictated by virtual meetings and complex routing algorithms.\n\nLeah\u2019s life is deeply integrated into her neighborhood. Mornings start with a run through the Panhandle, followed by coffee from a local roaster. She thrives on the energy of the city, yet her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow planners, tech colleagues, and a few friends from a pottery class she joined to disconnect from screens. A recent breakup has sharpened her focus on her career, pushing her deeper into her work.\n\nHer core ambition is to bridge the gap between Big Tech's profit motives and genuine public good. Leah dreams of leading a project that creates a truly equitable transit system, one that serves the underserved communities of the Bay Area, not just the affluent corridors. She sees her role as a necessary infiltration\u2014using the immense resources of the tech world to build the sustainable, human-centric city she\u2019s always envisioned. San Francisco, for her, is not just a home; it's a living laboratory for her life's work."
