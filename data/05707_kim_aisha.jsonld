The daughter of a Black American army veteran and a South Korean immigrant, she grew up in Oakland navigating the rich, and sometimes conflicting, cultural currents of her family. Her father\u2019s pragmatism and her mother\u2019s quiet diligence instilled in her a powerful work ethic, but also a feeling that her own passions were a luxury. This led her to Laney College, where she earned an Associate's in Liberal Arts\u2014a degree chosen more for its broad applicability and affordability than for any specific career path it promised.\n\nThe true turning point in her life came at twenty-three. After the slow, painful dissolution of a long-term relationship that had defined her post-adolescent years, she felt a desperate need for a clean slate. Packing her life into a few boxes, she moved across the Bay to a small, rent-controlled studio in San Francisco's Richmond District. It was a declaration of independence, a decision made entirely for herself.\n\nNow, at twenty-five, Aisha\u2019s life is a study in contrasts. By day, she is a remote Administrative Assistant for a small environmental non-profit. The 0.0-mile commute offers flexibility but also a deep sense of isolation, her apartment serving as both office and sanctuary. Her colleagues exist as names on Slack, her work a cycle of emails and spreadsheets that pays the bills for her modest lifestyle.\n\nHer real life unfolds after she logs off. Aisha is a photographer, wielding an old 35mm film camera her father gave her. She finds her subjects in the quiet corners of her neighborhood: the way the fog clings to the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park, the vibrant displays of produce at the Clement Street Farmers Market, the diverse faces of her neighbors. Her photography is her way of processing her mixed heritage and her place in the world.\n\nAisha\u2019s dream is not one of wealth or fame. She aspires to curate a small gallery show at a local cafe, a collection titled \u201cThird Space,\u201d exploring the beauty found in cultural intersections. For her, San Francisco is not a place for hustle, but a canvas. Her quiet life in the Richmond, punctuated by long walks and the click of her camera's shutter, is her slow and deliberate process of finding her own frame."
