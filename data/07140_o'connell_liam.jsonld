His upbringing was grounded in practicality and the value of a steady paycheck, values that clashed with his teenage fascination with the city's underground music scene. Instead of a traditional four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, pursuing an Associate\u2019s degree in Sound Engineering, dreaming of a life behind a mixing board.\n\nThe reality after graduation was a harsh lesson. The freelance world of live sound and studio mixing was inconsistent and fiercely competitive. For a year, he chased gigs, living off dwindling savings and the occasional cash-in-hand job at small clubs. The pressure to be self-sufficient, deeply ingrained from his childhood, became overwhelming. In a pivotal moment of pragmatic surrender, he saw an advertisement for a pharmacy technician certification program\u2014it was fast, affordable, and promised stability. He enrolled, trading his creative passion for the certainty of healthcare.\n\nNow, Liam\u2019s life is defined by a small radius in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small studio apartment directly above the independent pharmacy where he works. His days are a routine of precision and patience: counting pills, managing prescriptions, and navigating insurance bureaucracy. His social life is quiet, consisting of weekly calls with his parents and occasional meetups with a few friends from his CCSF days, most of whom have also settled into more practical careers.\n\nThough he rarely touches his audio equipment, Liam hasn't fully abandoned his dream. He finds solace in long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, listening to meticulously curated playlists. He hopes to eventually transition to a hospital pharmacy for better pay and save enough to build a small, high-quality home recording studio. For now, he is a quiet steward of his community's health, a young man who chose security over his art, hoping that one day the meticulous counting of pills might fund the creation of music once more."
