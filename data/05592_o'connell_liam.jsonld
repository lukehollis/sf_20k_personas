Adopted from an orphanage in Seoul as an infant by a loving Irish-American couple, he was raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. His father, a city bus driver, and his mother, a public school librarian, instilled in him a profound sense of civic duty and the value of a stable, hardworking life.\n\nDriven by his parents\u2019 ethos, Liam excelled academically, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley. He was fascinated by the systems that governed society, which led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy. His goal was clear: work in city government to improve urban infrastructure. However, upon graduating, he was met with the harsh realities of bureaucratic inertia and the staggering weight of his graduate school loans.\n\nThe turning point came during an interview for a municipal planning role, where he realized his potential impact would be stifled for years. That same week, a recruiter for a top-tier consulting firm approached him. The allure of a six-figure salary and the promise of influencing major financial institutions was too powerful to ignore. He accepted the offer, framing it to himself as a pragmatic detour.\n\nNow, at 28, Liam lives a life his parents struggle to comprehend. His \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from his bed to his desk in a sleek SoMa apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls with clients in New York and London, spent optimizing financial models and creating slide decks. His social life consists of happy hours with colleagues and weekend trips to Napa, connections often feeling as transactional as his work.\n\nThough he enjoys the city's culinary scene and jogs along the Embarcadero, Liam feels more like an observer of San Francisco than a participant. His deep-seated dream is to eventually leave consulting and launch a venture fund for social-impact startups, finally merging the idealism of his youth with the financial acumen he\u2019s now mastering. He hopes to one day prove to his parents, and to himself, that he hasn't lost his way\u2014he\u2019s just taking the scenic, albeit more lucrative, route."

He watched his dad greet regulars by name, his hands expertly guiding the massive vehicle through the fog. In that moment, the city wasn't just a place; it was a complex, living system. He felt an overwhelming sense of pride and belonging, a feeling that he, too, was part of what made the city run. This established his belief in public service.\n\n2.\nHe was fifteen, engulfed in the sea of green at the St. Patrick's Day parade, a shamrock pinned to his jacket by his mom. Amid the raucous cheers, he caught his reflection in a storefront window\u2014a Korean face under an Irish name. It wasn\u2019t a moment of sadness, but of profound clarity. He understood he was a living bridge between worlds, a testament to his parents\u2019 love. This solidified his quiet comfort with his complex identity, teaching him to exist in the space between definitions.\n\n3.\nHe was 23, sitting in a beige, airless office in City Hall. The interviewer explained, with weary pride, that a proposed bike lane was entering its fifth year of review. Liam felt his grand ambitions for the city shrink to the size of a three-ring binder. The idealism he'd nurtured at Berkeley evaporated, replaced by a cold dread of inertia. The recruiter\u2019s call later that week didn't feel like a temptation; it felt like a rescue. It was the moment he decided efficiency could be its own form of duty.\n\n4.\nAt 26, he closed his laptop after a flawless presentation that secured a client millions. The silence in his SoMa apartment was absolute. He walked to the floor-to-ceiling window and looked down at the city lights, the same lights his father used to drive through. He felt a profound disconnect, like watching a movie of a life he was supposed to be living. The victory felt abstract, the financial gain hollow. It was the first time he truly understood he was building a gilded cage, not a foundation.\n\n5.\nHe was jogging along the Embarcadero last year when he saw a small team from a bay restoration non-profit setting up a booth. They were earnest, passionate, and slightly disorganized. He thought of his slide decks and financial models that could optimize any system\u2014including theirs. A powerful ache of longing hit him, followed by a spark of an idea. Here was the bridge. He could use the tools of his lucrative detour to fund their essential work. The social-impact fund wasn't just a dream; it became his necessary destination."
