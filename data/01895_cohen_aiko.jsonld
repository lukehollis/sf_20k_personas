The daughter of a third-generation Japanese American ceramicist from Sonoma and a Jewish literature professor from New York, she grew up in a Berkeley home where *wabi-sabi* aesthetics coexisted with heated Talmudic debate. Her childhood was a curated collection of cultures: mismatched, beautiful, and deeply intellectual. This fusion instilled in her an eye for finding beauty in unexpected combinations.\n\nHer path seemed pre-ordained. After earning a B.A. in Art History from Reed College, a pivotal internship at SFMOMA crystallized her ambition. She didn\u2019t just want to study art; she wanted to shape the conversation around it. This led her to New York for a competitive Master\u2019s program in Curatorial Studies at Columbia University. While she thrived academically, the city's art scene felt transactional. She missed the collaborative spirit and raw, experimental energy of the Bay Area and returned upon graduating.\n\nNow 27, Aiko is a fiercely independent curator. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her integrated lifestyle; she resides in a spacious live/work loft in Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial bones and creative pulse mirror her own sensibilities. Her life is her work. Mornings are for grant-writing and emailing galleries, fueled by coffee from a cafe downstairs. Afternoons are for studio visits with emerging artists in the Mission or Bayview. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings, not just to network, but to genuinely connect with the community she is dedicated to uplifting.\n\nHer relationships are woven into this tapestry\u2014her closest friends are artists, writers, and designers. Her social life and professional life are nearly one and the same. She is a fixture in her neighborhood, known for her thoughtful critiques and unwavering support for local talent.\n\nAiko\u2019s dream is to secure funding to open her own small, influential gallery in San Francisco. It would be a space that reflects her own heritage: a platform for hybrid identities and underrepresented voices. She envisions a place that dismantles the pretension of the art world, making it as accessible and vital as the diverse city she calls home."
