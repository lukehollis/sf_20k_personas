Born and raised in the foggy expanse of the Outer Richmond, Liang is a second-generation San Franciscan. His parents, immigrants from Guangdong, ran a small, bustling grocery store on Balboa Street, a place that smelled of dried herbs and fresh produce. It was there Liang learned the value of a long day's work. School was never his calling; he was a restless student, more interested in the mechanics of his father\u2019s old delivery van than in textbooks. He graduated from George Washington High School with a diploma and a vague sense of needing to find his place.\n\nAfter high school, Liang drifted through a series of jobs\u2014working at an auto body shop in the Bayview, making deliveries for a Chinatown wholesaler. The turning point came in his late twenties. After marrying his wife, Mei, a quiet but determined woman he met through family friends, the need for stability became paramount. An older uncle, a longtime Muni maintenance worker, suggested he apply to be a driver. The process was long, but the promise of a union job, good pay, and a pension was a future he could build a family on. He got the job at 28 and has been driving a bus ever since.\n\nNow, at 53, Liang\u2019s life is a testament to that decision. He and Mei still live in the Richmond District, in a modest home they bought two decades ago. Their greatest pride is their daughter, Evelyn, now a junior at UC Davis studying veterinary science. Liang\u2019s substantial income isn't for luxuries; it\u2019s for her tuition, for the secure life he and Mei have carefully constructed. His daily routine is disciplined: up before dawn, he takes the 38R-Geary Rapid to the depot to begin his own route, often the 22-Fillmore, which carries him through the city\u2019s complex tapestry of wealth and poverty.\n\nFrom his driver\u2019s seat, Liang is a silent witness to San Francisco's ceaseless transformation. He feels a deep, protective connection to the city, even as he grumbles about the traffic and the ever-changing streets. His hopes are simple: to see Evelyn graduate and build a career she loves, to retire comfortably with Mei in another ten years, and perhaps buy an RV to visit the national parks they\u2019ve only seen in pictures. For now, he is content being a consistent, reliable pulse in the heart of the city that made him."

The kid wrinkled his nose. \u201cSmells weird,\u201d he said, looking at the dried mushrooms. Liang\u2019s face burned with a familiar shame, but his father just offered a polite, unbothered smile. In that moment, Liang saw his father\u2019s dignity not as weakness, but as a quiet, powerful armor. It was the first time he understood the strength required to build a life in a world that saw you as foreign.\n\n2.\nThe official Muni envelope felt impossibly heavy. At 28, with Mei recently his wife, the future felt like a San Francisco fogbank, thick and uncertain. They sat at their small kitchen table as he read the acceptance letter. Her quiet hand covered his, and he felt the tension drain from his shoulders for the first time in years. It wasn\u2019t a dream job, but it was a foundation. It was the moment he stopped drifting and started building a life he could count on.\n\n3.\nAn elderly Filipina woman, who got on his 22-Fillmore bus every Tuesday, once pressed a small, warm *pan de sal* into his palm as she exited. \"For you, driver,\" she said, her smile missing a few teeth. He was just a man in a uniform, a constant, faceless presence. But in that small, unexpected act of kindness, Liang felt seen. It cemented his purpose: he wasn\u2019t just navigating streets, he was carrying the city\u2019s heart, one passenger at a time. It was a responsibility he held with quiet honor.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the night he and Mei made Evelyn\u2019s first tuition payment to UC Davis. The number on the screen was staggering, a sum that represented years of pre-dawn alarms and traffic-choked afternoons. He clicked \u2018confirm,\u2019 and the screen showed \u201cPayment Received.\u201d He looked at Mei, whose eyes were shimmering. All the long hours and difficult passengers funneled into that single, satisfying moment. His hard work had become his daughter's open door, a future he could never have imagined for himself.\n\n5.\nLast spring, on a rare Sunday off, Mei was looking through a travel magazine. She pointed to a picture of an RV parked beneath the giant sequoias. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said softly, her voice full of a future he was working toward. Liang sat beside her on the sofa, the city\u2019s noise a distant hum. In that quiet moment, looking at the photo, the future wasn\u2019t about schedules and stop requests, but about open roads. It was a shared promise: after a lifetime of service, they would have a piece of the world just for themselves."
