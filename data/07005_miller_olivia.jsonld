The daughter of a compassionate Filipina nurse and a quiet, steadfast Maltese-American mechanic, Olivia grew up in a home filled with the aromas of both adobo and pastizzi. She was the family\u2019s resident translator, navigating complex medical appointments for her grandmother and witnessing firsthand the gaps in a healthcare system that often overlooked cultural nuances. This early exposure to systemic failures planted the seed for her future.\n\nHer educational journey was a direct response to this calling. After earning her bachelor's at SF State, she pursued a Master of Social Work, determined to become the advocate her family never had. Her early career was spent in the chaotic trenches of a downtown hospital, where she honed her skills amidst crises and burnout. The pandemic, however, became an unexpected turning point. The system pivoted to telehealth, and Olivia discovered a new, more sustainable way to work.\n\nNow, at 31, Olivia\u2019s commute is the few steps from her bed to her desk. From her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, looking out over the quiet residential streets, she serves as a digital bridge to her clients across the city. Her days are a series of back-to-back virtual sessions, providing therapy to individuals grappling with illness, grief, and trauma. Decompressing is essential; she\u2019ll take a quick lunch break for dumplings on Clement Street or end her day with a long, grounding run through Golden Gate Park, letting the eucalyptus-scented air clear her mind.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, a chosen family she connects with over weekend hikes in the Headlands rather than late nights out. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, she is pouring her energy into her work and herself. Olivia\u2019s dream is to open her own private practice focused on providing culturally competent mental healthcare for the AAPI community. She envisions a space that feels less clinical and more like a community sanctuary\u2014a true reflection of her San Francisco, a city she knows not as a glittering destination, but as a complex, diverse home."
