            "value": "Michael O\u2019Connell was born Park Min-jun in Seoul, South Korea. At eighteen months old, he was adopted by a warm, boisterous Irish-American couple from Daly City who gave him their name and their unwavering love. Growing up, Michael\u2019s life was a study in loving contrasts: kimchi and shepherd's pie, the serene faces on his grandmother\u2019s Korean scrolls and the Celtic crosses on the wall. While he cherished his parents, his adolescence was marked by a quiet, internal struggle to reconcile the face in the mirror with the name he answered to.\n\nThis profound search for identity shaped his academic path. He pursued psychology at UC Berkeley, driven to understand the complex interplay of nature, nurture, and culture. The theoretical framework wasn't enough; he felt a calling to apply his insights directly. He earned a Master of Social Work, finding his purpose in helping others navigate their own tangled histories. Now, at 48, Michael is a respected Licensed Clinical Social Worker, specializing in trauma, addiction, and identity issues within a large healthcare system.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a shift to telehealth that suits his introspective nature. From a calm, minimalist office in his Inner Richmond apartment, he holds space for his patients\u2019 stories. His days have a gentle rhythm: a strong coffee from a local cafe, a block of virtual sessions, and an afternoon walk through Golden Gate Park to decompress. He has a small, trusted circle of friends, a mix of fellow therapists and old college buddies, with whom he shares dinners and hikes.\n\nHaving made a painful, unsuccessful attempt to find his birth family in his thirties, Michael has since found peace in the unknowns of his past. His aspiration is no longer to complete his origin story, but to deepen his expertise and mentor younger therapists, particularly those from immigrant or adoptee backgrounds. San Francisco, with its confluence of cultures, provides the perfect backdrop. For Michael, living in the Inner Richmond isn't just a choice; it's a quiet acknowledgment of the person he has become\u2014a man who built his own sense of home, right where he stands."

            "value": "1.\nHe was fourteen, pulling the thick, cream-colored Aran sweater his mom bought him over his head for the St. Patrick's Day parade. He caught his reflection in the hallway mirror\u2014the dark, almond-shaped eyes, the face so clearly not from Donegal. It wasn\u2019t sadness, but a sudden, stark disconnect. In that moment, the loving name \u2018Michael O\u2019Connell\u2019 felt like a borrowed coat. It was the first time his internal questions felt loud, setting him on a path to understand the space between his name and his face.\n\n2.\nHe remembers a specific psychology lecture in Wheeler Hall at Berkeley, sometime around his twentieth birthday. The professor was discussing attachment theory in the context of transracial adoption. As the academic terms filled the air, Michael felt a tremor of recognition. His private, tangled feelings were being laid out as a legitimate field of study. It was a profound validation that transformed his personal quest into a professional calling, giving him a framework for a life he struggled to articulate.\n\n3.\nThe email from the Seoul agency arrived at 2 AM. He was thirty-two. The message was brief, professional, and final: no records could be found. He stared at the screen in his apartment, the blue light illuminating a profound emptiness. It felt like a door to a possible version of his life slamming shut forever. The grief was immense, but in its wake, years later, came a quiet liberation\u2014the freedom to build his own story from the ground up, without a missing first chapter.\n\n4.\nHe was forty, sitting across from a young client, a teenager adopted from Vietnam who spoke of feeling like a \u2018ghost\u2019 in his own family. Michael simply nodded and shared a small, carefully chosen piece of his own experience. He saw the boy\u2019s shoulders relax, a flicker of recognition in his eyes. In that shared silence of understanding, Michael felt his own fractured history coalesce into something purposeful. His past wasn't a burden to be solved, but a bridge to connect with another soul.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in, he felt a profound sense of peace. He wasn\u2019t Park Min-jun searching for a past, or Michael O\u2019Connell trying to fit in. He was simply a man walking home. This city, this park, this quiet life\u2014they were not inherited, but chosen and built. He felt the weight of his own belonging, a foundation he had laid himself, stone by quiet stone, right here in the Inner Richmond."
