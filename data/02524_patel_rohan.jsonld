The son of Gujarati immigrants, his childhood was a familiar narrative of high expectations. His father, a successful software engineer, envisioned a similar path for Rohan, pushing him toward practical, stable careers.\n\nRohan dutifully pursued an undergraduate degree in Urban Studies at UC Berkeley, but his heart was never in it. The turning point had come years earlier, on a family trip to India. Standing before the intricate stepwells and latticed havelis of his ancestral Gujarat, he was captivated not by their history, but by their design\u2014the interplay of light, shadow, and community. That memory became his quiet rebellion. Against his family's gentle protests, he enrolled in a Master of Architecture program at the California College of the Arts (CCA), fully immersing himself in the city he had only ever admired from across the bay.\n\nNow 27, Rohan works as a Junior Architect for a small, prestigious firm specializing in the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. His 0.0-mile commute is the envy of his friends; he lives in a high-ceilinged loft apartment directly above the firm's studio in a converted warehouse. His days begin with a run along the waterfront at Crane Cove Park before he heads downstairs to a world of blueprints and 3D models. He thrives on the challenge of weaving modern sustainability into the architectural soul of a bygone era.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow CCA alumni\u2014graphic designers, artists, and industrial designers\u2014who share his passion for aesthetics and creation. Evenings are often spent at a local brewery discussing projects or simply sketching in his journal, his true passion. Rohan feels an immense connection to San Francisco, seeing it as a living canvas. His ultimate dream isn't to design a new skyscraper, but to lead the restoration of a forgotten public space, leaving a subtle but lasting mark that honors the city\u2019s past while building its future."
