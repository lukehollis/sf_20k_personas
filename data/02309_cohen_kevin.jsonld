Raised in the quiet suburbs of the East Bay by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing librarian mother, Kevin was a cinephile from a young age. He pursued this passion at UC Santa Cruz, earning a Bachelor's degree in Film and Digital Media, imagining a future as a screenwriter or indie director.\n\nHowever, post-graduation reality proved harsh. The creative industry was fiercely competitive, and the need to pay rent in the city was immediate. After a string of unfulfilling cafe and retail jobs, a temporary offer came through a family friend: assisting a property manager. The work was steady, grounded, and kept him in the city he\u2019d grown to love. The temporary gig slowly, imperceptibly, became his career.\n\nThe major turning point came six years ago when he was offered the on-site assistant manager role in a handsome, pre-war apartment building in the Marina. The position came with a small apartment, reducing his commute to zero and solving his housing anxieties. But it also fused his personal and professional lives. He now lives where he works, a constant presence who knows the building's every groan and its tenants' every minor complaint.\n\nHis days are a predictable rhythm of coordinating repairs, showing vacant units, and mediating noise disputes. He is friendly but maintains a professional distance, known by everyone but truly known by few. His social life consists of a small circle of college friends and bi-weekly trivia at a neighborhood pub.\n\nAt 35, Kevin feels a quiet sense of stagnation. The film degree certificate is tucked away in a closet, a relic of a different man. Yet, his dream isn't entirely extinguished. Late at night, after the last maintenance email is answered, he sometimes opens a screenwriting app, outlining scenes inspired by the lives swirling around him. He hopes to save enough to one day produce his own short film, a tangible proof that the storyteller still exists within the property manager. He is a quiet fixture of his building, a manager of spaces, aspiring to become the architect of his own narrative once more."
