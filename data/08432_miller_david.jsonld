Born in the Outer Richmond to a Filipino mother, a registered nurse, and an Armenian father, a precise and quiet watchmaker, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of gentle care and meticulous craft. He was a pensive child, inheriting his mother\u2019s empathy and his father\u2019s talent for understanding how things work. He spent his youth sketching intricate designs for fantastical machines and helping his father repair delicate timepieces.\n\nHis path seemed set for a creative field. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the industrial design program at City College, his mind buzzing with ideas. However, in his second year, his father suffered a debilitating stroke. The watch shop closed, and the family\u2019s finances crumbled. David dropped out of college to find steady work, and his mother, through her hospital connections, found him an opening in the maintenance department. What began as a temporary solution became a career.\n\nFor over two decades, David has been the silent guardian of the hospital\u2019s mechanical heartbeat. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his small, subsidized apartment on the hospital campus to the cavernous basement floors. He knows the building\u2019s anatomy better than anyone\u2014the hum of the backup generators, the hiss of the steam pipes, the specific groan of the third-floor elevator. During the pandemic, while doctors and nurses fought the virus, David fought entropy, ensuring ventilators had power and air filtration systems never failed. It was the most purposeful he had ever felt.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is solitary but not lonely. His closest connections are with the night-shift nurses and security guards, a nocturnal family who share coffee in the quiet hours. He remains a native San Franciscan whose city isn't the Golden Gate Bridge or tech campuses, but the intricate network of pipes and wires that sustain life within the hospital walls. In his spare time, he still sketches, filling notebooks with designs for elegant, useless machines. His quiet dream is to one day have a small workshop of his own, not for profit, but simply to build one beautiful thing that doesn\u2019t have to keep anyone alive."
