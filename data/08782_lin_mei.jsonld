The daughter of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up in a small apartment above her parents' bustling herbal medicine shop. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the scent of ginseng, balanced with the expectations of American success. Her parents, who sacrificed everything for a foothold in the city, envisioned a future for her in business or technology\u2014a secure path far from their own daily toil.\n\nTo please them, Mei enrolled at City College of San Francisco, dutifully starting on a business track. However, she felt adrift in classes filled with balance sheets and marketing plans. She switched majors, eventually graduating with a general Associate\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts, feeling more lost than ever. For a year, she worked part-time at her parents\u2019 shop, the quiet order of the medicinal drawers a stark contrast to her own internal uncertainty.\n\nThe turning point came unexpectedly. A neighbor needed last-minute childcare, and Mei spent a chaotic, crayon-stained afternoon with two toddlers. In their unfiltered curiosity and boundless energy, she found a sense of purpose that had always eluded her. It was a revelation. Soon after, she enrolled in Early Childhood Education courses and earned her assistant teacher permit.\n\nNow, at 28, Mei\u2019s life is deeply woven into the community that raised her. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her small studio apartment to a bilingual Mandarin-English preschool just a block away. Her days are a whirlwind of storytelling, mediating disputes over toy blocks, and wiping away tears. In the afternoons, she often takes her class for a walk in Golden Gate Park, pointing out the same bison and windmills that fascinated her as a child.\n\nHer relationship with her parents remains one of loving complexity; they are proud of her happiness but quietly wish for more financial security for her. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of neighborhood friends. Mei\u2019s dream is to one day become a lead teacher and eventually open her own small, play-based preschool in the Richmond, a place that feels like a true extension of home. She finds her joy not in climbing a corporate ladder, but in nurturing the city\u2019s next generation, one story at a time."
