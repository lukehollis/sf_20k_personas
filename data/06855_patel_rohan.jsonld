His father, a meticulous software engineer, and his mother, a warm homemaker, instilled in him the value of education as the ultimate path to success. Rohan excelled, and by his second year at UC Davis, he was well on his way down the pre-med track, studying biochemistry with a clear vision of a doctor's white coat in his future.\n\nThe turning point came swiftly and without mercy. During his junior year, his mother was diagnosed with a rapidly progressing form of ALS. The theoretical world of textbooks and lab reports crumbled as Rohan witnessed the raw, daily reality of illness. He saw the profound impact of the healthcare aides who visited their home, their quiet competence and deep compassion a stark contrast to the clinical detachment of specialists. He left Davis mid-semester to become one of his mother\u2019s primary caregivers, a decision that initially fractured his relationship with his devastated father.\n\nAfter his mother passed away, the thought of returning to the abstract world of biochemistry felt impossible. The experience had rewired him; he now found meaning not in prestige, but in direct, tangible care. He earned his certification as a healthcare aide and found a unique position that solved the Bay Area's punishing housing costs: a live-in role in San Francisco.\n\nToday, Rohan lives in a quiet, second-floor apartment in Cole Valley, which also serves as his workplace. His commute is the ten steps from his small bedroom to the living room of his client, an 88-year-old retired history professor with Parkinson\u2019s. Rohan\u2019s days are a structured routine of medication schedules, meal preparation, physical assistance, and providing companionship, reading aloud from the professor's vast library. His connection to the city isn't through its vibrant nightlife but through foggy morning walks in Golden Gate Park and quiet errands on Cole Street. He dreams of eventually attending nursing school, not to chase a high salary, but to deepen the skills he learned at his mother\u2019s bedside. His work is his tribute, a daily act of honoring the woman who unknowingly set him on his true path."
