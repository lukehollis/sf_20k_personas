Raised in a working-class Irish-American family in South Boston, he was the son of a contractor who saw buildings in terms of concrete, rebar, and budgets. Liam, however, saw them as light, shadow, and human experience. While his father hoped he\u2019d take over the family business, Liam was busy sketching cathedrals and drafting impossible, beautiful structures in his notebooks. This divergence led him to pursue a Master of Architecture at Yale, where he specialized not in corporate towers, but in the spaces that house art and culture.\n\nHis early career took him to a prestigious New York firm, but he felt stifled designing sterile bank lobbies. The turning point came when he was headhunted by a boutique San Francisco firm renowned for its innovative museum and gallery designs. He moved west, drawn by the city\u2019s embrace of creative risk. For years, he thrived in their SoMa office, but the forced isolation of the pandemic offered an unexpected revelation. He discovered a profound focus and creative freedom working from home. He successfully negotiated a permanent remote position, cementing his role as a trusted senior architect.\n\nNow, Liam\u2019s world is centered in his Hayes Valley loft, a space that is both his home and his studio. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his espresso machine to his drafting table, which overlooks the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant street life. His days are a disciplined routine of deep work, punctuated by walks to Patricia's Green for inspiration or to grab a coffee from a local roaster. He has a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a product designer, a symphony musician, and a chef\u2014with whom he shares dinners and gallery visits.\n\nThough content, Liam aspires for more. He dreams of designing a landmark cultural institution in San Francisco, a building that becomes as much a piece of public art as the work it contains. He feels a deep connection to the city\u2019s creative pulse and yearns to leave a permanent, elegant mark on the skyline that has become his home."
