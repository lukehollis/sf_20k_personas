Raised in a union-heavy suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, his father was a pragmatic factory foreman who valued tangible work and a steady paycheck. David, however, was a contemplative youth, drawn more to ideas than machines. He pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Philosophy at Ohio State, a choice that baffled his parents but satisfied his desire to understand the \"why\" behind everything.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in 1998, lured not by a grand plan but by a friend\u2019s promise of opportunity during the dot-com boom. With no technical skills, he landed a job in customer support, then as a project coordinator. He discovered his philosophy degree had given him an unexpected edge: the ability to deconstruct complex problems, identify inefficiencies, and build logical systems. He wasn't a coder, but he could make the coders\u2019 work flow. This became his niche. He survived the dot-com bust by being indispensable and slowly climbed the ladder to his current role as an Operations Manager.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce a decade ago. The split was amicable but left him with a quiet, orderly apartment in the Inner Richmond and a newfound solitude. When his company went fully remote during the pandemic, his 0.0-mile commute cemented his home as his world. His days are now a predictable rhythm of Zoom calls, workflow diagrams, and managing global teams from his standing desk overlooking the fog-dusted avenues.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is that of a long-term observer. He misses the grittier, more eccentric city he first met but appreciates the proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he takes long, contemplative walks. He\u2019s part of the tech engine but feels detached from its relentless hype. His hope is not for a promotion, but for disconnection. He dreams of taking a sabbatical to a place with poor internet, reconnecting with his philosophical roots not through texts but through experience, and perhaps finally finding a personal project that is beautifully, inefficiently, and tangibly his own."
