The only child of Lebanese immigrants, she grew up amidst the scent of spices and the hum of sewing machines in her parents' small fabric shop in Daly City. While her parents built a life through tangible goods, Samira found her refuge in the orderly, quiet aisles of the public library. Stories, cataloged and preserved, felt more permanent and trustworthy to her than the shifting fortunes of retail.\n\nThis love for order led her to San Jose State University for a degree in Library and Information Science. Her early career was in traditional library settings, but a pivotal project in the late 90s changed her trajectory. Tasked with digitizing a fragile collection of photographs documenting San Francisco\u2019s Arab-American community from the 1950s, she found her calling. In the silent flicker of the scanner, she wasn\u2019t just preserving images; she was saving her own history from fading. She became a Digital Archivist, a bridge between the analog past and the digital forever.\n\nNow 47, Samira lives a life of deliberate routine in the Inner Richmond. Her modest apartment, filled with books and neatly organized hard drives, is her sanctuary. Her 1.6-mile commute is a ritual: a short walk to the bus stop, followed by a ride where she observes the city's daily drama. At work, she meticulously curates digital collections for a prominent historical society, ensuring that the stories of artists, activists, and everyday people are not lost to bit rot or neglect.\n\nHer social life is small but deep: a monthly book club with fellow librarians and a standing Friday dinner with two close friends. She is contentedly single, her most profound relationships being with the ghosts in her archives. Samira loves San Francisco not for its disruptive tech, but for its layers of history. Her dream is to spearhead a major project: a publicly accessible digital archive of the city\u2019s vanishing neighborhoods, an effort to save the soul of the San Francisco she cherishes before it\u2019s completely overwritten."

The whir of the sewing machine was a constant, frantic buzz. She pulled a book from her satchel\u2014a library copy of *A Wrinkle in Time*\u2014and the crisp scent of paper and glue was a shield. In that moment, nestled between bolts of silk, she knew she preferred the quiet, ordered world of the page. It was the beginning of her lifelong search for sanctuary in structure.\n\n2.\nThe scanner\u2019s green light passed over the photograph in 1998. It was a family, dressed in their Sunday best, standing proudly outside their small grocery store in the Mission. The woman\u2019s face, her expression of weary hope, was so much like her Teta\u2019s. A sob caught in Samira\u2019s throat. This wasn't just a job digitizing fragile silver gelatin prints anymore. It was an act of reclamation, of pulling her own history\u2014the history of immigrants who build a world with their hands\u2014out of the fading light and into permanence.\n\n3.\nOn a Tuesday morning five years ago, her MUNI bus stopped in front of the old Italian bakery she loved. But instead of the familiar glow and scent of bread, the windows were papered over with a stark, white notice. For Lease. A sleek, glass-fronted building loomed next door. A quiet, hollow ache filled her chest, an anger that felt like grief. This was when her dream of an archive for vanishing neighborhoods became an urgent, necessary mission. The city was erasing its own memory, and she realized she had to be its scribe.\n\n4.\nShe was 38, on a date with a man who talked excitedly about \"disrupting the legacy space\" of urban planning. He looked at her with polite confusion when she spoke of the souls of old buildings. \"But it's just inefficient real estate,\" he\u2019d said, smiling. In that moment, she felt no disappointment, only a profound clarity. She understood then that her most intimate relationships were with the ghosts in her archives. Their stories held more weight and truth for her than any conversation about the future. Her contentment in solitude felt less like a choice and more like a calling.\n\n5.\nLast year, while processing a new collection, she held a single letter written by a long-gone Beat poet to his lover. His looping, frantic script described the specific grey of the fog rolling over Potrero Hill and the taste of cheap coffee at a North Beach cafe. It was so vivid, so alive, she could almost smell the rain on the pavement. This single piece of paper held more of the city\u2019s true soul than a thousand polished Instagram posts. It solidified her conviction: she wasn\u2019t just archiving data, she was preserving feelings."
