Born in Sacramento to a pragmatic high school history teacher and a perpetually optimistic, if not always successful, potter, Rebecca was raised on a diet of loving, chaotic intellectualism. She was the one who kept the family organized, the quiet anchor in their creatively messy home.\n\nDrawn by its bohemian allure, she moved to San Francisco in the early 1990s to study Art History at San Francisco State University. However, the theoretical world of academia felt disconnected from the vibrant, tangible city life she craved. When her father fell ill, she took what she thought was a temporary waitressing job in North Beach to help with bills. It was a turning point. She traded textbooks for an order pad and discovered her true calling not in hushed galleries, but in the bustling theater of a busy restaurant. The immediate feedback, the camaraderie of the staff, and the satisfaction of a perfectly executed dinner service were intoxicating. She never went back to college.\n\nRebecca\u2019s ascent was steady and earned. She learned every station, from host to bartender to expediter, eventually becoming the indispensable manager of \u201cCaffe Emilio,\u201d a beloved neighborhood Italian bistro. The restaurant\u2019s elderly owner, seeing her unwavering dedication, offered her the small apartment above the establishment. For the past fifteen years, her commute has been a single flight of stairs.\n\nHer personal life is woven into the fabric of the restaurant. Her staff are her chosen family, and many regulars have become close confidants. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, unable to compete with the relentless demands of her profession. Now, at 49, her days are a familiar rhythm: waking to the clatter of morning prep, handling inventory, managing staff, and ending the night by locking the front door long after the last patron has gone. Rebecca's dream isn't to escape this life, but to own it. She is slowly saving every dollar, hoping to one day buy Caffe Emilio and ensure its legacy\u2014and her own\u2014is cemented in the heart of the city she truly calls home."
