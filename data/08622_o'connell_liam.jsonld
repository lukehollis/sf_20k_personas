The son of a gregarious Irish-American longshoreman from Boston and a quiet, stoic first-generation Filipina nurse, he grew up in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento. His childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s booming laughter and his mother\u2019s intricate cooking, a constant navigation between two cultures. This duality, coupled with a youth spent in beige subdivisions connected only by freeways, sparked an early fascination with how places shape people. He saw the isolation baked into car-dependent life and yearned for something more connected.\n\nThis drive led him to pursue a Master\u2019s in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, where he fell in love with the complex, chaotic ballet of a dense city. He wrote his thesis on equitable transit access, arguing that a bus route could be a more powerful tool for social mobility than a tax credit. Landing a coveted position as a Transportation Planner for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) felt like the culmination of his life\u2019s mission.\n\nThe key turning point, however, was unforeseen. Just as he was beginning to immerse himself in the city\u2019s rhythms, the world shifted to remote work. Now, Liam\u2019s commute is a 0.0-mile walk from his bed to his desk in his Inner Richmond apartment. The irony is not lost on him: he spends his days analyzing traffic flows, designing protected bike lanes for Arguello Boulevard, and rerouting MUNI lines, all from the sterile glow of a monitor. He plans a city he rarely moves through during work hours.\n\nTo combat this digital detachment, Liam\u2019s personal life is aggressively analog. He takes the 38 Geary bus just to feel its lumbering pace. He and his partner, Maya, a landscape architect, spend weekends exploring neighborhoods on foot, critiquing parklet designs and debating the merits of different street layouts. His dream is no longer just to have a successful career, but to close the gap between policy and pavement. He longs to stand on a corner and see one of his projects\u2014a truly efficient, beautiful, and equitable transit solution\u2014come to life, finally connecting his work to the city he has chosen as his own."
