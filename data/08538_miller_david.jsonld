Raised in a Cleveland suburb, he was the son of a steelworker father and a librarian mother. His childhood was shadowed by the ghost of decaying industry; he saw firsthand how inefficient processes and a failure to adapt could hollow out a community. This instilled in him a deep-seated need to fix what was broken, to make things work better.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning, initially believing he could revitalize cities like his own. However, he grew disillusioned with the slow pace of public sector bureaucracy. A pivotal internship with a civic tech startup changed his trajectory. He saw how technology could identify and solve systemic problems with a speed and scale that government work couldn't match. He pivoted, self-teaching coding and systems analysis, and landed a job in San Francisco as a Process Improvement Engineer.\n\nNow 32, David lives and works in a small, meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are highly structured. A 6 AM run in Golden Gate Park is followed by focused work, where he untangles complex workflows and streamlines digital infrastructure for a major tech firm. He finds a quiet satisfaction in his job, viewing each inefficient process as a puzzle to be solved\u2014a digital echo of the broken factories of his youth.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is dualistic. He loves the city\u2019s energy and access to nature but is wary of the tech monoculture. He chose the Inner Richmond for its authentic, neighborhood feel, a welcome contrast to the sterile efficiency of Silicon Valley. His social circle is small and tight-knit, built around his running club and a shared appreciation for the city's hidden culinary gems. David\u2019s hope is to one day apply his skills outside the corporate world, perhaps for a nonprofit or a municipal project, finally bridging the gap between his technological expertise and his original dream of building better, more humane systems for people to live in."
