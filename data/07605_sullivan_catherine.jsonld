            "value": "Catherine Sullivan\u2019s polished demeanor and strategic mind were not forged in a business school, but on the stages of Off-Broadway. Born to a family of Irish-American electricians and secretaries in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Catherine\u2019s ambition was always aimed at a larger world. She defied her family\u2019s practical expectations by pursuing an MFA in Theatre Arts from NYU, mastering not just performance but the art of commanding a room and understanding human motivation\u2014skills that would become her secret weapon.\n\nHer pivot to management consulting in her late twenties was less a career change than a change of venue. She found the corporate world was just another form of theatre, and she was a natural director. For two decades, Catherine was a road warrior, living out of sleek, anonymous hotels from London to Tokyo. She built a formidable reputation for untangling complex organizational knots, her success measured in airline status and six-figure bonuses. But around her 48th birthday, during a lonely layover in Dubai, she realized she had perfected a life she no longer wanted.\n\nThis epiphany was her turning point. Leveraging her senior partner status, Catherine negotiated a fully remote role, a radical move in her firm at the time. She sold her sterile high-rise condo and bought a beautiful Edwardian flat in Cole Valley, a neighborhood she\u2019d always admired for its village-like charm. Her 0.0-mile commute became a deliberate act of claiming her life back.\n\nNow, at 51, her days are structured by choice, not by flight schedules. Mornings begin with a walk through the Panhandle to a local cafe, followed by intense, focused work blocks from her sunlit home office overlooking Kezar Stadium. She is rediscovering her own city, building friendships with neighbors and becoming a regular at the local bookstore. Her social life is a small, curated circle of old friends. Having conquered the corporate world, Catherine\u2019s new aspiration is to find meaning. She\u2019s begun doing pro-bono strategy work for a small Mission District theatre company, feeling the pull of her first love. Her dream is no longer about the next promotion, but about building a legacy of mentorship and integrating the artist and the strategist she has always been."
