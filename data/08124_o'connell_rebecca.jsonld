The only child of a literature professor and a research librarian, her childhood was a quiet world of towering bookshelves and thoughtful dinner-table debates. Words and structure were the twin pillars of her upbringing, shaping a mind that was both creative and meticulously organized. This led her to pursue a Master\u2019s in Library and Information Science, a seemingly traditional path that she saw as the ultimate challenge: taming the chaos of information.\n\nShe arrived in the Bay Area in her late twenties, drawn by the digital gold rush. While her peers were coding, Rebecca found her niche translating her academic skills to the burgeoning tech landscape. She discovered that a company\u2019s sprawling, messy internal content needed an architect just as much as a library did. She became a Content Strategist, building logical, intuitive systems out of digital disorder. Her career flourished as she moved from scrappy startups to her current role at a major tech firm, all accomplished from the quiet of her Cole Valley condo.\n\nA key turning point came in her mid-thirties with the amicable end of a long-term relationship. The split was a quiet earthquake that reshaped her life. Instead of moving out, she bought out her partner\u2019s half of their shared condo, a definitive act of claiming her space and independence. This solidified her connection to her neighborhood, a place she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its village-like feel.\n\nHer days, free from a commute, have a deliberate rhythm. A morning walk with her rescue terrier, Leo, is followed by hours of focused work, her apartment a silent command center. Evenings are for disconnecting: a pottery class, a book club with friends who have become her chosen family, or simply cooking a meal while listening to a history podcast. Rebecca loves San Francisco for its restless energy, a force she can engage with on her own terms before retreating to her ordered world. Her future aspiration is to turn her strategic skills inward, finally outlining the novel that has lived in her mind for years\u2014a new, more personal chaos to tame."
