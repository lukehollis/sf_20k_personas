Raised in Naperville, Illinois, by a high school teacher mother and an accountant father, his upbringing was one of stability, routine, and clear expectations. Ryan, however, was drawn to the sprawling, messy narratives of the past. He pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History at the University of Illinois, a choice his parents supported but quietly questioned in terms of career prospects.\n\nThe pivotal turn in his life was not a career plan but a relationship. At 23, he followed his college girlfriend to the Bay Area when she was accepted into a PhD program at UC Berkeley. While she immersed herself in academia, Ryan needed to find work. He took a temp job as an office assistant at a burgeoning tech startup and discovered an unexpected talent for organizing the creative chaos of engineers and designers. He was methodical, a good listener, and adept at translating big ideas into actionable steps\u2014skills honed by years of analyzing historical events. The relationship eventually faded, a casualty of divergent paths, but Ryan had found his footing. He stayed, leveraging his experience into a full-time Project Coordinator role.\n\nNow at 30, Ryan lives a life contained within the foggy confines of his Richmond District apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured by Slack notifications and Jira boards rather than MUNI schedules. Mornings start with coffee from a local roaster, poured into a mug as he logs on. He often takes his lunch break with a walk through Golden Gate Park, a necessary escape from his screen. To combat work-from-home isolation, he found community at a bouldering gym in the Mission, where the physical problem-solving offers a satisfying contrast to his digital work.\n\nThough comfortable, Ryan feels a persistent, low-level sense of being adrift. His history degree gathers dust on a shelf, a reminder of a passion he rarely indulges. He\u2019s good at his job but doesn\u2019t love it. His aspiration isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a project\u2014or a person\u2014that ignites a deeper sense of purpose. He dreams of finding a way to connect his organizational skills with something more meaningful, perhaps volunteering for a local historical society, and building a life in San Francisco that feels less like a chapter he fell into and more like a story he\u2019s actively writing."
