His father, a gifted and sought-after handyman, could diagnose a building\u2019s ailment by sound alone. His mother, a middle school administrator, managed chaos with color-coded binders and unwavering calm. Deion grew up absorbing both lessons: how to fix a faulty switch and how to manage the person complaining about it.\n\nHe enrolled at Laney College with a vague interest in sociology, but the classroom felt abstract compared to the tangible satisfaction of a job well done. When his father suffered a back injury that forced him into early retirement, Deion left school without a second thought. He took over his dad\u2019s list of clients, quickly earning a reputation for reliability and a calm, reassuring demeanor.\n\nThe turning point came when a property management company, impressed by his work at one of their buildings, offered him a full-time position. He started in maintenance, but his knack for scheduling vendors and communicating with residents saw him promoted to Facilities Coordinator. The real prize was the job offer that brought him across the bay: a management role at a new, amenity-rich residential high-rise in SoMa, which included a company apartment. His commute became the length of an elevator ride.\n\nNow 32, Deion\u2019s life unfolds within the building\u2019s ecosystem. His day starts with a 6 AM walkthrough, checking the boiler room, the rooftop deck, and the gym. He is the quiet authority figure who knows every resident by name, every mechanical quirk, and which plumber to call for any emergency. His social life is a careful balancing act; he\u2019s friendly with residents but maintains a professional distance. For true connection, he meets up with old friends from Oakland for basketball at a Mission District court on Sundays.\n\nIn the quiet of his apartment, surrounded by the hum of the building he manages, Deion nurtures a private dream. He sees the wealth around him not with envy, but with curiosity. He\u2019s saving aggressively and studying for his real estate license online. He doesn\u2019t just want to coordinate the facilities; one day, he wants to own the building."

His dad didn\u2019t just show him how to replace the gasket; he made Deion listen to the \"hiss before the drip,\" teaching him that every problem has a sound. The satisfaction of the resulting silence was profound. It wasn't just a repair; it was a translation. That day, he learned that competence was a quiet, powerful language he wanted to speak fluently.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the exact spot in the Laney College library where he took his mom\u2019s call. He was 19, a sociology textbook open but unread. Her voice was steady, but he heard the tremor underneath. \"Your father... a fall.\" In that sterile silence, the abstract theories on the page dissolved. His path wasn't in a book; it was in his dad's overflowing toolbox and the list of clients who depended on him. The decision to leave school wasn\u2019t a sacrifice; it felt like a homecoming, a return to what was real and necessary.\n\n3.\nAt 26, he stood at Jack London Square, phone still warm after accepting the SoMa job. The city skyline across the water looked like a different planet, all glass and ambition. It wasn't just a promotion; it felt like a passport. He was being invited inside a world he'd only ever fixed from the outside. The promise of living there, in the heart of the machine, sparked a thrilling, terrifying sense of arrival. He felt the distance between the two shores not as miles, but as a measure of his own life changing.\n\n4.\nThe fire alarm at 2 AM was a burst water line on the 28th floor. As residents huddled in the lobby, a mix of panic and annoyance, a strange calm descended upon him. He moved through the crowd, voice low and reassuring, while coordinating the emergency plumber on his phone. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t just Deion; he was the building's central nervous system. He managed the fear as much as the flood, realizing his true job was to be the singular point of order in their collective chaos.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a Sunday night, he was looking out his apartment window after a day of basketball with his friends. He saw a resident\u2014a tech exec he\u2019d helped with a faulty thermostat that morning\u2014get into a car worth more than his father had made in a decade. There was no bitterness. Instead, a cool curiosity took hold. He wasn\u2019t just looking at wealth; he was looking at an system. He understood its mechanics, its costs, its vulnerabilities. That\u2019s when the dream crystallized: Don\u2019t just run the building. Own it."
