The son of an architect father and a librarian mother, his upbringing was one of ordered creativity and quiet intellectualism. He was expected to follow a stable path, and for a time, he tried. He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, choosing History as a major\u2014a field that felt both respectable and satisfying to his innate curiosity about how things came to be.\n\nThe turning point was not a grand epiphany, but a summer job. Needing money, he took a position helping set up for a massive outdoor music and arts festival. Amid the logistical chaos of scheduling volunteer crews, coordinating with sound engineers, and ensuring portable toilets arrived on time, David discovered a surprising talent: he was brilliant at organizing chaos. He thrived on the pressure, finding deep satisfaction in being the invisible hand that made the spectacle possible.\n\nAfter graduating, he eschewed grad school and instead moved to Chicago, taking an entry-level job with a small avant-garde theater company. This was his true education. He learned lighting grids, union rules, and how to stretch a budget until it screamed. He climbed the ranks from stagehand to assistant manager, his reputation growing as the calm, unflappable guy who could solve any problem.\n\nTen years ago, he followed a job opportunity and a relationship to San Francisco. While the relationship eventually dissolved, his love for the city\u2019s vibrant, tech-infused art scene only deepened. He now lives in a spacious live/work loft in SoMa, making his 0.0-mile commute a dream. His days are a flurry of spreadsheets, vendor calls, and meetings with sculptors, choreographers, and coders creating interactive installations.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow arts professionals and tech workers who appreciate his world. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or obscure performances\u2014part work, part pleasure. Though content, David harbors a quiet ambition. He dreams of launching his own production company, one dedicated to fostering large-scale, immersive public art projects that could only exist in a city as strange and beautiful as San Francisco."
