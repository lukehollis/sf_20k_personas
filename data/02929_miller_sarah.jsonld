Raised by a practical accountant father and a nurturing high school teacher mother, Sarah was a bookish child who always had her nose in a novel. They were supportive but slightly bewildered when she chose to major in English Literature at the University of Oregon, worrying about her job prospects.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was accidental. After graduating, she took an administrative assistant role at a small Portland startup simply to pay the bills. There, amidst the chaotic energy of software engineers and designers, she discovered a hidden talent: she could translate their technical jargon into clear, actionable plans and bring order to their creative chaos. This was her turning point. Seeing a new path, she devoured online courses in Agile methodologies and project management, leveraging her communication skills to climb from admin to project coordinator.\n\nSeven years ago, drawn by the industry\u2019s gravitational center, she moved to San Francisco for a project manager position. Today, she lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step shuffle from bed to her standing desk, a routine solidified by the pandemic that her company has since made permanent. Her days are a blur of Slack notifications, Zoom stand-ups, and meticulously updated Gantt charts.\n\nTo combat the isolation of remote work, Sarah has built a life firmly rooted in her neighborhood. Every morning, she runs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, and she religiously gets her afternoon coffee from a small Clement Street caf\u00e9, cherishing the brief, familiar interactions. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of friends from a pottery class and a former colleague, with whom she explores the city's diverse food scene.\n\nThough successful, Sarah yearns for something more tangible than a completed software sprint. She dreams of leading a team that builds tech for social good, and perhaps one day finding a partner to share her quiet, structured life with. Her ultimate aspiration is to buy a small condo in the city, a goal that feels both daunting and deeply necessary to finally put down permanent roots in the place she now calls home."
