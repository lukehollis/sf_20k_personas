The daughter of a longshoreman and a public school teacher\u2019s aide, she grew up understanding that community wasn't an abstract concept but a lifeline built on mutual support and shared struggle. Her parents instilled in her a powerful work ethic and an even stronger sense of justice, which naturally guided her to San Francisco State University for a Bachelor's degree in Social Work.\n\nHer early career was a trial by fire. As a frontline caseworker for at-risk youth in the Bayview, Aisha saw the systemic cracks that swallowed up families. The burnout was immense, but instead of breaking her, it sharpened her focus. She realized she could effect greater change not by pulling one person from the river, but by going upstream to address the source. This epiphany marked her transition into management. Now, as a Clinical Program Manager, she oversees a team of social workers embedded in San Francisco schools, coordinating mental health and family support services.\n\nAt 41, Aisha\u2019s life has found a steady, fulfilling rhythm. Her 6.5-mile commute on the MUNI from her Inner Richmond apartment is a cherished buffer, a time for podcasts and quiet reflection before a demanding day. She chose her neighborhood for its peaceful, family-oriented feel and its proximity to Golden Gate Park, her weekend sanctuary for long walks. While single, her life is rich with connection; a tight-knit circle of friends from college and work forms her chosen family, and she visits her retired parents in Oakland nearly every other weekend.\n\nAisha\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of practiced purpose. She is not here for the glamour but for the grit\u2014the opportunity to serve the communities that are the city\u2019s true bedrock. Her dream is to secure a major grant to expand her program into the middle schools, creating a seamless support system for kids from K-12. Personally, she hopes to finally take a long-overdue trip to Ghana, to connect with a history far beyond the Bay Area shores that have so thoroughly shaped her."
