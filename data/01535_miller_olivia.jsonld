Growing up in a quiet Sacramento suburb, she was the unwitting barometer in the still, tense air between her emotionally reserved engineer father and her well-meaning but perpetually anxious mother. Olivia became an expert in unspoken needs and subtle shifts in mood, a childhood spent as a silent mediator. This ingrained hyper-awareness, once a survival mechanism, became her calling.\n\nHer escape was UC Santa Cruz, where psychology coursework gave a name and a framework to the family dynamics she had only ever felt instinctively. It was there, during a difficult phone call home, that she had a pivotal realization: she couldn't fix her parents, but she could equip others with the tools she never had. This clarity propelled her to San Francisco for her Master's in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco, a city whose ethos of self-discovery felt like a world away from the emotional repression of her youth.\n\nNow 27 and a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, Olivia has meticulously crafted a life of intention. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this; she runs her private practice from a dedicated, soundproofed office in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are structured and calm. Mornings begin with tea and a walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to ground herself before absorbing the emotional weight of her clients. She sees individuals and couples, mostly via telehealth, helping them navigate the very communication breakdowns she knows so intimately.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends from her graduate cohort who understand the unique demands of their work. While she helps others build stronger foundations, her own deepest aspiration is to cultivate a partnership built on the radical honesty and vulnerability she champions professionally. Olivia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; it\u2019s not just her home, but the place that gave her the language and freedom to finally understand, and then heal, the quiet spaces between people."
