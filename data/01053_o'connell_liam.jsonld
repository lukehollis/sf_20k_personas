            "value": "Liam O\u2019Connell is a product of San Francisco\u2019s western fog. Raised in the Sunset District, the son of a pragmatic Irish-American Muni driver and a sharp-witted waitress, his upbringing was more about hard work than high art. School was a place he existed, not a place he thrived. The city itself, particularly its gritty 90s music scene, was his true education. He spent his early twenties in a cramped Mission flat, pouring every ounce of energy into his post-punk band, convinced they were one gig away from a record deal.\n\nThe band\u2019s messy, inevitable breakup in his late twenties was his first major turning point. Disillusioned and with no degree to fall back on, Liam drifted between temp jobs. A friend convinced him to volunteer at a struggling community arts center in SOMA, a place for experimental artists who couldn\u2019t afford studio space elsewhere. Here, Liam discovered a new calling. He wasn't the star, but he was brilliant at finding extension cords, promoting shows, and making the artists feel seen.\n\nOver two decades, he became the backbone of the organization, rising to Program Coordinator. His 0.0-mile commute is a function of his life\u2019s devotion; he lives in a small loft apartment directly above the gallery and workshop space, a key part of his modest compensation package. His days are a steady rhythm of scheduling workshops for at-risk youth, writing grant applications to keep the lights on, and listening to the dreams and anxieties of the artists who cycle through.\n\nNow 47, Liam is a quiet fixture in his SOMA neighborhood, a human link to a less polished, more affordable San Francisco. His relationships are deep but often transient, tied to the artists who have residencies at the center. His old dream of fame has been replaced by a fiercer, more selfless one: to secure a permanent endowment for the arts program. He no longer needs his name on an album cover; he just wants to ensure there\u2019s a stage for others long after he's gone."
