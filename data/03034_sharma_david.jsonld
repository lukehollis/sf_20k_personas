The son of an exacting software engineer and a pragmatic mother who immigrated to Fremont in the late 1980s, David was raised in a home where success was measured in code and circuit boards. The path laid out for him was clear: engineering or medicine. He began as a pre-med student at UC Davis, dutifully checking the boxes his parents had envisioned.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. His younger cousin, struggling with severe depression, faced a wall of cultural stigma and familial misunderstanding. David witnessed firsthand the chasm between his family\u2019s love and their inability to navigate the complexities of mental illness. He felt a profound helplessness that ignited a new purpose. He changed his major, and after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley, a decision that initially caused a deep rift with his father.\n\nDavid began his career at a large hospital, working with patients facing chronic illness and end-of-life decisions. He excelled, his calm demeanor and deep listening skills providing solace in sterile, intimidating environments. When the pandemic normalized telehealth, he saw an opportunity for greater autonomy and impact. He transitioned to a private practice run from his Inner Sunset apartment, his commute now a zero-mile walk from his kitchen to a softly lit home office. His specialty became providing culturally competent therapy for South Asian and other immigrant families, bridging the very gap that had once confounded his own.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s life is structured and intentional. Mornings begin with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, followed by coffee from his favorite cafe on 9th Avenue. His days are filled with virtual sessions, a digital hearth where he helps others find their footing. He maintains a close circle of friends from grad school, meeting for weekly dinners in the Mission. His relationship with his parents has healed, replaced by a quiet, hard-won respect. David\u2019s dream is to one day open a small non-profit clinic in the city, offering subsidized mental healthcare. For him, San Francisco is more than a backdrop; his cozy Inner Sunset flat, just blocks from the park, is an anchor, not just an address\u2014a place of healing, for both his clients and himself."

Later, he overheard his uncles whispering in the kitchen, dismissing the boy\u2019s pain as \u201cjust a phase.\u201d A silent, screaming helplessness seized David. It was the precise moment the clean, predictable path of medicine fractured for him. It wasn't a choice to change his major; it was a calling, born from the ache of seeing love fail to understand.\n\n2.\nYears after his MSW, during a visit to Fremont, his father quietly handed him a cup of chai. He didn\u2019t look at David, but stared into the steam. \u201cTell me about this family you helped,\u201d his father said, his voice low. \u201cThe one from Punjab. What was their story?\u201d It wasn\u2019t an apology for the years of disapproval, but it was a bridge. In that moment, the rigid frame of his father\u2019s expectations finally dissolved, leaving only a quiet, hard-won respect that tasted sweeter than the chai.\n\n3.\nHe was a new social worker in the oncology ward. His patient was an elderly woman who hadn't spoken to her family in days. David just sat with her, not pushing, simply sharing the silence. After an hour, she turned her head and whispered a message for him to give her son. He felt less like a clinician and more like a conduit for a grace that had been trapped by fear and pain. It was the first time he truly understood that his work wasn\u2019t about fixing, but about bearing witness.\n\n4.\nIt was a Thursday night, early in the pandemic, and he\u2019d just finished his last telehealth session. He closed his laptop and looked out his Inner Sunset window as the fog rolled in, muffling the city. A profound sense of peace settled over him. He had spent the day holding space for others' anxieties from this very room. He realized then that this small apartment wasn't just a home office; it was a sanctuary he had built, a safe harbor for his clients and, finally, for himself.\n\n5.\nOn a recent morning run, cresting a hill in Golden Gate Park, he saw the whole tapestry of the city below. He thought of a client, a young student from an immigrant family, who\u2019d had to stop therapy for financial reasons. The ache of that unfinished work hit him. It was there, catching his breath amidst the cypress trees, that the vague idea of a non-profit sharpened into a concrete plan. He didn't just want to help; he needed to build a place where help was a right."
