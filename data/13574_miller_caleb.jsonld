The only child of parents who loved each other but communicated through a frustrating mix of passive aggression and stony silence, Caleb learned to be an emotional interpreter before he could properly ride a bike. He spent his youth decoding sighs and translating loaded silences, becoming the unwilling fulcrum in his parents\u2019 strained relationship. This early, unpaid apprenticeship in family dynamics planted a seed that would define his future.\n\nHe pursued a BA in Psychology at UC Davis, initially unsure of his direction, but a pivotal moment came during his junior year. His parents, on the verge of separation, finally sought counseling. Watching a professional guide them toward healthier communication was a revelation for Caleb. He saw how targeted intervention could provide the tools his family had always lacked. This solidified his purpose, and after graduating, he enrolled in a Master\u2019s program in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco, eager to be the person he had needed as a child.\n\nNow 28, Caleb is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) working entirely from his apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the small, sound-proofed office he\u2019s set up in a converted den. His days are a succession of telehealth sessions, guiding clients through the very same communication breakdowns he knows so intimately. To decompress, he begins each morning with a run through Golden Gate Park, the fog-laced eucalyptus groves a necessary balm for the emotional weight he carries. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly from his graduate cohort, who understand the unique pressures of their profession. Dating has been a challenge; he often finds himself analyzing relational dynamics rather than simply experiencing them.\n\nCaleb\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in the quietude of his neighborhood, a peaceful contrast to the emotional turbulence he navigates professionally. He dreams of one day opening a small, in-person group practice focused on young adults and family systems. His ultimate aspiration remains simple: to help others find the clarity and language that was missing in his own upbringing, turning his childhood burden into a source of healing for others."
