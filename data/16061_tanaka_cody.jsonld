Raised in Modesto, he was the son of a perpetually optimistic but financially unstable biological father and a hardworking mother. When his parents divorced, his mother remarried Ken Tanaka, a quiet, diligent owner of a local hardware store. Ken provided a stability Cody had never known, and at sixteen, Cody took his stepfather\u2019s name out of deep respect. He watched his biological father chase fleeting dreams while Ken built something tangible, a lesson that Cody absorbed completely.\n\nSchool was never his forte. He was restless in classrooms, more interested in people and the dynamics of persuasion. Instead of pursuing a four-year degree, he saw a more direct path to success. The Bay Area\u2019s frenetic real estate market seemed like a landscape of pure opportunity. After graduating high school, he spent a year working at his stepfather\u2019s store, saving every dollar. At 19, he moved to San Francisco, enrolled in an online real estate licensing course, and supported himself by working as a barista.\n\nThe key turning point was landing his first job as a leasing agent's assistant. Cody\u2019s charm, relentless follow-up, and genuine interest in helping people find a home made him a natural. He quickly graduated to a full leasing agent, excelling at navigating the city\u2019s complex rental market.\n\nNow 24, Cody lives a life dictated by hustle and budget. He shares a drafty but beloved three-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond with two other young professionals. His daily routine begins with the 38-Geary bus, a 2.8-mile ride downtown that he uses to scan new listings and mentally prepare for the day\u2019s appointments. He thrives on the city's energy, seeing every street and neighborhood as a collection of assets and opportunities. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends, usually meeting for beers in the Mission or weekend hikes in the Headlands.\n\nCody\u2019s dream isn\u2019t abstract; it\u2019s a tangible goal. He\u2019s saving aggressively to transition from leasing to sales. His ultimate aspiration is to buy his own investment property within five years, but his deepest motivation is familial. He dreams of one day handing his mom and Ken the keys to a house he bought for them\u2014the ultimate tribute to the man who showed him the value of building a stable life."

That afternoon, Cody\u2019s biological father called, breathless about a new \"can't-miss\" venture. The contrast was a physical jolt. He hung up, looked at the solid, quiet man who was always there, and knew. He wasn\u2019t chasing dreams anymore; he was going to build something real. He asked his mom for the paperwork to change his name that night.\n\n2.\nHis first solo lease was a tiny studio in Hayes Valley for a young ER nurse. After a month of failed applications, she was exhausted. When Cody called with the approval, her relief was audible. Handing her the keys, he saw the stress drain from her face, replaced by a fragile, hopeful smile. It wasn't about the commission check. It was the tangible feeling of providing someone a safe harbor in a frantic city. He realized then that real estate wasn't just transactions; it was about delivering stability, just like Ken had.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday morning, age 19. Exhausted from a 4 AM barista shift, he was behind the counter, an open real estate textbook propped against the espresso machine. He fumbled a tray, sending four scalding lattes crashing to the floor. His manager yelled, customers groaned. In that moment of sticky, milky humiliation, a cold resolve settled in his gut. This was temporary. This feeling was fuel. He swore to himself that he would never again depend on a job where his future rested on not spilling coffee.\n\n4.\nThe 38-Geary was crawling through a thick Richmond fog one morning last year. Cody wiped condensation from the window and saw it: a small, beige, four-unit apartment building, a \"For Sale\" sign half-hidden by a juniper bush. Suddenly, his vague ambition had a physical address. He could picture it\u2014the numbers, the tenants, the key in his own hand. The long bus ride no longer felt like a commute; it felt like the first step of a concrete plan, a daily reminder of the exact thing he was grinding for.\n\n5.\nHe called home last month after a brutal week, expecting to unload his stress. Instead, Ken just asked, \u201cDid you help anyone find a good place this week, son?\u201d Cody told him about a family he\u2019d placed in a two-bedroom near Golden Gate Park. There was a pause on the line, and then Ken\u2019s quiet, rumbling voice said, \u201cThat\u2019s good work. A family needs a solid foundation.\u201d The simple, profound validation hit Cody harder than any bonus. It was the approval he\u2019d been working for all along."
