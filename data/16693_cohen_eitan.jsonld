The only child of Israeli immigrants, he was raised in the East Bay suburbs, far from the polished glass of his current FiDi office. His father, a general contractor, taught him the value of a well-built structure, while his mother, a bookkeeper for small businesses, drilled the importance of a clean ledger. Dinner table conversations revolved around property values, zoning laws, and the cyclical nature of the housing market. The 2008 financial crisis was a formative event; seeing his father\u2019s work dry up taught a young Eitan a crucial lesson about the power of capital over labor.\n\nThis understanding shaped his academic path. He pursued an economics degree at UC Davis before enrolling in a specialized Master of Science in Real Estate program at the University of San Diego. He wasn't just interested in buildings; he was fascinated by the complex financial instruments that brought them to life. He excelled, driven by a desire for the security his family had fought so hard for. After graduating, he landed a coveted associate position in a real estate private equity firm in San Francisco.\n\nNow 26, Eitan lives a life of calculated discipline. His mornings begin before sunrise with a run along the Embarcadero, followed by a 1.2-mile walk from his modern Russian Hill apartment to his office. His days are a blur of financial modeling, due diligence, and investor calls, translating physical properties into abstract returns on a spreadsheet. His social circle is tight, consisting mainly of colleagues and a few friends from his master\u2019s program who share his ambition.\n\nDespite achieving the financial success he aimed for, Eitan feels a growing disconnect. He analyzes multi-million dollar deals but rarely feels the sun on his face at a construction site. His connection to San Francisco is largely defined by his commute and the upscale bars where he entertains clients. His ultimate dream is to pivot from private equity to development, to use his financial acumen to build something lasting. He aspires to create mixed-use, community-focused projects in the city\u2014a way to honor his father\u2019s craft on a grander scale and finally build a true, tangible connection to the place he calls home."

His father\u2019s Ford F-150 sat unnervingly clean in the driveway, its bed empty of tools and debris for weeks. Seeing his strong, capable father stare at the silent phone taught Eitan a brutal lesson: passion and skill were powerless against a market crash. He decided then he would control the capital, not just the hammer. That silence was the foundation of his ambition.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during a UC Davis class trip, he stood on the muddy edge of a massive construction site. While his peers saw dirt and rebar, Eitan saw the spreadsheet made real. He could smell the wet concrete and hear the financial waterfall structure from his lectures in the clang of steel. For the first time, his father\u2019s world and his own academic pursuits clicked together. He wasn\u2019t abandoning his roots; he was learning to speak the language that gave them scale.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-five, staring at an email confirming his first six-figure bonus. The number on the screen was abstract, a reward for months spent modeling a deal for a building he\u2019d only seen in photos. There was a brief surge of pride, the feeling of security he\u2019d craved. But it vanished quickly, replaced by a strange emptiness. He had won the game his twelve-year-old self wanted to play, but felt no closer to building anything real. The digits felt like smoke.\n\n4.\nOn a recent morning run, he stopped to catch his breath by the Ferry Building. He watched vendors set up stalls, friends greeting each other with coffee, the organic, unplanned life of a true public space unfolding. He felt a sharp, painful pang of otherness. His San Francisco was a line item, a commute route, a view from his window. This place, vibrant and real, felt like a city he had yet to earn the right to belong to.\n\n5.\nLast week, his father called, buzzing with excitement about a complex kitchen remodel. He described the satisfaction of fitting the custom cabinets, the joy on the homeowners\u2019 faces. Eitan listened, clutching his phone, having just spent his day arguing fractions of a percentage point on a billion-dollar loan. The contrast was stark. He felt a sudden, fierce need to feel that tangible pride, to have a story about more than just a successful closing. That call became his personal notice to pivot."
