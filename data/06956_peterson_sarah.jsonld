Raised by a stoic, emotionally reserved father and a well-meaning but overwhelmed mother, she became a keen observer of the silent struggles that defined her family. This environment ignited in her a deep desire to understand and voice the feelings others couldn't, a calling that led her to pursue a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, leaving the flat plains of the Midwest for the dynamic coasts of California.\n\nHer career began in the crucible of San Francisco General Hospital. For over a decade, Sarah worked on the front lines, navigating the raw, unfiltered crises of a Level 1 trauma center. She guided families through grief, supported patients with life-altering diagnoses, and absorbed the city\u2019s pain day after day. While fulfilling, the work etched away at her own reserves. The relentless pressure, magnified by the pandemic, led to profound burnout. This breaking point became her turning point; she left the hospital system to establish a private telehealth practice from her Inner Sunset apartment.\n\nNow, her commute is a walk from her bedroom to a small, dedicated office space overlooking a foggy street. Her days are structured by virtual sessions, providing a crucial lifeline to clients grappling with anxiety, depression, and medical trauma. Life is quieter. She finds solace in long, meandering walks through Golden Gate Park, the scent of eucalyptus a cleansing ritual after a difficult session. She maintains a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends\u2014a nurse, a teacher, a chef\u2014who understand the need for gallows humor and unconditional support.\n\nAt 43 and single after a long-term relationship buckled under the weight of her past career, Sarah aspires not to change the world, but to reclaim her own. Her dreams have become smaller, more intimate: mastering a complex recipe, learning to throw pottery at the Sharon Art Studio, and perhaps, finding a partnership built on mutual care rather than crisis. She remains deeply connected to San Francisco, no longer as a crisis responder, but as a quiet resident tending to both her clients' healing and her own."
