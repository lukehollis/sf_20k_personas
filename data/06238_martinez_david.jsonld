His parents, immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, arrived in the 1970s and opened \"Martinez & Son Auto Repair.\" It was initially his father's dream, but it quickly became David\u2019s entire world. He didn\u2019t find his calling in a high school classroom; he found it under the hood of a sputtering sedan, his father patiently explaining the intricate dance of pistons and spark plugs.\n\nHis formal education ended with a diploma, but his real apprenticeship lasted fifteen years. David learned the language of engines, the feel of a perfectly tightened bolt, and the unwritten code of a neighborhood mechanic: honesty above all. The shop was more than a business; it was the community\u2019s mechanical heart, fixing the delivery vans for local panaderias and the old sedans of families who had lived there for generations.\n\nThe major turning point in David\u2019s life was his father's sudden death from a heart attack when David was 32. Overnight, the \"& Son\" became the sole proprietor. The weight of the legacy was immense, and it strained his young marriage to its breaking point. His wife, who longed for a life outside the constant smell of gasoline and the endless hours, left a year later. David buried his grief in his work, pouring everything into keeping the shop afloat.\n\nToday, David\u2019s world remains centered on that same property. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of creaky wooden stairs from his small, clean apartment to the garage floor below. His day starts before sunrise with strong coffee and the company of his scruffy terrier mix, Frijol. His customers are now a mix of old-timers and new tech workers who appreciate his fair prices and no-nonsense approach.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of expansion or wealth. It\u2019s a dream of preservation. He hopes to withstand the rising rents and the changing face of the Mission long enough to retire on his own terms. He quietly aspires to one day find a young, passionate apprentice to pass the legacy on to, ensuring that a Martinez wrench will continue to turn in the heart of San Francisco."
