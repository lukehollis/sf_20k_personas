Raised in Petaluma, her childhood was a stable, middle-class picture of suburban Northern California. Her father, a union electrician, and her mother, a teacher\u2019s aide, provided a loving home. However, this stability was perpetually shadowed by her Uncle Sean\u2019s struggles with bipolar disorder and addiction, which led to cycles of homelessness that deeply impacted their family. It was watching her parents navigate a broken social services system, fighting for a brother they loved, that planted the seeds of Caitlin\u2019s future career.\n\nChoosing to stay in the Bay Area, she attended San Francisco State University, earning her degree in Social Work. The city, with its stark and visible homelessness crisis, felt like the only place she could be. It wasn't an abstract problem to her; it had a face\u2014her uncle\u2019s. Upon graduating, she dove headfirst into the nonprofit sector, eventually landing her current role as a Case Manager for a homeless outreach program. Her job is a relentless cycle of crisis intervention, navigating bureaucracy for clients, and celebrating the smallest victories\u2014a secured shelter bed, a successful benefits application\u2014that feel monumental.\n\nCaitlin lives in a small, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its foggy tranquility and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her daily routine begins before sunrise with a run through the park to clear her head before the emotional weight of her day settles in. She then catches the 5-Fulton MUNI bus for the short ride to her office in the Tenderloin. Her modest income requires careful budgeting, but finds joy in simple things: browsing the Clement Street Farmers' Market on Sundays and monthly potlucks with her \u201cfound family\u201d of fellow social workers and old college friends.\n\nThough devoted to her work, she dreams of moving from direct service into policy advocacy, hoping to address the systemic failures she confronts daily. Caitlin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of profound purpose and quiet sacrifice. She sees both its beautiful idealism and its harsh realities every day, and has chosen to dedicate her life to bridging the ever-widening gap between them."

After he left with a Tupperware container of leftovers, she saw her mother slip a crumpled twenty-dollar bill into his jacket pocket, a quick, almost invisible movement. Caitlin felt a pang of shame and confusion, a silent sadness that settled in the room long after he was gone. That day, she understood that love could be helpless, a feeling that would anchor her entire professional life.\n\n2.\nDuring a sophomore year lecture at SF State, a professor used the phrase \u201csystemic failures in social welfare.\u201d Caitlin looked out the window of the Humanities building at the city skyline, and the term clicked into place with gut-wrenching clarity. It wasn't just Uncle Sean's personal struggle; it was a vast, broken machine. The abstract theory gave her family\u2019s private pain a public name. In that moment, her vague desire to help sharpened into a specific, unwavering professional mission.\n\n3.\nIt took six weeks and a mountain of paperwork to get her client, a man named Marcus, a simple state ID. When she finally handed him the laminated card at her Tenderloin office, he just stared at it, turning it over and over. Then he looked up, his eyes welling with tears, and whispered, \"I'm a person again.\" That small, plastic square felt heavier and more important than a medal. It was her first visceral taste of a victory that the rest of the world wouldn't even see.\n\n4.\nAfter a brutal week where a client relapsed and disappeared, Caitlin ran harder than usual through a foggy Golden Gate Park. As the cold air burned her lungs and the scent of eucalyptus filled her senses, she stopped near the Conservatory of Flowers, completely spent. Watching the fog swallow the tops of the trees, she didn't feel defeated, just small. It was a comforting, clarifying feeling that erased the day's chaos. It was a moment that taught her how to find peace within the storm.\n\n5.\nAt a potluck in her apartment last winter, another case manager began to cry silently into her food, utterly overwhelmed. Without a word, one friend put a hand on her shoulder while another refilled her wine glass. No one had to ask what was wrong; they all knew the weight. Surrounded by the warmth of her found family in her small Richmond living room, Caitlin felt a profound sense of shared resilience. This, she realized, was the only way any of them could survive the work."
