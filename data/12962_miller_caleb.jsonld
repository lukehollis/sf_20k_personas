The son of a general contractor and a high school math teacher, Caleb grew up with a deep appreciation for both structural integrity and precise calculations. His bedroom floor was a perpetual minefield of LEGOs, model rockets, and disassembled electronics. While his friends were playing video games, Caleb was often in the garage, building a go-kart from spare lawnmower parts, learning the satisfying logic of how things fit together.\n\nThis practical passion led him to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for a degree in Mechanical Engineering. It was there, during a senior project to design a complex, lightweight drone chassis, that he had his epiphany. Frustrated by the limitations of traditional CNC machining, he turned to the university\u2019s nascent 3D printing lab. Watching the laser sinter powder into a perfectly formed, impossibly intricate object overnight felt like witnessing magic. He knew he had found his calling.\n\nAfter graduation, Caleb was drawn to the Bay Area\u2019s hub of innovation, but not for software. He sought out a role where he could get his hands dirty, digitally speaking. He landed at an advanced manufacturing firm in the Dogpatch, specializing in 3D-printing high-performance components for the aerospace and medical industries. Now, as an Additive Manufacturing Engineer, he spends his days optimizing designs, troubleshooting complex material science problems, and bringing digital blueprints into physical reality.\n\nCaleb lives in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. His daily 2.8-mile bike commute is a cherished ritual, a mental warm-up that takes him through the city\u2019s vibrant arteries before the deep focus of his work begins. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, often meeting for rock climbing at Mission Cliffs or grabbing beers at a local brewery. His quiet ambition is to one day lead a team developing next-generation, sustainable 3D-printing materials. For Caleb, San Francisco isn\u2019t just a place to live; it\u2019s the ultimate workshop, a city constantly prototyping its own future, and he\u2019s proud to be one of its builders."

At twelve, after a summer of wrestling with greasy parts in the Sacramento garage, his go-kart sputtered to life. His dad gave a thumbs-up, his smile brimming with a shared pride. That first lurch forward\u2014it was the moment he learned the profound satisfaction of transforming a pile of junk into a machine that *worked*. It wasn't about the speed; it was the intoxicating logic of it all, a feeling he\u2019s been chasing ever since.\n\n2.\nHe remembers walking into the dim Cal Poly lab at 3 AM, the air smelling of hot polymer. Inside the machine, a laser danced across a bed of white powder. Where there had been nothing, his drone chassis was materializing, layer by invisible layer. It wasn\u2019t fabrication; it felt like a conjuring. In that quiet, humming moment, the abstract chaos of engineering theory snapped into a tangible, beautiful purpose. He knew, with absolute certainty, what he was meant to do. This was his senior year.\n\n3.\nHalfway up a tough route at Mission Cliffs, his grip faltered and his mind went blank with panic. He was stuck. But below, his friend Maya\u2019s voice was calm and steady\u2014not shouting instructions, but simply saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got you. Just breathe.\u201d He looked down, saw the absolute confidence in her eyes, and the fear dissolved. It wasn\u2019t about finishing the climb anymore; it was about the profound trust anchoring him from below. This memory from his first year in the city became his definition of friendship.\n\n4.\nThe email arrived with a simple subject: \"Titanium Lattice - QC PASSED.\" For weeks, Caleb had obsessed over the design for a patient-specific spinal implant, tweaking the geometry for optimal porosity and strength. Seeing that confirmation was more than a professional victory; it was a physical part he designed, a piece of intricate logic, that would soon exist inside another human being, fundamentally changing their life. It was a weight and a privilege he felt in his bones. This was two years into his job.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a crisp autumn morning, coasting down 17th Street on his bike. The fog was thick, muffling the city\u2019s sounds into a gentle hum. Ahead, the lights of bakeries and taquerias glowed softly through the haze. He felt like a component moving through a larger, sleeping machine, each person on their own precise trajectory. For a moment, he wasn\u2019t just commuting through the Mission; he was a perfectly integrated part of its complex, living design. This was just last fall."
