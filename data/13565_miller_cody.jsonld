Raised in a working-class family, his father a forklift operator and his mother a dental assistant, the expectation was simple: graduate, get a steady job, and stay close. Cody, however, was restless. School was a place of abstract rules that never clicked; he was a tactile, sensory learner who felt more at home tinkering with his dad\u2019s tools than dissecting a frog. He scraped by with a general studies diploma, his future an undefined blur.\n\nAt nineteen, feeling the walls of his hometown closing in, he packed a duffel bag and took a bus to San Francisco, drawn by a vague promise of something more. He landed a job as a barback in a busy North Beach pub\u2014a grueling, invisible role. But it was here, amidst the clatter of glasses and the sticky floors, that he found his calling. An old-school bartender named Marcus saw Cody\u2019s quick hands and sharp palate, noticing how he could identify the botanicals in gin just from the aroma. Marcus took him under his wing, teaching him the chemistry of a perfect sour, the history of bitters, and the art of conversation.\n\nThis mentorship was Cody\u2019s true education. He moved from barback to bartender, absorbing everything. His turning point came when he landed a job at a sleek, upscale cocktail lounge in SoMa. Here, his creativity flourished. He wasn\u2019t just pouring drinks; he was an architect of flavor. Now, at 28, he\u2019s the Lead Mixologist, earning a respectable income by designing seasonal cocktail menus and training new staff.\n\nCody lives in the Inner Richmond, a world away from the downtown glamour he works in. His 2.5-mile commute on the 5-Fulton MUNI bus is a daily decompression, a transition from the chaotic energy of his job to the quiet fog of his neighborhood. He spends his mornings off running in Golden Gate Park or grabbing dim sum on Clement Street. His social life is a constellation of industry friends who understand the inverted lifestyle of late nights and Tuesday \"weekends.\" Though he dates, the demanding schedule makes long-term relationships a challenge.\n\nHis ultimate dream is to open his own place: a small, intimate cocktail bar in a quiet neighborhood, a haven focused purely on craft and connection. For Cody, San Francisco wasn't just an escape; it was the place that gave him the ingredients to craft a life he could finally call his own."
