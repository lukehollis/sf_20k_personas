Raised in the quiet suburbs of Des Moines, Iowa, by a high school principal and a librarian, her upbringing was a stable world of community potlucks and academic encouragement. She excelled, eventually earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature from the University of Iowa, imagining a future in publishing or academia.\n\nThe reality of the job market in the early 2000s steered her differently. Following a friend to San Francisco, she took a temporary job as a technical writer for a burgeoning software company. It was there she discovered her true talent: translating the chaotic world of engineering into coherent, actionable plans. She wasn't a coder, but she was an unparalleled communicator and organizer. This realization was her turning point. She pursued project management certifications and methodically built a career, climbing the ladder to her current role as an IT Project Manager.\n\nHer personal life mirrored this steady build. After a significant long-term relationship ended in her early thirties, Sarah made the deliberate choice to plant her own roots, purchasing a small condo in Cole Valley. The 0.0-mile commute listed on her profile is a post-pandemic fixture she fiercely protects. Her days are a blend of global Zoom calls from her spare bedroom-turned-office and intensely local routines. Mornings begin with a coffee from Reverie Cafe and a walk with her rescue terrier, Buster, toward the mist-shrouded base of Sutro Tower. The sharp divide between work and life is non-negotiable; at 6 p.m., the laptop closes, and she immerses herself in her neighborhood, whether it\u2019s a yoga class, a book club meeting, or dinner with a tight-knit circle of friends.\n\nAt 40, Sarah feels a familiar restlessness. She\u2019s achieved the stability her parents championed, but the creative spark from her literature degree flickers. Her quiet dream is to transition her project management skills into a more passion-driven field\u2014perhaps consulting for local non-profits or even opening a small, curated bookstore in her beloved neighborhood, creating a tangible community hub in the city she has deliberately, and successfully, made her own."
