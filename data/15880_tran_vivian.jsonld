For her, the city isn't just a map of streets, but a complex network of human movement, a puzzle she feels born to solve. Her passion for urban planning was seeded in San Jose, where she was raised by Vietnamese immigrant parents. She watched her father, a restaurant cook, and her mother, a seamstress, navigate a sprawling suburbia that was often hostile to those without a car. The most vivid memory was of her grandfather, who felt increasingly isolated after he could no longer drive, his world shrinking to the few blocks he could walk.\n\nThis early exposure to the inequities of urban design fueled her academic journey through UC Berkeley and a Master's program at UCLA. She chose to return to the Bay Area, drawn to San Francisco's potential as a dense, transit-first city. Hired by the city\u2019s transportation agency right after graduation, her sharp analytical skills and genuine empathy for commuters propelled her to the role of Senior Transportation Planner by age 29.\n\nNow a resident of the Inner Richmond, Vivian lives the principles she advocates for. Her mornings begin with a walk to a local bakery for a coffee, followed by a 3.5-mile ride on the 5-Fulton bus to her office downtown. She spends her days analyzing data, modeling traffic flows, and advocating in community meetings for protected bike lanes and more reliable bus service. Her key turning point was securing funding for a project that increased transit frequency in a low-income neighborhood, a professional victory that felt deeply personal, a tribute to her grandfather.\n\nHer social life intertwines with her work; her friends are a mix of architects, policy wonks, and activists. She\u2019s recently started dating a landscape architect she met at a public space design charrette. Vivian\u2019s dream is to one day oversee the implementation of a major bus rapid transit line from start to finish. For her, it\u2019s about more than concrete and schedules; it\u2019s about creating a more connected and equitable San Francisco, a city where no one is left behind on the platform."

Her grandfather stood at the window, his hand pressed against the glass, watching cars speed down the boulevard. His world had shrunk to what his tired legs could carry him, and the bus stop felt a world away. A quiet, burning frustration ignited in her; a feeling that a city should hold its people, not abandon them. That day, she didn't just see her grandfather; she saw the problem she would one day solve.\n\n2.\nIt was a rainy Tuesday night her sophomore year at Berkeley. Huddled under a bus shelter, she watched the 51B pull up, its windows steamy and full of life. Students, workers, families\u2014all part of a complex, moving system. While others complained about the wait, Vivian felt a profound click of understanding. This wasn't chaos; it was a puzzle of human connection waiting to be optimized. She walked into the registrar\u2019s office the next morning and officially declared her major in Urban Studies.\n\n3.\nThe victory wasn't the boardroom applause; it was the quiet ding of an email on her laptop at 7 PM. 'PROJECT FUNDING APPROVED: Bayview Transit Equity Initiative.' She stared at the screen, and the face that filled her mind was her grandfather's. Tears welled as she pictured families no longer stranded, the city's promise finally reaching them. It was more than data and budgets; it was a debt repaid, a ghost soothed. This single moment validated her entire journey back to the Bay.\n\n4.\nHer first year on the job, she presented a bike lane proposal at a heated community meeting. Her charts and data were met with raw anger from residents who felt unheard, fearing lost parking. A man shouted that she didn't understand *their* lives. Vivian felt her cheeks burn, her careful logic dissolving against a wall of human frustration. That night, she didn't just learn about community outreach; she learned that true empathy means listening to the anger, not just presenting the solution.\n\n5.\nLast month, on her third date with the landscape architect, they walked through Patricia\u2019s Green in Hayes Valley. He didn't just see a park; he pointed out the desire lines, the seating that encouraged conversation, how the space connected to the transit stops. He spoke her language. Looking at him, with the sound of the city humming around them, Vivian felt a new kind of connection\u2014not just planning a city, but happily, surprisingly, building a life within it."
