The daughter of a U.S. Navy logistics officer and a proudly independent Filipino artist, her childhood was a blur of naval bases from Japan to Italy. While other children collected souvenirs, Amina collected flavors. Her formal education was a patchwork of international schools, but her real classroom was alongside her mother, learning to recreate the taste of adobo in Germany or master fresh pasta in Naples. The kitchen was the only constant geography in her nomadic youth.\n\nForgoing a traditional college path, Amina dove headfirst into the culinary world at eighteen, starting as a prep cook in a bustling San Diego bistro. She was disciplined and relentless, absorbing techniques with the intensity of a scholar. She rose through the ranks in the brutal, meritocratic environments of high-pressure kitchens in Chicago and New York, her own culinary voice a quiet fusion of her travels. A key turning point came a decade ago after a painful divorce. Feeling adrift, she accepted a Sous Chef position at a celebrated but notoriously difficult fine-dining restaurant in San Francisco, seeing it as both an escape and a final push toward the top.\n\nToday, at 49, Amina\u2019s life is a study in intense focus. She lives in a small studio apartment directly above the Hayes Valley restaurant she has helped earn its accolades. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days are a grueling, familiar ritual: pre-dawn walks to the Ferry Building for produce, hours of meticulous prep, the violent, controlled ballet of dinner service, and late-night drinks with her kitchen crew, the only family she truly feels a part of. These younger cooks see her as a tough but fair mentor, a repository of classical skill and hard-won wisdom.\n\nAmina\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and sensory. It\u2019s the fog on her morning walk, the trust of her specific fishmonger, and the challenge of pleasing the city\u2019s sophisticated palate. Her dream is to finally open her own place\u2014not a grand hall, but a tiny, 20-seat restaurant in the Mission where she can tell her life story on a plate. It would be a culmination of everything: her mother's art, her father's discipline, and a lifetime of collected tastes, finally rooted in one city."
