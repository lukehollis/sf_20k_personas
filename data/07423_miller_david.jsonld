            "value": "David Lee Miller\u2019s story is one forged in the heat of a kitchen and seasoned by a search for identity. Born in Seoul and adopted as an infant by a loving, academic couple from Berkeley, David\u2019s name reflects his dual heritage. The Millers provided a world of books and art, but he always felt a subtle disconnect, a missing piece of his own narrative. He enrolled at San Francisco State University with a vague plan to study graphic design, but the structured world of academia felt foreign. To pay his bills, he took a job as a prep cook in a bustling North Beach restaurant. There, amidst the chaotic symphony of clattering pans and searing heat, David found his calling.\n\nHe dropped out of college, a decision that quietly disappointed his parents, and dedicated himself to the craft. He worked his way up through some of San Francisco's most demanding kitchens, absorbing techniques from French, Italian, and Californian cuisine. The pivotal turning point came at age 28 when he used his life savings to travel to Korea for the first time. The journey was a sensory awakening. The explosive flavors of gochujang, the deep umami of doenjang, and the communal joy of a shared meal connected him to his roots in a way nothing else ever had.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, his mission was clear. He would fuse the precise techniques he\u2019d learned with the bold, soulful flavors of his homeland. After years of relentless work and saving, he opened \"Saejoon,\" a small, intimate restaurant in Hayes Valley where he also lives in the apartment upstairs. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his all-consuming passion. His days are a disciplined cycle of farmers' market runs, meticulous prep, and leading his small, tight-knit staff through the nightly dinner service. Though a past long-term relationship buckled under the weight of his ambition, he finds family in his team and community among the city's chefs. At 50, David\u2019s dream is no longer just running a successful restaurant; he now quietly aspires to earn a Michelin star, a validation that his unique Korean-Californian story is one worth telling on the world stage."
