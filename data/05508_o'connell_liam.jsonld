Growing up, the family\u2019s gravity was his older brother, Sean, whose charm was matched only by his spiraling struggle with opioid addiction. Liam spent his teenage years as a helpless observer, witnessing the cycles of hope and despair. This experience of \"emotional triage,\" as he would later call it, planted the seed of his professional calling. He saw the systemic failures and the profound need for accessible, compassionate care.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct flight from that turmoil. After completing his undergraduate degree in psychology on the East Coast, he sought both distance and purpose, finding both in the Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area offered a fresh start and a new lens through which to view the issues that had defined his youth. He threw himself into his studies and clinical internships, quickly earning his license (LCSW) after graduation and choosing to work within a large healthcare system that allowed for remote telehealth services.\n\nNow 26, Liam lives and works from his one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. His commute is a zero-mile walk from his bed to his desk, where he spends his days in back-to-back video sessions, providing a calm, steady presence for clients grappling with everything from anxiety to trauma. His apartment is a sanctuary of minimalist calm, a stark contrast to the vibrant murals and bustling energy of the streets below. He begins each day with a run through Dolores Park, a ritual to clear his head before absorbing the emotional weight of others.\n\nLiam\u2019s social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from his graduate cohort, people who understand the unique pressures of their work. While deeply fulfilled professionally, he dreams of one day opening a small group practice specializing in supporting families affected by substance use, turning his painful past into a beacon for others. His deepest aspiration, however, is personal: to find a healthy work-life balance, to explore the hiking trails of Marin, and to build a life in San Francisco that is defined as much by his own joy as it is by the healing he facilitates."

His mother\u2019s voice was a thin, stretched wire as she said Sean was in the hospital again. Not a question, just a fact. In that moment, a chilling calm washed over him. He felt an absolute certainty that his path wasn\u2019t to fix his brother, but to learn how to stand steady in the wreckage. That night, the therapist he would become was truly born.\n\n2.\nHe remembers his first drive from Berkeley into the city for a study group, just weeks after moving west. He was 22. As he crested the Bay Bridge, the skyline glittered against the dark water, seeming to promise a life unwritten. It was a visceral, physical relief\u2014the cold Pacific air felt clean, wiping away the heavy, humid atmosphere of his past. This wasn't just a new city; it was a chance to finally breathe, to build something that was entirely his own.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a session during his final internship. A teenage girl, who for weeks had only stared at her hands, finally looked up. Her eyes met his, and she quietly said, \"Thank you. No one\u2019s ever just listened before.\" He was 24. The profound wave of validation was overwhelming, a quiet, powerful antidote to the years of helpless watching. It was the first time he truly felt the weight of his past transform into a tool, proving he could offer the stillness he never had.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a simple evening last summer, sitting on a friend\u2019s tiny Mission balcony with his cohort. They shared a cheap bottle of wine, laughing about impossible clients and the absurdities of their profession. Looking at the city lights, surrounded by people who understood the psychic toll of his work without explanation, he felt a deep, anchoring sense of belonging. It was a powerful reminder that he wasn't alone in his new life, and that chosen family could be a powerful sanctuary.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a run in Dolores Park just a few months ago. Reaching the top of the hill, breathless, he stopped. The early morning sun broke over the eastern hills, bathing the cityscape in a soft, golden light. For a full minute, he wasn\u2019t a therapist, a brother, or a son\u2014he was just a man watching the sun rise in his city. That feeling of simple, quiet joy felt revolutionary. It cemented his resolve to protect his own peace as fiercely as he protected his clients'."
