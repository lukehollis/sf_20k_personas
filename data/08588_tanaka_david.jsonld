The son of a pragmatic Sansei accountant and a mother who taught the subtle art of Ikebana in their Berkeley home, he was raised on a diet of fiscal responsibility and unspoken aesthetics. His father urged him toward a stable career, so David dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from UC Berkeley. He was on a clear path to a corporate life he never wanted.\n\nThe turning point was a post-graduation trip to Japan. In the minimalist, daring art galleries of Tokyo, he saw a future that merged his mother\u2019s artistic sensibility with his father\u2019s commercial acumen. He returned to San Francisco, abandoned his finance job offers, and took a menial position at a small, struggling gallery in Hayes Valley, much to his father\u2019s dismay. He learned the art world from the ground up: packing canvases, managing inventory, and charming collectors.\n\nWhen the first dot-com bubble burst, the gallery\u2019s owner folded. David, now in his late 20s, saw his chance. Using a small inheritance and his economic foresight, he bought the space, including the small apartment upstairs. He has lived and worked in the same building ever since. His 0.0-mile commute means his life and his work are inextricably linked\u2014a dedication that contributed to the amicable end of his only long-term relationship a decade ago.\n\nNow 51, David is a fixture in Hayes Valley. His gallery, *Tsubaki*, is a respected name for showcasing emerging Bay Area artists. His days start with coffee overlooking the neighborhood\u2019s boutiques and end with him turning off the gallery lights below. He is a solitary but not lonely figure, his social life revolving around gallery openings and dinners with his artists. He feels a deep, protective connection to a San Francisco that prioritizes culture over code. His quiet dream is not of wealth, but of legacy: to discover one more truly groundbreaking artist whose work will long outlast the city\u2019s transient tech fortunes."
