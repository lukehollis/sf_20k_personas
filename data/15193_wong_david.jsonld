Born to unknown biological parents, he was adopted as an infant by a kind, second-generation Chinese-American couple in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. He grew up as the white son in a Cantonese-speaking household, a fixture in a community where he was both an insider and an outsider. His father, a quiet man who ran a small electronics repair shop on Taraval Street, became his first and most important mentor. Surrounded by the scent of solder and the intricate guts of discarded technology, David learned to troubleshoot and build things not from books, but with his hands.\n\nWhile he was a bright student, the rigid structure of school never appealed to him. After graduating from high school, he bypassed college, a decision that worried his parents but felt right to him. He took his homegrown skills and threw himself into the burgeoning tech scene of the late 1990s. Starting as a help desk technician, his innate talent for untangling complex systems saw him rise quickly. He was a natural sysadmin, a digital janitor who kept the lights on. Through company changes, dot-com busts, and booms, David\u2019s pragmatism and unflinching competence made him indispensable. Now, as Director of IT Operations, he manages the critical infrastructure of a downtown management firm, his lack of a degree a forgotten footnote overshadowed by two decades of proven experience.\n\nDavid\u2019s life flows with a comfortable predictability. His 6.1-mile commute is a daily ritual on the N Judah line, a time for podcasts and people-watching as the train rumbles from his quiet Sunset apartment toward the Financial District. He\u2019s a regular at a few neighborhood pubs and has a small, tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of old schoolmates and former colleagues. He remains deeply devoted to his aging parents, visiting them every weekend for dim sum.\n\nHaving achieved a level of financial security he never imagined, David\u2019s aspirations have shifted. He feels the pull of his roots, dreaming of leaving corporate management behind. His quiet hope is to open a small, specialized workshop of his own\u2014not unlike his father\u2019s\u2014perhaps restoring vintage arcade machines or building custom PCs. It\u2019s a dream of returning to the hands-on work that first sparked his passion, a way to honor the man who gave him a name and a future."

Instead, he gently showed David the worn-out rubber belt inside. The scent of solder filled the air as his father\u2019s steady hands worked. For the first time, David felt a profound sense of belonging, not as a son who looked different, but as an apprentice. That quiet moment taught him patience and that everything broken could, with care, be made whole again.\n        \n2.\nIt was Chinese New Year when he was fifteen. The living room was a loud, joyful sea of Cantonese conversation, and David felt the familiar, gentle isolation of understanding only fragments. Then his grand-aunt, visiting from Hong Kong, asked his mother in Cantonese who the \u201cgweilo boy\u201d was. He watched his mother\u2019s smile tighten as she answered firmly, \u201cHe is my son.\u201d The pride in her voice was a shield and a bridge, cementing his place in the family more than any shared language ever could.\n        \n3.\nThe startup was collapsing in 2001. Panic echoed in the halls as executives packed their boxes. David, barely in his twenties, just put on his headphones and went to the server room. While the company imploded, he methodically backed up the critical data, ensuring the last paychecks could be processed. Amid the chaos, he felt a calm, steely sense of purpose. He learned then that his value wasn't tied to a company\u2019s soaring stock, but to his own unflinching competence. It was a lesson in self-reliance.\n        \n4.\nOne Tuesday morning, rattling toward downtown on the N Judah, he saw his reflection in the window, superimposed over the passing Sunset homes. He was listening to a podcast about venture capital, and a sudden, quiet wave of exhaustion washed over him. He wasn't building anything; he was just maintaining the infrastructure for others. That mundane commute became a turning point, the moment a vague dissatisfaction sharpened into a clear desire: to go back to the beginning, to the satisfying click of a well-repaired machine.\n        \n5.\nLast Sunday, over dim sum, he watched his father's hands tremble slightly as he reached for a har gow. The same hands that had taught him to hold a soldering iron now struggled with chopsticks. Without a word, David picked one up and placed it on his father\u2019s plate. In that simple, reversed gesture of care, David felt the weight of time and love. His dream of opening a shop was no longer just for him; it was a way to honor the man whose hands had built his entire world."
