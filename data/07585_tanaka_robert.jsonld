As the Senior Facilities Technician for a sprawling SoMa tech campus, he lives where he works, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his small, company-provided apartment to the building\u2019s humming mechanical core.\n\nBorn and raised in the Sunset District, Robert is a third-generation (Sansei) San Franciscan. His parents, a seamstress and a Muni mechanic, instilled in him the value of tangible, honest work. While his high school peers chased academic validation, Robert found his purpose in his father\u2019s garage, deciphering the logic of engines and wiring. He bypassed a four-year university for City College, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Electrical Mechanical Technology. It was a practical choice for a practical man.\n\nHis career was a steady climb through apprenticeships and journeyman roles, maintaining the bones of the city\u2019s older commercial buildings. The turning point came ten years ago, after a quiet divorce left him financially strained and adrift. A sought-after position at a booming tech giant offered not just a senior title, but an on-site residence. He took it, swapping a small house in Daly City for a utilitarian one-bedroom in the shadow of a server farm.\n\nRobert\u2019s life is now a cycle of controlled systems. He wakes before the young coders arrive, walking the quiet halls and checking HVAC outputs and power distribution panels. He is the invisible force ensuring their world runs flawlessly. His personal life is equally contained: weekly calls with his college-aged daughter in San Diego, a beer with a handful of old friends on Saturdays, and solitary walks through Golden Gate Park, a pilgrimage back to the San Francisco of his youth.\n\nHe feels like a relic, a man of copper wire and ductwork living inside a world of code and abstract capital. His dream isn't to launch a startup, but to save enough to buy a small condo in Pacifica. He longs to trade the sterile, recycled air of the campus for the raw, salty fog rolling in off the ocean, to finally clock out and go home."
