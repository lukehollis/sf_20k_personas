As a second-generation Chinese-American, his name was a deliberate choice by his immigrant parents, a shield and a key for the American life they envisioned for him. They ran \"Hayes Market,\" a corner grocery store that smelled of cardboard, fresh produce, and their enduring hard work. David grew up stocking shelves and making small talk with the neighborhood regulars who were as much a part of his family as his own relatives.\n\nHis escape, and his rebellion, was film. He devoured foreign cinema and classic documentaries, finding a world of expansive stories far from the predictable rhythm of the store. He earned a Bachelor's in Film Studies from UC Berkeley, dreaming of becoming a documentarian who captured untold stories. But in his final year, his father had a sudden, severe heart attack. David came home to help run the store, assuring himself and his girlfriend at the time that it was temporary. The temporary, however, became permanent after his father passed away a year later, leaving the store and his aging mother in David\u2019s care.\n\nNow at 40, David lives in the apartment above the market, his commute a single flight of stairs. His days are a routine of 6 AM openings, inventory management, and conversations with customers who have watched him grow up. He is the neighborhood's quiet anchor, privy to the community's small joys and sorrows exchanged over the counter. His film school romance ended years ago, unable to compete with the gravity of his obligations.\n\nWhile the dream of filmmaking has faded, it hasn\u2019t vanished. On quiet nights, David still sketches out storyboards, imagining a documentary about his own block\u2014the old woman who buys a single persimmon every day, the tech couple new to the city, the ever-changing face of the neighborhood. His hope is no longer to escape his life, but to find a way to honor it through the lens he once planned to see the world with. He is a man defined by duty, but he aspires to be the storyteller of the small, profound world he inherited."
