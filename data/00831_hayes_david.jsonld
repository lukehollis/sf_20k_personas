As a second-generation Chinese-American, his name was a deliberate choice by his immigrant parents, a shield and a key for the American life they envisioned for him. They ran \"Hayes Market,\" a corner grocery store that smelled of cardboard, fresh produce, and their enduring hard work. David grew up stocking shelves and making small talk with the neighborhood regulars who were as much a part of his family as his own relatives.\n\nHis escape, and his rebellion, was film. He devoured foreign cinema and classic documentaries, finding a world of expansive stories far from the predictable rhythm of the store. He earned a Bachelor's in Film Studies from UC Berkeley, dreaming of becoming a documentarian who captured untold stories. But in his final year, his father had a sudden, severe heart attack. David came home to help run the store, assuring himself and his girlfriend at the time that it was temporary. The temporary, however, became permanent after his father passed away a year later, leaving the store and his aging mother in David\u2019s care.\n\nNow at 40, David lives in the apartment above the market, his commute a single flight of stairs. His days are a routine of 6 AM openings, inventory management, and conversations with customers who have watched him grow up. He is the neighborhood's quiet anchor, privy to the community's small joys and sorrows exchanged over the counter. His film school romance ended years ago, unable to compete with the gravity of his obligations.\n\nWhile the dream of filmmaking has faded, it hasn\u2019t vanished. On quiet nights, David still sketches out storyboards, imagining a documentary about his own block\u2014the old woman who buys a single persimmon every day, the tech couple new to the city, the ever-changing face of the neighborhood. His hope is no longer to escape his life, but to find a way to honor it through the lens he once planned to see the world with. He is a man defined by duty, but he aspires to be the storyteller of the small, profound world he inherited."

His father saw sturdy retail architecture; David saw color, geometry, and light. He smelled the sweet citrus tang mixing with the scent of his father\u2019s work apron. It was the first time he understood that his world, the four walls of Hayes Market, could be framed and seen as something beautiful. This moment planted the seed of the filmmaker\u2019s eye, finding composition in the mundane demands of his inheritance.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, the darkness of the Balboa Theatre was his sanctuary. He sat through a screening of Wong Kar-wai\u2019s *In the Mood for Love*, mesmerized. It wasn't just a film; it was a feeling, a world of longing and unspoken truths that felt more real than his own life. Walking home, the Richmond fog seemed cinematic, not dreary. The film didn't just show him a different world; it gave him a language for the quiet sadness and duty he felt but couldn't name, solidifying his rebellion as an artistic pursuit.\n\n3.\nThe phone call came in his final year at Berkeley. He was in an editing bay, the scent of hot equipment and celluloid in the air, when his mother's frantic voice cut through the phone. In that instant, the aural collage of his student film was replaced by the screeching halt of his future. The weight wasn't just his father's failing health; it was the sudden, crushing gravity of the store, his mother, and his entire life, pulling him back from his dream with an unbreakable force.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty-six, and his girlfriend was visiting from LA. She spoke of grants and new projects, her words full of light and possibility. A customer came in, and he instinctively turned away from her to ask, \"The usual, Mrs. Gable?\" In that simple, dutiful turn, they both saw the truth. His life was a series of predictable loops inside those four walls; hers was a forward-moving line. The quiet goodbye they shared later that week wasn't about a lack of love, but an acknowledgment of two incompatible realities.\n\n5.\nJust last year, Mrs. Lin, a customer since he was a boy, bought her daily persimmon. As her wrinkled hand placed the coins in his, he saw it\u2014not as a transaction, but as a shot. The texture of her skin against the smooth, vibrant fruit. He felt a profound urge to document this small, sacred ritual. The crushing weight of duty he\u2019d carried for years suddenly shifted, feeling less like a burden and more like a story only he could tell. The dream wasn't dead; it had just come home."
