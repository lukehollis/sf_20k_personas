A native San Franciscan, she is the product of two distinct city cultures. Her father, a stoic carpenter of Swedish descent from the Outer Sunset, taught her the language of wood, calipers, and patience. Her mother, who emigrated from Guangzhou and became a meticulous financial auditor, imbued her with a respect for systems and precision. Mei Lin\u2019s childhood was a blend of foggy beach bonfires and quiet evenings helping her mother balance ledgers, shaping her into a person who saw beauty in both tangible craft and elegant efficiency.\n\nHer path seemed set when she pursued a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. After graduation, she spent three years at a massive Silicon Valley medical device corporation. While the work was stable, she felt disconnected, designing components on a screen for a factory thousands of miles away. The turning point came during a visit to her father\u2019s dusty workshop. Watching him shape a piece of redwood, she had an epiphany: her passion wasn't just in the design, but in the creation itself. She quit her corporate job, cashed in her stock options, and invested in her own slice of San Francisco\u2019s industrial heartland.\n\nToday, Mei Lin runs a boutique manufacturing consultancy from her live-work loft. Her ground floor is a state-of-the-art workshop filled with 3D printers and CNC machines, where she creates high-fidelity prototypes for local hardware startups. Her commute is a simple walk down a flight of steel stairs. Her partner, Alex, a software engineer, often works from their sunlit living space upstairs, their lives a perfect synergy of hardware and software. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow makers and old college friends, often meeting for climbing sessions at Mission Cliffs or ramen in the Mission.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t world domination, but mastery. She aspires to be the go-to engineer for the most challenging small-batch manufacturing problems in the Bay Area. She feels deeply connected to Dogpatch, a neighborhood that, like her, has reinvented itself while honoring its industrial roots. For Mei Lin Peterson, San Francisco isn't just a backdrop; it\u2019s the raw material from which she has engineered a life of purpose and tangible creation."
