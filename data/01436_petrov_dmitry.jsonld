            "value": "Dmitry Petrov was born in Cleveland, the only child of a quiet, intense Soviet dissident who taught mathematics and an endlessly practical second-generation Irish-American nurse. His parents, wary of labels after fleeing one regime, raised him to be simply \"American,\" shunning any specific ethnic or religious identity. This left Dmitry with a feeling of being untethered, a sense he channeled into a restless youth. He rejected the structure of formal education after high school, finding more truth in Kerouac's prose than in college course catalogs. In 1988, at age 20, he followed the pull of counter-culture to San Francisco.\n\nHe found his purpose in the tragedy of the AIDS epidemic. After losing his first close friend in the city to the disease, Dmitry\u2019s aimlessness crystallized into a fierce resolve. He began volunteering at a small Castro clinic, answering phones and stuffing envelopes. His quiet competence and deep empathy didn't go unnoticed. He became a street outreach worker, then a case manager, earning his education not in lecture halls but in hospital wards and support groups. His career was built on grit, trust, and the thousands of hours he spent on the front lines, making him more knowledgeable than many with advanced degrees. This on-the-ground expertise eventually led to his current role as a Public Health Program Manager, a position he earned through decades of dedicated service.\n\nNow 54, Dmitry\u2019s life is rooted in his Duboce Triangle apartment, where he has worked from home since before the pandemic made it common. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a quiet, hyper-local routine. Mornings begin with a walk with his rescue terrier, Buster, in Duboce Park, followed by coffee from a familiar cafe. His days are a mix of Zoom calls with city agencies and mentoring younger staff, whom he views as his legacy. He has been with his partner, a landscape architect named Marcus, for fifteen years.\n\nDmitry\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul. He\u2019s not a transplant; he is part of the city\u2019s resilient fabric. His aspiration is no longer to change the world but to protect the corner of it he helped heal. He hopes to one day write a memoir of his early years in the crisis, ensuring that the generation of ghosts he still walks with are never forgotten."
