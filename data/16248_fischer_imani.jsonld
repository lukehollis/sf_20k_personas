Raised in Oakland by a community organizer father and a public school teacher mother, she learned early that systems could either uplift or oppress. For her family, who relied on AC Transit, a late bus wasn\u2019t an inconvenience; it was a docked paycheck or a missed appointment. She saw public transportation as a lifeline, its effectiveness a direct measure of a city's equity. This foundational belief shaped her entire trajectory.\n\nHer academic path was a straight line toward public impact. She attended UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies, later earning her Master of Public Policy from the Goldman School. While her peers were lured by lucrative consulting gigs, Imani\u2019s turning point came during an internship where she analyzed ridership data. She saw not just numbers, but stories\u2014of night-shift nurses, students, and families whose lives were dictated by bus schedules. It solidified her resolve to work from within the system. Landing a Policy Analyst position at the SFMTA felt less like a job and more like a calling.\n\nNow, at 29, Imani lives what she preaches. Her 2.4-mile commute from her Lower Haight apartment is a daily field study on the N-Judah line. She observes passenger flow, timing, and accessibility with a critical eye, notes app open on her phone. Her life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco. Weekends are for runs through Golden Gate Park, browsing the stacks at Green Apple Books, and debating housing policy with her partner, an attorney for a tenants' rights non-profit. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow civil servants and activists, bonded by a shared desire for a more just Bay Area.\n\nImani\u2019s ambition isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to build a better city. Her current project is a proposal for an equitable fare structure, and she dreams of the day she can ride a bus line that she helped make faster and more accessible for San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable residents. For Imani, success is seeing her analysis translate into tangible, positive change on the streets she calls home."

She felt his calm fa\u00e7ade crack, the quiet tension of a man calculating lost wages in his head. The world, for that moment, shrank to the injustice of their wait, the helplessness of relying on a system that didn\u2019t see them. It wasn't a policy problem then; it was the knot in her stomach, a feeling that would fuel her for decades to come.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in the university library during her Goldman internship. A spreadsheet of late-night ridership on the 24-Divisadero line blurred before her eyes. Then, a cluster of data points coalesced into a person: a nurse from SF General, exhausted. The numbers weren\u2019t abstract anymore; they were stories of sacrifice, dictated by service hours. In that silent, fluorescent-lit moment, lucrative consulting gigs dissolved. There was only this\u2014the data that bled humanity, and her overwhelming need to serve it.\n\n3.\nHer first project was minor: analyzing rider feedback to justify adding a bench and shelter at an exposed bus stop in the Bayview. Six months later, riding the T-Third on a Saturday, she saw it. An older man sat on the new bench, shielded from the wind, reading a paper. No one knew her role in its existence. Seeing that small moment of dignity and comfort\u2014a direct result of her work\u2014was more validating than any promotion. It was a physical manifestation of her purpose.\n\n4.\nLast winter, the N-Judah stalled in the tunnel. An elderly woman, clutching grocery bags, became audibly distressed about getting home before dark. Imani, instinctively switching from analyst to neighbor, helped her navigate the bus bridge transfer. The woman\u2019s relieved \u201cGod bless you\u201d wasn\u2019t for an SFMTA employee, but for a kind stranger. For Imani, it was a sharp, humbling reminder that her work wasn\u2019t just about system efficiency, but about delivering someone\u2019s grandmother safely home.\n\n5.\nShe was mapping her equitable fare proposal on their kitchen table, surrounded by her partner\u2019s legal briefs on eviction defense. He traced one of her proposed low-income routes with his finger. \"This line,\" he said, \"is the same one three of my clients use to get to their hearings.\" The sudden, perfect overlay of their worlds\u2014transportation and housing, access and justice\u2014felt like a jolt of electricity. In that instant, her project wasn't just a policy proposal; it was a shield for his clients."
