The only child of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Taraval Street. She watched the L Taraval streetcar rumble by daily, a lifeline connecting her quiet, residential world to the city's vibrant core. Her parents, who worked tirelessly, viewed education as the ultimate form of security, and Grace absorbed their work ethic, excelling in school with a quiet, determined focus.\n\nHer perspective shifted during her undergraduate years at UCLA. Confronted with Los Angeles's infamous sprawl, she grew fascinated by the stark contrast to her compact, transit-oriented upbringing. This fascination solidified into a passion, leading her to pursue a Master's in Urban & Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. She chose her field not for prestige, but to solve a puzzle that had captivated her since childhood: how to make a city move for everyone.\n\nNow, at 32, Grace works as a Transportation Planner for a city agency. Her life is a practical application of her ideals. She lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice for its central location and walkability. Her 1.8-mile commute is a short MUNI ride to her office near City Hall, a daily field study of the system she works to improve. A key turning point in her career was seeing the completion of a protected bike lane she helped design on Folsom Street, watching families and commuters use it safely.\n\nHer circle of friends is a mix from her Berkeley days and a few childhood friends still in the city. Weekends are for browsing the Ferry Building Farmer's Market, hiking in Marin, and Sunday dinners with her parents in the Sunset. Grace dreams of one day leading a major project that improves transit equity for the city's elderly and non-English-speaking populations, a tribute to her own family\u2019s experience. She isn\u2019t just a resident of San Francisco; she is an active participant in its daily rhythm, meticulously planning the pathways that connect its diverse communities."

She looked up to see her father pause his stocking of shelves, his gaze following the train with a quiet, exhausted longing. In that moment, she understood the streetcar wasn't just noise; it was the physical form of her parents\u2019 aspirations for her, a lifeline to a world they could see but rarely had time to ride.\n\n2.\nDuring her first year at UCLA, she tried to meet a friend for dinner across town. The two-hour, multi-bus journey left her feeling stranded and anonymous under a vast, smoggy sky. It was a moment of profound frustration, followed by a wave of homesickness not for her family, but for the predictable rumble of the L Taraval. She understood viscerally that a city's design wasn't an abstraction; it determined your freedom. Her interest in planning became an urgent, personal mission that night.\n\n3.\nA few years ago, on the first Saturday after the Folsom Street bike lane she helped design was completed, she went to watch. She saw a father patiently running alongside his daughter\u2019s wobbling bicycle, both of them laughing inside the concrete barrier she had advocated for. The sight brought an unexpected tightness to her chest. It wasn't a data point or a line on a blueprint; it was a family\u2019s safe passage. Her work finally felt real and deeply essential.\n\n4.\nLast year, over Sunday dinner in the Sunset, her mother admitted in Cantonese that she\u2019d avoided a doctor\u2019s appointment because the required MUNI transfer felt too confusing and overwhelming. Grace saw a flicker of fear in the eyes of her stoic mother. The abstract concept of \"transit equity\" collapsed into one sharp, personal point: her parents' world was shrinking. That confession ignited her quiet ambition into a burning resolve to build a system they could navigate with dignity.\n\n5.\nWhile studying at Berkeley, she returned home one weekend to help at the store. An elderly man, a regular since her childhood, fumbled with his change, his hands trembling. Grace switched to Cantonese, patiently helping him count his money and explaining the new MUNI fare machine. The look of relief on his face was immense. It wasn't about planning or theory; it was about human connection. That small act of translation and kindness solidified her desire to work for the city, for him."
