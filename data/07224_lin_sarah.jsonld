The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in the Outer Sunset, she grew up surrounded by the scent of dried mushrooms and the constant hum of her parents\u2019 ambition. They instilled in her a formidable work ethic, hoping she\u2019d pursue a stable career like medicine. Sarah, however, was drawn to the nascent digital world blossoming around her in the 90s, a world her parents viewed with loving skepticism.\n\nHer quiet rebellion led her not to medical school, but to Stanford, where she earned a Master\u2019s degree in Human-Computer Interaction. She saw technology not as cold code, but as a new way for people to connect and create. Sarah joined the first dot-com wave, quickly rising through the ranks at a major tech corporation. For nearly two decades, she was a star performer, eventually reaching a Vice President role. But the success felt hollow, a gilded cage of endless meetings and stakeholder management that distanced her from the creative work she loved.\n\nThe turning point came at 41. After a grueling product launch, she looked out from her corner office and felt utterly disconnected from the vibrant city below. She resigned two months later. After a year of travel and introspection, she founded Lin UX Strategy from the spare bedroom of her Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute became a symbol of her reclaimed life.\n\nNow 49, Sarah\u2019s days are her own. They begin with yoga at a local studio, followed by coffee from Ritual Roasters as she plans her day. She consults for a select group of mission-driven startups, helping them build technology that is intuitive and humane. She has cultivated a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech veterans and local artists\u2014and is slowly rebuilding a relationship with her now-retired parents, who finally see her success not in a corporate title, but in her contentment. Her dream is no longer to climb a ladder, but to deepen her roots: to mentor young women entering the tech field and, perhaps, to take a six-month sabbatical to learn ceramics in Japan, finally untethering herself completely from the digital world she helped build."
