His name, a puzzle to classmates, was a testament to their unlikely love story. Growing up, Anwar was the family\u2019s quiet observer and translator, not just of languages, but of cultural cues and unspoken tensions. He witnessed firsthand how his father\u2019s pride and his mother\u2019s community-focused mindset often clashed, particularly around issues of mental and emotional health. When his father fell into a deep depression after a work injury, the family\u2019s inability to seek help due to stigma became Anwar's defining turning point.\n\nThis experience propelled him toward a career in social work. He attended San Francisco State University, earning both his bachelor's degree and a Master of Social Work. He was drawn to the practical, community-based approach, determined to build the bridges his own family had lacked. He interned at a community clinic in the Mission, counseling families navigating immigration, trauma, and poverty. It was grueling work that solidified his purpose. After years of supervised practice, he earned his LCSW credential, a milestone that felt more significant than any diploma.\n\nNow 38, Anwar lives and works from his serene apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic gift; his sunlit spare room is a telehealth office where he provides therapy for a major healthcare provider. His clients are a cross-section of the city, but he specializes in working with first-generation professionals and individuals from mixed-heritage backgrounds. His days are structured around virtual sessions, charting, and decompressing with long walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nAnwar\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014artists, teachers, and chefs\u2014a chosen family that gathers for potlucks and weekend hikes to Muir Beach. He remains single, finding fulfillment in his work and deep friendships. His dream is to eventually open a small private practice in his neighborhood, offering sliding-scale therapy to ensure cost is never a barrier. For Anwar, San Francisco isn't a city of tech booms or hustle culture; it's a collection of communities in need of connection and healing, and he has found his place by tending to its heart."
