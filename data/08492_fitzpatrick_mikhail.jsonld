Raised in the foggy expanse of the Outer Sunset, Mikhail\u2019s childhood was filled with the rumble of the N Judah, the scent of salty air, and the practical, no-nonsense lessons of a working-class home. He was never a stellar student; his hands were always more interested in taking apart a broken radio than in a history book.\n\nHis path was set not by ambition, but by necessity. When his father was injured on the docks, college became an unaffordable dream. At 18, Mikhail took a job as a maintenance apprentice for a property management company, quickly discovering a talent for plumbing, electrical work, and the patient art of plaster repair. He learned his trade in the guts of buildings across the city, rising from assistant to manager through sheer competence and reliability.\n\nThe key turning point was landing his current position fifteen years ago. He became the live-in manager for a grand, pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill, a world away from his humble upbringing. His basement unit is both his home and his headquarters, a 0.0-mile commute that inextricably links his life to his work. This constant proximity cost him his marriage; his ex-wife tired of never truly having him \u201coff the clock.\u201d\n\nNow, at 47, Mikhail is a fixture in the building, its quiet, institutional memory. He knows which floorboards creak, which radiators hiss, and which tenants are going through a hard time. His daily routine is a steady rhythm of walk-throughs, repair tickets, and brief, friendly conversations in the lobby. He maintains a professional distance but is a trusted confidant for the elderly Mrs. Chen on the third floor and the one who discretely ignores the occasional late-night noise from the young couple in 4B.\n\nHis dream is an escape from the city he so intimately maintains. He saves methodically for a small house near the Russian River, a place where the only leaky faucet he has to fix is his own. But for now, his world is the hum of the boiler, the chime of the vintage elevator, and the hundred small lives unfolding above his head, all held together by his steady, capable hands."
