The daughter of pragmatic Shanghainese immigrants who settled in the Outer Richmond, Meilin was groomed for a stable career in finance or medicine. Her childhood was a landscape of foggy avenues and her parents\u2019 quiet diligence\u2014her father a tailor, her mother a pharmacy technician. While they saw her future in spreadsheets or prescriptions, Meilin found hers in the hushed galleries of the de Young Museum, losing herself for hours in the stories objects told.\n\nThe first rebellion of her life was academic. After a dutiful year studying business at SF State, a single art history elective felt like a tectonic shift in her soul. She changed her major, weathering her parents\u2019 silent disappointment. This newfound purpose propelled her to an East Coast university for a Master\u2019s in Museum Studies, where she specialized in the conservation and history of East Asian decorative arts.\n\nHer return to San Francisco was a quiet triumph. She secured the position of Collections Manager at the Sterling House, a small, privately-funded museum in Pacific Heights dedicated to the art and artifacts of Pacific trade. The position came with a rare San Francisco treasure: a small, rent-controlled apartment on the museum\u2019s top floor, making her commute a simple walk downstairs.\n\nHer days are a ritual of meticulous care: monitoring climate controls, cataloging acquisitions, and researching the provenance of a porcelain vase or a lacquered box. Her life is intertwined with her work; the museum's silent, beautiful objects are her most constant companions. Her social circle is small but cherished, consisting of a bookbinder she met at a workshop and a fellow curator from SFMOMA. She sees her parents for dim sum on weekends, their initial disappointment having slowly morphed into a hesitant pride they can\u2019t quite articulate.\n\nMeilin\u2019s dream is to curate an exhibition that re-centers the narrative of Pacific trade, highlighting the forgotten stories of the Chinese merchants and artisans whose work fills the museum\u2019s collection. She feels a deep kinship with these creators from the past. For now, she is content in her quiet stewardship, living and breathing the history of her city from within the walls of one of its hidden gems."
