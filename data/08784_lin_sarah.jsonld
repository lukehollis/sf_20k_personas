The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store in the Sunset District, she grew up amidst the quiet diligence of creating a new life. Her parents preached practicality\u2014medicine, law\u2014but Sarah was drawn to the wild, sprawling expanse of Golden Gate Park just blocks from her home. It was her true classroom.\n\nThe defining moment came with the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The violent shudder didn't just shake the city; it awakened in a teenage Sarah a profound understanding of nature\u2019s power and humanity's fragile relationship with it. This spurred her to study Environmental Science at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master's in Environmental Policy and Management from Yale. She returned to the Bay Area, initially taking a job with a large corporate consulting firm. However, she grew disillusioned by the \"greenwashing\"\u2014advising corporations on how to appear sustainable without making substantive change.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce a decade ago. Her ex-husband, a tech executive, embodied the relentless growth-at-all-costs mentality she fought against in her professional life. The separation was liberating, prompting her to quit her corporate job and establish her own independent consultancy. Now, from her sunlit Cole Valley flat, her commute is a mere ten steps to her home office. She carefully selects her clients, working primarily with non-profits, progressive city agencies, and ethical startups committed to genuine environmental impact.\n\nHer days have a quiet rhythm: an early morning run through the Panhandle, strong coffee while reviewing policy drafts, and afternoons spent on calls with clients across the globe. Her social life is small but meaningful, centered on a weekend hiking group she explores Marin with and a long-standing book club. Though content, Sarah dreams of leaving a tangible legacy\u2014perhaps leading the policy development for a major Bay Area wetland restoration project. She cherishes her independence and her deep roots in the city, a place she quietly works to protect, one meticulously researched report at a time."
