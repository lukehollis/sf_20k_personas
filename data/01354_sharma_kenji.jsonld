Born to an Indian academic father and a second-generation Japanese-American mother, his Berkeley upbringing was a blend of intellectual rigor and quiet artistic sensibility. From his father, he inherited a love for structure and history; from his mother, a reverence for minimalism and the beauty of natural materials. This duality became the foundation of his architectural philosophy.\n\nHis educational path was direct and local. Kenji earned his Bachelor of Architecture from UC Berkeley, where he chafed under purely theoretical exercises. He craved the tactile reality of building. After graduating, he joined a large, prestigious firm in downtown San Francisco, designing sleek but soulless glass towers. The work was financially rewarding but creatively hollow. The turning point came at age 35, a quiet rebellion against corporate conformity. He cashed in his savings, rented a small ground-floor space, and founded \"Sharma Design,\" a firm dedicated to thoughtful, human-centric architecture.\n\nNow 54, Kenji is the principal of that same small firm, which operates out of the ground floor of the meticulously restored Victorian he owns in Hayes Valley. His commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs. His life and work are seamlessly integrated. His days begin with a walk to a local cafe for a pour-over, sketchbook in hand, and end late in his studio, poring over blueprints for a residential renovation or a small community center.\n\nKenji is amicably divorced; his ex-wife moved to Portland a decade ago. His proudest creation is his daughter, Maya, a 24-year-old artist now living in New York. Their relationship is a warm but distant one, maintained through weekly video calls where he peers at her life through a screen. His social life is small and intimate, revolving around his two young associates and the familiar faces in his neighborhood. He doesn\u2019t dream of building skyscrapers anymore. Instead, his aspiration is to leave behind a handful of beautiful, functional spaces that feel intrinsically part of San Francisco's urban fabric\u2014buildings that, like him, honor the past while thoughtfully shaping the future."
