Born to an Indian academic father and a second-generation Japanese-American mother, his Berkeley upbringing was a blend of intellectual rigor and quiet artistic sensibility. From his father, he inherited a love for structure and history; from his mother, a reverence for minimalism and the beauty of natural materials. This duality became the foundation of his architectural philosophy.\n\nHis educational path was direct and local. Kenji earned his Bachelor of Architecture from UC Berkeley, where he chafed under purely theoretical exercises. He craved the tactile reality of building. After graduating, he joined a large, prestigious firm in downtown San Francisco, designing sleek but soulless glass towers. The work was financially rewarding but creatively hollow. The turning point came at age 35, a quiet rebellion against corporate conformity. He cashed in his savings, rented a small ground-floor space, and founded \"Sharma Design,\" a firm dedicated to thoughtful, human-centric architecture.\n\nNow 54, Kenji is the principal of that same small firm, which operates out of the ground floor of the meticulously restored Victorian he owns in Hayes Valley. His commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs. His life and work are seamlessly integrated. His days begin with a walk to a local cafe for a pour-over, sketchbook in hand, and end late in his studio, poring over blueprints for a residential renovation or a small community center.\n\nKenji is amicably divorced; his ex-wife moved to Portland a decade ago. His proudest creation is his daughter, Maya, a 24-year-old artist now living in New York. Their relationship is a warm but distant one, maintained through weekly video calls where he peers at her life through a screen. His social life is small and intimate, revolving around his two young associates and the familiar faces in his neighborhood. He doesn\u2019t dream of building skyscrapers anymore. Instead, his aspiration is to leave behind a handful of beautiful, functional spaces that feel intrinsically part of San Francisco's urban fabric\u2014buildings that, like him, honor the past while thoughtfully shaping the future."

She ran his small hand over a plank of unfinished cypress, telling him to feel the story in the grain. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she\u2019d said softly, \u201cand that\u2019s why it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d It was not a lesson in carpentry, but in philosophy. In that moment, he understood that a structure\u2019s most profound beauty wasn't in its flawless design, but in the life and history held within its materials. It became his guiding principle.\n\n2.\nAt 35, he stood in the penthouse of a glass tower he\u2019d helped design. The view of the bay was spectacular, but he felt nothing. He saw the reflection of a beautiful, century-old brick building across the street, its form warped and distorted on his sleek, sterile facade. A profound hollowness washed over him. He wasn't building San Francisco; he was erasing it. He wrote his resignation letter that night. The decision wasn\u2019t an impulse, but a quiet, soul-crushing certainty that he was on the wrong side of history.\n\n3.\nThe day he moved into his own ground-floor space in Hayes Valley, the only furniture was a folding table and a stool. He sat there as dusk fell, the smell of fresh paint mixing with old plaster, a single bare bulb overhead. The silence was filled with a liberating terror. There was no safety net, no corporate prestige, just the weight of his own name on the door. It was the most honest and hopeful moment of his life, the true foundation of everything he would build from then on.\n\n4.\nMaya was fifteen when he found her on the sidewalk, sketching the intricate ironwork on the facade of their Victorian. She wasn\u2019t just copying it; she was tracing its history with her pencil, her brow furrowed in concentration. He felt a wave of pride so intense it almost hurt. In her careful attention to detail\u2014the rust, the elegant curves\u2014he saw his mother\u2019s reverence and his own love for the city\u2019s bones. He knew then that his legacy wasn\u2019t just in buildings, but in her eyes.\n\n5.\nYears after it was built, he sat on a bench across from the small community center he designed in the Mission. He watched a group of kids spill out the door, laughing, and saw an elderly man stop to run his hand along the warm, reclaimed redwood of the entryway. No one knew he was the architect. He felt no ego, only a deep, quiet sense of belonging. This was it. This was the success he\u2019d chased: not a monument to himself, but a humble, useful space woven seamlessly into the city\u2019s life."
