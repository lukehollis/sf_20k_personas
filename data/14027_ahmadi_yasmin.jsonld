Born in Shiraz, Iran, her early childhood was colored by the scent of her mother\u2019s rose garden and the sound of her engineer father\u2019s drafting pencil. This idyllic world fractured in 1979. At age seven, she and her family fled the revolution, eventually landing in the Bay Area with two suitcases and a fierce determination to rebuild. The instability of her youth instilled in Yasmin a deep appreciation for systems, predictability, and control.\n\nWhile her peers at San Jose State explored more glamorous fields, Yasmin was drawn to the elegant logic of Logistics and Supply Chain Management. It was the perfect antidote to the unpredictability that had once uprooted her life. She saw the world not as a series of random events, but as a complex puzzle of movement and timing waiting to be solved. This led her to a career in public transportation, where she found her calling. For over two decades, she has been a key mind behind San Francisco\u2019s transit network, a senior scheduler who treats bus routes and light rail timetables with the precision of a watchmaker.\n\nNow 52, Yasmin\u2019s life reflects her work. She lives alone in a meticulously kept apartment in Hayes Valley, chosen for its central location and easy access to multiple transit lines. Her 3.5-mile commute on the Muni is a daily quality-control check of her own intricate designs. A brief, ill-fated marriage in her thirties to a free-spirited artist taught her she was happiest as the sole architect of her own life. Her social circle is small but cherished, composed of a few old colleagues and a neighbor with whom she visits the farmers' market.\n\nYasmin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not through its iconic landmarks, but its functional backbone. She finds more beauty in a perfectly executed bus schedule during rush hour than in the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset. Her dream isn't retirement on a beach, but seeing the next major transit expansion launch flawlessly under her watch. She is one of the city\u2019s quiet guardians, a woman who long ago decided that the greatest peace comes from ensuring everything, and everyone, gets where they need to go, right on time."

Her mother had picked one last rose before they left, and somewhere in the chaos, Yasmin watched the soft, white petals get trampled on the floor. At seven, she didn\u2019t understand politics, only that the predictable scent of her garden and the steady scratch of her father\u2019s pencil had been replaced by noise and disorder. That moment planted a seed: a deep, quiet vow to build a world that could never be trampled.\n**(Age 7, 1979)**\n\n2.\nIn a San Jose State library, a textbook diagram stopped her breath. It was a complex flowchart for a global shipping network\u2014a beautiful, intricate dance of vessels, ports, and timetables. While her classmates groaned, Yasmin felt a profound sense of peace. It was proof that even the world\u2019s biggest messes could be organized with logic and foresight. This wasn't just a major; it was an answer. It was the moment she realized she could spend her life fighting the kind of chaos that had once uprooted hers.\n**(Age 20, circa 1992)**\n\n3.\nHer husband, a painter, had \u201cre-curated\u201d her bookshelf by spine color. He thought it was a romantic gesture. Staring at the beautiful, illogical chaos he\u2019d created, Yasmin felt a cold, deep finality. It wasn\u2019t about the books. It was the realization that his entire existence thrived on the very spontaneity that she found destabilizing. She knew then that her happiness would never be a collaboration; it had to be a system she designed and maintained herself, a quiet space of perfect order.\n**(Age 34, circa 2005)**\n\n4.\nIt was the first morning of a major service overhaul she had designed. From the SFMTA control room, she watched the GPS icons of the buses move along their new routes. One amber N-Judah icon, perfectly on schedule, passed a green 22-Fillmore icon at the exact intersection she\u2019d calculated. A wave of elation, more potent than any praise, washed over her. It was the sublime beauty of a complex system functioning flawlessly. This was her art, seen by no one but felt by thousands.\n**(Age 45, circa 2016)**\n\n5.\nLast week, riding the 5-Fulton during a sudden downpour, she watched people board, shaking off their umbrellas. They were commuters, students, tourists\u2014all finding refuge and reliability in the warm, dry bus that arrived just when the schedule said it would. Yasmin felt not pride, but a quiet sense of belonging. She wasn't an immigrant or a scheduler; she was a guardian of the city\u2019s rhythm. Her intricate work was the silent promise that, no matter the storm, you could get where you needed to go.\n**(Age 52, last week)**"
