The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a bustling San Jose laundromat, David grew up amidst the hum of machines and the scent of bleach, a tangible world far removed from the abstract logic he now navigates daily. His parents championed practicality, envisioning a stable future for him, and he obliged, channeling his quiet intensity into academics.\n\nHe chose UC Berkeley, not for computer science, but for Cognitive Science. He was fascinated by the architecture of the mind, a passion that seamlessly translated into coding. His bachelor's degree became a bridge to software engineering. A key turning point came right after graduation: a scrappy, idealistic startup he co-founded with two college friends. They poured two years of their lives into an app designed to facilitate local volunteer work. Its failure was a quiet, crushing blow that taught him the harsh difference between a noble idea and a viable product.\n\nHumbled, David accepted a remote role at a large, stable tech firm. Now, his 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to his standing desk. His daily routine is a cycle of code, coffee from the local cafe on Valencia Street, and solo lunches. The ghosts of his failed startup linger in his closest friendships\u2014his two co-founders remain his core social circle, their bond forged in shared ambition and disappointment.\n\nTo counteract the digital haze, David has embraced the analog. He shoots film photography, his vintage Minolta camera forcing him to slow down and truly see his neighborhood: the vibrant murals, the weathered Victorian facades, the weekend crowds in Dolores Park. He feels like an observer in his own city, a resident tethered by Wi-Fi but disconnected from its pulse. His dream is no longer to be a founder, but to one day build something small, tangible, and lasting\u2014perhaps a community darkroom or a tech education program for local kids\u2014a project that requires him to finally step out from behind the screen."
