Raised in a comfortable suburban Ohio home, she was the daughter of a high school history teacher and a passionate woodworker who ran a small, beloved furniture shop. Rebecca inherited their appreciation for the arts, losing herself in museums and art books. She enrolled at Oberlin College to study Art History, envisioning a future as a museum curator, surrounded by the beauty and stories she cherished.\n\nThe turning point came abruptly during her senior year. Her father\u2019s business, unable to compete with mass-market retailers, shuttered almost overnight, taking her family\u2019s financial security with it. The experience was a brutal lesson in the fragility of passion without a safety net. Shaken, Rebecca graduated with her arts degree and a newfound, desperate need for stability.\n\nShe moved to Chicago and took an entry-level job as a bank teller\u2014anything to get her foot in the door of the financial world. To her surprise, she discovered an unexpected aptitude for the work. The patterns in market data and balance sheets weren't so different from analyzing composition in a Renaissance painting; they just told a different kind of story. Driven by a fear of ever feeling so helpless again, she poured herself into her work, earning certifications and climbing the corporate ladder. This dedication eventually led to a lucrative offer as a Financial Analyst in San Francisco.\n\nNow 34, Rebecca lives a highly structured life from her chic, minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. Her zero-mile commute means her days are a disciplined cycle: a morning run through the neighborhood, followed by hours immersed in spreadsheets and market analyses. Her home is her fortress. She\u2019s built a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly colleagues, with whom she enjoys quiet dinners at local bistros or weekend trips to Sonoma.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate but contained, mostly confined to the few blocks around her home. While she has achieved the financial security she craved, a part of her still longs for the world she left behind. Her deepest aspiration is to one day merge her two lives: using her financial acumen to become a benefactor for emerging artists or to serve on the board of a local museum, finally bringing the curator and the analyst into a single, complete picture."
