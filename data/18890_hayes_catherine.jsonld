The daughter of an accountant and a schoolteacher, she was raised with a strong work ethic but a limited sense of possibility. She escaped to the University of Michigan, pursuing a degree in Art History, a small act of rebellion against her pragmatic upbringing. She dreamed of curating galleries, of living a life surrounded by beauty and historical significance.\n\nHer move to San Francisco in the late 1990s was a turning point. The art world she found was insular and poorly funded. While temping at a commercial real estate firm to pay her rent, she had an epiphany: the real power and artistry weren't in the paintings, but in the iconic buildings that housed them. She saw the city's skyline as the ultimate collection, and she wanted to be one of its curators.\n\nCatherine channeled her voracious ambition into this new field. Lacking a business degree, she compensated with a sharp intellect and relentless drive, quickly moving from an assistant to a licensed broker, then an analyst. She had an eye for undervalued properties and a stomach for high-stakes negotiation, which saw her rise steadily through the corporate ranks.\n\nNow, at 43, Catherine is the Vice President of her firm. Her life is contained within the elegant confines of her Pacific Heights condo, which doubles as her office. The 0.0-mile commute is a status symbol she earned, allowing her to command billion-dollar deals in her slippers. Her days are a strict routine: pre-dawn calls with New York, a mid-morning walk with her rescue terrier in Lafayette Park, and afternoons of complex financial modeling, broken up by a Pilates class.\n\nFiercely independent after a long-term relationship buckled under the weight of her career, her social circle is small and loyal, consisting of a few other high-achieving professionals. While she has achieved the financial security her parents prized, her old dream flickers. Catherine now aspires to launch her own boutique investment fund, one that specializes in acquiring and preserving architecturally significant buildings\u2014a final, perfect synthesis of her love for art and her mastery of capital."
