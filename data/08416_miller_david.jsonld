Raised in the manicured suburbs of Walnut Creek, he was the son of a pragmatic accountant and a real estate agent. They instilled in him the value of a stable career path, guiding him toward a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration from San Francisco State University. In the late 90s, he did everything right, landing a lucrative job in financial services downtown, riding the thrilling wave of the dot-com boom. But the higher his portfolio climbed, the emptier he felt. The work was abstract, a game of numbers that felt disconnected from real human impact.\n\nThe dot-com crash of 2001 was his turning point. While his colleagues saw ruin, David felt a strange sense of liberation. Laid off and untethered for the first time in his adult life, he began volunteering at a local after-school program. It was there, helping a third-grader finally grasp long division, that he felt a spark of purpose he\u2019d never known in a boardroom. Within a year, he had enrolled in a teaching credential program. His parents were baffled, but David had never been more certain.\n\nFor the past two decades, David has been a fourth-grade teacher at an elementary school in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a core part of his identity; he lives just three blocks from the school in a rent-controlled apartment he\u2019s had for fifteen years. His days follow a comforting rhythm: a morning walk through the fog to his classroom, afternoons grading papers at a favorite table at a Clement Street caf\u00e9, and evenings spent reading history novels. He is a recognized figure in the neighborhood, known by name at the local grocer and the public library.\n\nThough single, his life is rich with connection. His colleagues are his closest friends, and his former students, now in high school or college, sometimes stop him on the street to say hello. These moments are his greatest reward. David\u2019s dream is not of wealth or recognition, but of continuity. He hopes to teach until retirement, watch his \"kids\" build their own lives, and perhaps one day buy a small, quiet cabin near the Russian River\u2014a peaceful epilogue to a life spent investing in something far more valuable than stocks: potential."
