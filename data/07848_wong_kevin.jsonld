Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, he is the son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store. His upbringing was a lesson in pragmatism; success wasn't about prestige but about stability and hard work. After high school, Kevin felt adrift, unsure of his path and lacking the academic drive his parents hoped for.\n\nThe turning point came when he was 22. His mother suffered a sudden, severe stroke, and the family\u2019s life was upended. During her long recovery at SF General, Kevin was mesmerized not by the doctors, but by the relentless, compassionate care of the nursing staff. They were the ones who explained procedures in patient terms, who held his mother's hand, and who managed chaos with grace. Inspired, Kevin found his purpose. He enrolled in the Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) program at City College of San Francisco, a practical, hands-on path that suited him perfectly.\n\nNow 32, Kevin is a Registered Nurse in the cardiac unit at the UCSF Parnassus campus. His 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his lifestyle; he lives in a small, modern apartment in a building adjacent to the hospital, a perk for essential staff. His days are a blur of 12-hour shifts, beeping monitors, and life-or-death decisions. He thrives on the adrenaline but is keenly aware of the burnout that hovers over his profession.\n\nHis social life is intertwined with his work, consisting mostly of drinks with fellow nurses at neighborhood bars. On his rare days off, he escapes the sterile environment by running long distances in Golden Gate Park or visiting his parents, who are now retired. Kevin dreams of a life beyond the hospital's shadow. He\u2019s saving to go back to school for his BSN, but his more personal aspiration is to take a six-month sabbatical to travel through Southeast Asia\u2014to see a world not defined by charts and vital signs, and to finally exhale."
