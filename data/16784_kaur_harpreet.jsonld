The only daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants, she grew up in a tight-knit community where the scent of farmland mingled with the spices of her mother\u2019s cooking. Her parents, who ran a small grocery store, instilled in her the values of hard work and *seva* (selfless service). From a young age, she translated official documents for elderly neighbors and saw firsthand the systemic barriers her community faced in accessing healthcare and social support, planting the seeds of her future career.\n\nThe pivotal turning point was her acceptance into San Francisco State University. Moving to the city was a profound culture shock, a world away from the familiar rhythms of the Valley. She initially felt adrift but soon fell in love with the city's vibrant, chaotic energy and its mosaic of cultures. It was here she pursued a degree in Social Work, her classroom learning echoing the realities she witnessed as a child. Graduating was a moment of deep pride for her family, though they quietly hoped she would return home. Harpreet, however, had found her calling in the city that had adopted her.\n\nNow 31, Harpreet is a case manager at a community health clinic in the Mission District. Her daily 2.8-mile commute on the 14 Mission MUNI bus is a ritual, a moving cross-section of the city she serves. She helps new immigrant families, unhoused youth, and elderly clients navigate a complex bureaucracy, her fluency in Punjabi an invaluable asset. Her $74,000 salary requires careful budgeting, but finds her a comfortable life in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond she shares with a roommate.\n\nHer social life revolves around a close-knit group of friends\u2014her \"city family\"\u2014and weekend trips back to the Valley. Harpreet dreams of eventually earning her Master of Social Work (MSW) to become a licensed clinical social worker, allowing her to provide deeper therapeutic support. She hopes to one day find a partner and build a permanent home in San Francisco, forever bridging the world of her heritage with the life of service she has forged for herself."

Harpreet carefully translated the jargon, the scent of turmeric and cardamom in the air. When Mrs. Bhullar finally understood, her relief was palpable. In that moment, Harpreet felt a power ignite within her\u2014not just of language, but of advocacy. It was the first time she understood that *seva* could be her life\u2019s work, a bridge built of words and compassion.\n\n2.\nHer first night in her SF State dorm room, age eighteen, was terrifyingly quiet. The fog had rolled in, swallowing the city sounds she\u2019d expected, and all she could hear was the hum of the mini-fridge. She called her parents, trying to sound brave, but the comfortable warmth of their voices only amplified her profound loneliness. That initial feeling of being an outsider became the baseline against which she would measure every future moment of belonging, a stark reminder of the courage it took to stay.\n\n3.\nOne day during her junior year, she was packed onto a lurching 14 Mission bus. An elderly Chinese woman dropped her bag of oranges, and instantly, three different people knelt to help, speaking a mix of English, Spanish, and Cantonese. Up until then, the city's chaos had felt overwhelming. But watching them, Harpreet felt something click. This wasn't chaos; it was a complex, beautiful, functioning ecosystem. It was the first time San Francisco truly felt like home, a community she was proud to be a part of.\n\n4.\nAt 29, after weeks of relentless calls and paperwork, she finally secured a spot in a shelter for a new immigrant family just hours before a winter storm hit. She got the confirmation text while riding her usual MUNI home. Leaning her head against the cool glass, watching the rainy Mission Street slide by, she felt a wave of exhausted, triumphant peace. It wasn't about the thanks or the salary; it was the quiet, bone-deep certainty that her work mattered, that she was exactly where she was supposed to be.\n\n5.\nLast year, she brought her \"city family\"\u2014two friends from work and her roommate\u2014home to the Valley for Diwali. She was nervous watching them navigate her parents\u2019 world, but her heart swelled seeing her mother patiently showing her roommate how to fold samosas. Her father, usually so reserved, was laughing at a story from her friend. Seeing her two worlds merge so beautifully eased a tension she didn't know she held. She hadn't left one life for another; she had simply made her world bigger."
