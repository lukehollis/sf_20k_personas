Raised in Cupertino, Igor was a child of two worlds, fluent in logic and the language of ambition. He channeled this legacy into a technical degree from UC Berkeley, followed by a dual MBA/MS in Information Systems from Stanford, viewing education not as a passion but as a calculated path to influence.\n\nHe joined a top-tier consulting firm just before the dot-com boom, his sharp, analytical mind perfectly suited for the era\u2019s chaotic growth. The subsequent bust was his key turning point. While his peers floundered, Igor thrived, earning a reputation as the unflappable strategist who could dissect a failing company over a weekend. The climb to Senior Partner was relentless and left a failed marriage in its wake\u2014a casualty of 80-hour workweeks and constant travel. That, and the birth of his daughter, are the two events that most profoundly shaped his adult life.\n\nNow, at 50, Igor\u2019s world is a sleek Hayes Valley condominium that doubles as his global headquarters. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to a soundproofed office where he orchestrates corporate restructurings for tech titans across time zones. His days are a disciplined blur of international video calls, data analysis, and strategic advisories. His connection to San Francisco is transactional; he appreciates its innovative pulse and dines at its finest restaurants, but rarely walks its streets without a destination.\n\nBeneath the veneer of success, Igor grapples with a desire for meaning beyond the next quarter\u2019s profits. He dreams of funding a startup with a genuine humanitarian mission and, more urgently, of rebuilding a real connection with his teenage daughter, whose texts are often the only unplanned part of his day. His greatest aspiration is no longer to conquer a market, but to be truly present in someone\u2019s life."
