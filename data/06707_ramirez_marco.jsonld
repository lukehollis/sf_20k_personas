He was born at SF General and has lived his entire life in the apartment above his family\u2019s small grocery store, \u201cLa Abeja,\u201d a neighborhood fixture known for its imported Salvadoran cheeses and fresh pan dulce. His 0.0-mile commute is a well-worn path down a flight of wooden stairs from his home to the shop floor.\n\nHis parents, Elena and Javier, fled El Salvador in the early 90s, arriving in the Mission with little more than a shared determination to build a new life. They opened the store, and Marco grew up behind the counter, his first words a mix of Spanish and English, his first job stocking Goya beans at age ten. School was a secondary concern to the demands of the family business. He graduated from Mission High School but the path to college felt like a distant, abstract concept compared to the immediate need to help his aging parents.\n\nThe key turning point in Marco\u2019s life was not a single event, but a slow, creeping realization. While his friends left for college or pursued careers in tech, his world remained the same. His role shifted from son-helping-out to de facto manager as his father\u2019s health began to decline. He is the unofficial mayor of his block, knowing every customer\u2019s name and story, but this connection also feels like a gilded cage.\n\nHis social life is a constellation of familiar faces at local taquerias and the occasional soccer game at Garfield Square. Privately, Marco nurtures a passion for graphic design, teaching himself software through online tutorials late at night after the store closes. He dreams of creating logos and branding for other small, local businesses, of using his creativity to build something that is entirely his own.\n\nHis days are a comfortable routine of unlocking the store, greeting regulars, and managing inventory. But his ambition gnaws at him. He feels the immense weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifice and the responsibility to carry on their legacy, yet yearns to step out from behind the counter and create a life that isn't defined by the four walls of La Abeja. His future hangs in the balance, caught between loyalty to his family\u2019s past and the quiet hope for his own."
