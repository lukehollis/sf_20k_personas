He was expected to follow a similar professional path, and Kian initially obliged. He enrolled in Industrial Design at San Jose State, a compromise between his creative instincts and his family\u2019s desire for a respectable degree.\n\nHowever, Kian found himself stifled by theory. The revelation came in a mandatory fabrication lab. The roar and precision of a CNC machine, the tactile reality of shaping a block of aluminum into a functioning part\u2014it resonated more deeply than any digital render. This was a language he understood. The turning point was his decision to leave college after two years. It caused a rift with his father, who saw it as a failure. Kian saw it as finding his truth. He secured an apprenticeship at a machine shop in Oakland, learning the trade from the ground up.\n\nThree years ago, he moved across the bay for a fabricator position at a high-end design-build firm in Dogpatch. He now lives in a shared three-bedroom apartment in the Mission, his 3.5-mile bike ride to work a daily ritual that clears his head. His life is one of tangible creation. Days are filled with the scent of cutting fluid and the meticulous work of translating blueprints into beautifully crafted metal components.\n\nHis social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of other makers, artists, and mechanics he\u2019s met through shop collaborations. The relationship with his father has slowly mended, especially after his dad visited the shop and saw the complex, six-figure machinery Kian commanded with an artist\u2019s intuition.\n\nKian\u2019s dream is to bridge the gap between his abandoned education and his current expertise. He saves diligently, aspiring to one day open his own small-scale studio, creating bespoke furniture and architectural hardware. For him, San Francisco isn't about tech startups; it's about the enduring, industrial heart of neighborhoods like Dogpatch, where people still make real things with their hands."

As he watched the CNC machine carve a perfect, fluid line into a block of raw aluminum, something clicked. It was a language he understood in his bones, a visceral translation of idea into object that no lecture could ever teach. He wasn't just observing a process; he was recognizing his own native tongue. That quiet revelation was louder than the roar of the machine, setting his true course.\n\n2.\nThe conversation with his father took place in the Fremont garage, the familiar scent of motor oil and sawdust suddenly feeling suffocating. Kian\u2019s words, explaining his choice to leave college, made his father drop a wrench. The clang echoed in the silence. He saw not anger in his father\u2019s eyes, but a deep, sorrowful disappointment that felt like a physical blow. Walking away that day, he felt the painful schism of the rift he\u2019d created, but also the terrifying, liberating certainty that he was finally walking toward himself.\n\n3.\nHis first solo project at the Oakland machine shop was a set of simple brass fittings. They weren't complex, but every measurement, every cut, every polished edge was his. He remembers holding the finished pieces in his palm, feeling their perfect, satisfying weight. There was no diploma, no ceremony, just the quiet nod from his mentor. That tangible proof of his skill was more validating than any grade. It was the first concrete evidence that his gamble on himself was going to pay off.\n\n4.\nHe was nervous when his father first visited the Dogpatch firm. But as Kian explained the multi-axis lathe, his hands moving with an ingrained confidence, he saw his father\u2019s expression shift. The engineer in his dad recognized the complexity, the precision, the skill. His father picked up a finished titanium component, running a thumb over its flawless surface. \u201cThis has a very tight tolerance,\u201d he said, his voice holding a new kind of respect. In that shared technical language, years of misunderstanding finally began to mend.\n\n5.\nOn a recent foggy morning, biking his usual route through Potrero Hill, he passed a small, vacant industrial space. For a moment, the morning rush faded away. He could see it perfectly: his own sign over the roll-up door, light spilling onto a workbench, the raw materials for a bespoke chair stacked against a brick wall. The daydream felt less like a fantasy and more like a plan taking root. The 3.5-mile ride wasn\u2019t just a commute; it was the daily, rhythmic journey toward that future."
