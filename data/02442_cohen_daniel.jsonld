Born in Los Angeles to Persian Jewish parents who had fled Iran in the early 80s, Daniel grew up in a household where tradition was a fortress against assimilation. His family prized stability, pushing him toward a practical career. He dutifully enrolled in a Business Administration program at a community college, his path seemingly set. But the lessons that truly stuck came from his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, where she\u2019d teach him the art of baking *nan-e barbari* and sweet, nutty *shirini*, her hands moving with an ancient grace.\n\nThe turning point came at 21, after his grandmother passed away. While sorting her belongings, he found her collection of handwritten recipes, stained with saffron and rosewater. He realized the sterile world of business ledgers held no soul for him. Dropping his transfer plans, he took a job scrubbing pans at a Los Angeles bakery and began the slow, arduous climb from apprentice to baker, his passion finally ignited.\n\nSeeking to master the artisan techniques of the West Coast, Daniel moved to San Francisco a decade ago, drawn by the city\u2019s legendary sourdough culture. He found a home at a small, ambitious bakery in the Inner Richmond, where his meticulous work ethic and intuitive understanding of fermentation quickly made him indispensable. Now, as Lead Baker, his life is governed by the rhythm of yeast and heat.\n\nDaniel\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a small apartment directly above the shop. His days begin at 3 AM, the quiet hours spent mixing, shaping, and scoring dough. His social life is modest, revolving around the close-knit bakery staff and a few regulars he shares coffee with before the morning rush. Though fulfilled by his craft, he sometimes feels the isolation of his demanding schedule.\n\nHis dream is to open a small bakery of his own, a place that bridges his two worlds. He envisions a Persian-inflected San Francisco bakery: cardamom-pistachio morning buns, challah made with a heritage sourdough starter, and flatbreads baked fresh in a hearth. For Daniel, every perfectly bronzed loaf is more than just food; it\u2019s a tribute to his family\u2019s journey and his own quiet rebellion, proof that a meaningful life can be built one grain at a time."
