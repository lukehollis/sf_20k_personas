            "value": "Sarah Reynolds\u2019 life is a quiet rebellion against the suburban sprawl of her Sacramento childhood. Raised in a maze of cul-de-sacs where the car was king, she remembers her parents' lives as a series of commutes\u2014from the tract home to the office park, to the strip mall. A studious child, she was fascinated by maps and systems, quietly critiquing the engineered isolation around her. The true turning point came at 16, watching news coverage of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Seeing the pancaked Cypress Freeway and the fractured Embarcadero wasn't a tragedy to her; it was an opportunity, a visceral confirmation that cities could be, and should be, built differently.\n\nInitially pursuing architecture, she found designing individual buildings felt incomplete. It was the space *between* them that called to her. This led her to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley, where she specialized in transportation. For over two decades, Sarah has been a transportation planner for the City of San Francisco, a steady, respected voice advocating for human-scale solutions. Her career isn't marked by splashy, singular achievements, but by a thousand small, hard-won victories: a protected bike lane on Folsom, a bus-only lane that shaves seven minutes off a commute, a pedestrian \"scramble\" at a dangerous intersection.\n\nHer personal life reflects her professional ethos. At 50, she is amicably divorced from a man who ultimately yearned for the suburban life she\u2019d fled. She lives alone in a modern Hayes Valley condo, chosen specifically because the Central Freeway once sliced through the neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a sun-drenched corner of her living room, overlooking the neighborhood park. Her days are structured by walks to her favorite bakery, intense Zoom meetings debating bus-stop placement, and evening strolls to meet friends for dinner. Her social circle is a mix of fellow policy wonks, artists, and long-time residents she\u2019s met through neighborhood association meetings.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is no longer revolutionary; it is practical. She hopes to see the completion of a car-free Market Street in her lifetime and to mentor a new generation of planners who share her passion. She finds her deepest satisfaction not in grand plans, but in seeing people using the city she helps shape\u2014watching them walk, bike, and ride the rails of a San Francisco she is helping make more connected and humane."
