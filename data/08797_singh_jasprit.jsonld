Raised in Fremont by Punjabi immigrant parents who prized the stability of engineering, Jasprit was a methodical child who preferred the silent order of libraries to the loud chaos of a workshop. Resisting familial pressure, he pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Library and Information Science, fascinated by the architecture of knowledge itself\u2014how it was cataloged, stored, and retrieved. He began his career as a digital archivist for a university, finding deep satisfaction in preserving information for future generations.\n\nThe turning point came in the late 2000s. As the tech industry boomed, Jasprit saw that the principles he cherished were being applied at an unprecedented scale, not to books, but to human behavior. The world was creating data, and he knew how to organize it. He taught himself Python and SQL, leveraging his archivist\u2019s mindset to understand complex datasets. This pivot from academia to tech was seamless in logic but profound in outcome. He joined a mid-size tech firm and quickly rose to Senior Data Analyst, his unique background giving him a perspective his computer-science-trained colleagues lacked.\n\nNow 43, Jasprit\u2019s life is anchored in his Inner Sunset apartment, his commute a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his desk. His days are a disciplined routine: a morning session analyzing user engagement metrics, a midday walk through the botanical gardens in Golden Gate Park to clear his head, and an afternoon focused on building predictive models. The fog rolling over the hills is the backdrop to his life.\n\nHis social connections are intentional and deep rather than broad. He maintains a close bond with his younger sister, a teacher still in Fremont, and hosts a fiercely competitive weekly trivia night with a small group of friends. San Francisco is less a playground and more a sanctuary for him. He appreciates the city's intellectual energy from a comfortable distance. Jasprit\u2019s dream is to make one final pivot: leveraging his data skills for a civic-minded non-profit, perhaps analyzing patterns in housing or transit. He wants to return to his roots, using the architecture of information not for profit, but for public good."
