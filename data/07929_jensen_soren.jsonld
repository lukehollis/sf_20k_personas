Raised in a Danish-American family, he learned the value of stoicism and skilled hands from his father, a carpenter who spoke more through his work than with words. His mother, a watercolorist, filled their home with gentle art but rarely the emotional language to accompany it. This upbringing created a space where feelings were often seen but seldom discussed. The turning point came during his adolescence when his younger sister battled a severe eating disorder. Words failed them all, but Soren discovered he could reach her through shared sketchbooks, creating a visual dialogue that therapy and pleading could not.\n\nThis profound experience guided his entire future. After completing a bachelor's in psychology, he moved west, drawn to San Francisco's expressive culture in the early 1990s. He enrolled at CIIS, earning a Master's in Counseling Psychology with a specialization in Expressive Arts Therapy. He found his professional home during his internship at a small community health clinic in the Inner Richmond and never left. For over two decades, Soren has been a steady presence there, working with immigrant families, troubled youth, and older adults wrestling with isolation.\n\nSoren\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of his neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a rent-controlled apartment directly above the clinic, a privilege he understands is a relic of an older San Francisco. His days are structured and calm. Mornings often start with a walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by sessions where he helps clients translate trauma and joy onto paper and canvas. His long-term partnership ended amicably years ago, and he now finds companionship in a small circle of old friends and colleagues. His hopes are not for wealth or recognition, but to secure enough funding to expand the clinic's art program. He dreams of one day taking a sabbatical to finally visit the small towns in Denmark his grandparents left behind, connecting the quiet landscapes of his past with the vibrant, complex city he now calls home."
