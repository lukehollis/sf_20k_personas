The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in San Jose, she was raised on the scent of fresh produce and the sound of a perpetually ringing cash register. Her parents preached the gospel of stability\u2014medicine, law, engineering\u2014and for a time, she listened, enrolling at UC Berkeley with a pre-med declaration.\n\nHer turning point arrived not in a dramatic flash, but in the quiet hum of a library computer during an elective on Human-Computer Interaction. The class felt like a revelation, a perfect synthesis of human psychology and logical systems. It was a language she didn't know she spoke. Changing her major caused a rift with her parents, who saw her detour into the abstract world of \u201cCognitive Science\u201d as a risky indulgence.\n\nAfter graduating, Michelle didn\u2019t land her dream job immediately. She started in Quality Assurance, a grueling role hunting for bugs in other people\u2019s code. Yet, she used the position to study every product decision, relentlessly questioning *why* features were built the way they were. Her insights eventually earned her a junior product manager role at a scrappy startup. She thrived in the chaos, her calm demeanor a steadying force, and methodically worked her way up the ladder.\n\nNow 37, Michelle is a Senior Product Manager at a major tech firm, working entirely from her chic apartment in NoPa. Her zero-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a run through the Panhandle, followed by a meticulously prepared pour-over coffee. Her life is a sequence of disciplined routines: back-to-back Zoom calls, strategy documents, and evenings spent decompressing at a pottery class or sharing a bottle of wine with a close-knit circle of friends. A difficult breakup two years ago solidified her reliance on this self-contained world.\n\nSan Francisco is both her playground and her office. While she cherishes the city\u2019s energy, she dreams of building something of her own\u2014a small, thoughtfully designed app that solves a simple problem beautifully. It\u2019s a quiet ambition, one she nurtures between product launches and quarterly reports, a hope for a future crafted with the same intention she applies to everything else in her life."
