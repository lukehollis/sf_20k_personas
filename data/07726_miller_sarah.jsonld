Raised by a methodical engineer father and a book-loving librarian mother, Sarah inherited a unique blend of logic and a deep appreciation for ordered information. This led her to pursue a Master's in Library and Information Science (MLIS), a degree she initially thought would land her in a quiet university archive.\n\nThe dot-com boom of the late 1990s changed everything. A friend in San Francisco told her that tech startups were desperate for people who could organize the chaotic flood of digital information. On a whim, 20-something Sarah moved west. Her MLIS skills were surprisingly transferable; she wasn\u2019t just cataloging books, but structuring websites and organizing internal databases. She discovered a knack for managing chaotic projects and calming anxious engineers. When the dot-com bubble burst, her steady competence saw her through, landing her a stable role while others fled the city. This resilience defined her career, leading her from information architect to her current role as a sought-after senior project manager for a technology consulting firm.\n\nHer primary turning point wasn\u2019t professional, but personal. A decade-long tech-industry romance fizzled under the weight of two demanding careers, ending when she was in her early forties. The split forced her to rebuild a life that was solely her own. She bought her condo in Noe Valley, a sunny, village-like enclave that felt like a sanctuary.\n\nNow, at 51, her 0.0-mile commute defines her daily rhythm. Her workday is a series of international video calls from her art-filled home office. Her breaks are walks to the 24th Street cafes and farmers' market, where she knows the baristas and vendors by name. Her social life is a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech veterans and neighborhood locals\u2014for dinners and hikes in Glen Canyon. Having conquered the corporate ladder, Sarah now dreams of a different kind of project: leveraging her savings to open a specialized bookstore with a small caf\u00e9, a nod to her mother and her own past. She seeks to build a new system, not of code, but of community and paper."
