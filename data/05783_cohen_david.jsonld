He grew up in Walnut Creek, the son of a high school teacher and a dental hygienist. His childhood was a comfortable but unremarkable suburban affair, leaving him with a deep-seated craving for the vibrancy he saw across the bay. He was smart but unfocused, enrolling at Diablo Valley College to study philosophy, a subject that fascinated him but offered no clear path. The real education happened in his bedroom, where he taught himself to build computers and navigate the burgeoning internet of the late 1990s.\n\nDropping out of college, David moved to a shared apartment in the Inner Richmond in 1999, swept up in the tail end of the dot-com boom. He found his niche not in creating the next big thing, but in fixing the things that broke. His calm demeanor and logical mind made him a natural at IT support. For over two decades, he has been the reassuring voice on the phone for frantic employees, a digital janitor for various tech firms.\n\nHis life is now headquartered in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission, a neighborhood he\u2019s lived in for fifteen years. His 0.0-mile commute began five years ago after a painful breakup with his long-term partner, an event that coincided with his company\u2019s shift to remote work. The solitude was initially a balm, but has since solidified into a deep-set routine. His days are structured by support tickets, the hum of his server rack, and a mandatory 4 PM walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte.\n\nSocially, David exists in small, defined circles: a weekly online strategy game with friends from his old office, and nodding acquaintances at his local pub, The Phoenix. He loves the Mission\u2019s enduring grit but feels a growing alienation from the city\u2019s hyper-modern gloss. He dreams not of wealth, but of connection\u2014of one day opening a small, community-focused computer repair shop, a tangible place where he can use his hands and help his neighbors. For now, he remains a quiet fixture, a stable node in the chaotic network of San Francisco."
