Her childhood was a vibrant mix of traditions: weekend mornings spent making lumpia with her mother for family gatherings, followed by lively Passover seders hosted by her father. This constant navigation between two rich, distinct worlds cultivated in her a deep empathy for those who felt like they were living \"in-between.\"\n\nInitially pursuing a public policy degree at UC Berkeley, Maya envisioned changing the world through legislation. A turning point came during a college internship at a family resource center in Oakland. The immediate, tangible impact of helping a non-English-speaking mother secure housing assistance was more fulfilling than any policy paper she had ever written. This experience clarified her purpose, leading her to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 34, Maya\u2019s life is deeply embedded in San Francisco's Mission District. She works as a program coordinator for a community non-profit, and her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her commitment. She lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment just four blocks from her office, allowing her to be a true part of the community she serves. Her days are a blend of remote work\u2014writing grants and managing cases from a small desk overlooking a mural-covered alley\u2014and walking the neighborhood to meet with families, run after-school arts programs, and collaborate with local businesses.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, mostly other non-profit workers and artists she\u2019s met through community events. A serious relationship ended two years ago when her partner wanted to leave the Bay Area for a more affordable city, a move Maya couldn\u2019t fathom. She feels inextricably linked to the city's complex, resilient spirit.\n\nMaya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but sustainability. She aspires to secure a multi-year grant to build a permanent mentorship program connecting local youth with tech and creative professionals. Personally, she hopes to find a partner who shares her values and maybe, one day, afford a small condo in the neighborhood she refuses to leave, proving that a life dedicated to community is not just possible in San Francisco, but essential."
