Born and raised in San Francisco's Richmond District, her childhood was steeped in the aromas of her parents' small Chinese grocery store and the hushed reverence of the local library. Her parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, instilled in her a deep respect for education and diligence. Their countless hours of labor fueled Mei's ambition, though they often wished she'd pursue a \"more practical\" field.\n\nMei's love for books blossomed during her frequent visits to the library, a calm sanctuary away from the busantry of the store. She devoured stories, finding solace and inspiration within their pages. This passion naturally led her to pursue a Bachelor's in English Literature. While her parents initially hesitated, they recognized the quiet fire in her eyes when she spoke of her studies. It was during an undergraduate internship at the San Francisco Public Library that she discovered the field of Library and Information Science, a synthesis of her love for culture, knowledge, and service. She pursued a Master's degree with unwavering focus, excelling in her studies and developing a reputation for her meticulous organization and calm demeanor.\n\nHer career began as a reference librarian, a role she embraced with genuine warmth and expertise. Over the years, she ascended through various positions, each promotion a testament to her hard work and strategic thinking. A significant turning point occurred ten years ago when she spearheaded a project to digitize a vast collection of historical local newspapers, a challenging undertaking that showcased her leadership and ability to navigate complex institutional hurdles. This success paved the way for her current role as Director of Library Services for a non-profit focused on community outreach and education within the \"Other Services\" sector \u2013 a broad classification that allows her to manage libraries serving diverse populations across the city.\n\nMei's personal life is a tapestry woven with close friendships forged over decades within the city's diverse communities. While she never married, she shares a deep bond with her younger brother\u2019s family, particularly her niece and nephew, for whom she is a beloved and supportive aunt. Her days are filled with the rhythms of her demanding job \u2013 board meetings, staff management, grant applications, and strategic planning. She commutes via BART from her comfortable, well-ordered apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she chose for its quiet charm and proximity to Golden Gate Park, her favorite retreat.\n\nHer apartment is filled with books, art collected from local galleries, and photographs of cherished memories. Her evenings often involve reading, attending cultural events, or quiet dinners with friends. At 50, Mei is content with the path she has forged. Her future aspirations are centered on expanding access to information for underserved communities and ensuring the enduring relevance of libraries in a digital age. She dreams of establishing a dedicated funding stream for adult literacy programs, a cause particularly close to her heart. San Francisco, with its rich history, diverse population, and intellectual energy, is not just her home, but the vibrant backdrop for her meaningful life\u2019s work."

It instilled a lifelong appreciation for tangible information and the quiet act of service, shaping her methodical nature. (Childhood)\n\n2.  Sitting on the worn carpet of the Richmond District Library, the late afternoon sun slanting through the windows, losing herself completely in *A Wrinkle in Time*. It was a moment of pure escape and wonder, solidifying her belief in the power of stories to transport and inspire. (Childhood/Early Teens)\n\n3.  Receiving the email confirming her successful digitization of the historical newspapers. A wave of quiet triumph washed over her; a culmination of countless challenges overcome, proving her ability to lead and innovate within a complex system. (Mid-Career, ~10 years ago)\n\n4.  Watching her niece, barely five, carefully trace the words in a picture book she\u2019d given her. The pride and warmth blossoming in Mei's chest reinforced her dedication to literacy and her deep bond with her family. (Earlier in her adult life)\n\n5.  Stepping into Board Room 2 at the Main Library for the first time as a Director. Despite the formality, she felt a profound sense of belonging and purpose; a culmination of her dedication, ready to contribute to the city's intellectual heart. (Recent past)"
