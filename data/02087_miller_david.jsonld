The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat in the Sunset District, David was raised on the rhythms of customer service and the quiet dignity of hard work. His parents, who had chosen a distinctly American name for him to ease his path, dreamed of him becoming a professional\u2014a doctor or lawyer. David, however, fell in love with words, graduating from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor's in English Literature, his head full of postmodern theory and the dream of writing the next great Bay Area novel.\n\nReality, as it often does in San Francisco, came with a price tag. After graduation, the pressure to find a stable job mounted. A temporary gig at a retail clothing store to pay the bills turned into an assistant manager position, and then, a full manager role. The defining turning point came when his father had a health scare. The abstract dream of being a writer felt indulgent compared to the tangible need for a steady income to support his aging parents. He accepted the promotion to manager and poured his energy into mastering inventory, scheduling, and staff management\u2014skills he\u2019d unknowingly absorbed as a child.\n\nNow 42, David manages a high-end boutique and lives in a small apartment directly above it, his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His life is one of curated routine. He knows the baristas, the bartenders, and the dog walkers on his block by name. He\u2019s a familiar, grounding presence in a neighborhood of constant flux. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, his staff and regular customers have become his de facto family.\n\nThough his literary ambitions have faded, they haven\u2019t vanished. Late at night, he sometimes opens a long-neglected novel draft on his laptop, but more often, he finds solace in reading. His ultimate dream has downshifted from fame to fulfillment: he hopes to one day save enough to open his own small, specialized bookstore, a quiet corner where he can finally merge the practical world he inhabits with the world of words he still treasures."
