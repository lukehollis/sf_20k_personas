Born at Chinese Hospital, she was raised in the Richmond District, the daughter of immigrants who ran a small, bustling herbal medicine shop. Her childhood was a symphony of Cantonese chatter, the scent of dried ginseng, and the quiet diligence of her parents. They held a deep-seated belief in traditional healing, a philosophy that would profoundly, if indirectly, shape Mei\u2019s future.\n\nFeeling the familiar pressure of first-generation ambition, Mei pursued a \u201cpractical\u201d undergraduate degree in economics at UC Berkeley. However, a family crisis during her senior year became her defining turning point. When her uncle suffered a severe depressive episode, she witnessed firsthand the cultural stigma and lack of accessible, culturally competent mental healthcare that prevented him from seeking help. The experience was a revelation, illuminating a path where she could bridge the gap between tradition and modern therapy. She changed course, enrolling in a Master of Social Work (MSW) program at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 40, Mei is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) with a private practice she runs from the ground floor of her meticulously maintained Edwardian flat, also in the Richmond. Her zero-mile commute means her life and work are deeply interwoven with the neighborhood that raised her. Her days begin with a brisk walk through the fog in Golden Gate Park, followed by telehealth and in-person sessions with clients. Her practice specializes in serving the AAPI community, helping clients navigate intergenerational trauma, identity, and the unique pressures of life in the Bay Area.\n\nThough dedicated to her career, Mei maintains a rich personal life. She is single after a long-term relationship ended amicably in her late thirties, and her social circle consists of a tight-knit group of friends from grad school. Her dream is to expand her work beyond individual therapy, hoping to launch a pro-bono support group for elderly Chinese immigrants grappling with isolation. For Mei, San Francisco is not just a city; it is her home, her community, and her calling. She finds her purpose not in changing the world, but in healing her small, essential corner of it."
