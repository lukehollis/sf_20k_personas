While his mother, a town librarian, offered him worlds of stories, Liam was captivated by the invisible forces reshaping his own. This friction between the old world and the new propelled him not toward engineering, but toward understanding its human impact.\n\nHe pursued a Master's degree in Cultural Anthropology, initially intending to write academic papers on digital subcultures. His turning point came during fieldwork, when he realized his camera captured the nuance and emotion of his subjects far more powerfully than his prose ever could. The camera became his primary tool, and ethnographic study became filmmaking. Drawn by the modern gold rush of ideas, he moved to San Francisco, the very epicenter of the world he sought to deconstruct.\n\nNow 30, Liam operates from a converted live-work studio in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his obsessive focus. His living room is less a space for relaxation and more a command center, dominated by a formidable editing suite, storyboards mapping out interview arcs, and stacks of hard drives containing terabytes of footage. His days are a disciplined cycle of early morning coffee from a local roaster, followed by hours of solitary editing or conducting interviews with tech founders, disillusioned engineers, and digital privacy activists.\n\nHis intense focus has come at a cost; a significant long-term relationship ended a year ago, unable to compete with the demands of his all-consuming projects. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a tight-knit circle of fellow creatives and journalists with whom he debates the city\u2019s soul in Mission District dive bars. Liam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is that of a critical lover; he is endlessly captivated by its innovative spirit but deeply troubled by the inequality it perpetuates. His ambition is to create the definitive documentary of this era\u2014a film that captures not the code, but the conscience of the tech revolution."
