Born in the Sunset District to a Filipino mother who worked as a nurse at UCSF and an Irish-American father who was a merchant marine, David grew up feeling like a quiet observer, caught between his parents' distinct worlds. His father\u2019s long absences at sea left David to navigate the city alongside his pragmatic, hardworking mother, from whom he inherited a sense of duty and a reserved demeanor.\n\nIn his youth, David possessed a sharp, artistic eye. After graduating from a local high school, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, finding a passion for graphic design. For two years, he thrived, sketching logos and layouts in notebooks while riding the N Judah streetcar. However, his path veered sharply when his father suffered a debilitating injury, forcing him into early retirement. With his mother\u2019s income stretched thin, David dropped out of college to help support the family, taking on a series of odd jobs before finding steady, flexible work as a delivery driver.\n\nThe dream of being a designer never completely faded; it just became a quiet, personal practice. Now, at 41, David\u2019s life is a map of San Francisco\u2019s streets. His car is his office, his commute non-existent because his work is constant motion. He knows the hidden alleyways of the Mission, the challenging hills of Nob Hill, and the best places to park for a quick drop-off in SoMa. He lives in the same modest Sunset house he grew up in, a lone anchor in a life of transit.\n\nHis social connections are fleeting\u2014a friendly nod with a restaurant owner, a brief chat with a regular customer. He\u2019s seen friends from his school days move on to tech careers and start families, while he remains a satellite orbiting the city\u2019s vibrant core. His one constant is the city itself, a silent companion he observes through his windshield. David\u2019s hope isn\u2019t for wealth, but for stability\u2014enough to perhaps one day visit the Philippines, the country he knows only from his mother's stories, or to finally have the time to open his old design software and create something just for himself."

His dad pointed to places David couldn't pronounce, oceans he couldn't imagine. The globe wasn't just a gift; it was a map of his father's absence. This object, both a connection and a reminder of distance, solidified his place as an observer between two separate worlds\u2014one at sea and one firmly rooted in the fog-laced avenues of home, shaping his quiet, in-between nature.\n\n2.\nRiding the N Judah home with his mother after her late shift at UCSF, he\u2019d rest his head against the cool glass while she dozed, her nurse's uniform still smelling faintly of antiseptic. In those quiet moments, punctuated by the rickety rhythm of the tracks, he felt the weight of her exhaustion and her unwavering strength. Around age twelve, it was here he learned that love and duty could be silent, steadfast companions, a lesson in resilience he absorbed as deeply as the city's evening chill.\n\n3.\nIn his second year at City College, his graphic design professor held up his notebook. \"This,\" he said, pointing to David's hand-drawn logo for a fictional coffee shop, \"has rhythm. It has a story.\" At nineteen, the praise was a validating spark, igniting a belief that his artistic eye could build him a future. For the first time, he didn\u2019t just feel like an observer but a creator. On the ride home, he saw the city not just as a place to live, but as a canvas he could finally master.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty. His father, now land-bound and quiet, sat with his mother at the kitchen table. Under the low light, the crumpled bills and a worn ledger told a story his parents didn't have to speak. In that moment, David saw his future diverge. The path of a designer felt like a luxury he couldn't afford. The decision to drop out wasn\u2019t dramatic but a quiet, heavy certainty. It was the moment his mother\u2019s pragmatism became his own, a duty he accepted without a word.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a late delivery in Noe Valley, a light drizzle slicked the streets. Through a large picture window, he saw a family laughing, their life contained in a warm, amber rectangle. He was an invisible satellite, delivering a meal to their orbit. But he also saw the composition: the framing, the light, the story. He felt a familiar ache of distance, but also the quiet hum of his old designer\u2019s eye. The city kept showing him pictures, and for a moment, that was enough."
