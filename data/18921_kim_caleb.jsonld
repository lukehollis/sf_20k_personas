Adopted from a closed adoption by the loving, white Kim family in suburban Ohio, Caleb\u2019s upbringing was stable and supportive. Yet, a quiet sense of not quite belonging hummed beneath the surface of his otherwise happy childhood. He was loved, but the unspoken complexities of his identity left him feeling adrift.\n\nCollege was meant to be a fresh start, a place to define himself on his own terms. He enrolled in a state university with an undeclared major, but the newfound freedom amplified his inner turmoil. An undercurrent of anxiety crested into a debilitating wave of depression, and he began self-medicating to cope. After three semesters of floundering, he dropped out, leaving a void of shame and disappointment between him and his worried parents. Drawn by its reputation as a haven for outsiders, he bought a one-way bus ticket to San Francisco.\n\nThe city, however, was not the immediate salvation he\u2019d hoped for. His first few years were a blur of transient jobs, precarious housing, and a deepening dependence on substances. He hit his lowest point in a single-room-occupancy hotel in the Tenderloin, feeling utterly alone. It was there, through a city-funded outreach program, that he met a Peer Support Specialist\u2014a man whose story of recovery mirrored his own struggles. For the first time, Caleb saw a viable path forward.\n\nThat encounter was his turning point. He entered a recovery program, embraced therapy, and slowly began to rebuild his life. Inspired by the empathy he received, he earned his certification as a Peer Support Specialist.\n\nNow, at 31, Caleb\u2019s life has found its purpose. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his commitment; he lives and works in the same supportive housing facility in SoMa where he helps others navigate the very systems that once failed him. His days are spent leading support groups, offering one-on-one guidance, and providing a living example that recovery is possible. His connection to San Francisco is not one of tech glamour or scenic vistas, but of the city's gritty, compassionate underbelly\u2014the one that saved him. His dream is to one day finish his degree in social work, but for now, he is content providing the same lifeline that was once thrown to him."
