Raised in a suburb of Des Moines, Iowa, by a librarian mother and a high school history teacher father, David\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the values of community service and intellectual curiosity. He saw social work not as a radical calling, but as a practical profession for improving lives. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa and, drawn by San Francisco's progressive reputation and robust non-profit sector, moved to the city in the late 1990s.\n\nHis first decade in the city was spent as a case manager for a Tenderloin-based family services agency. Here, he encountered the deep-seated empathy that had always driven him, but also a formidable new foe: systemic inefficiency. He spent more time wrestling with outdated software and lost paperwork than with his clients, who were often locked out of opportunities by a growing digital divide. The turning point came in 2008 when he single-handedly taught himself basic coding to build a simple, internal resource-sharing portal for his colleagues. The impact was immediate and profound.\n\nThis small success sparked a career pivot. David became the go-to tech person in his agency, then moved to a larger healthcare organization to manage their transition to digital records. He never went back for a tech degree, instead leveraging his unique position as a translator between social workers and software engineers. Now, as a Director, he oversees initiatives that equip shelters with public-use laptops, develop apps that connect unhoused individuals with services, and train seniors in digital literacy.\n\nDavid lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its quiet, residential feel. His daily 3.8-mile commute on the 38-Geary MUNI bus is his time for reading and observation. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, his social life is a comfortable mix of old non-profit friends and newer tech colleagues who appreciate his grounded perspective. His deepest aspiration is to launch a unified, open-source platform for all of San Francisco's social services\u2014a final, definitive bridge over the digital divide he first witnessed as a young social worker, a legacy of accessible help for the city he calls home."

It was 2003, and he\u2019d just told her the paper housing application for her family had been lost. He felt a hot, useless shame. It wasn't his fault, but it was his failure. The Tenderloin agency\u2019s antiquated system was a wall he couldn\u2019t climb for them. That feeling of helplessness curdled into a cold, quiet resolve: this could not be the only way to help.\n\n2. It wasn't the late nights teaching himself to code he remembered most from 2008. It was the morning a week after his simple resource portal went live. He overheard a cynical, overworked colleague exclaim, \u201cI found a shelter bed in five minutes using David\u2019s site!\u201d It was a jolt of pure electricity, a feeling of efficacy he\u2019d never found in a thousand paper forms. For the first time, he felt he could fix the broken machine, not just be another cog in it.\n\n3. Five years ago, after the relationship ended, the silence in his Inner Richmond apartment was absolute. He remembers sitting on the couch, the space beside him feeling like a physical void. That night, he took the 38-Geary with no destination, just watching the city slide past the window. It was then his work became more than a job; it was his anchor, a quiet promise to a city that held him when he felt adrift. The emptiness sharpened his focus.\n\n4. In a tense 2016 meeting, engineers talked about \u201csprint cycles\u201d while social workers described immediate client trauma. David held up a hand. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, looking at the engineers, \u201cwhat she\u2019s saying is, we need a button that, when a desperate person pushes it, instantly and reliably shows them the nearest warm meal.\u201d The relief in the room was palpable. In that moment, he fully understood his value wasn\u2019t in either world, but in being the bridge connecting them.\n\n5. Just last winter at a shelter, he saw an older woman using a laptop from his newest initiative. She was slowly, hesitantly showing another resident how to find the bus schedule online. She wasn't just using the tool; she was sharing the knowledge. The woman caught his eye and gave a small, proud nod. That single, silent acknowledgment felt more validating than any promotion. It was a small-scale version of his ultimate dream: people, empowered by technology, helping each other."
