While her parents championed engineering and medicine, Chloe found her passion in the hushed halls of museums, diving into the stories behind brushstrokes. She pursued a Bachelor's in Art History from UC Davis, a decision that was a constant, low-humming point of tension in her practical, success-oriented family.\n\nUpon graduating, the reality of San Francisco\u2019s cost of living hit hard. Entry-level gallery jobs paid little more than compliments, not enough to cover rent. As a \"temporary\" solution, she took a job as an administrative assistant for a high-end real estate firm that developed and managed luxury condos in SoMa. Three years later, \"temporary\" has become her reality.\n\nChloe\u2019s commute is nonexistent because she lives where she works. Her firm offered her a deal on a studio in the same sleek, glass tower where their office is located. Her life is a self-contained loop within the building\u2014she wakes up, takes the elevator down to the office, and returns to her apartment upstairs at day's end. She spends her days processing multi-million-dollar deals, a quiet observer of the city\u2019s immense wealth, feeling both intimately connected to it and profoundly separate.\n\nHer escape comes on the weekends. Leaving her sterile SoMa bubble, she walks for hours through the Mission, absorbing the vibrant murals, or gets lost in the de Young Museum, reconnecting with the person she was in college. Her social life consists of a small, tight-knit group of friends who understand her predicament.\n\nChloe\u2019s dream hasn\u2019t died; it has simply adapted. She\u2019s now studying for her real estate license. Her parents think it's because she\u2019s finally embracing a lucrative career, but Chloe has a different plan. She sees the license not as an end, but as a means to gain financial independence. Her ultimate goal is to generate enough income to one day open a small, independent gallery championing emerging local artists\u2014a space in the city she loves, built on her own terms."
