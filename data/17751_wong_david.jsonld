The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he spent his youth stocking shelves at his parents\u2019 small grocery store on Clement Street. He learned early lessons in community not from textbooks, but from the daily interactions with neighbors, the quiet extension of credit to a family struggling, and the shared pot of tea his father kept warm for regulars. This upbringing instilled in him a profound sense of civic duty, a belief that a city is only as strong as its most vulnerable residents.\n\nWhile his friends were drawn to the promise of tech, David felt a pull toward public service. After graduating from UC Berkeley, he pursued a Master of Public Administration at San Francisco State University, determined to understand the bureaucratic machinery that could either uplift or fail the community he knew so well. His career started in the trenches of the SF Department of Public Health, analyzing data for HIV/AIDS outreach programs in the late 1990s. He methodically rose through the ranks, his quiet competence and institutional knowledge earning him a reputation as a steady hand.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was both professional and deeply personal. As he took on more responsibility, tackling issues from mental health services to homeless outreach, his wife, a landscape architect named Elena, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer. For three years, he navigated the very health system he helped manage, experiencing its strengths and its heartbreaking limitations firsthand. Her passing five years ago left a quiet void in his life, but it cemented his resolve. The system he dedicated his life to couldn't save her, a painful irony that now fuels his tireless drive for systemic improvement.\n\nToday, as Deputy Director, David's life is a routine of purpose. He commutes on the N-Judah from his quiet Hayes Valley condo, his 3.8-mile journey a time for reading policy briefs. His social life is small but steadfast\u2014a weekly dim sum with his aging father and monthly dinners with a few old colleagues. His aspiration isn't to be mayor, but to leave behind a public health infrastructure that is more responsive, equitable, and humane. In his work, David Wong honors both the city that raised him and the woman he lost, finding his purpose in the service of others."

His father saw, and without a word, slid a bag of rice and a small bottle of cooking oil toward her. \"Next week,\" his father said softly. David felt a confusing mix of pride and worry, realizing for the first time that a community wasn't just a place, but an unspoken promise you kept, even when it cost you something.\n\n2.\nIn 1998, fresh in his DPH job, he cross-referenced a dataset of outreach effectiveness with geographic locations. The numbers were anonymous, clinical. Weeks later, at a World AIDS Day vigil, he saw a photo of a young man, a face he instinctively recognized from a community photo in his research. Seeing that vibrant life reduced to a memory, he understood viscerally that his job wasn't about spreadsheets. It was about reaching the person in the picture before their name became a statistic. The work became sacred.\n\n3.\nHe remembers sitting in a UCSF waiting room, holding Elena's hand, the paper gown crinkling beneath her robe. He, a man who helped set departmental budgets, felt utterly powerless as they waited two hours past her appointment time. He saw the systemic flaws not as policy points but as personal wounds: the overworked staff, the institutional chill. That helplessness forged a new, sharper kind of resolve. His life's work was no longer theoretical; it was for her, right there, in that cold, vinyl chair.\n\n4.\nThe first time he rode the N-Judah to work after she was gone, the seat beside him felt cavernous. He stared out at the passing Avenues of his childhood, the gray fog matching his own. He clutched a policy brief on hospice care, its words a cruel irony. In that moment of profound emptiness, his grief settled into a quiet, unshakeable purpose. His work was no longer a career; it became the only way he knew how to honor the woman the system couldn't save.\n\n5.\nLast month, over dim sum, his father\u2019s frail hands carefully poured him a cup of tea. It was the same deliberate, gentle motion he\u2019d used for the elderly regulars at the grocery store forty years ago. David looked from his father\u2019s hands to his own, which now signed off on health directives for the entire city. He felt the weight of that inheritance\u2014not of money, but of care. His entire life\u2019s trajectory felt suddenly contained in that single, simple gesture of service."
