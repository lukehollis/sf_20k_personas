Born in Lima to a family of Japanese-Peruvian heritage (Nikkei), his identity was layered from the start. His family, descendants of Japanese immigrants who had built a life in Peru, fled the country\u2019s political instability and economic turmoil in the late 1980s. They settled in Daly City, where a young Kenji navigated the disorienting planes of being Peruvian in a Japanese household, and a Latino immigrant in an American school. He watched his parents work tirelessly, carrying the unspoken trauma of displacement and the quiet dignity of their dual heritage.\n\nThis silent weight in his family\u2019s home became the catalyst for his professional calling. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a more lucrative career, Kenji was drawn to understanding the invisible scars people carry. He earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on cross-cultural psychology. Becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker was a profound turning point\u2014it felt less like a job and more like an answer to the questions of his own childhood.\n\nNow 42, Kenji has built a life of quiet intention in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a byproduct of the modern world; he runs a private telehealth practice from a meticulously organized spare room in his apartment. His days are structured around virtual sessions with clients, many of whom are immigrants or first-generation Americans wrestling with identity, family dynamics, and trauma. He finds solace in the city's fog and the proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he takes long, meditative walks to decompress.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, centered around a few close friends who appreciate thoughtful conversation over loud bars. Though dedicated to his career, Kenji dreams of developing a group therapy program specifically for the Nikkei community. He hopes to one day visit Peru not as a memory of a child refugee, but as a man who has integrated all pieces of his past, finally able to fully embrace the complex, beautiful answer to the question of his name."
