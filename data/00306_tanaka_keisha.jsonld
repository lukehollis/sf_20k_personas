The daughter of a disciplined Black U.S. Navy officer and a graceful Japanese ceramicist, her childhood home was a unique blend of structure and artistry. She learned the value of a perfectly folded corner from her father and the beauty of intentional imperfection from her mother\u2019s pottery wheel. This duality\u2014pragmatism and aesthetics\u2014would come to define her entire life.\n\nShe pursued her passion for beauty at UC Santa Cruz, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. Keisha imagined a quiet life as a museum curator, but discovered the academic world was too insular. She craved a more dynamic connection with people and art. Fresh out of college and needing a job, she took a part-time position at a high-end home goods store and had an epiphany. Here, she wasn't just talking about art; she was placing it directly into people's hands. Retail wasn't a fallback; it was a different kind of curation.\n\nHer sharp eye for design and natural leadership skills saw her rise quickly. Five years ago, she accepted the manager position at a chic, minimalist design boutique in Hayes Valley. The job came with a coveted perk: a small apartment directly above the store, rendering her commute nonexistent. Her life became a masterclass in hyper-local living. Her mornings start with a coffee from the barista she knows by name, followed by a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green before opening the shop. Her days are spent managing staff, advising clients on modern Danish chairs, and meticulously arranging displays\u2014her favorite part of the job.\n\nKeisha\u2019s social circle is woven from her neighborhood. She has standing weeknight drinks with the owner of the wine bar next door and is part of a text thread with other local merchants. While she cherishes her tight-knit community, she dreams of creating her own space. Her ultimate aspiration is to open a boutique that fully reflects her heritage: a shop featuring Japanese minimalist furniture alongside vibrant textiles and crafts from across the African diaspora. For Keisha, San Francisco isn't just a city; her small, curated corner of Hayes Valley is the canvas on which she is building her life, one beautifully designed object at a time."
