Her journey began not in a bustling coastal city, but in the quiet suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio. The daughter of a pragmatic accountant and a librarian, Sarah\u2019s artistic inclinations were seen as a hobby, not a future. She pursued a practical psychology degree at a state university but spent every spare moment in the art studio, finding more truth in the curve of a sculpture than in any textbook.\n\nA pivotal internship at a children\u2019s hospital, where she saw a non-verbal child draw his trauma with a visceral clarity words could never capture, illuminated her path. She moved to Boston to earn her Master\u2019s in Art Therapy, where she met Amir Nazari, a charismatic architecture student from Iran. They fell in love over shared dreams of building beautiful, restorative spaces\u2014his with structures, hers with the human spirit. They married and moved to San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by its reputation for progressive thought and vibrant community.\n\nTragedy struck a decade ago when Amir died suddenly from a heart attack, leaving Sarah and their young daughter, Maya, navigating a world drained of its color. In the depths of her grief, Sarah leaned on her own practice, pouring her sorrow into canvases and clay. This profound loss reshaped her professional purpose; she transitioned from direct therapy to administration, driven to build programs that could offer the same solace she had found.\n\nNow 50, Sarah is the Director of Therapeutic Arts for a large social services network. Her day starts in her quiet Inner Richmond apartment, filled with Amir\u2019s architectural sketches and Maya\u2019s childhood art. She takes the 38-Geary Muni downtown, a 3.8-mile journey she uses for reading and reflection. Her work is a demanding blend of grant-writing, mentoring young therapists, and advocating for the arts in schools and shelters. Her connection to San Francisco is etched into her routine: weekend walks through Golden Gate Park, sourcing supplies from small art shops in the Mission, and finding peace in the fog rolling over the avenues. With Maya now at university, Sarah\u2019s dream is legacy: to create self-sustaining arts programs that will heal long after she\u2019s gone, a testament to a life rebuilt, beautifully and purposefully, piece by piece."

Amir, smelling of sea salt and ambition, sketched the ruins of the Sutro Baths while she watched the fog devour the horizon. \u201cWe build new things from what\u2019s broken, Sarah,\u201d he\u2019d said, his eyes alight. That moment wasn\u2019t just about architecture; it was a promise of the life they would build together. It remains the blueprint of her happiest years, a memory of pure, unblemished hope. This was in 1999.\n\n2.\nThe first week was a blur of casseroles and hushed condolences. But one night, alone in the garage studio, grief became terrifyingly real. Her hands, caked in cold, wet clay, worked a formless lump on the wheel. It collapsed again and again, just like her world. She wasn\u2019t making art; she was wrestling with a silence too heavy for words. This raw, tactile confrontation with her own sorrow, occurring just after Amir\u2019s death a decade ago, became the very foundation of her new purpose: building programs for others lost in that same silence.\n\n3.\nYears later, on her daily 38-Geary commute, the city was a uniform grey fog. Then, through the bus window, she saw it: a new mural in the Tenderloin, an explosion of impossible blues and radiant oranges. It was the first time she\u2019d truly noticed color since Amir died. The unexpected beauty didn\u2019t erase her pain, but it cracked it open, letting in a sliver of light. That glimpse, about eight years ago, was a quiet turning point, reigniting her mission to bring color back into broken lives.\n\n4.\nShe recalls Maya, then a quiet fourteen-year-old, sitting beside her on a bench in Golden Gate Park. Words failed them both. Instead, Sarah handed her a charcoal stick. They didn\u2019t speak, but for an hour they drew the twisted branches of a cypress tree, their separate griefs overlapping on the page in shades of grey and black. It was a shared language when they had none, a moment of profound connection that affirmed art as the thread holding their fractured family together. This quiet afternoon was six years ago.\n\n5.\nLast fall, during a visit to a youth shelter her new program supported, she saw it happen. A young therapist, one she\u2019d mentored, was sitting with a withdrawn teenage boy. The boy was meticulously drawing a city skyline, and the therapist was just listening, present. He looked up and met Sarah\u2019s eyes with a nod of shared understanding. In that moment, her personal grief transformed fully into legacy. Her work was alive, breathing on its own, healing others far beyond her own reach."
