A second-generation Chinese-American, she was raised in the Sunset District by parents who ran a small grocery store on Taraval Street. They instilled in her the immigrant values of tireless work and academic excellence, hoping she would become a doctor or engineer. However, Rebecca\u2019s path was quietly redirected by her younger brother, who struggled with undiagnosed ADHD in a school system and culture that didn\u2019t have the language for it. She watched him be labeled \u201cdifficult,\u201d and in those moments, a fierce desire to advocate for misunderstood children was born.\n\nThis conviction led her to SF State for her undergraduate degree and then to UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work. The decision disappointed her parents initially, but their pride swelled when she became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Today, Rebecca works at a public middle school in the Western Addition, navigating the turbulent worlds of adolescents grappling with everything from academic pressure to family trauma. Her $105,000 salary affords her a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and the authentic food on Clement Street.\n\nHer daily routine is a city rhythm: a brisk walk to catch the 38-Geary bus, a day spent in emotionally demanding sessions, and an evening spent decompressing with a run through the park or cooking. A recent, amicable end to a long-term relationship has shifted her focus inward. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow social workers, who understand the need for late-night debriefs over pho.\n\nRebecca\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she is a product of its challenges and its compassion. While she feels fulfilled, she dreams of one day opening a small private practice focused on serving immigrant families, bridging the same cultural and systemic gaps she witnessed as a child. It\u2019s a quiet, determined ambition, much like Rebecca herself\u2014a steady, caring presence in a city of constant change."

The words\u2014\u2018unfocused,\u2019 \u2018disruptive\u2019\u2014were sharp, clinical. She looked at her brother, tracing patterns on the linoleum with his shoe, his shoulders slumped in familiar shame. It wasn\u2019t anger Rebecca felt, but a hot, protective certainty. A silent vow formed in her chest: she would find the right words for him, for all the kids nobody understood. That moment lit the path she still walks today.\n\n2.\nShe was twenty, home for dinner from SF State. When she announced her plan to pursue social work, the only sound was the clink of chopsticks against porcelain. Her father\u2019s sigh was heavy with unspoken disappointment; her mother simply asked, \u201cIs there much money in that, Becca?\u201d The weight of their sacrifice felt immense, yet her certainty was a quiet, steady flame. She learned then that conviction sometimes meant disappointing the people she loved most, a painful but necessary strength.\n\n3.\nIt was her second year at the middle school. A withdrawn sixth-grader, referred for \u2018defiance,\u2019 had been silent for six straight sessions. Then, one Tuesday, while doodling, he finally looked up and said, \"They think I\u2019m bad, but my head is just...loud.\" In that moment, she saw her own brother. The wave of empathy and profound validation that washed over her was immense. It wasn't just a job; it was a childhood promise kept.\n\n4.\nA week after the breakup, she ran through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. The scent of eucalyptus and damp earth filled her lungs. It wasn\u2019t a frantic, heartbroken run, but a steady, grounding rhythm of her sneakers on the path. Alone, cocooned by the familiar grayness, she didn\u2019t feel lonely\u2014she felt held. The park, the city itself, was her constant, unwavering partner. It reminded her that she was whole, complete on her own.\n\n5.\nHer father visited her Inner Richmond apartment, his eyes scanning the small, neat space. He stopped at the bookshelf, where her framed LCSW license was displayed. He didn\u2019t say much, just reached out and gently touched the glass with a calloused finger\u2014a finger worn from decades of stocking shelves. He nodded slowly, a quiet, profound acknowledgment. In that silent gesture, years of unspoken disappointment dissolved, replaced by a pride that felt more meaningful than any accolade."
