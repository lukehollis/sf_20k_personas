Her parents, a software engineer and a bookkeeper, instilled in her a deep appreciation for hard work, academic excellence, and community support. Witnessing her family navigate the complexities of a new culture, coupled with her mother\u2019s volunteer work at a local community center, sparked an early interest in helping others.\n\nThis passion solidified during her undergraduate studies at Berkeley, where she volunteered at a crisis hotline. The raw vulnerability shared by callers propelled her toward a Master's in Social Work at San Francisco State University. Her clinical rotations, particularly those in under-resourced schools and healthcare settings, further fueled her dedication to supporting marginalized communities.\n\nAfter obtaining her LCSW, Mei landed a position in a busy Tenderloin clinic, working with individuals struggling with addiction and homelessness. This challenging but rewarding experience was a significant turning point, forcing her to confront systemic inequities and hone her therapeutic skills under pressure. A desire to address these issues earlier in life led her to her current role as a social worker in the San Francisco Unified School District, where she provides mental health support to students and families. Her annual income of $95,000 reflects her years of experience and specialized training.\n\nMei\u2019s personal life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco. Her closest friends are former classmates and colleagues, bonded by shared experiences and a commitment to social justice. She is in a stable, loving relationship with Kai, an artist she met at a gallery opening in North Beach. They share a small but charming apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood Mei cherishes for its vibrant culture and community feel.\n\nHer daily routine is a mix of commutes and clinical work. She relies on BART for her 7.5-mile journey across the city, often using the travel time to read articles or listen to podcasts related to her field. Evenings are spent with Kai, exploring new restaurants, attending local events, or simply relaxing at home. Weekends often involve exploring golden Gate Park, volunteering at a local food bank, or visiting her parents in the South Bay.\n\nLooking ahead, Mei dreams of establishing a non-profit focused on providing culturally sensitive mental health services to immigrant families in San Francisco. She envisions a future where mental healthcare is accessible and destigmatized for all, a testament to the values instilled by her family and shaped by her experiences in this city. San Francisco is not just where she works; it's the cornerstone of her identity and the canvas for her aspirations."

One afternoon, a young man, barely older than her students, finally broke down, detailing the sheer exhaustion of surviving on the streets. Seeing the raw vulnerability, not just of addiction, but of deep human need, solidified Mei's fight. It wasn't just a job; it was witness. (Early 30s)\n\n2.  Standing in Golden Gate Park, after a chaotic week at school, Kai simply held her hand. The silence and the rustle of leaves were a balm. In that quiet moment, she felt completely seen and supported, knowing her burdens weren't hers alone. That connection grounded her turbulent life in the city. (Mid 30s)\n\n3.  Volunteering at the food bank, handing a bag of groceries to an elderly immigrant woman whose eyes mirrored her own grandmother's, a wave of connection washed over Mei. It wasn't just charity; it was echoing her family's values, a tangible link to the generations who came before her and built a life here. (Late 20s)\n\n4.  The first time a student, who had been stubbornly withdrawn, finally opened up about their anxieties, the relief and trust in their young voice resonated deeply. It was a powerful reminder of the impact she could have, a seedling of hope pushing through difficult ground. This fueled her belief in early intervention. (Mid 30s)\n\n5.  Listening to her mother recount her own struggles adjusting to life in the US, the quiet resilience in her voice, Mei understood her passion for community support wasn't just intellectual; it was deeply rooted in her family's journey. It solidified her dream of a non-profit, a way to honor their strength by helping others like them. (Late 20s)"
