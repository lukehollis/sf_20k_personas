At 51, he manages \u201cCypress & Crane,\u201d a high-end home goods store, and lives in the rent-controlled apartment directly above it. His 0.0-mile commute is a source of both comfort and containment.\n\nBorn to a pragmatic accountant father and a free-spirited mother in the East Bay, David\u2019s upbringing was a stable but uninspiring suburban affair. He escaped to San Francisco State University, seeking a world of ideas and beauty, and found it in Art History. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in the subject, dreaming of a life spent in museums, analyzing the brushstrokes of masters.\n\nThat dream, however, met the hard reality of the early 90s recession. With his degree proving commercially useless and student loans looming, David took a \"temporary\" holiday job at a department store. He discovered a surprising aptitude for the work\u2014a knack for inventory management and an art historian\u2019s eye for creating compelling displays. The temporary job became a career path. He rose through the ranks, eventually being headhunted to manage the newly opened boutique in Hayes Valley fifteen years ago.\n\nHis most significant relationship, a decade-long partnership with a chef, ended amicably when his partner left to open a restaurant in Portland. Since then, David has remained single, not out of sadness, but from a settled comfort in his routine. His social life is woven into his neighborhood: morning coffees with the barista next door, conversations with loyal customers, and weekly dinners with a small group of fellow long-term residents.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are marked by a familiar rhythm: unlocking the store, arranging new merchandise with an artist's care, and providing the warm, knowledgeable service that keeps people coming back. He is a fixture, a point of stability in a transient city. While he rarely thinks about museum archives anymore, his old dream surfaces in small ways. He hopes to one day take a long-overdue trip to Italy to finally see the Renaissance masterpieces he once studied so intensely. For now, though, he finds his satisfaction in the quiet stewardship of his small, curated corner of San Francisco."
