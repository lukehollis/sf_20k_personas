Born to a Native Hawaiian father from Maui and a second-generation Lebanese-American mother from Detroit, Keahi\u2019s childhood was a blend of two rich cultures. He spent his early years on Maui, where his father taught him to read the tides and respect the land\u2014*m\u0101lama \u02bb\u0101ina*, to care for and honor it. His mother infused their home with the resilient spirit of her immigrant family, expressing love through community feasts and intricate stories of perseverance.\n\nA pivotal turning point came during a college visit back to Maui. He saw a beloved coral reef, once vibrant in his memory, now bleached and struggling. The sight galvanized him. It was no longer enough to simply appreciate nature; he felt a burning need to protect it. This led him to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Management at UC Berkeley, where he specialized in watershed science and corporate sustainability.\n\nNow 28, Keahi works as an environmental consultant from his apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, minimizing his own footprint and maximizing his time. His days are a disciplined mix of digital meetings with corporate clients, advising them oneverything from water rights to carbon offsetting, and poring over environmental impact reports.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is rooted in its proximity to the ocean. Most mornings begin before dawn with a surf session at Ocean Beach, a ritual that washes away the corporate jargon and reconnects him to the elemental forces he works to protect. He navigates the city with a critical eye, appreciating its green initiatives while being acutely aware of the socioeconomic disparities underlying them. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from grad school, often meeting for beers in the Haight or cooking elaborate Lebanese dinners at his apartment.\n\nKeahi\u2019s ultimate dream is to move beyond advising. He hopes to one day launch his own B-Corp, one that directly implements ecological restoration projects by partnering with indigenous communities. He envisions a future where he can blend his father\u2019s ancestral knowledge with his mother's resilient pragmatism, creating a tangible legacy of healing for the earth."
