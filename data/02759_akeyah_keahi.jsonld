Born to a Native Hawaiian father from Maui and a second-generation Lebanese-American mother from Detroit, Keahi\u2019s childhood was a blend of two rich cultures. He spent his early years on Maui, where his father taught him to read the tides and respect the land\u2014*m\u0101lama \u02bb\u0101ina*, to care for and honor it. His mother infused their home with the resilient spirit of her immigrant family, expressing love through community feasts and intricate stories of perseverance.\n\nA pivotal turning point came during a college visit back to Maui. He saw a beloved coral reef, once vibrant in his memory, now bleached and struggling. The sight galvanized him. It was no longer enough to simply appreciate nature; he felt a burning need to protect it. This led him to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Management at UC Berkeley, where he specialized in watershed science and corporate sustainability.\n\nNow 28, Keahi works as an environmental consultant from his apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, minimizing his own footprint and maximizing his time. His days are a disciplined mix of digital meetings with corporate clients, advising them oneverything from water rights to carbon offsetting, and poring over environmental impact reports.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is rooted in its proximity to the ocean. Most mornings begin before dawn with a surf session at Ocean Beach, a ritual that washes away the corporate jargon and reconnects him to the elemental forces he works to protect. He navigates the city with a critical eye, appreciating its green initiatives while being acutely aware of the socioeconomic disparities underlying them. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from grad school, often meeting for beers in the Haight or cooking elaborate Lebanese dinners at his apartment.\n\nKeahi\u2019s ultimate dream is to move beyond advising. He hopes to one day launch his own B-Corp, one that directly implements ecological restoration projects by partnering with indigenous communities. He envisions a future where he can blend his father\u2019s ancestral knowledge with his mother's resilient pragmatism, creating a tangible legacy of healing for the earth."

His father worked beside him, explaining how this single act helped the whole ecosystem breathe. Keahi felt the chill of the water and a burgeoning sense of pride. It wasn\u2019t a chore; it was a conversation with the land. That day, *m\u0101lama \u02bb\u0101ina* stopped being a phrase and became a physical, unshakeable responsibility lodged deep in his bones.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he dipped his masked face into the waters of Honolua Bay, a place that shimmered with turquoise and gold in his childhood memories. But the color was gone. Before him lay a skeletal, ghostly white reef, silent and surreal. The beauty had been replaced by a tombstone. A cold, sharp grief struck him, quickly followed by a hot, defiant anger. In that moment, his vague appreciation for nature ignited into a fierce, lifelong mission to protect it.\n\n3.\nThe air in their Detroit relatives\u2019 kitchen was thick with cinnamon, garlic, and the steam from boiling grape leaves. He was fourteen, trying to learn the delicate fold from his mother. As she worked, she told a story of her grandfather arriving in America with nothing but a single recipe. Keahi realized the food wasn't just for sustenance; it was a vessel for resilience. He learned then that community and perseverance could be cooked into a meal and shared, a lesson he would carry into his own home.\n\n4.\nDuring his first semester at Berkeley, an overwhelming sense of displacement pushed him out of bed before dawn. He drove his beat-up car to Ocean Beach, the frigid water a shock to his system. As he paddled out, watching the city lights flicker behind the dunes, the intense Pacific waves demanded his full attention. The cold water washed away his anxiety, grounding him. He wasn't just in California; he was connected to its wild edge. This became his anchor, his non-negotiable ritual.\n\n5.\nJust last year, after a frustrating call advising a tech giant on a token carbon offset project, he took a walk. He was near the manicured lawns of the Presidio when he saw an elaborate, multi-bin recycling station just feet from the tent of an unhoused person. The contrast was jarring\u2014a symbol of curated, privileged environmentalism ignoring the human ecosystem right beside it. The sight solidified his resolve: advising wasn\u2019t enough. He had to build something that healed both the land and the community."
