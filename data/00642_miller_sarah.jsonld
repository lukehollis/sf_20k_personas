As the second-generation Korean American daughter of hardworking immigrants in Daly City, she became the family's emotional translator. Her father, a stoic grocer, communicated through tireless work, while her mother\u2019s anxieties were expressed in meticulously prepared meals. Sarah learned to read the unspoken, understanding that love and fear often wore the same face. This deep-seated empathy guided her away from the practical careers her parents hoped for and toward a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career was a trial by fire in the chaotic environment of a busy San Francisco hospital. For over a decade, she worked with patients and families grappling with sudden, life-altering diagnoses. Sarah was brilliant at her job, offering a calm anchor in moments of profound crisis, but the constant exposure to trauma took its toll. The turning point came at 39, when after a particularly grueling case, she found herself completely emotionally depleted. She realized she was on a path to burnout and could no longer effectively help others without first saving herself.\n\nThis realization prompted a radical shift. Sarah left the hospital system and painstakingly built her own private telehealth practice from her condo in Cole Valley. Her commute is now a ten-second walk from her kitchen to her serene home office. Her days are structured and intentional: she wakes early for a walk through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park before seeing clients via video call. Her work is more focused now, allowing for deeper, more sustained therapeutic relationships.\n\nNow 44, Sarah has cultivated a life of deliberate peace. Her partner, David, a software architect, provides a grounding and logical counterpoint to her emotional work. Their evenings are spent cooking together, reading, or enjoying the quiet, village-like atmosphere of their neighborhood. They have a small, tight circle of friends, preferring intimate dinners to loud parties.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in the sanctuary she has built. Cole Valley offers the community and green space she needs to recharge. Her dream is no longer about career advancement but about deepening her impact. She aspires to write a book for healthcare professionals on managing vicarious trauma, hoping to give others the tools she had to build for herself. For Sarah, success is measured in the quiet contentment of a life built on purpose and balance."
