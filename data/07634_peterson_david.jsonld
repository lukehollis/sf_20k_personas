Raised by an engineer father and a homemaker mother in suburban Ohio, his household was stable but emotionally reserved. David was an observant, sensitive child who often felt more like an anthropologist studying his own family than a participant. This innate curiosity about the unspoken currents between people later guided him toward his calling.\n\nHe left the Midwest for the University of Michigan, but it was his acceptance into UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work in the early 1990s that truly defined his path. David arrived in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS crisis. The city\u2019s profound grief and fierce resilience became his classroom. He interned at a hospice, and the experience of providing comfort and dignity amidst overwhelming loss forged his professional identity. He wasn\u2019t just learning a trade; he was bearing witness.\n\nFor two decades, David worked in challenging roles at SF General and various community clinics. His key turning point came about ten years ago, following the painful end of a 15-year relationship. Seeking stability and a new sense of purpose, he funneled his savings and experience into establishing a private practice.\n\nNow, David\u2019s commute is the ten steps from his kitchen to his home office. His days are structured around telehealth sessions, helping clients navigate their own landscapes of grief, anxiety, and trauma. He breaks up his day with long, meandering walks through Golden Gate Park or by picking up groceries on Cole Street, savoring the neighborhood\u2019s village-like atmosphere. His social life consists of a small, tight-knit circle of old friends\u2014survivors like him\u2014who prefer intimate dinners to crowded bars.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul. He has seen the city boom, bust, and transform, all while holding space for its ghosts. His dream is no longer grand; it is to continue his meaningful work, perhaps write a memoir about his early years in the field, and maintain the peaceful, purpose-driven life he has so carefully built for himself."
