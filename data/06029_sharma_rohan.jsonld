Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents, both successful software engineers, his path was pre-paved with expectations of medicine or tech. His childhood was one of academic pressure, but Rohan found his escape not in code, but in the chiaroscuro of a Caravaggio print and the bold lines of modern sculpture. He\u2019d spend hours in his room sketching, filling notebooks with designs that were a world away from the calculus problems his father championed.\n\nThe turning point came at UC Berkeley. Enrolled as an Economics major to appease his family, he took an elective in Art History that ignited his true passion. The decision to switch majors caused a deep, painful rift with his parents, who saw his choice as a betrayal of their sacrifices. To prove his seriousness, Rohan pursued a Master's in Art History from the San Francisco Art Institute, immersing himself in the city's vibrant, anti-establishment creative scene.\n\nHe started his career at the bottom, working as an unpaid intern, then as a registrar, learning the business from the ground up. His sharp eye, calm demeanor, and deep respect for the artists earned him a reputation. Today, at 43, he is the manager of a respected contemporary gallery in a SoMa loft building. His commute is zero; he lives in a minimalist apartment directly above the gallery, his life and work seamlessly intertwined.\n\nHis days are a curated routine: a strong black coffee while reading art journals, meetings with temperamental artists and discerning collectors, and evenings spent at openings or quiet dinners with his small, tight-knit circle of friends from the art world. The relationship with his parents has softened into a fragile truce, their pride in his stability warring with their lingering confusion over his path. Rohan\u2019s dream is to one day open his own gallery, a space dedicated to elevating emerging South Asian artists, finally bridging the two worlds he has fought so long to keep separate."
