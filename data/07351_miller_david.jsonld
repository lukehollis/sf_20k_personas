The son of an engineer father and a homemaker mother, his childhood was orderly and stable, but conversations rarely strayed beyond the practical. Emotions were private, unexamined things. This environment fostered in David a keen sense of observation and a deep curiosity about the unspoken currents that ran beneath his family\u2019s placid surface.\n\nInitially, he followed a conventional path, enrolling in an economics program at Ohio State University. However, a single elective in developmental psychology acted as a fulcrum, tipping his entire worldview. He was fascinated by the architecture of the human mind and the dynamics of relationships. He switched majors and, after graduating, pursued a Master's in Counseling Psychology from a small university in the Midwest.\n\nSan Francisco, with its promise of social liberty and self-exploration, called to him. He moved in the late 1990s, completing his licensure hours at a community health clinic in the Mission before eventually opening his own private practice. A key turning point came in his late 30s with the amicable end of his first and only marriage. The experience was humbling, teaching him the profound difference between clinical knowledge and lived emotional presence\u2014a lesson that deepened his empathy and transformed his therapeutic approach.\n\nNow, at 52, David\u2019s life is one of deliberate calm. He lives and works from his serene Inner Sunset home, his commute a simple walk from the kitchen to his study. His days are structured by telehealth appointments with clients navigating the complexities of their own lives. He and his partner of twelve years, Leo, a landscape architect, find solace in their shared routines: morning walks through the fog in Golden Gate Park, tending to their small, verdant backyard, and hosting quiet dinners for a tight-knit circle of friends. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its frantic energy and more about the space it has given him to build a life of quiet intention, helping others untangle the very knots he first noticed in himself as a boy in Ohio."
