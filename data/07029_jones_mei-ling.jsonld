            "value": "Mei-Ling Jones is a product of San Francisco's interwoven cultures. Raised in the Richmond District, she is the daughter of a pragmatic, first-generation Chinese mother who ran a beloved neighborhood bakery, and a history-obsessed, fourth-generation White American father who taught at a local high school. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken over dinner, helping her mother with inventory, and listening to her father\u2019s detailed explanations of the city\u2019s architectural and political history. She saw firsthand how city policies, from parking regulations to vendor permits, directly impacted her family's livelihood and the fabric of their community.\n\nThis dual perspective guided her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Urban Studies. A pivotal internship with a housing advocacy group in the Mission District solidified her career path. Witnessing the struggles of families facing displacement, she realized her passion wasn't just in understanding cities, but in actively shaping them for the better. This led her to a position as a City Planner\u2019s Assistant, where she now spends her days poring over zoning codes, environmental impact reports, and community feedback.\n\nLiving in a small apartment in Hayes Valley, Mei-Ling\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a core part of her identity; she works remotely, deeply embedded in the neighborhood she serves. Her mornings start with a coffee from a local cafe where she knows the barista by name, and her lunch breaks are often spent walking through Patricia's Green, observing how people interact with the public space. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of college friends and the occasional, often-dreaded, virtual community board meeting.\n\nWhile she enjoys her stable, civic-minded work, Mei-Ling dreams of having more direct influence. She aspires to lead projects that create affordable \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing and protect legacy businesses like the one her mother sold upon retirement. She wants to build a more equitable San Francisco, one that honors both her father\u2019s belief in civic structures and her mother\u2019s entrepreneurial grit."
