Born and raised in San Francisco's Mission District, she was the first-generation American daughter of hardworking immigrants from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. From a young age, she was their bridge to a new world, translating official documents and navigating appointments. Her life\u2019s trajectory was solidified at sixteen when her father, a construction worker, suffered a severe injury on the job. Sarah spent months deciphering workers' compensation forms and fighting with insurance adjusters, witnessing firsthand how easily vulnerable people could fall through the cracks of a complex healthcare system.\n\nThis formative struggle ignited a quiet fury and a profound sense of mission. She earned a scholarship to San Francisco State University and went on to complete her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. She turned down more lucrative corporate offers for a case manager position at a non-profit providing supportive housing and healthcare services in the SoMa district.\n\nNow forty, Sarah\u2019s commute is zero miles because she lives in a small apartment within the same building as her clients. Her day doesn't end at 5 p.m.; it simply shifts. A knock on her door after hours might be a resident in crisis or someone just needing to talk. Her life is a tapestry woven from the threads of others' struggles and triumphs. She helps individuals navigate addiction recovery, manage chronic illnesses, and find stable employment, celebrating small victories with the intensity others reserve for major promotions.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow social workers and old friends who understand the emotional weight of her work. Romance has been fleeting, often taking a backseat to her residents' urgent needs. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a bigger house or a fancier car, but to see systemic policy change that better protects the people she serves. She holds onto a quiet hope of one day taking a real vacation to Oaxaca, but for now, her purpose is here, in the heart of the city she\u2019s always called home, fighting to keep its compassionate soul alive, one person at a time."
