Born Kim Jin-woo, he was adopted at eighteen months by a loving Caucasian couple from Walnut Creek, an engineer and a teacher who gave him their name and a stable, suburban upbringing. Growing up, David was an analytical, observant child, excelling in math but quietly fascinated by the systems that made cities work. This interest led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Urban Planning, dreaming of designing more equitable and sustainable public spaces.\n\nHowever, graduating in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, David found the idealistic jobs he sought were scarce and underfunded. Pragmatism won out. Leveraging his formidable quantitative skills, he pivoted sharply into finance, securing an entry-level analyst position. The work was less soulful but offered the stability his parents had always valued. Over the next decade, he methodically climbed the corporate ladder, his intellect and discipline earning him the title of Senior Financial Analyst.\n\nNow 42, David\u2019s life is a study in contained precision. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to the standing desk in the corner of his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis before the East Coast wakes up, intense hours tracking global indices, and a string of virtual meetings. The apartment, with its clean lines and view of the bustling street below, is both his office and his sanctuary.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but curated. He rarely leaves his central neighborhood, preferring the contained energy of Hayes Valley\u2019s cafes, independent shops, and performance venues. His social life is similarly focused; he has a tight-knit circle of friends, and his most significant relationship is with Clara, a landscape architect who shares his appreciation for design and pulls him away from his screens for walks through the Presidio.\n\nThough financially secure, David feels a quiet pull toward the life he left behind, both professionally and personally. His ultimate dream isn't a C-suite title, but to take a year-long sabbatical. He and Clara have begun planning a trip to South Korea\u2014not to find his birth family, but to connect with the culture he knows only through books and food, finally weaving that missing thread into the fabric of his identity."

He saw his tall, fair-haired parents and, between them, a small boy with dark hair and different eyes. It wasn't sadness, but a sudden, clinical jolt of otherness. That moment sparked his lifelong habit of analytical observation, a need to understand the systems he existed within and his precise place\u2014or displacement\u2014inside them. He learned to see himself from the outside in.\n\n2. In his cramped Berkeley apartment in 2009, the rejection emails for urban planning jobs were piling up. He finally closed the browser tab for a non-profit he\u2019d dreamed of working for. Then, with a quiet finality, he opened a new one for a financial analyst training program. It felt less like a choice and more like a surrender to market forces. That single click was the moment pragmatism defeated idealism, setting a course for stability over passion and shaping his disciplined, risk-averse nature.\n\n3. He remembers one of his first Saturday afternoons in the Hayes Valley condo, around 2017. Leaning against his window, he watched the controlled, stylish chaos below: patrons leaving the symphony, shoppers with curated bags, the hum of contained energy. It wasn't the sprawling city he\u2019d studied, but a perfect, self-contained system. In that moment, he felt a profound sense of belonging not to San Francisco, but to *this* specific, well-designed corner of it, a feeling that cemented his hyperlocal existence.\n\n4. He had been silently fuming, dragged from a volatile pre-market analysis for a foggy walk in the Presidio. Clara stopped him mid-stride. \"Just listen to the wind in those cypress trees,\" she whispered. Annoyance gave way to awe as he heard the specific, flute-like whistle she had noticed. She saw the world as a living system, not a data set. That moment, two years ago, was when he realized she didn't just balance him; she completed a part of his perception he never knew was missing.\n\n5. For years, the sabbatical to Korea was an abstract wish. Then, six months ago, Clara came home not with takeout, but with a thick travel guide and a notebook labeled \"The Jenkins-Kim Project.\" Seeing his birth name next to his adopted one, written in her hand beside maps of Seoul, made his breath catch. The vague, formless longing he'd carried for forty years suddenly had weight and a timeline. The trip shifted from a distant dream to the most important analysis of his life."
