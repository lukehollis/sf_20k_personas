Born Kim Jin-woo, he was adopted at eighteen months by a loving Caucasian couple from Walnut Creek, an engineer and a teacher who gave him their name and a stable, suburban upbringing. Growing up, David was an analytical, observant child, excelling in math but quietly fascinated by the systems that made cities work. This interest led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Urban Planning, dreaming of designing more equitable and sustainable public spaces.\n\nHowever, graduating in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, David found the idealistic jobs he sought were scarce and underfunded. Pragmatism won out. Leveraging his formidable quantitative skills, he pivoted sharply into finance, securing an entry-level analyst position. The work was less soulful but offered the stability his parents had always valued. Over the next decade, he methodically climbed the corporate ladder, his intellect and discipline earning him the title of Senior Financial Analyst.\n\nNow 42, David\u2019s life is a study in contained precision. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to the standing desk in the corner of his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis before the East Coast wakes up, intense hours tracking global indices, and a string of virtual meetings. The apartment, with its clean lines and view of the bustling street below, is both his office and his sanctuary.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but curated. He rarely leaves his central neighborhood, preferring the contained energy of Hayes Valley\u2019s cafes, independent shops, and performance venues. His social life is similarly focused; he has a tight-knit circle of friends, and his most significant relationship is with Clara, a landscape architect who shares his appreciation for design and pulls him away from his screens for walks through the Presidio.\n\nThough financially secure, David feels a quiet pull toward the life he left behind, both professionally and personally. His ultimate dream isn't a C-suite title, but to take a year-long sabbatical. He and Clara have begun planning a trip to South Korea\u2014not to find his birth family, but to connect with the culture he knows only through books and food, finally weaving that missing thread into the fabric of his identity."
