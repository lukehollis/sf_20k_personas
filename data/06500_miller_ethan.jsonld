Adopted at nine months old by a loving Caucasian couple from Marin County, he grew up with the surname Miller, a name that felt both like a warm blanket and a costume he couldn't take off. His childhood was privileged and stable, filled with hikes on Mount Tamalpais and trips to Stinson Beach. Yet, in a predominantly white community, his reflection was a constant reminder of a connection he couldn't quite grasp.\n\nSchool was a place of quiet observation for Ethan. He was a decent student but felt academically adrift, finding more solace in the structure and sensory feedback of his after-school job as a dishwasher in a Sausalito bistro. The frenetic energy of the kitchen\u2014the clatter of pans, the sharp commands, the visceral process of creation and immediate reward\u2014was more compelling than any textbook. He graduated high school with a diploma but no desire for college, instead diving headfirst into the culinary world, working his way from dishwasher to prep cook across various North Bay kitchens.\n\nThe key turning point came at 24. Feeling stagnant and yearning for a deeper connection to his heritage, he moved across the bridge to San Francisco. He landed a line cook position at a small, family-owned Shanghainese restaurant in the Richmond District. The owner, a pragmatic matriarch named Mrs. Lin, saw his relentless work ethic and offered him the tiny, spartan apartment above the restaurant, a perk that explained his zero-mile commute.\n\nNow 28, Ethan\u2019s life is a cycle of intense, focused work. His alarm is the morning chop of cleavers on wood from the kitchen below. His days are a blur of searing, saut\u00e9ing, and plating. He has a respectful, familial bond with the Lins and the other cooks, though a language barrier often leaves him on the periphery of their Cantonese banter. He is an insider in the kitchen\u2019s chaotic ballet but an outsider to the culture that surrounds him.\n\nHe spends his rare days off walking the city, from the quiet shores of Ocean Beach to the bustling streets of the Mission, absorbing its eclectic energy. His dream is to save enough to one day open his own small food truck or pop-up, one that fuses the Korean flavors of his birthright with the Northern California ingredients of his upbringing. For Ethan, cooking is not just a profession; it\u2019s a way to slowly, thoughtfully plate his own identity."
