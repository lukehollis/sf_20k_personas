The daughter of pragmatic Chinese immigrants who ran a small grocery, her world was defined by their expectations: good grades, a practical degree, and a stable career in tech or medicine. She dutifully enrolled in a business program at San Francisco State University, but the lectures on market analytics felt as grey and colorless as the fog outside her classroom window. The path laid out for her felt like a stranger\u2019s map.\n\nThe turning point came during a walk through SoMa. Drawn in by a gallery opening, she was struck by a powerful photography exhibit depicting the city\u2019s hidden corners. It was the San Francisco she knew, but rendered with a raw beauty she had never allowed herself to see. Within a semester, she dropped out of college, a decision that created a quiet, painful rift with her parents who saw it as a profound failure. Unmoored but determined, Mei dedicated herself to the art world from the ground up, taking any job that would keep her close to her newfound passion.\n\nNow 32, Mei is a studio assistant at a small, independent gallery in SoMa, living in a tiny studio apartment directly above it. Her 0.0-mile commute is a staircase. Her days are a blur of stretching canvases, mixing paints for the featured artist, managing inventory, and greeting the occasional patron. After the gallery closes, her real work begins. In the quiet of her apartment, surrounded by contact sheets and developing chemicals, she pursues her own photography, capturing the overlooked textures and fleeting moments of the city that first inspired her.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit group of fellow artists who understand the sacrifice. While she yearns to mend the relationship with her family, her primary dream is to one day see her own work hanging on the gallery walls below, not just assisting it. Mei\u2019s life is a testament to her two San Franciscos: the foggy, traditional world of her upbringing and the vibrant, demanding art scene she now calls home. She lives between the two, hoping to one day build a bridge."
