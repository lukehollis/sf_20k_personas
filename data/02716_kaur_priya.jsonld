Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrant parents who ran a small, bustling grocery store, her childhood was a blend of Sikh traditions and Bay Area ambition. The plan was clear: she would get a practical degree, help with the family business, and eventually take it over. Priya dutifully enrolled in community college, pursuing an Associate's degree in Business Administration, though her heart was never in the ledgers and inventory sheets.\n\nThe major turning point came at 22. Her mother\u2019s prolonged illness required a full-time caregiver, and Priya stepped away from her studies to nurse her and run the store. In those demanding years, she discovered a deep, innate patience and a talent for nurturing that business school could never teach. After her mother recovered, the thought of returning to that life felt impossible. She had fulfilled her duty, and now she needed a life that was hers.\n\nAt 28, she moved to San Francisco, finding a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset. It was a world away from Fremont\u2019s suburban sprawl. She worked various service jobs before a nannying gig revealed her true calling. The joy she found in guiding a child\u2019s discovery of the world was profound. She soon earned her credentials to work in early childhood education. By a stroke of luck, the small, family-run preschool operating on the ground floor of her own apartment building had an opening for an assistant teacher. Her commute became a walk down two flights of stairs.\n\nNow 42, Priya\u2019s life is rooted in her neighborhood. Her days are a symphony of finger-paints, story time, and mediating disputes over toy blocks. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow teachers and a few families from the school. She is a familiar, calming presence on her block. While she sometimes feels the financial pinch of her modest income in an expensive city, she finds wealth in the children\u2019s laughter. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day take a long trip to India, to see the villages her parents spoke of, and perhaps, eventually, become a lead teacher at the school she calls home."
