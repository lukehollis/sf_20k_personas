            "value": "Sarah Miller\u2019s journey to San Francisco was less a grand ambition and more a quiet secession from the life she was supposed to live. Raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a pragmatic family of accountants and insurance agents, Sarah was a gentle, observant child who preferred sketching in notebooks to team sports. Her parents encouraged a stable path, so she dutifully enrolled at Ohio State University to study communications, a major she chose for its perceived practicality rather than any real passion.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year. Feeling adrift in the sprawling university, she spent a summer visiting a cousin in San Francisco. The city, with its fog-draped hills, vibrant neighborhood murals, and the casual acceptance of eccentricity, felt like an exhale. She saw lives being lived on their own terms and realized her own path felt suffocatingly narrow. She never returned for her junior year.\n\nArriving back in SF with little money and no plan, Sarah took a job as a part-time helper at the \"Little Sprouts Cooperative,\" a small, play-based preschool in the Inner Richmond. It was meant to be a temporary stopgap, but she was captivated. The chaos, creativity, and unfiltered honesty of three- and four-year-olds resonated with her in a way lectures never had. She found purpose not in textbooks, but in moderating disputes over building blocks and celebrating the mastery of tying a shoe.\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a small studio apartment directly above the preschool, a benefit that makes her modest assistant\u2019s salary tenable. Her days are a comforting rhythm of story time, art projects, and playground supervision. Her social circle is an extension of her work: the other teachers, the parents she chats with during pickup, and the owner of the corner caf\u00e9 where she gets her morning coffee. Her dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to complete an online Child Development Associate (CDA) credential. She envisions a future where she might one day co-lead a small school like Little Sprouts, fostering a space where children, like her, feel free to discover who they truly are."
