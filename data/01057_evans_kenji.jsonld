Born in a homogenous Ohio suburb to a Japanese mother who taught ikebana and a white American father who sold insurance, Kenji spent his youth navigating the space between two worlds, fully belonging to neither. This constant feeling of being an observer, of not quite fitting in, made him quiet and intensely perceptive. After high school, lacking direction, he drifted through a series of unfulfilling jobs\u2014warehouse stocker, coffee barista, delivery driver\u2014feeling the weight of his unrealized potential.\n\nThe turning point came at 26. His younger sister, overwhelmed by the same cultural pressures he felt, fell into a severe bout of depression. Witnessing her struggle and feeling utterly powerless to help ignited a dormant purpose within him. He realized his lifelong role as an observer could be transformed into a tool for understanding and healing.\n\nHe enrolled in a local community college, then transferred to San Francisco State University, drawn by the city\u2019s reputation as a haven for outsiders. For the first time, he didn't feel like an anomaly. He devoured his psychology and sociology courses, eventually earning his Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 46, Kenji is a a Licensed Clinical Social Worker operating a private practice from his quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his kitchen to a small, sound-proofed office. He specializes in treating adolescents and young adults grappling with identity issues, anxiety, and family conflict. His daily routine is structured: a foggy morning walk in Golden Gate Park, back-to-back telehealth sessions, and evenings spent cooking the Japanese recipes his mother taught him.\n\nHe maintains a small, close circle of friends, mostly other therapists who understand the emotional toll of the work. While he yearns for a lasting romantic partnership, he often prioritizes his clients' stability over his own. His quiet hope is to create a space where people feel unconditionally seen\u2014the very thing he craved as a boy. In San Francisco, a city built by transplants and dreamers, Kenji Evans finally found a place where his unique story wasn't a liability, but his greatest strength."
