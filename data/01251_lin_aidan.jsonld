Born to a mercurial Irish-American father who drifted through odd jobs and a second-generation Japanese-American mother who chased artistic whims, Aidan\u2019s childhood was a rudderless journey across the Pacific Northwest. He never lived in one place long enough to grow roots or claim a community. When asked about his ethnicity, he says \"None,\" as he feels no legitimate claim to any single culture; he is a collection of his parents' half-told stories and abandoned traditions.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma earned through a patchwork of different schools. At eighteen, after a final, explosive argument with his father, Aidan packed a bag and bought a one-way bus ticket to San Francisco, a city that promised anonymity among its fog-shrouded hills. He landed with seventy dollars and the clothes on his back, finding work within a week as a dishwasher in a loud, perpetually busy restaurant in the Mission District.\n\nThe chaotic, high-pressure kitchen became his true education. He found a strange solace in the rigid hierarchy and the discipline of a well-run line. He learned by watching, his quiet focus catching the eye of the exacting head chef. He was promoted from the dish pit to prep, then finally to the searing heat of the line. His life is now circumscribed by the restaurant itself; he lives in a small, subsidized SRO room directly above it. His commute is a single flight of stairs, his world perpetually smelling of garlic, grease, and cleaning solution.\n\nAidan\u2019s relationships are fleeting, forged in the heat of service with a shared nod or a quick, profane complaint. He keeps to himself, his social life limited to a post-shift beer with the other cooks. His dream isn\u2019t grand; he doesn\u2019t aspire to be an executive chef or a restauranteur. Instead, he obsesses over perfecting a single, deceptively simple pasta dish on the menu. He believes if he can create one thing that is perfectly executed and whole, he might understand how to assemble the disparate parts of his own life. For now, his San Francisco is not the landmarks, but the pre-dawn quiet of Mission Street, the clang of the roll-up gate, and the controlled frenzy of the kitchen\u2014the only home he's ever truly known."
