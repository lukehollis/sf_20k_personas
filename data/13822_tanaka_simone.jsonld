The daughter of a pragmatic Black union carpenter and a meticulous Japanese American bookkeeper, she grew up in Oakland, where discipline and education were presented as the only reliable tools for building a better future. From a young age, Simone was drawn to the elegant certainty of science, a world of variables that could be controlled and outcomes that could be predicted.\n\nHer educational journey was a direct line upward: an undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley, followed by a Master of Public Health from a prestigious East Coast university. It was there she discovered her niche\u2014not in a wet lab or patient-facing role, but in the complex architecture of clinical operations. She thrived on designing systems, managing massive datasets, and ensuring ethical and scientific rigor. Her early career was a blur of long hours at a major pharmaceutical company, a period that sharpened her skills but nearly burned out her spirit.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. Feeling like a cog in a machine, she resigned without a new job lined up. After three months of soul-searching\u2014and reconnecting with a love for hiking in the Marin Headlands\u2014she pivoted. Simone deliberately sought a role at a smaller, more innovative biotech firm in San Francisco, one that valued work-life balance. She negotiated a fully remote position as Director of Clinical Operations, a role she has held for the past seven years.\n\nNow 42, Simone\u2019s world is centered in her sunny Noe Valley apartment, where her home office overlooks a quiet, tree-lined street. Her 0.0-mile commute affords her a disciplined routine: an early morning run through Glen Canyon Park, followed by hours of focused work managing teams across different time zones. Evenings are for unwinding with a good book, tending to her impressive collection of houseplants, or meeting her small, tight-knit circle of friends for dinner in the Mission.\n\nThough deeply fulfilled by her career, Simone aspires to create a more personal legacy. She dreams of leveraging her expertise to launch a non-profit that helps mentor young women of color entering STEM fields. For Simone, San Francisco is not just a city of opportunity, but a platform from which she hopes to build something that will outlast any clinical trial: a foundation for the next generation."
