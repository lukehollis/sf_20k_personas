Born in Seoul, she was adopted as an infant by a loving caucasian couple and raised in the quiet, sun-drenched suburbs of Walnut Creek. Her childhood was happy but marked by a subtle sense of otherness. She was the only Asian face in most family photos, a fact that fueled a quiet, lifelong search for identity.\n\nAfter high school, she enrolled in community college with vague ideas of a career in art history, but felt disconnected and unmoored. Lacking direction, she dropped out after a year and a half, trading academia for the immediate reality of service jobs. The move to San Francisco in her mid-20s was an escape and a homecoming. The city\u2019s energy and diversity offered an anonymity her suburban town never could.\n\nShe found her footing not through a grand passion, but through pragmatism. A temp gig as a receptionist at a boutique real estate firm morphed into a full-time position. Rebecca was organized, empathetic, and excellent at de-escalating the myriad frustrations of urban tenancy. This led to her current role as a Property Management Assistant. The job came with a crucial perk: a small, rent-stabilized one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond building she helps manage, explaining her zero-mile commute.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of her building. Mornings are a flurry of emails and calls\u2014coordinating plumbers, fielding noise complaints, and scheduling showings. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, a collection of friends from her old barista days. Her connection to San Francisco isn't about landmarks; it's the thick fog rolling down Cabrillo Street, the scent of dumplings from Clement, and the familiar faces of the tenants whose lives she helps run smoothly.\n\nLately, at 35, Rebecca feels a quiet restlessness. The stability she craved now feels like a gilded cage. She dreams of finishing her degree, perhaps in urban studies, and has recently taken the terrifying first step of submitting her information to a Korean adoption reconciliation project. She hopes for a future that isn't just about managing properties, but about building a life that is fully and unapologetically her own."
