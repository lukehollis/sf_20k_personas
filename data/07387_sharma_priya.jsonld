Raised in Sacramento as the only child of Indian immigrants, she was instilled with a deep sense of duty. Her parents, who ran a small convenience store, pinned their hopes on her education, envisioning a future far more stable than their own. Priya enrolled at Sacramento State, initially drawn to history, but family circumstances intervened. When her father\u2019s health declined sharply during her sophomore year, she left school without a second thought to help run the store and support her mother.\n\nThe path to a degree was closed, so Priya found another. She took a temp job doing data entry for a burgeoning tech company. What was meant to be a stopgap became a career. She was meticulous, reliable, and possessed an uncanny ability to spot errors. Over two decades, she climbed the ladder not through ambition, but through sheer competence, eventually becoming a Data Entry Supervisor.\n\nAfter her father passed and her mother found stability, Priya, then in her late 30s, made a pivotal decision: she moved to San Francisco. It was an act of quiet rebellion, a claim on a life she\u2019d long deferred. She settled in the Inner Richmond, drawn to its proximity to Golden Gate Park and the comforting aroma of bakeries and dim sum restaurants.\n\nNow 48, Priya\u2019s world is contained within her one-bedroom apartment. The pandemic shifted her job to full-time remote, erasing her commute and deepening her connection to her immediate surroundings. Her days follow a structured pattern: managing her team via Slack and Zoom, a long afternoon walk through the park\u2019s winding trails, and evenings spent perfecting her mother\u2019s recipes while on FaceTime with her back in Sacramento. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a bi-weekly book club with two former colleagues.\n\nPriya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb higher in the tech world. Instead, a quiet hope simmers within her: to finish her degree. She has started taking online art history courses, not for a career, but for the pure joy of learning she sacrificed long ago. It is a private goal, a final, personal chapter she intends to write for herself."
