The only child of first-generation Korean immigrants, she grew up behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Outer Richmond. Her parents, who named her after a character in a Russian novel her mother adored, poured all their hopes into her, envisioning a stable future secured by a university degree.\n\nIrina dutifully enrolled in Business Administration at San Francisco State University, but her path was rerouted in her junior year. When her father suffered a heart attack, Irina dropped out to run the family store, a decision born of necessity and filial duty. For two grueling years, she managed inventory, balanced books, and worked fourteen-hour days. Though she never returned to college, the experience was a far more potent business education than any classroom could provide. It instilled in her a relentless work ethic and an intimate understanding of sacrifice.\n\nOnce her father recovered, Irina knew she couldn't return to the small world of the grocery store. Seeking autonomy and a higher ceiling, she earned her real estate license at 25. The first few years were lean, a humbling grind of open houses and cold calls. But she knew the city\u2019s neighborhoods not as abstract maps but as living communities. She leveraged her grit and street-smarts, eventually becoming a top-producing agent. At 41, she took the ultimate risk, cashing out her investments to open her own boutique brokerage, \u201cKim Collective Properties.\u201d\n\nNow 49, Irina is a respected Principal Broker. Her life is one of disciplined success. She lives in a thoughtfully renovated Marina-style home in West Portal, her 5.5-mile drive to her downtown office a quiet ritual of coffee and market podcasts. A brief marriage in her thirties ended amicably, unable to withstand her ambition; her greatest pride is her son, Leo, now a sophomore at UCLA. Her social life is a small, tight circle of fellow entrepreneurs and a few old friends.\n\nIrina\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she has sold pieces of it, watched it transform, and carved her own niche within its competitive heart. Her aspiration is no longer just about closing deals. She dreams of mentoring young, hungry agents, especially women from immigrant backgrounds. She envisions eventually selling her firm and traveling, perhaps finally finishing that business degree online\u2014not for the credential, but for the satisfaction of closing a loop she left open decades ago."

She remembers the mingled scents of her mother\u2019s fresh kimchi and damp cardboard, her father\u2019s patient smile for every customer. It wasn't just a store; it was the entire world. That cramped space behind the register was where she first learned the language of numbers, sacrifice, and the quiet dignity of a long day's work. It was the foundation of everything she would become.\n\n2.\nThe call came while she was in the SF State library. Her mother\u2019s voice, fractured with panic, sliced through the academic quiet. \"Your father...\" In that moment, the textbook on macroeconomics felt weightless, irrelevant. She walked out, leaving her books on the table. The decision wasn't a choice; it was a current that pulled her under. That long walk to her car was the first step of her real education, a brutal, immediate lesson in duty over desire, a path she had to forge alone.\n\n3.\nIt was a small Victorian in Noe Valley, her first big solo commission after years of grinding. She remembers the smell of fresh paint and the weight of the old brass keys in her palm. The young couple cried when she handed them over. For them, it was a home. For Irina, it was the click of a lock turning in her own life, validating every cold call and failed open house. In their joy, she found her purpose: she wasn't just selling property; she was handing people their future.\n\n4.\nShe stood alone in her new, empty downtown office at 6 a.m. The lease was signed with money that represented every risk she\u2019d ever taken. Her name was on the glass door: *Kim Collective Properties*. The sun was just beginning to touch the top of the Transamerica Pyramid. The feeling wasn't loud or triumphant, just a deep, quiet hum of arrival. The girl from the Outer Richmond grocery store finally owned a piece of the skyline she used to stare at from across the city.\n\n5.\nStanding on the UCLA campus, the late summer heat felt oppressive. She watched Leo, so confident and ready, haul a box into his dorm. She helped him make his bed, a familiar ritual made strange and final. The hug goodbye was brief, fierce. Driving back up the I-5 alone, the silence in the car was cavernous. It was the proudest, most painful moment of her life\u2014a successful launch. Her ambition had a purpose, and he was flying on his own. Now, her life was fully hers again."
