The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1980s, she grew up straddling two worlds: the quiet, fragrant kitchen of her mother\u2019s cooking and the booming, chaotic expansion of Silicon Valley just outside her door. While her father, a software engineer, pushed for a career in tech, Priya was more fascinated by the systems that governed their burgeoning community\u2014specifically, the often-unreliable bus line she depended on for teenage freedom.\n\nThis early frustration with public infrastructure became a calling. She pursued political science at UC Berkeley, immersing herself in urban studies, before earning a Master's in Public Policy. Her career began not with a corner office, but as a policy analyst for a city supervisor, poring over transit data and community feedback reports. She methodically climbed the ladder within San Francisco's municipal government, her reputation built on a foundation of sharp analysis and a genuine commitment to equity.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce a decade ago. The amicable split from a partner whose career in finance demanded a different lifestyle clarified her own priorities. She realized her deepest commitment was to the city itself. Free from marital obligations, she channeled her formidable energy into her work at the SFMTA, leading to her current role as Deputy Director.\n\nToday, Priya lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley. Her morning routine is sacrosanct: a strong cup of coffee while reading global news, followed by her 1.5-mile commute on the Muni Metro. This daily trip is her fieldwork; she observes passenger flow, notes delays, and listens to the ambient chatter, constantly gathering data. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of non-profit leaders, artists, and civil servants\u2014who meet for dinner in the Mission or catch shows at the SFJAZZ Center near her home.\n\nPriya\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to become the Director of the SFMTA. It\u2019s not about power, but about stewardship. She dreams of a San Francisco with a world-class, seamless transportation system that connects every neighborhood and resident, regardless of income. For Priya, fixing the city\u2019s transit isn't just a job; it's the fulfillment of a promise she made to her teenage self at a lonely bus stop decades ago."

She was sixteen, stranded between the scent of her mother's kitchen and the distant promise of the city. The initial anger cooled into a cold, determined question: *who decides?* The frustration of that moment wasn't a teenage complaint; it was the blueprint for her career. It was the first time she understood that a broken system was not a fact, but a problem to be solved.\n\n2.\nIt was a visiting planner speaking in an overheated lecture hall at UC Berkeley. He put up a map overlaid with transit lines and income data, calling it \u201can equity diagram.\u201d For Priya, it was a thunderclap. The messy unpredictability of her teenage bus rides suddenly had a name, a discipline, a science. She felt a profound sense of arrival, realizing her personal frustrations were a shared public challenge. That day, her path was no longer just a feeling; it became a formal education.\n\n3.\nThe first night alone in her Hayes Valley condo, a decade ago, should have felt empty. The boxes were still unpacked, the silence amplified by the absence of her ex-husband\u2019s finance calls. Instead, as she looked out at the lights and heard the distant rumble of the N-Judah, a profound calm settled over her. This was not an ending, but a clarification. Her most enduring, demanding, and rewarding partnership had always been with San Francisco itself.\n\n4.\nYears ago, in a tense Bayview community meeting, she defended a rerouting of the T Third Street line. After her data-heavy presentation, an elderly woman stood up, not to argue, but to thank her. \u201cI can finally get to my doctor\u2019s office without two transfers,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice quiet but firm. The spreadsheets dissolved in that moment, replaced by the weight of a single life made easier. It cemented her belief that true progress is measured one person, and one trip, at a time.\n\n5.\nJust last week, standing on a crowded K-line train, she watched a group of students seamlessly tapping their Clipper cards while a tourist fumbled with the payment machine. The driver gave the tourist a patient nod. This small, everyday ballet of commuters and operators is her sanctuary. It\u2019s not just a ride to work; it\u2019s a living report, a daily affirmation of the city\u2019s pulse. In these moments, she feels less like an administrator and more like a faithful custodian of the city's arteries."
