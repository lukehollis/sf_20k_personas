Raised in a working-class Detroit neighborhood, her father was a line supervisor at Ford and her mother a high school administrator. They instilled in Jada a powerful work ethic and the belief that education was the only reliable escape route. She excelled, pursuing a business undergraduate degree followed by a Master's in Urban Planning, dreaming of designing equitable, beautiful public spaces for communities like the one she grew up in.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was her great turning point. With municipal budgets slashed, her idealistic career path vanished. Facing significant student debt, Jada made a calculated pivot. Leveraging her innate skill with numbers, she pursued an accounting certification. Her diligence paid off when a burgeoning San Francisco fintech company recruited her in 2011. She left the Midwest behind for the promise of the Bay Area, trading urban planning blueprints for complex spreadsheets.\n\nNow, at 48, Jada is a Senior Accountant living in a meticulously kept condo in NoPa (North of the Panhandle). A decade-long marriage ended amicably five years ago, leaving her with a close circle of friends she considers her \"chosen family\" and a rescue terrier named Miles. Her 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic norm she cherishes. Her days begin not with a frantic BART ride, but a quiet walk with Miles through the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe in hand. She finds a steady satisfaction in the logic and order of her work, a calm counterpoint to the city's chaotic energy outside her window.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She knows the baristas, the bookstore owners, and the best days to visit the Divisadero Farmers' Market. Though she has found stability, her old dream flickers. Jada\u2019s future aspiration is to merge her two selves: she hopes to eventually transition to a financial role within a housing non-profit or an urban development firm, using her hard-won fiscal expertise to finally help build the equitable communities she once envisioned on paper."
