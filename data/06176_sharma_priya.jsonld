Born to a family of Indian descent, her early life was shaped by a close-knit community and the hard work of her parents, who ran a small grocery stand. They dreamed of providing more for Priya and her younger sister, Anjali, and when Priya was 15, they scraped together enough to immigrate, landing in Daly City with a distant cousin.\n\nThe transition was jarring. Priya finished her last two years of school at a packed public high school, her Fijian Hindi accent making her feel like an outsider. College was a distant, unaffordable dream. Her priority was to help her family gain a foothold. She took the first steady job she could find: a packing position at a logistics warehouse in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch district. What was meant to be a temporary measure to help her sister through school became a lifelong career.\n\nFor 28 years, Priya has worked her way up from packer to a trusted shift lead. Her key turning point came a decade ago when a small, rent-controlled apartment opened up just three blocks from the warehouse. Securing it meant she could walk to work, eliminating a grueling commute and anchoring her life to the city's industrial waterfront. Her San Francisco is not one of tech campuses but of cranes, shipping containers, and the salty fog rolling over Pier 70.\n\nPriya\u2019s life is one of routine and quiet dignity. Her days start before dawn, her body accustomed to the physical demands of lifting, sorting, and scanning. Her social circle is small, consisting of a few co-workers with whom she shares lunch and a deep, unspoken understanding. Her greatest pride is Anjali, now a successful dental hygienist in the East Bay, whose education Priya\u2019s wages helped secure.\n\nNow 46, Priya\u2019s dreams are grounded in reality. She hopes to save enough to one day take her aging parents back to Fiji for a final visit. Her quiet aspiration is to witness the sunrise from her own small balcony, a testament to a life of hard work in the city she calls home. She is the city\u2019s unseen engine, a resident whose hands have touched more goods than most will ever own, a quiet testament to a San Francisco that still works."
