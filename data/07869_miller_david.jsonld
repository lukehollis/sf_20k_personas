His father, a car mechanic, believed in the tangible world of engines and effort, a belief he passed on to his son. After graduating from high school with little fanfare and no desire for college, David drifted through a series of jobs\u2014parts runner, warehouse forklift operator, a brief stint as a security guard. None of them stuck. They were just ways to pay rent on a shared apartment, feeling disconnected from the work itself.\n\nThe turning point came at age 26. His dad had a health scare, and the fragility of a life without solid benefits became starkly clear. On a whim, seeing a hiring poster on a bus, he applied to be a Muni operator. The process was long, but the promise of a union job, a pension, and real stability was a powerful lure. It was the kind of steady, essential work his father respected.\n\nNow, at 33, David\u2019s life is intrinsically linked to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. He lives in a small, subsidized apartment in an employee housing complex adjacent to a Muni depot in Dogpatch, explaining his zero-mile commute. His days start before dawn, with the familiar ritual of a strong coffee and the walk to his assigned bus. From his driver\u2019s seat, he watches a rolling diorama of San Francisco life: tech workers silent behind their screens, tourists marveling at Victorian houses, and the city's forgotten souls seeking warmth.\n\nDavid is a quiet observer, a steady presence in a city defined by frantic change. His social life is small but solid, mostly consisting of other operators and a few old friends from the East Bay. A serious relationship ended a few years ago when his girlfriend grew tired of a life dictated by early mornings and rigid schedules. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup or travel the world; it\u2019s to save enough to one day buy a small house with a garage back in a quieter East Bay suburb, where he can finally restore the \u201868 Mustang that sits under a tarp in his father\u2019s yard. He is an anchor in a city of transients, a man who literally keeps San Francisco moving."
