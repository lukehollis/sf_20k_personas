Born to a Japanese immigrant mother who ran a small flower shop in Japantown and a third-generation Irish-American father who drove a Muni bus, Kenji\u2019s upbringing in the Outer Sunset was a blend of two cultures, defined by hard work and a quiet appreciation for the city's rhythms.\n\nSchool was never Kenji\u2019s domain. He was a tactile learner, more interested in taking apart a toaster than reading a textbook. After graduating high school, he bypassed college, finding it an abstract and expensive proposition. His twenties were a blur of transient jobs: bouncing at a Mission dive bar, hauling lumber for construction crews in Potrero Hill, and landscaping for wealthy clients in Pacific Heights. He felt adrift, a working-class ghost haunting a city rapidly transforming with dot-com money he couldn\u2019t comprehend.\n\nThe turning point came at 29. Tired of instability, he followed his father\u2019s advice and applied for a job with the city. After a year on the waiting list, he was hired by the Department of Public Works. Kenji found his calling not in a career, but in a vocation. The tangible satisfaction of fixing a broken irrigation valve or repainting a graffitied bench gave him a sense of purpose he\u2019d never found elsewhere.\n\nNow 43, Kenji\u2019s life is one of profound, localized connection. His commute is zero miles because he lives in a small, city-owned cottage attached to the public plaza he maintains near Hayes Valley. His days are dictated by the sun and the needs of his small patch of earth. He wakes before dawn to sweep the grounds, his only companions the city\u2019s early risers and the homeless individuals he knows by name. He\u2019s had relationships, including a brief, amicable marriage in his early thirties, but his hermit-like existence and dedication to his work make long-term partnership difficult.\n\nKenji\u2019s aspirations are modest. He dreams of retiring with his pension, perhaps getting a small fishing boat to take out on the Bay. His deepest hope is for the city itself\u2014that it can retain some of the soul he helps maintain, one swept path and repaired bench at a time."
