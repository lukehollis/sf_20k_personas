She arrived in 1979 as a young child, one of many Vietnamese \"boat people\" whose families had sacrificed everything for a foothold in America. Her parents worked multiple low-wage jobs, their exhaustion a constant, silent presence in their small apartment. Mai, a quick study, became their translator and navigator, a social worker in miniature before she even knew the term. This formative experience, witnessing her community\u2019s struggle to access basic services, cemented her life\u2019s calling.\n\nIgnoring the parental push towards more lucrative fields like engineering, Mai enrolled in the Social Work program at San Francisco State University. She felt a profound duty to build the bridges her family had so desperately needed. Her career began in the trenches: as a caseworker in a Mission District non-profit. For two decades, she built a reputation for being a fiercely compassionate and effective advocate. Her ascent to Director of Social Services at UCSF Health was the culmination of this tireless work, a position where she could effect systemic change.\n\nNow 52, Mai\u2019s life is a testament to her journey. She lives alone in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, a peaceful world away from her childhood. Her daily routine is grounded in the city's rhythm. She catches the N Judah MUNI line for her 5.8-mile commute, using the time to read or simply watch the diverse cross-section of the city she serves. A divorc\u00e9e for over a decade, her primary relationships are a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow professionals and women she\u2019s known since college\u2014with whom she shares dim sum on weekends.\n\nMai\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her very being. She sees the city not as a tech playground, but as a complex ecosystem of striving, resilience, and need. Her greatest aspiration isn\u2019t a bigger title or a house in the suburbs, but to establish a robust mentorship program at UCSF for first-generation students entering healthcare. For Mai, success is measured by the stability and support she now provides\u2014the very things her family once fought so hard to find."

She was eight, her small hand clutching her father\u2019s as she translated the official\u2019s rapid-fire English about a missing form. She felt the weight of her father\u2019s hope and confusion resting on her small shoulders. In that sterile room, translating bureaucratic jargon, she wasn\u2019t just a daughter; she was a lifeline. That feeling of immense responsibility, of bridging a chasm of language and culture, never left her. It became the bedrock of her identity. (Circa 1982)\n\n2.\nThe silence in their kitchen was heavier than any argument. She was 19, trying to explain to her parents why she chose Social Work at SF State. Her father, his hands calloused from two jobs, couldn\u2019t understand why she\u2019d choose advocacy over the security of engineering. It was the first time she truly disappointed them, a sharp, bitter pang of guilt. But it was also the moment she claimed her own purpose, vowing to honor their sacrifice by serving others, not just by earning a big salary. (Circa 1989)\n\n3.\nYears into her work at the Mission non-profit, she finally secured permanent housing for an elderly man who had been on the streets for a decade. He didn\u2019t say thank you. Instead, he simply took the key, looked at the small, clean room, and quietly began to weep. Mai felt no soaring triumph, only a deep, grounding sense of rightness. This was it. This was the work. That quiet moment of human dignity restored affirmed every difficult choice she had ever made. (Mid-1990s)\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday night, about three years after her divorce. Fog pressed against her Inner Sunset window, muffling all but the distant groan of the N Judah. Sitting alone in the quiet of her own rent-controlled apartment, she realized the silence wasn't empty, but peaceful. It was a stillness she had earned. This feeling of self-sufficient solitude\u2014not loneliness, but a quiet contentment\u2014became her anchor, a profound appreciation for the stability she had finally built for herself. (Circa 2014)\n\n5.\nWalking through a UCSF hallway last year, she saw a young medical resident on the phone, anxiously translating a diagnosis for her mother in Vietnamese. Mai saw the same flicker of stress and duty in the young woman\u2019s eyes that she remembered in her own. The sight was a gut-punch of recognition. In that instant, her vague idea for a mentorship program solidified into an urgent, non-negotiable mission. She wasn\u2019t just building a program; she was building a bridge for her younger self.
