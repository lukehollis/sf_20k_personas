Born and raised in Fremont to Indian immigrant parents who had built successful careers in Silicon Valley, Priya grew up surrounded by the expectation that she would follow a similar path in engineering or medicine. Her childhood was comfortable but regimented, a world of academic excellence and pragmatic career goals. However, a quiet rebellion was brewing within her.\n\nHer turning point came at UC Santa Cruz, where she declared a major in Sociology against her parents' wishes. An internship at a local shelter during her junior year exposed her to the stark realities of homelessness and systemic inequality. For the first time, she felt a profound sense of purpose that transcended financial success. The difficult conversations with her family about her future were painful, but they solidified her resolve.\n\nAfter graduating, Priya moved to San Francisco, drawn to its history of activism and the concentration of social services. She landed a job as a Case Manager at a nonprofit in the Mission District, focusing on supporting at-risk youth. The work is emotionally taxing and financially modest, a stark contrast to the life her parents envisioned. Her days are a whirlwind of crisis intervention, navigating labyrinthine bureaucracy for her clients, and celebrating small victories\u2014a successful housing application, a re-enrollment in school.\n\nLiving in a small, rent-controlled apartment just a few blocks from her office, Priya\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission. Her zero-mile commute is a walk past vibrant murals, bodegas, and the community she serves. Weekends are for decompressing with a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom also work in the nonprofit sector, sharing stories over cheap burritos or finding solace in Dolores Park.\n\nPriya dreams of a more just system, one that prevents crises rather than just managing them. She\u2019s considering a Master's in Public Policy to advocate for change on a larger scale. While she sometimes feels the weight of her clients\u2019 struggles and her own financial precarity, she is anchored by her connection to her neighborhood and the tangible impact of her work. She hopes one day her parents will fully understand that she is building a different, but no less valuable, kind of legacy."
