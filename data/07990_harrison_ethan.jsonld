            "value": "Ethan Harrison\u2019s life was built on a foundation of pragmatic ambition, a trait inherited from his father, a civil engineer in the quiet, leafy suburbs of Portland, Oregon. His mother, a high school history teacher, instilled in him a contrasting belief: that the most important work was in service to society. This duality defined his path. He excelled in undergrad, driven by a desire to understand and improve complex systems, which led him not to business school, but to a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown.\n\nHis turning point came during a grueling, unpaid internship on Capitol Hill. Surrounded by bureaucratic inertia and political posturing, his idealism soured. He saw true, rapid change happening not in government, but in the tech sector. The realization was a quiet but profound disillusionment. He pivoted, leveraging his analytical skills to land a coveted role at a top-tier management consulting firm in San Francisco, specializing in tech strategy.\n\nNow 28, Ethan lives a life of calculated efficiency. His sleek, minimalist apartment in a Hayes Valley high-rise is also his office, reducing his commute to zero. His days are a disciplined sequence of Zoom calls with high-stakes clients, dissecting data and building PowerPoints that shape the future of billion-dollar companies. Evenings are for the gym in his building or meticulously planned dinners with a small circle of friends, mostly colleagues or old university acquaintances. His romantic life is sporadic; the demands of his career leave little room for the unpredictability of a serious relationship.\n\nDespite his success, a part of him still wrestles with the ghost of his past ambitions. He loves San Francisco for its relentless energy and proximity to innovation, yet sometimes feels detached from its vibrant, messy soul. His ultimate dream isn't to become a partner at his firm, but to build enough capital and expertise to launch a public-benefit corporation. He aspires to fuse his father\u2019s pragmatism with his mother\u2019s idealism, proving to himself that his detour into the corporate world was not an abandonment of his values, but a strategic path toward making a tangible impact\u2014on his own terms."
