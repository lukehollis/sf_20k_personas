The scent of her jasmine tea in the morning mingles with the fog rolling in off the Pacific, a scent she has known since childhood. Born in San Francisco to parents who emigrated from Guangdong, Mei\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two worlds. She spent her youth translating for her parents, stocking shelves in their small import shop, \u201cGolden Dragon Gifts,\u201d and dreaming of a life beyond the storefront window.\n\nHer escape came in the form of an acceptance letter to San Francisco State University. For two exhilarating years, Mei immersed herself in art history, losing herself in Renaissance paintings and modern sculpture. It was a world entirely her own, separate from family duty. However, this chapter closed abruptly when her father had a severe stroke. Without a second thought, Mei left her studies to help her mother run the store. It was meant to be temporary, but \u201ctemporary\u201d stretched into years, then a decade. After her father passed, her role solidified.\n\nNow 54, Mei is the store\u2019s manager and heart. She took her father\u2019s traditional business acumen and modernized it, adding an inventory system and a simple online shop. Her brief marriage in her late thirties ended amicably; her ex-husband couldn\u2019t compete with the store, which demanded her evenings and weekends. Her key relationships now are with her regulars\u2014the elderly woman who buys incense every month, the young couple seeking the perfect wedding tea set. These connections form the fabric of her quiet social life.\n\nMei\u2019s commute is the seventeen steps from her apartment down to the shop floor. Her daily routine is a comforting ritual of opening the gate, brewing tea for the day, and arranging displays. While she is proud of preserving her family's legacy, a quiet dream persists. She hopes to one day hire a full-time manager, not to retire, but to finally finish her degree\u2014or perhaps just take the pottery class she\u2019s eyed for years. She wants to travel to Italy, not to source goods, but simply to see the art she once only studied in books."
