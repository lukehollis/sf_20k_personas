The only child of a Yemeni father, who ran a small electronics repair shop in San Jose, and a second-generation Yemeni-American mother, he grew up surrounded by stories of a distant, ancient homeland. Yet, his world was one of Silicon Valley\u2019s sprawling, car-centric suburbs. He spent his youth observing the disconnect\u2014the isolated cul-de-sacs, the vast parking lots, and the lack of vibrant public squares his parents spoke of. This observation became the quiet seed of his future career.\n\nDriven by a desire to build more connected communities, Omar excelled in his studies, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree in Urban Studies. He stayed for his Master of Urban Planning, focusing his thesis on creating equitable, transit-oriented development. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted entry-level position with the San Francisco Planning Department. Over the past five years, he\u2019s diligently worked his way up to City Planner III, earning a reputation for his meticulous research and passionate advocacy for pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.\n\nThe pandemic was a pivotal turning point. The mandated work-from-home policy transformed his life. Previously, his Hayes Valley apartment was merely a launchpad for his commute to City Hall; now, it\u2019s his entire universe. His 0.0-mile commute has tethered him to his neighborhood in a way he never anticipated. His daily routine involves a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and a pastry, followed by hours of analyzing zoning codes and reviewing development proposals from his standing desk, which overlooks a bustling street.\n\nSocially, Omar maintains a close circle of friends from his Berkeley grad program, meeting for weekly trivia or exploring new restaurants across the city. He is currently single, finding the rhythm of remote work makes organic connections more challenging, though he remains hopeful.\n\nOmar\u2019s dream is to one day lead a major project that reshapes a part of San Francisco\u2019s public realm, perhaps a new park or a pedestrianized corridor. He aspires to create a space that fosters the kind of spontaneous community he felt was missing in his suburban upbringing. His deepest hope is to build a life as well-designed as the cities he imagines\u2014a life of purpose, connection, and deep roots in the complex, vibrant city he now calls home."

His father was describing the old city of Sana\u2019a\u2014the smell of spices, the sound of a thousand conversations at once. Looking out at the endless, silent rows of cars, Omar felt a sudden, sharp ache for a place he\u2019d never seen. It wasn\u2019t nostalgia; it was the birth of a question that would define his life.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in Wurster Hall\u2019s library during his first year of grad school. He was reading Jane Jacobs, and a specific phrase\u2014\"the ballet of the good city sidewalk\"\u2014leapt from the page. Suddenly, his entire suburban childhood, the silent cul-de-sacs, and his father\u2019s stories all clicked into place. It was a moment of profound validation; his personal ache had a name and a theory. He wasn\u2019t just chasing a feeling, he was studying a science, and he finally felt seen.\n\n***\n\n3.\nTwo years into his job, he presented data for a new protected bike lane at a community meeting, feeling confident and righteous. Then an elderly woman stood up, her voice trembling, and spoke about losing the parking spot she relied on for groceries. In that moment, his beautifully designed diagrams felt hollow. He saw not an opponent, but a person with valid fears. It was a humbling lesson: cities are not just systems to be optimized, but collections of individual lives to be respected.\n\n***\n\n4.\nDuring the first silent week of the pandemic, he stepped out of his Hayes Valley apartment. For years, this street was just the start of his commute. But that morning, with no MUNI to catch, he just\u2026 walked. He noticed the intricate murals, the names of the small businesses, the faces of neighbors he\u2019d only ever nodded to. The city wasn\u2019t a map of transit lines anymore; it was a living ecosystem right outside his door. For the first time, he felt truly home.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last summer, after a long day of reviewing zoning codes, he sat on a bench in Patricia\u2019s Green. He watched dogs chase balls, couples share ice cream, and friends laugh on blankets. No one had planned these specific interactions; the space had simply allowed them to happen. He felt a profound, quiet joy\u2014a sense of seeing his life\u2019s work in miniature. It was a tangible piece of the community he\u2019d always longed for, and for a moment, he didn\u2019t feel alone in it at all."
