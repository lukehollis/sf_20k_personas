Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and an architect father, her childhood was filled with books, blueprints, and a deep appreciation for tangible history. She was the kind of girl who preferred the dusty stillness of a museum to a bustling playground. This passion led her to a BA in Art History and, subsequently, a Master's in Museum Studies from the University of Washington.\n\nHer early career unfolded in traditionally underfunded but passionate environments: a small historical society in Sacramento, a brief stint at a maritime museum. She married, had a son, and settled into a comfortable life in San Francisco\u2019s Noe Valley. But the dot-com bust, followed by the 2008 financial crisis, brought instability. After a layoff and a quiet divorce, Sarah, then in her mid-40s, faced a crossroads. The pivotal moment came with an unexpected job offer: Curator for the corporate museum of OmniCorp, a tech behemoth in Silicon Valley. To her idealistic younger self, it felt like selling out. To her pragmatic present self, it was a lifeline and a fascinating new challenge: to chronicle a history being written in real-time.\n\nNow 54, Sarah\u2019s life is contained within the pristine confines of the OmniCorp campus. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her modern, company-owned apartment to the glass-and-steel museum she now runs. She traded the unpredictable charm of her Noe Valley walk-up for curated serenity. Her days are a mix of meticulous research, exhibit design, and managing the delicate balance between historical integrity and corporate narrative. She has a cordial relationship with her adult son, a software engineer in Austin, their video calls often blending maternal affection with professional curiosity.\n\nThough she misses the chaotic energy of San Francisco proper, she finds deep purpose in her work. Her ultimate aspiration is to launch a permanent exhibit titled \"The Human Interface,\" focusing not on the triumphant progression of processors and code, but on the profound, often messy, human impact of the technology born within those very walls. It is her quiet rebellion, her hope to ensure the story of technology is remembered not just for its products, but for its humanity."
