Growing up in a quiet Ohio suburb with loving but emotionally reserved parents, she became a keen observer of the subtle currents of tension and affection that flowed beneath a placid surface. This early attunement to relational dynamics steered her toward psychology. She left the Midwest for the progressive energy of San Francisco to pursue her master's in Counseling Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies, drawn by its holistic approach.\n\nHer career began in community mental health, but her defining professional and personal test came in her early thirties. Her own marriage to a tech founder, a casualty of misaligned dreams and the relentless pressures of startup culture, ended in a painful but clarifying divorce. The experience, while devastating, imbued her with a profound empathy that textbooks could never provide. It solidified her commitment to her profession, and she leaned into the work, eventually becoming a senior therapist at a non-profit community services organization in the Western Addition. There, she helps families navigate crises, from financial hardship to cultural dislocation, finding deep meaning in providing accessible care.\n\nNow 43, Shauna\u2019s life is a tapestry of intentional choices. She lives alone in a cozy, book-filled apartment in NoPa, just a 1.2-mile walk from her office. Her mornings begin with her rescue terrier mix, Otis, at Alamo Square Park, watching the fog burn off the city skyline. Her commute is a cherished ritual, a time to decompress and observe the neighborhood\u2019s rhythms.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014for potlucks, hikes in the Marin Headlands, and a long-running book club. She has found peace in her singlehood but remains open to a partnership built on mutual respect and emotional honesty. Her ultimate dream is to one day co-found a small, specialized practice with a colleague, focusing on helping couples navigate major life transitions. For Shauna, San Francisco is more than a home; it's the place where she learned to heal herself by helping others find their own voice."

Instead of the familiar, awkward silence of her childhood, the group leaned in with quiet acceptance. It was a revelation. This was a place where the unspoken could finally be given voice. The deep, anxious knot she\u2019d carried from Ohio began to loosen. It was the moment San Francisco promised her a new language, one she desperately wanted to learn.\n\n2.\nShe was 32. After the last of his boxes were gone, she stood in the echo of their shared apartment, tracing the faint squares of dust on the wall where their pictures had hung. The silence wasn\u2019t just crushing; it was clarifying. For the first time, there was no one else\u2019s ambition to manage, no tension to navigate. There was only her. The pain was immense, but beneath it stirred a terrifying, exhilarating clarity. That day, her understanding of loss transformed from a clinical concept into a scar she would learn from.\n\n3.\nThe first Thanksgiving after her divorce, she planned to spend the day with a book and a bottle of wine. Then, a knock. Her book club, armed with mismatched Tupperware of turkey, stuffing, and pie. They didn't ask; they just came. They filled her quiet NoPa apartment with laughter and terrible jokes. As she looked at their faces, she realized this was family\u2014not one of blood and obligation, but of choice and presence. It was the day she learned that love could be loud, messy, and unconditional.\n\n4.\nA year into her job at the non-profit, a sullen teenager who hadn\u2019t said more than five words finally spoke. He described feeling like a \"ghost\" walking between his family's world and his school's. Shauna's breath caught. It was a feeling she knew from her own divorce\u2014the invisibility of transition. In that small, sterile office, she wasn't just a therapist; she was a witness who understood. This moment cemented her purpose: she was here to help others feel seen, just as she had longed to be.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on her morning walk. Otis was chasing a leaf near the Painted Ladies as the fog finally broke, revealing the downtown skyline in sharp morning light. A deep sense of peace settled in her bones\u2014not happiness, but a quiet, solid contentment. She was 43, standing in her city, with her dog, on her way to a job she loved. This life wasn\u2019t one she\u2019d inherited or fallen into; it was a life she had intentionally built, piece by painful, beautiful piece. It was hers."
