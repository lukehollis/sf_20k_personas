The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, she grew up in the back of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Balboa Street. They envisioned a future for her in medicine or law, a stable profession that would justify their sacrifices. Michelle, however, was quietly fascinated by the art of transformation, watching how a simple, kind gesture or a new haircut could change a person\u2019s entire demeanor.\n\nAfter high school, she placated her parents by enrolling at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration. It felt like a practical compromise, but her heart wasn't in it. The true turning point came when, instead of transferring to a four-year university, she used her savings to enroll in cosmetology school, specializing in esthetics. The decision caused a rift with her parents that took years to heal, but for Michelle, it was the first time she had truly chosen her own path.\n\nFor over a decade, she honed her craft at various high-end spas downtown, saving every dollar she could. Her marriage ended amicably but decisively when her ex-husband couldn\u2019t understand her ambition to be more than just an employee. The divorce solidified her resolve. At 38, she pooled her life savings and a small business loan to purchase a modest two-story building in the Inner Richmond, with a commercial space on the ground floor and a small apartment above.\n\nToday, at 43, Michelle is the proud owner of \u201cThe Bloom Room,\u201d a serene, one-woman skincare salon. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a steady rhythm of consultations, facials, and waxing appointments. Her clients are fiercely loyal, treating their sessions as part therapy, part skin rejuvenation. She knows the local bakery owner by name and gets her morning coffee from the caf\u00e9 on the corner. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of other small business owners and a few lifelong friends. Her dream of owning her own business is realized, and now she aspires to mentor a young esthetician, passing on the skills and independence she fought so hard to win. Michelle Lee didn\u2019t just build a business in San Francisco; she built her entire world in one small corner of it."
