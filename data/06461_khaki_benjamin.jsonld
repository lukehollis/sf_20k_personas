The son of Filipino immigrants, Benjamin grew up in the fog-draped hills of Daly City. His father, a retired Navy man, and his mother, a tireless administrative assistant, instilled in him a profound sense of obligation. They had sacrificed for his future, and he was determined to repay them with success.\n\nInitially, that success looked academic and abstract. He excelled at UC Berkeley, earning a graduate degree in Public Policy. He was fascinated by systems, by the grand architecture of urban life and governance. He envisioned a career shaping cities from a planner\u2019s office, a life of blueprints and macro-level impact.\n\nThe turning point was not a career opportunity, but a family crisis. His mother was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, plunging the family into the bewildering world of chronic illness. For two years, Benjamin became her primary advocate, navigating a labyrinth of specialists, insurance paperwork, and hospital corridors. In the midst of the chaos, one person became their anchor: a compassionate, unflappable medical social worker who helped them manage logistics, find support groups, and simply process their fear.\n\nWatching this social worker, Benjamin saw the impact he had craved\u2014not on a city map, but on the human heart. The experience reshaped him. Quietly, he set aside his public policy ambitions and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program.\n\nNow 34, Benjamin lives in a small apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; he lives three blocks from the UCSF Parnassus campus where he works. His days are a whirlwind of crisis intervention, discharge planning, and providing counsel to families at their most vulnerable. He walks to work in the morning fog and returns long after it has rolled back in, his mind heavy with the stories of his patients.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, centered on a few friends who understand the emotional toll of his work. He\u2019s traded the dream of designing cities for the tangible act of helping people navigate their own internal wreckage. His ultimate aspiration is to start a non-profit that provides free, dedicated support for the caregivers of chronically ill patients\u2014a tribute to the woman who first showed him what true impact looks like. Benjamin found his purpose not in the grand design, but in the quiet, essential work of human connection."
