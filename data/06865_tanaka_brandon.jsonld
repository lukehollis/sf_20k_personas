A third-generation Japanese-American, Brandon grew up in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. His parents, a pragmatic Muni driver and a meticulous bookkeeper, preached stability, a value inherited from grandparents who survived the internment camps.\n\nBrandon\u2019s path was supposed to follow that stable line. He enrolled at San Francisco State, vaguely pursuing a Kinesiology degree, but felt more at home playing bass in a garage band than sitting in lecture halls. The pivotal shift came when his beloved *bachan* (grandmother) was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. As her condition worsened, Brandon, feeling adrift in his studies, left college to become her primary caregiver. In the challenging routines of care, he discovered a profound sense of purpose that academia had never provided. It was a difficult, emotionally taxing education, but it was his.\n\nAfter her passing, Brandon formalized his calling, earning certifications to become a professional caregiver. For the past three years, he has been the live-in assistant to a reclusive, elderly author. His commute is a walk down a flight of stairs from his attic room. This arrangement solves San Francisco\u2019s impossible housing calculus but severely curtails his personal life. His days are a disciplined rhythm of administering medication, preparing meals, reading aloud, and offering quiet companionship.\n\nAt 30, his social connections are frayed. Old friends are consumed by careers and families, and romance feels like a distant luxury. His world has shrunk to his patient, his weekly video calls with his worried sister, and cherished solitary walks through the Presidio on his afternoons off. He carries the city of his birth within him\u2014the scent of eucalyptus, the clang of a cable car\u2014but experiences it from a solitary remove. Brandon\u2019s dream is to one day open his own small, culturally-sensitive board-and-care home, a place that offers the dignity he fought to give his grandmother. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration, nurtured in the silence of his unusual, dedicated life."
