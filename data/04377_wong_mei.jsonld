Her life story began not with the salty tang of the Bay, but with the humid air of a small village in Guangdong, China. The eldest of four, she finished her secondary schooling with distinction but saw no path forward beyond the fields. At 22, sponsored by an uncle in Chinatown, she arrived in San Francisco, clutching a bag filled with more hope than belongings.\n\nHer first decade was a blur of steam-filled kitchens, working 12-hour shifts in a dim sum parlor. There, she met a cook with kind eyes, married quickly, and had her son, David. The marriage was short-lived, leaving her a single mother in a city that demanded relentless hustle. The inconsistent hours and meager pay of restaurant work couldn\u2019t support a growing boy. A turning point came when a neighbor told her about a logistics warehouse hiring packers. The work was physically brutal, but the hours were steady. For the next twenty years, that warehouse became her universe.\n\nEvery box she scanned, every pallet she wrapped, was for David. She funneled her earnings into his education, her own aspirations shrinking until they fit entirely within his future. Her proudest moment was seeing him graduate from UC Berkeley with an engineering degree. Now, David works in tech, lives in a trendy Mission apartment, and calls her every Sunday.\n\nMei\u2019s current life is one of disciplined routine. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk across the street from her small, rent-stabilized apartment to the warehouse entrance before dawn. Her social connections are the small crew of lifers she works with, sharing jokes in a mix of Cantonese and English over lunch. San Francisco, for her, isn't postcard views; it's the rumble of early morning trucks, the clang of shipping containers, and the fog rolling over the nearby piers. Her dream is no longer for herself, but a simple hope for David\u2019s happiness and, perhaps one day, the quiet peace of tending to the orchids blooming on her windowsill without the ache in her back from a lifetime of lifting."

She counted it under the dim light of her tiny room, the smell of grease still clinging to her clothes. It wasn't the fortune she\u2019d imagined, but a stark calculation of survival. That night, she didn\u2019t cry. She just folded the bills neatly, understanding that this city wasn't built on dreams, but on the strength of your hands and the endurance of your back. It was her first lesson in pragmatism.\n\n2.\nDavid was five, his head nodding into his bowl of noodles at a corner table while she wrapped the last of the har gow. Seeing his small body slumped in exhaustion, waiting for her shift to end, was a blade to her heart. The chaotic kitchen was no place for a child\u2019s life to take root. The next day, she walked to the warehouse on 25th Street. The decision was not a choice, but a necessity, a silent vow that his childhood would have a stability that hers, and now hers again, lacked.\n\n3.\nShe remembers the day she bought David the thick, blue English-Chinese dictionary. It cost nearly a full day's wages, and she ate only plain congee for a week. He was eight. She watched him that evening, his small finger tracing the foreign characters, his brow furrowed in concentration at their small kitchen table. Her hands could lift boxes, she realized, so that his mind, with this tool, could build worlds she would never even see. Her hope wasn\u2019t for herself anymore; it was for him.\n\n4.\nThe Berkeley sun was warm on her face, but she barely felt it. All she could see was David in his dark blue robe against the bright green lawn, his name echoing from the speakers. As he crossed the stage, twenty years of lifting heavy boxes and wrapping pallets dissolved. The ache in her shoulders, the fatigue in her bones\u2014it all vanished, replaced by a joy so pure it left her breathless. This was the receipt for her life\u2019s work. For the first time, she felt her shoulders truly relax.\n\n5.\nIt's Sunday, just after 7 PM. She sits by the window, the fog blurring the lights of the shipyard cranes. The phone rings, and David\u2019s voice, clear and bright, fills her apartment with stories of code and new restaurants. She listens to the sounds of his world, so different from the familiar groan of the warehouse. His happiness is a warmth she feels through the line. This call is her weekly postcard from the life she built for him, and for her, it is more beautiful than any view of the bridge."
