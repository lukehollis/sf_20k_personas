The only child of immigrants from Punjab, India, she grew up in Fremont, where her parents\u2019 engineering careers provided stability but also a specific vision for her future. Priya, however, was drawn not to code but to people. She saw the subtle struggles of families in her own community and felt a calling to bridge gaps, not build circuits. This led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Social Work at San Francisco State University, a decision that initially worried her parents but one they grew to deeply respect.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s social services, working as a caseworker in the Tenderloin and the Mission District. These years were formative, cementing her belief that systemic support, not just individual intervention, was the key to lasting change. It was during a volunteer event that she met Michael Klein, a public school history teacher whose quiet idealism mirrored her own. They married and settled in the Inner Sunset, raising their daughter, Maya, on a foundation of shared values.\n\nThe key turning point in Priya's career came when she was promoted to Program Director for a city-wide Community Health Initiative. The role shifted her focus from direct client interaction to strategy, fundraising, and mentorship\u2014building the infrastructure to help thousands. Her daily routine now begins with a ride on the N Judah, a 4.8-mile journey that takes her from the fog-laced streets of her neighborhood to her bustling downtown office. Her days are a mix of strategic meetings, budget reviews, and calls with community partners, all aimed at securing resources for the city's most vulnerable youth.\n\nNow 48, Priya finds fulfillment in seeing her programs thrive. Her deepest hope is to create a sustainable model of care that will outlast her own career, ensuring future generations have the support they need. She dreams of a San Francisco that lives up to its progressive ideals for all its residents. On a personal level, she looks forward to traveling with Michael once Maya is off to college, but for now, her heart and her work remain firmly rooted in the city that shaped her."

Her father, an engineer to his core, simply shook his head. But it was her mother\u2019s quiet plea\u2014\u201cPriya, this work will break your heart\u201d\u2014that almost swayed her. In that moment, her own fear warred with a fierce, protective instinct for people she hadn't yet met. Saying \u201cI have to\u201d wasn\u2019t just a choice; it was the first time she defined strength on her own terms.\n\n2.\nIn a dim Tenderloin SRO, it wasn\u2019t the poverty that finally broke her, but a child\u2019s drawing. Taped to a stained wall was a crayon sketch of a big house with a yellow sun and a green yard, a world away from this single room. She saw her role not as helping this one child, but as fighting the system that drew those walls around her. That small piece of paper, full of impossible hope, cemented her mission to dismantle broken systems, not just patch them. This happened in her mid-20s.\n\n3.\nIt was a Saturday cleanup at Mission Dolores Park, and she was tired. She was explaining the endless cycle of casework to a fellow volunteer, a history teacher named Michael. He listened, his brow furrowed with a familiar frustration. He didn\u2019t offer easy platitudes. He just looked at her and said, \u201cSo what is the structural fix?\u201d In that question, she felt seen. It wasn\u2019t a spark of romance, but of profound recognition. Here was someone who saw the world, and its deep injustices, just as she did.\n\n4.\nThe first major grant for the youth shelter came through on a Tuesday afternoon. She was in her new, quiet office, a world away from the noisy hallways of the clinics. After the call, she didn't cheer. She put her head in her hands and felt the immense, terrifying weight of what they\u2019d done. This wasn't just a budget line; it was food, safety, and a chance for hundreds of kids. That moment, around age 40, shifted her from a helper into an architect of hope, a responsibility that thrills and haunts her still.\n\n5.\nJust last year, riding the N Judah home with Maya. The train lurched, and her daughter, then seventeen, looked past her at a man curled in a corner, shivering. Instead of looking away, Maya asked quietly, \u201cIs he someone your office could help, Mom?\u201d The question was so direct, so full of the empathy Priya had championed her whole life. In that foggy streetcar, seeing her own legacy reflected in her daughter\u2019s concerned eyes, Priya felt a surge of hope so powerful it almost brought her to tears."
