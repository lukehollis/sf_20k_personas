The daughter of hardworking Punjabi Sikh immigrants, her home life was filled with the scent of cardamom and the gentle rhythm of prayers, while her world outside was the burgeoning, practical-minded suburbia of Silicon Valley. Her parents, who\u2019d built a small but successful import business, envisioned a stable path for her: engineering, medicine, or at the very least, a solid business degree. To please them, Priya attended UC Davis, dutifully earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration, a degree that felt as foreign to her as a second language.\n\nHer first job, as a junior analyst at a consulting firm, was a spreadsheet-driven purgatory. The turning point came during a business trip to San Francisco. Escaping a conference, she stumbled into a tiny, experimental theater in the Mission. The raw, unfiltered creativity struck her like a lightning bolt. Within six months, she had quit her lucrative job, weathering a storm of parental disappointment, and moved into a cramped apartment with two roommates in the city.\n\nPriya started at the bottom, volunteering for a struggling arts non-profit, using her business knowledge to write grants and balance books. She discovered her true calling wasn't making art, but making art *happen*. She was a natural producer, a calming force who could coax a budget from a wealthy donor and then coordinate with a temperamental lighting designer.\n\nNow, at 44, Priya is the respected Event Manager for a prominent contemporary arts center in SoMa. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her devotion; she lives in a minimalist loft in the same converted warehouse as her venue. Her days are a whirlwind of artist liaisons, gala planning, and community outreach. Her social life is inextricably woven into her work, a tapestry of gallery openings, artist dinners, and benefit concerts. While her parents now boast of their \"arts director\" daughter, she feels her truest family is the eclectic, passionate community she has cultivated. Priya\u2019s dream is to one day launch a city-wide festival celebrating emerging Bay Area artists, a permanent monument to the city that allowed her to build a life on her own terms, bridging the worlds of commerce and creation."
