Raised in a manicured suburb of Akron, Ohio, by a pragmatic bank manager father and a doting mother, David\u2019s path was paved with practicality. His family valued stability over passion, so when he enrolled at Ohio State, his choice of an Economics degree was met with resounding approval. He was destined for a sensible corporate life, a future as predictable as the Midwest seasons.\n\nThe turning point came during a post-graduate marketing internship in Chicago. While his days were spent analyzing data for a soulless soda conglomerate, his firm took on a pro-bono client: a small, struggling avant-garde theater. Tasked with their campaign, David discovered a dormant talent. He wasn't just good at marketing art; he was alive doing it. The thrill of helping a daring play sell out its short run eclipsed any satisfaction he found in corporate spreadsheets. Within six months, he quit, packed his car, and drove west, chasing a vague notion that San Francisco was where creativity was currency.\n\nHis early years in the city were a patchwork of freelance gigs and barista jobs. He slowly built a reputation in the arts community, known for his sharp strategies and genuine passion. Now, at 35, David is a sought-after freelance marketing specialist for the Bay Area's independent arts scene.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is a point of pride; he runs his campaigns from his meticulously organized SoMa live-work loft, overlooking a street that hums with a mix of tech start-ups and hidden artist studios. His days are a disciplined blend of client calls, digital strategy sessions, and late-night visits to gallery openings or theater rehearsals\u2014not as a socialite, but as a devoted patron and partner. His social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of the artists, curators, and playwrights whose work he champions.\n\nDavid doesn't dream of wealth. He dreams of sustainability for the artists he serves. His ultimate aspiration is to launch a grant-funded arts incubator, a space that would provide marketing and business resources to emerging talents. He sees himself as a guardian of San Francisco\u2019s creative soul, using the tools of the modern world to protect and amplify the city's most vital, and often most vulnerable, voices."
