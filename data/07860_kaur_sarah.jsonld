The only daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who ran a small almond farm, her childhood was defined by the rhythm of harvests, the warmth of the local gurdwara, and her parents' unwavering belief in education as the ultimate form of empowerment. They saw her sharp, analytical mind and pushed her not towards farming, but towards a world of books and ideas they had only dreamed of.\n\nHer journey led her to UC Berkeley, where the cultural and economic chasms between her hometown and the Bay Area struck her profoundly. A pivotal internship with a tenants' rights organization in Oakland changed her trajectory forever. Witnessing a family lose their home to a no-fault eviction transformed abstract policy into a human crisis. This ignited a fire in her, leading her to pursue a Master of Public Policy, determined to understand and dismantle the systemic barriers that kept people like that family from thriving.\n\nNow 39, Sarah is a Senior Policy Analyst for the City of San Francisco, specializing in the labyrinthine world of housing policy. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern work-from-home era, her light-filled Hayes Valley condo serving as both home and office. Her days are a blur of data analysis, dense legislative briefs, and intense Zoom meetings with city supervisors and community stakeholders.\n\nHer personal life is quiet but fulfilling. Long-term relationships have been casualties of her demanding career, but she maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school who share her passion for public service. Weekends often involve driving down to visit her aging parents in the valley, a journey that grounds her and reminds her of her roots.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of both love and professional responsibility. On her evening walks, she sees the direct consequences of the policies she debates daily\u2014the unhoused seeking shelter, the new luxury towers casting long shadows over older buildings. Her ultimate dream is not a promotion, but to author a piece of legislation that creates thousands of units of truly affordable housing, a tangible legacy in the city she has chosen to serve. She aspires to help build a San Francisco that lives up to its promise, a place her parents would be proud she helped shape."
