His parents, immigrants who built a life through tireless work, hoped he would pursue a stable profession like medicine or law. Liam, however, was drawn to form and structure in a different way. He rebelled quietly, not with teenage angst, but with an application to art school. He earned a Master of Fine Arts in Sculpture, seeing the world as a series of materials to be shaped and balanced.\n\nThe reality of a sculptor's income in the Bay Area was a harsh awakening. To support his art, Liam began designing websites for local businesses, discovering an unexpected affinity for the logic and elegance of code. He found that building a clean backend was not so different from constructing an armature for a large-scale installation. This pivot became his career. He was a natural, a creative thinker in a field that often prized pure logic. He rose quickly through the ranks during the post-bust tech recovery, his unique perspective making him an exceptional manager who could bridge the gap between creative engineers and product goals.\n\nNow, as a Director of Engineering, Liam lives a life his parents would deem successful, yet one they don\u2019t fully understand. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his home office in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, strategic planning, and mentoring his team. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a few old friends from his art school days and a couple of trusted colleagues. A long-term relationship ended a year ago, leaving him with more time for introspection.\n\nEach morning, Liam runs through the quiet streets of his neighborhood, the crisp air a stark contrast to the digital world he commands. He feels a deep, unwavering connection to San Francisco, a city that holds both his family\u2019s history and his own reinvention. His aspiration is no longer just to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a way to merge his two selves. He dreams of funding a public art project using technology or creating an open-source tool for digital artists, finally sculpting the perfect synthesis of his life\u2019s disparate materials."
