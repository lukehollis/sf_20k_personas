            "value": "Eleanor Vance lives inside her work, quite literally. Her home is The Voss Foundation, a preserved Pacific Heights Victorian that houses a formidable collection of mid-century abstract expressionist art. Her commute is a walk down a grand, creaking staircase from her third-floor apartment to the second-floor gallery space.\n\nBorn in Scarsdale, New York, to a family of litigators, Eleanor was the quiet, artistic black sheep. While her parents discussed torts over dinner, she would lose herself in art books, tracing the lines of a Franz Kline with her finger. Her escape was a degree in Art History from Columbia, followed by a prestigious graduate program at The Courtauld Institute in London. Her early career was a blur of prestigious but impersonal roles at behemoths like the MoMA and Tate Modern, where she felt more like a cog than a custodian of stories.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. Burnt out and disillusioned, she was offered the inaugural curatorship of the newly established Voss Foundation in San Francisco. The eccentric late heiress, Annelise Voss, had stipulated that the curator must live on-site to truly \"inhabit the collection's spirit.\" For Eleanor, it was a lifeline.\n\nShe has now spent nearly fifteen years in the house. Her daily routine is a quiet ritual: waking to the fog rolling past her bay window, checking the gallery\u2019s climate controls, spending afternoons researching the largely-forgotten female artists Annelise championed, and hosting intimate tours for donors and academics. Her social life is as curated as her exhibitions\u2014small dinners with artists, historians, and the occasional tech patron she's trying to cultivate for the foundation's endowment. A long-term relationship ended years ago, unable to compete with her devotion to the house and its legacy.\n\nEleanor's connection to San Francisco is filtered through the panes of the Voss house. She loves the city\u2019s layered history, seeing it mirrored in the canvases she protects. Her dream is two-fold: to secure the foundation\u2019s future and to finally write the definitive book on Annelise Voss's collection, giving its overlooked artists their due. She seeks not fame, but permanence\u2014for the art, and for the quiet, meaningful life she has built around it."
