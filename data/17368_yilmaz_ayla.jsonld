The only child of Turkish immigrants, she grew up amidst the clatter of porcelain and the scent of cardamom in her family\u2019s small Sacramento caf\u00e9. Her parents, hardworking and pragmatic, built a life on hospitality and tangible goods. Ayla, however, was fascinated by the invisible forces that shaped their neighborhood.\n\nThe key turning point came when she was 15. A city redevelopment plan threatened a block of small businesses, including her parents\u2019 caf\u00e9. Ayla watched them navigate a bewildering maze of public hearings and opaque planning documents. While their cafe ultimately survived, the experience ignited a fire in her. She saw how policy, written in sterile jargon miles away, could intimately impact the lives and livelihoods of a community. This realization set her on a direct path.\n\nShe excelled at UC Davis, then pursued a Master\u2019s in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, focusing on equitable urban development. Graduating with honors, she accepted a position as an Urban Planning Consultant, trading the academic for the applied. Now, at 24, her life is one of structured purpose. She lives in a modest but bright apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood she chose for its walkability and vibrant mix of residents.\n\nHer mornings start with Turkish coffee, a ritual connecting her to her parents, before she catches the Muni Metro for the 2.8-mile commute downtown. Her days are spent analyzing data and drafting reports that advise developers and city agencies on creating more human-centered projects. Evenings are for connection: a run through Golden Gate Park, dinner with her close-knit circle of grad school friends, or attending a local community board meeting, listening intently.\n\nAyla\u2019s ambition is clear: she wants to move from consulting to a position within the SF Planning Department. Her dream isn\u2019t about power, but about access\u2014to be the person in the room who remembers the faces of the shopkeepers and residents, ensuring San Francisco\u2019s future is built for everyone, not just for those who can afford the view."

She would listen to her father\u2019s easy laugh as he poured coffee for regulars, their stories weaving into the air. It wasn't just a caf\u00e9; it was a living room for the neighborhood. This feeling of shared space, of simple belonging, became the foundation of everything she would later fight to protect. It was her first, truest definition of community.\n\n2.\nShe was fifteen when she found her father at their kitchen table, buried in official-looking envelopes. His shoulders, usually so broad, were slumped in defeat over a zoning notice. The city\u2019s sterile language felt like a physical threat against their warm, vibrant caf\u00e9. A cold anger bloomed in her chest, replacing the fear. It was the moment she realized that invisible lines drawn on a map could break a person\u2019s spirit. She vowed then that one day, she would understand that language and fight back.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-two, during a guest lecture at Berkeley, a retired city planner spoke. She didn't talk about grand designs, but about a small park she\u2019d saved by finding a loophole in an old water-use ordinance. The planner\u2019s eyes lit up describing the fight. For Ayla, it was an epiphany. Policy wasn't just a defensive shield; it could be a creative tool for good. It wasn\u2019t about stopping things, but about building them better. Her ambition sharpened from advocacy to actively shaping the city from within.\n\n4.\nHer first big project meeting, just last year at age twenty-three. She presented her community impact report, full of residents' concerns about shadows and displacement. The developer glanced at it, nodded politely, and then turned to the architect to discuss the profit margins on the penthouse units. The casual dismissal landed like a stone in her gut. That day, she knew consulting wasn\u2019t enough. She didn\u2019t want to just advise; she needed to be one of the people in the room making the final decision.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, at a Hayes Valley neighborhood board meeting, she listened to an elderly woman speak passionately about the bench where she\u2019d met her husband 50 years ago, now slated for removal. In the woman\u2019s plea, Ayla heard her own parents\u2019 voices from a decade before. It wasn't about a bench; it was about memory, dignity, and a city that remembers its people. Sitting there quietly in the back, her purpose felt clearer than ever. This was the work. This was the reason she was here."
