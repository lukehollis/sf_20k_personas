A third-generation Japanese American, she was raised in the serene, orderly suburbs of San Jose by parents who valued security above all else. Her father, a civil engineer, and her mother, a librarian, had instilled in her the virtues of a practical path. Sarah complied, suppressing her own artistic inclinations. She earned a Master\u2019s in Library Science, following her mother\u2019s footsteps into a decade-long career that was stable, predictable, and profoundly unfulfilling.\n\nThe turning point came at age 35, after her mother's passing. While clearing out her mother\u2019s home, Sarah discovered a hidden box filled with delicate watercolor paintings and sketchbooks\u2014a secret artistic life her mother had never shared. It was a posthumous permission slip. Within a year, Sarah quit her job, cashed in her savings, and enrolled in a program to get her teaching credential with an authorization in art.\n\nShe found her true calling not in creating her own art, but in nurturing it in others. For the past fifteen years, she has been an art teacher at a public high school in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. To solve the city\u2019s brutal commute, she moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment directly across the street from the school, making her commute a 30-second walk.\n\nHer days are steeped in the scent of turpentine and wet clay. Sarah is often the first to arrive and the last to leave, her classroom a sanctuary for students navigating the turbulence of adolescence. She is single, her life-partner having become her profession; her students are her legacy. Her social life is a small, warm circle of fellow teachers and the proprietor of the local art supply store on Clement Street.\n\nWeekends are for herself: long walks through Golden Gate Park, visits to the de Young Museum, and tending to the small collection of bonsai trees on her windowsill. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer of her own gallery show, but of seeing her students\u2019 work displayed. Her greatest hope is to live long enough to see one of them hang a piece in a museum, a vicarious fulfillment of a passion she so bravely chose to reclaim."
