Raised in the Sacramento suburbs, he was the son of a general contractor who instilled in him a fluency with tools that felt more natural than academic theory. Liam enrolled in community college with a vague notion of studying engineering, but his path was cut short when his father suffered a debilitating back injury. At 20, Liam dropped out to take over the family\u2019s handyman jobs, trading textbooks for a tool belt to keep his family afloat.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco a decade ago, following a graphic designer girlfriend with dreams bigger than his own. The relationship dissolved under the city\u2019s financial pressures, but Liam, surprisingly, stayed. He found he didn\u2019t miss the suburbs. After a series of odd jobs, he landed a position in facilities management, his practical skills finally giving him a stable foothold. The true turning point was securing his current role: a live-in Building Services Technician for a grand, pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. His commute is a walk down the servant\u2019s stairs to the basement workshop.\n\nLiam is the building\u2019s quiet confessor. He has fixed leaky faucets for tech CEOs crying over a breakup and reset breakers for elderly tenants who share stories of the city\u2019s past. He\u2019s cordial with everyone but close to few, his role placing him in a unique social space\u2014neither peer nor servant. His evenings are his own, often spent reading history paperbacks in his small basement apartment or walking down to a Polk Street dive bar for a solitary beer.\n\nAt 37, Liam feels a sense of grounded purpose but also a quiet yearning. He is an integral part of a world he can\u2019t fully afford to live in. His dream isn\u2019t wealth, but ownership\u2014a small HVAC business, maybe, or a little house with a garage workshop somewhere just outside the city. For now, he finds satisfaction in his work, in being the man who knows the secrets of the building\u2019s bones. He is a steward of a small piece of San Francisco, a custodian of the quiet machinery that allows others to dream."
