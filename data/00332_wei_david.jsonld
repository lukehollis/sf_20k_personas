The only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond, David grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and the constant hum of the N Judah streetcar. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, envisioned a straightforward path for him: a stable, lucrative career as an engineer or doctor. David initially tried to oblige, enrolling in a pre-med program at UC Berkeley. However, the sterile competition of the sciences left him feeling hollow.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year when his father suffered a major stroke. Navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system, David found the most profound support not from the physicians, but from the hospital\u2019s social worker\u2014a compassionate woman who helped his family manage their fear and grief. This experience was a revelation. He changed his major and, after graduating, earned a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nDavid built his career in the demanding world of hospital-based social work, specializing in palliative and end-of-life care. For two decades, he has been a steadying presence for families facing their most difficult moments. His own life has had its share of fractures; a marriage ended amicably a few years ago, strained by the emotional weight of his profession. He now co-parents his teenage daughter, Maya, who lives with her mother in Marin.\n\nToday, at 49, David\u2019s life is contained within his quiet Inner Sunset condo. The pandemic shifted his practice to telehealth, and he never went back, embracing the 0.0-mile commute. His days are a disciplined routine of virtual sessions with patients, punctuated by long walks in Golden Gate Park to clear his head. In the evenings, he finds solace in cooking complex Sichuan dishes from his mother's old recipes and listening to his collection of jazz vinyl. He feels like a relic of a different San Francisco, a city less concerned with IPOs and more with community. His aspirations are not grand; he hopes to mentor younger social workers, perhaps travel with Maya after she graduates, and continue to find meaning in the quiet, essential work of helping others find peace."

The doctors spoke in clinical acronyms, but it was the social worker, a kind woman named Linda, who brought them lukewarm tea in styrofoam cups. She didn\u2019t offer false hope, just sat with them, absorbing their panic into her quiet presence. In that moment, watching her navigate his family\u2019s fear with such grace, David understood what real healing was. It wasn't science; it was compassionate witness. His entire future course corrected itself.\n\n2.  He\u2019s eight years old, hiding behind a barrel of dried shiitake mushrooms in his parents\u2019 Richmond district store. The air is thick with the earthy scent of ginseng and the constant, rhythmic rumble of the N Judah passing outside. He watches his father use an abacus, the wooden beads clicking a familiar tune. This was his San Francisco\u2014not a postcard, but a mosaic of quiet transactions and shared language. It\u2019s the feeling of belonging he chases now when he cooks, a connection to a legacy that feels increasingly rare.\n\n3.  Early in his career, he sat with an elderly jazz musician who was actively dying. The family was distraught, but the man whispered just one request: to hear John Coltrane's \"Naima.\" David found a portable player and as the saxophone filled the sterile room, a profound calm settled over the man. It taught David that his job wasn't to fight death, but to help curate peace\u2014to honor the small, sacred rituals that make a life whole. He started his own vinyl collection the following month.\n\n4.  He remembers Maya, maybe ten years old, on the steep drum bridge at the Japanese Tea Garden. \u201cDoes your work make you sad, Baba?\u201d she asked, her small hand gripping his. He paused, the scent of damp earth and pine around them. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said honestly, \u201cbut helping people through the sadness makes it worth it.\u201d In her clear, accepting gaze, he felt not the weight of his job, but the anchor of her love. It became a reason to keep his heart from closing completely.\n\n5.  His first night alone in the Inner Sunset condo, the unpacked boxes stood like ghosts. The silence was an accusation. He\u2019d just had the amicable, heartbreaking conversation with his now ex-wife, acknowledging the pieces of him his profession had claimed, pieces he couldn't give her. He pulled out a Miles Davis record, not for joy, but for company. As the trumpet filled the void, he accepted the fracture. It was the price of his calling, a quiet sorrow he would learn to carry alone."
