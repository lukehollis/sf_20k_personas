The only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond, David grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and the constant hum of the N Judah streetcar. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, envisioned a straightforward path for him: a stable, lucrative career as an engineer or doctor. David initially tried to oblige, enrolling in a pre-med program at UC Berkeley. However, the sterile competition of the sciences left him feeling hollow.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year when his father suffered a major stroke. Navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system, David found the most profound support not from the physicians, but from the hospital\u2019s social worker\u2014a compassionate woman who helped his family manage their fear and grief. This experience was a revelation. He changed his major and, after graduating, earned a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nDavid built his career in the demanding world of hospital-based social work, specializing in palliative and end-of-life care. For two decades, he has been a steadying presence for families facing their most difficult moments. His own life has had its share of fractures; a marriage ended amicably a few years ago, strained by the emotional weight of his profession. He now co-parents his teenage daughter, Maya, who lives with her mother in Marin.\n\nToday, at 49, David\u2019s life is contained within his quiet Inner Sunset condo. The pandemic shifted his practice to telehealth, and he never went back, embracing the 0.0-mile commute. His days are a disciplined routine of virtual sessions with patients, punctuated by long walks in Golden Gate Park to clear his head. In the evenings, he finds solace in cooking complex Sichuan dishes from his mother's old recipes and listening to his collection of jazz vinyl. He feels like a relic of a different San Francisco, a city less concerned with IPOs and more with community. His aspirations are not grand; he hopes to mentor younger social workers, perhaps travel with Maya after she graduates, and continue to find meaning in the quiet, essential work of helping others find peace."
