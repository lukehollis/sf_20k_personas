Passed through the California foster care system since infancy, he has no connection to a specific race or ethnicity; he is simply a product of his environment. His early life was a blur of temporary homes and indifferent schools, leaving him with a deep-seated pragmatism and an education scraped together from observation rather than textbooks. He aged out of the system at eighteen with a worn duffel bag and a profound sense of being utterly on his own.\n\nHis salvation came in the form of steam and steel. Desperate for work, he took a job as a dishwasher in a bustling SoMa bistro. The kitchen\u2019s chaotic ballet of heat, noise, and synchronized movement was the first stable, predictable system he had ever known. He watched, learned, and worked tirelessly, graduating from the dish pit to peeling vegetables, then to the fry station. The head chef, a hardened woman who valued grit over pedigree, saw his potential and mentored him. For Wei, learning how to perfectly sear a scallop was more valuable than any diploma. The kitchen became his education, the line his profession.\n\nWei\u2019s entire world exists within a five-block radius. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his monastic SRO room in the Tenderloin to the back door of the restaurant. His daily routine is a loop: wake, prep, service, clean, sleep. The city isn\u2019t the Golden Gate Bridge or cable cars to him; it\u2019s the pre-dawn quiet of his walk to work, the grimy alley behind the kitchen, and the faces of the kitchen crew who have become his surrogate family. They share cigarettes on breaks, complain about difficult customers, and cover for each other without a word.\n\nThough his current life is about survival, Wei nurtures quiet aspirations. He dreams of becoming a sous chef, of earning enough respect to create a special on the menu. More fundamentally, he fantasizes about renting a small studio apartment in the Richmond district, one with a real kitchen where he could cook for himself on his day off. His hope isn't for fame or fortune, but for the one thing he's never had: a place to call his own, built with the skill of his own two hands."

He didn't pack sentimental things; he packed for efficiency. Two pairs of jeans, a few shirts, toothbrush. He had learned that attachments were liabilities. The act wasn't sad, just a quiet, practiced procedure. That moment, zipping the bag closed while a social worker waited, cemented a core piece of his identity: you don't own things, you just steward them for a while. It was the birth of his pragmatism.\n\n2.\nHis eighteenth birthday wasn't a celebration; it was a transaction. The social worker handed him his final paperwork in a manila envelope. When the door to the county office clicked shut behind him, the street noise of San Francisco fell away. For a full minute, he stood there feeling the terrifying weight of absolute solitude. It wasn't freedom, but a profound emptiness. That moment forged his hardened self-reliance, the deep-seated knowledge that from that point on, his survival was entirely his own responsibility.\n\n3.\nMonths into his dishwashing job, Chef Anya pulled him from the steam and sulphur of the pit. She placed a crate of potatoes in front of him. \"Peel,\" she grunted. He fumbled, wasting flesh. She didn't yell. She took the peeler, put her hand over his, and guided his wrist in a swift, economical motion. \"Don't fight it. Work with it.\" It was the first time an adult had ever taught him a practical skill with such focused intent. In that moment, he wasn't a foster kid; he was a student.\n\n4.\nDuring a brutal Friday night service, he fired a steak to medium-rare instead of medium-well. The ticket was a VIP. He saw the flash of anger in Chef Anya's eyes and braced for the end. Instead, Miguel, the grill cook next to him, silently slid the steak off the plate and threw a new one on, catching the Chef\u2019s eye with a nearly imperceptible nod. No one said a word. The silent, seamless act of support was overwhelming. That night, he learned what family was: the unspoken pact of covering for each other in the fire.\n\n5.\nOn a rare day off, he walked through the Richmond district as the fog rolled in. He smelled garlic and roasting chicken and saw, through a ground-floor apartment window, a small family moving around a brightly lit kitchen. The scene was so simple, so warm, so impossibly distant from his SRO room. It wasn't envy he felt, but a clear, sharp pang of longing that solidified his ambition. His dream wasn't about being a chef anymore; it was about earning that window, that warmth, that small kitchen of his own."
