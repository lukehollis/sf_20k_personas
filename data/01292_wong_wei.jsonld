Passed through the California foster care system since infancy, he has no connection to a specific race or ethnicity; he is simply a product of his environment. His early life was a blur of temporary homes and indifferent schools, leaving him with a deep-seated pragmatism and an education scraped together from observation rather than textbooks. He aged out of the system at eighteen with a worn duffel bag and a profound sense of being utterly on his own.\n\nHis salvation came in the form of steam and steel. Desperate for work, he took a job as a dishwasher in a bustling SoMa bistro. The kitchen\u2019s chaotic ballet of heat, noise, and synchronized movement was the first stable, predictable system he had ever known. He watched, learned, and worked tirelessly, graduating from the dish pit to peeling vegetables, then to the fry station. The head chef, a hardened woman who valued grit over pedigree, saw his potential and mentored him. For Wei, learning how to perfectly sear a scallop was more valuable than any diploma. The kitchen became his education, the line his profession.\n\nWei\u2019s entire world exists within a five-block radius. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his monastic SRO room in the Tenderloin to the back door of the restaurant. His daily routine is a loop: wake, prep, service, clean, sleep. The city isn\u2019t the Golden Gate Bridge or cable cars to him; it\u2019s the pre-dawn quiet of his walk to work, the grimy alley behind the kitchen, and the faces of the kitchen crew who have become his surrogate family. They share cigarettes on breaks, complain about difficult customers, and cover for each other without a word.\n\nThough his current life is about survival, Wei nurtures quiet aspirations. He dreams of becoming a sous chef, of earning enough respect to create a special on the menu. More fundamentally, he fantasizes about renting a small studio apartment in the Richmond district, one with a real kitchen where he could cook for himself on his day off. His hope isn't for fame or fortune, but for the one thing he's never had: a place to call his own, built with the skill of his own two hands."
