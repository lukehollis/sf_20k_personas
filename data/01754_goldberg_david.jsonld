Adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish-American couple from Palo Alto, he grew up surrounded by the burgeoning energy of Silicon Valley and the warm traditions of a culture that was not his by birth, but entirely his by upbringing. This duality\u2014celebrating Hanukkah while quietly curious about Chuseok\u2014became a defining thread of his life. His adoptive father, an early engineer at Apple, instilled in him a respect for elegant systems and logical processes.\n\nInitially rebelling against the pull of technology, David pursued a history degree at UC Berkeley, fascinated by the narratives that shape identity. However, the pragmatic need for a stable career led him to a Stanford MBA. He found his professional calling not in coding or sales, but in operations. David became the person who brought order to the brilliant chaos of startups, designing the internal architecture that allowed innovation to flourish. He thrived during the dot-com boom, weathered its bust, and learned invaluable lessons about sustainability and resilience.\n\nA key turning point came in his late 30s during a trip to Seoul. He didn\u2019t search for his birth family, but instead immersed himself in the culture, discovering a part of himself he\u2019d only ever read about. The experience solidified his identity not as a man caught between two worlds, but as a resident of both. Around this time, a demanding career contributed to the amicable end of his marriage, leaving him introspective and more focused on his close-knit circle of friends.\n\nNow, at 50, David\u2019s life is one of disciplined contentment. He works from his meticulously organized Cole Valley flat, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his espresso machine to his standing desk. His days are punctuated by walks through the Sutro Cloud Forest and coffee from his favorite local cafe. He loves San Francisco for its quiet acceptance of complex identities like his. His aspirations have shifted from career advancement to personal fulfillment: mentoring young Asian-Americans in tech, perfecting his mother\u2019s brisket and his own kimchi recipe, and perhaps one day, returning to Seoul not as a tourist, but as a visitor who feels, finally, like he\u2019s coming home."
