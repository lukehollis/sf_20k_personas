Adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish-American couple from Palo Alto, he grew up surrounded by the burgeoning energy of Silicon Valley and the warm traditions of a culture that was not his by birth, but entirely his by upbringing. This duality\u2014celebrating Hanukkah while quietly curious about Chuseok\u2014became a defining thread of his life. His adoptive father, an early engineer at Apple, instilled in him a respect for elegant systems and logical processes.\n\nInitially rebelling against the pull of technology, David pursued a history degree at UC Berkeley, fascinated by the narratives that shape identity. However, the pragmatic need for a stable career led him to a Stanford MBA. He found his professional calling not in coding or sales, but in operations. David became the person who brought order to the brilliant chaos of startups, designing the internal architecture that allowed innovation to flourish. He thrived during the dot-com boom, weathered its bust, and learned invaluable lessons about sustainability and resilience.\n\nA key turning point came in his late 30s during a trip to Seoul. He didn\u2019t search for his birth family, but instead immersed himself in the culture, discovering a part of himself he\u2019d only ever read about. The experience solidified his identity not as a man caught between two worlds, but as a resident of both. Around this time, a demanding career contributed to the amicable end of his marriage, leaving him introspective and more focused on his close-knit circle of friends.\n\nNow, at 50, David\u2019s life is one of disciplined contentment. He works from his meticulously organized Cole Valley flat, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his espresso machine to his standing desk. His days are punctuated by walks through the Sutro Cloud Forest and coffee from his favorite local cafe. He loves San Francisco for its quiet acceptance of complex identities like his. His aspirations have shifted from career advancement to personal fulfillment: mentoring young Asian-Americans in tech, perfecting his mother\u2019s brisket and his own kimchi recipe, and perhaps one day, returning to Seoul not as a tourist, but as a visitor who feels, finally, like he\u2019s coming home."

Later that night, flipping through an encyclopedia, he saw a photo of a family bowing during Chuseok. A quiet pang of curiosity hit him\u2014not sadness, just a question. It was the first time he understood his life was a story with two beautiful, separate beginnings. This feeling became the blueprint for his identity: a complex structure he would spend his life understanding.\n\n2.\nThe year was 2001. His startup\u2019s office, once electric with ringing phones and frantic coding, was silent. David was the last one there, methodically packing the final server into a box. He wasn\u2019t sad, but profoundly sobered. He saw the ghost of brilliant chaos reduced to neat, stackable squares. That day, he learned that true, elegant systems aren't just built for growth, but for resilience. It was a lesson in stability that anchored the rest of his career, prioritizing sustainable order over explosive, fragile hype.\n\n3.\nAt 38, standing in Gwangjang Market in Seoul, the smell hit him first: a sharp, funky, deeply earthy aroma of fermenting kimchi. It was a scent he'd only known from his own kitchen attempts. But here, it was the air itself. In that moment, surrounded by the loud, joyful chaos, a piece of him he\u2019d only theorized about became real. He wasn't a tourist observing a culture; he was breathing in a part of his own history. It was a quiet, internal homecoming.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the first walk through the Sutro Cloud Forest after his divorce papers were signed. He was 42. The fog was so thick it swallowed sound, wrapping the eucalyptus trees in a soft, grey blanket. In that profound quiet, he didn't feel lonely, but peacefully contained. He realized San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a city; it was a mood that matched his own. It held complexity without judgment. That day, standing in the mist, his Cole Valley flat truly became home.\n\n5.\nHe was 45, having coffee with a young Korean-American engineer he was mentoring. The young man wasn\u2019t asking about funding rounds, but about feeling invisible in meetings. David saw a flicker of his own past. Sharing his story\u2014the adoptee, the history major, the Jew from Palo Alto\u2014he saw understanding in the young man's eyes. In that instant, his complex identity stopped being a private puzzle and became his greatest asset: a bridge for someone else to cross. His purpose shifted from building systems to building people."
