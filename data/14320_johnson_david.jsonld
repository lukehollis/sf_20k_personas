Born on a US military base in Seoul to a Korean mother and a white American father, his last name often preceded him with assumptions his face would then contradict. His family settled in a working-class Bay Area suburb, where David learned to navigate cultural divides with a quiet diligence. His father, a stern disciplinarian, preached self-reliance, while his mother instilled a deep-seated respect for education as the ultimate equalizer. This dual upbringing fueled a powerful ambition: to build a life so secure, so unequivocally successful, that no one could question where he belonged.\n\nHis path was methodical. A state university degree led to a junior analyst position at a traditional commercial real estate firm in the 90s. While he excelled, he found the industry stagnant. The key turning point came during the dot-com bubble's aftermath; while others saw ruin, David saw a blueprint. He realized technology wasn't just for software companies\u2014it would eventually devour and reshape every legacy industry, including property. This conviction propelled him to pursue an MBA with a real estate focus, positioning himself at the intersection of brick-and-mortar assets and digital innovation.\n\nToday, David is a Managing Partner at a leading PropTech venture capital fund. His Pacific Heights condo, a sleek, minimalist space with panoramic views, is a testament to his success. His days are a disciplined blur of Uber rides to his Financial District office, back-to-back pitches from aspiring founders, and strategic board meetings. Divorced for nearly a decade, his work is his primary relationship, though he maintains a close, if long-distance, bond with his daughter studying architecture on the East Coast.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both appreciative and analytical. He loves the city's relentless drive but sees its challenges\u2014from housing to transit\u2014as investment theses. His aspirations are no longer just about personal wealth; he dreams of funding the unicorn that fundamentally solves an urban living problem, cementing his legacy not as a man from two worlds, but as a man who helped build the next one."

His mother placed her hands over his. \"This,\" she said, her accent a gentle but firm counterpoint to the suburban quiet, \"this is how you answer them.\" He knew she wasn't just talking about the kids who pulled their eyes wide at him, or the teachers who called him Johnson and expected someone else. In that moment, education became both a shield and a sword, an absolute he would wield for the rest of his life.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001, and David was walking through a desolate SoMa. The \"For Lease\" signs were tombstones. But where his colleagues saw a graveyard, he saw potential energy. He looked at the empty brick-and-beam offices, the ghosts of ambition, and pictured them not as failures, but as a blueprint. Technology wasn't gone; it was just waiting for the right key to unlock the right door. He knew then that he would be the one to help forge that key for the physical world.\n\n3.\nThe first night in the Pacific Heights condo, he didn\u2019t unpack. He just stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the lights of the city glitter below. The silence was absolute. For a boy from a loud, striving suburb, whose life had been a constant climb, this quiet was the prize. It was the sound of having arrived, of finally building a fortress so high that no one could question his place inside it. The view wasn't just a view; it was proof.\n\n4.\nHis daughter, home from college last summer, stood beside him on the balcony. She pointed toward the Transamerica Pyramid. \"Elegant, but dated,\" she said, her architect's eye already seeing the city's next evolution. He felt a profound sense of pride mixed with a familiar, paternal ache of distance. He saw his own analytical drive, his need to understand and build, refined into her art. In her, his legacy already felt more real and more important than any venture fund.\n\n5.\nJust last month, a founder was pitching him. She was young, hungry, with a desperate intelligence he recognized from his own past. Her idea\u2014a modular housing solution\u2014was audacious. As she spoke, David didn't just hear a deck; he heard an answer to the city\u2019s endemic problem. He felt that old, familiar spark, not of personal ambition, but of purpose. He realized his money wasn't just capital; it was the ultimate equalizer his mother had always preached about."
