Her mother, a first-generation immigrant from Taiwan who worked tirelessly running a small bakery, and her father, an African American born and raised in the Bay Area who drove a Muni bus, instilled in Mei a deep appreciation for hard work and community. They weren't wealthy, but the apartment was filled with love, the aroma of freshly baked goods, and the rumble of the L-Taraval line, a constant reminder of the city\u2019s rhythm.\n\nMei was a diligent student, driven by a desire to understand the struggles she saw around her \u2013 the language barriers faced by her mother\u2019s customers, the housing insecurity many of her father\u2019s riders experienced. This led her to San Francisco State University, where she pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work. It wasn't glamorous, but it felt authentic. She interned at various community centers, finding her calling in connecting people with the resources they desperately needed.\n\nA pivotal moment came during an internship at a youth center in the Mission District. She worked with a teenage girl navigating homelessness and substance abuse, witnessing firsthand the systemic barriers that trapped vulnerable individuals. This experience solidified her commitment to social justice and fueled her determination to be a part of the solution.\n\nUpon graduation, Mei landed a job as a Case Manager at a non-profit focused on providing support to low-income families in the Tenderloin. Her days are a whirlwind of client meetings, navigating complex bureaucracies, and advocating for basic necessities like housing, healthcare, and educational support. Her income of $62,000 is tight in San Francisco, but the fulfillment she derives from her work outweighs, for now, the financial strain.\n\nHer social circle is a blend of college friends from diverse backgrounds and colleagues who share her passion. She finds solace and connection in shared meals, walks along the Embarcadero, and attending community events focused on social good.\n\nMei\u2019s daily routine is dictated by the needs of her clients. She walks the short distance to her office, the cool morning air a stark contrast to the often-heated conversations she engages in throughout the day. Her evenings are spent catching up on paperwork, preparing meals for the week, and sometimes, just sitting on her small balcony, watching the city lights shimmer.\n\nUltimately, Mei dreams of a more equitable San Francisco, one where access to essential services is not a luxury but a given. She aspires to move into program development or policy work, hoping to impact change on a larger scale. For now, she is grounded in the daily realities of her neighborhood, finding strength in the resilience of the people she serves and her deep connection to the vibrant, challenging city she calls home."

Watching her mother tireless, greeting every customer with a genuine smile despite the long hours, taught Mei the quiet power of resilience and the dignity of honest work, a foundation laid in her Sunset District childhood.\n\n2. Sitting beside her father on the rattling seat of his Muni bus, hearing him patiently explain routes or offer a helping hand to elderly riders, showed Mei the unseen bonds that wove the city together. This early glimpse into the diverse lives he touched sparked her empathy and a deep respect for community.\n\n3. The visceral shock of seeing that teenage girl in the Mission, no older than herself, sifting through a dumpster. It wasn\u2019t just a sight; it was a punch to the gut. This moment at SFSU, in her internship, solidified her purpose and fueled her unwavering commitment to fight for others.\n\n4. The first time she helped a family in the Tenderloin secure stable housing after months of navigating bureaucracy. The sheer relief and gratitude on their faces, a quiet exhale after holding their breath for so long, validated every frustrating moment and reaffirmed her calling as a case manager.\n\n5. Walking along the Embarcadero after a particularly tough day at work, the sound of the waves and the vastness of the bay offering a sense of perspective. In these moments of quiet reflection, surrounded by the city\u2019s beauty, Mei found the strength to continue her arduous work, remembering why she fights for a better San Francisco."
