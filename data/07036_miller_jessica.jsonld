Her parents, a dentist and a real estate agent, prized stability and prestige, values Jessica internalized early on. She was a straight-A student and debate team captain, mapping a direct course from a top undergraduate program at the University of Michigan to the hallowed halls of Berkeley Law. California was a revelation\u2014a place where ambition felt sunnier, more innovative.\n\nShe graduated near the top of her class and secured a coveted position as an Associate Attorney in a downtown San Francisco finance firm. Her career began just as the pandemic reshaped the professional landscape. The corner office she had envisioned was replaced by a standing desk in the corner of her apartment. Now, two years into her career, she has never met most of her colleagues in person. Her 0.0-mile commute from her bedroom to her living room is both a luxury and a gilded cage.\n\nJessica lives in a sleek, modern apartment in Hayes Valley. Her days are a monotonous cycle: a 7 a.m. alarm, a strong coffee, and then 10-12 hours deciphering arcane financial regulations and drafting impenetrable contracts. Lunch is usually a salad from a delivery app, eaten while answering emails. Her connection to San Francisco is often through her floor-to-ceiling windows, which offer a stunning view of a city she rarely has the energy to explore. Her social life is sparse, consisting of occasional dinners with a couple of law school friends and the endless, exhausting cycle of dating apps.\n\nLately, a quiet disillusionment has taken root. The six-figure salary provides comfort but little fulfillment. The intellectual challenge of her work feels hollow, disconnected from any tangible good. Jessica finds herself daydreaming of a different life\u2014one where she uses her law degree to work for an environmental non-profit, or even one where she leaves law entirely to open a small pottery studio in a coastal town. For now, she\u2019s trapped by the golden handcuffs of her profession, a successful young woman in a vibrant city, who feels deeply and profoundly alone."
