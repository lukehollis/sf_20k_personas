Arriving from Bulgaria at age 14 with his parents, his mixed heritage left him ethnically ambiguous and socially adrift. His family, chasing a relative\u2019s empty promises, settled into a cramped apartment in the Outer Richmond, where the fog felt like a constant, suffocating blanket. Ivan, struggling with English and a profound sense of not belonging, was a ghost in the city\u2019s school system. He eventually dropped out, finding transient work in restaurant kitchens and as a night-time janitor, his potential invisible to everyone, including himself.\n\nThe turning point came at 22, during a period of deep depression. Facing eviction, he was connected with a county services program. The catalyst wasn't the aid he received, but the social worker who administered it\u2014a man who listened without judgment and saw a flicker of intelligence behind Ivan\u2019s defeated eyes. For the first time, someone asked him what *he* wanted, not what he had failed to do.\n\nFueled by this sliver of validation, Ivan\u2019s ascent was relentless. He earned his GED, then enrolled in City College of San Francisco, devouring psychology and sociology texts. He transferred to SF State, working two jobs to fund his education, and graduated with honors. His path was clear: he would become the person who had saved him. He completed a Master of Social Work program, focusing on youth in transient populations.\n\nNow, at 38, Ivan is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. The \"0.0 miles\" commute is literal; he runs his practice from a dedicated room in his small SoMa apartment, serving clients via telehealth and in-person meetings at nearby cafes. He specializes in helping immigrant youth and young adults navigate the same systems that once failed him. His personal life is quiet, consisting of a tight-knit circle of friends, many of them fellow social workers who share his gallows humor and fierce dedication. His dream is to eventually launch a non-profit that provides holistic support\u2014mentorship, job training, and mental healthcare\u2014to ensure no one else has to be saved, because they were never allowed to fall in the first place."
