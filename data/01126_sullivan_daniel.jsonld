Raised in the sprawling, diverse suburbs of Fremont, he was the son of a practical Irish-American software engineer and a compassionate Filipina-American nurse. This blend of logic and care defined his upbringing. A thoughtful, observant child, Daniel excelled in math and science, but it was his grandmother's slow, heartbreaking decline from Alzheimer's that gave his talents a direction. He spent hours trying to understand the disease, not through emotion, but through the clinical charts and data his mother would occasionally bring home, seeing it as a complex puzzle to be solved.\n\nThis drive led him to UC Davis, where he initially pursued a pre-med track. However, he quickly realized he was more drawn to the elegant certainty of data than the chaotic unpredictability of patient care. He pivoted, earning a degree in statistics before completing a Ph.D. in Biostatistics at Stanford. There, he found his calling: translating the complexities of human biology into actionable data. Now, as a Senior Biostatistician, he works remotely for a Mission Bay-based biotech firm, analyzing clinical trial results for neurological drugs.\n\nDaniel\u2019s 0.0-mile commute defines his life in Hayes Valley. His day begins not with a drive, but with a short walk to a local cafe for a pour-over coffee. Back in his minimalist apartment, he dives into complex datasets, his world constrained to a high-resolution monitor where he searches for signs of a drug\u2019s efficacy. Afternoons are for virtual meetings with research teams across the globe. To decompress, he runs through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park or meets a small circle of friends\u2014mostly fellow grad school alumni\u2014for dinner at a favorite neighborhood spot.\n\nThough his work is demanding, Daniel craves a deeper human connection that analytics can\u2019t provide. He loves San Francisco for its vibrant energy and its acceptance of people who live by their own code. His greatest aspiration is twofold: to see his statistical analysis contribute to a drug that changes lives, validating the promise he made to himself as a boy, and to find a relationship that adds a beautiful, unpredictable variable to his well-ordered existence."
