Raised in a suburb of Sacramento, he was the son of a practical-minded accountant and a teacher, who envisioned a stable, conventional future for him. He enrolled at Sacramento State, dutifully pursuing a marketing degree he had little passion for, feeling the pressure to follow a clear path to success.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year when his beloved grandmother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. David, witnessing his family struggle with her care, decided to take a semester off to help. That semester stretched into a year. He left college for good, not out of failure, but because he discovered a profound sense of purpose in caring for his grandmother. He wasn\u2019t just helping with meals; he was a keeper of her memories, a patient listener to her looping stories, and the architect of small joys in her shrinking world.\n\nAfter her passing, David felt adrift. His old life no longer fit, and his newfound calling lacked a formal career path. On a whim, he moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation for acceptance and its beautiful, melancholic fog. He found a job as an aide at \u201cThe Cypress Grove,\u201d a senior living facility in the Inner Richmond. His innate empathy and knack for connection were quickly recognized. Within a few years, he was promoted to Activities Coordinator.\n\nDavid lives in a small, subsidized staff apartment on the building's ground floor, explaining his zero-mile commute. His days are a whirlwind of planning chair yoga, coordinating therapy dog visits, hosting classic film nights, and, most importantly, listening. He knows who fought at Normandy, who saw the Fillmore in its heyday, and who still mourns a spouse lost decades ago. His social life is small\u2014a weekly pint with a couple of nurses at a nearby pub\u2014as his emotional energy is largely dedicated to his residents.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is unique; he experiences the city through the memories of its oldest inhabitants. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup but to secure a grant for a dedicated music therapy room at The Cypress Grove. David Miller found his purpose not in a boardroom, but in a quiet room filled with stories, building a meaningful life one bingo game and one cherished memory at a time."
