She was born in the fog-laced avenues of the Sunset District to parents who had emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1970s. Their life revolved around the steady rhythm of their small bakery on Irving Street, where the scent of pineapple buns and egg tarts was the backdrop of her childhood. While her parents valued stability and tradition, Mei was drawn to the meticulous order of museum exhibits and the stories hidden within art. She was a quiet, observant child who found comfort in organization and detail.\n\nHer path seemed set for a quieter life when she pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History at San Francisco State University. She loved the theory and the history, but graduated into the throes of the first dot-com boom. The city was electric with a new kind of energy, and the art world felt slow and disconnected by comparison. A temp job as an administrative assistant at a fledgling startup became her turning point. While engineers created chaotic digital magic, Mei brought order. She created spreadsheets, managed timelines, and translated the creative vision of developers into actionable plans for marketing teams. She had found her calling not in curating art, but in curating projects.\n\nOver two decades, Mei methodically built her career. She wasn't a coder, but she spoke the language of deadlines, deliverables, and dependencies better than anyone. Now a senior project manager for a major tech firm, she orchestrates complex projects from the quiet of her Cole Valley apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a sanctuary carved out from the city\u2019s relentless pace.\n\nHer daily routine is a blend of intense focus and neighborhood comfort. Mornings start with a walk to her favorite local caf\u00e9, followed by hours on international calls, her calm voice a steady hand guiding teams across time zones. Her social life is a small, curated circle of old friends\u2014a mix of fellow SF natives and tech transplants. Having navigated a painful divorce five years prior, she cherishes her independence and the peace of her own space.\n\nMei\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. She aspires to find balance, perhaps by volunteering at the de Young Museum or finally taking a pottery class\u2014a way to reconnect the art history graduate with the tech professional. She loves the city of her birth, yet feels the pang of its constant, aggressive evolution. For Mei Lin, the future is about managing her most important project: a life of purpose and peace in the ever-changing city she calls home."
