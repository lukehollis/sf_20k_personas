Raised in Hayward by her Filipino mother, a registered nurse, and her Mexican-American father, a union carpenter, Maya grew up keenly aware of the disparities in the Bay Area. Her childhood was a vibrant mix of family gatherings, but she also witnessed relatives struggle to navigate complex healthcare systems due to language barriers and a lack of resources. This formative experience planted the seed for her future work.\n\nHer academic path was a direct response to these observations. After a bachelor's degree at UC Davis, she pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, determined to build systems that served everyone, not just the privileged. Her early career was spent in community health clinics, creating outreach programs. The decisive turning point came with the COVID-19 pandemic. Maya saw firsthand how the pivot to telehealth and digital information created a new chasm, leaving the elderly and low-income families dangerously behind. This galvanized her, pushing her to focus on the intersection of technology and public health.\n\nNow 40, Maya is the Program Director for Digital Health Equity at a prominent non-profit. Her work involves developing platforms and training programs to ensure that marginalized communities can access virtual health services. Her 2.8-mile bike commute from her Inner Sunset apartment to her office in Hayes Valley is a cherished daily ritual, often taking her through the Panhandle or the edge of Golden Gate Park. She lives with her long-term partner, Leo, a landscape architect, and their home is filled with plants and books.\n\nWeekends are for hiking in Marin or volunteering at a community garden. Maya feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2019s history of activism and innovation. Her dream is to see her programs adopted nationwide, creating a new standard for inclusive healthcare. For Maya, building bridges is no longer just a metaphor; it's her life's work, ensuring no one is left on the wrong side of the digital divide."

At 12, she sat beside her *lola*, whose hands were twisting a worn handkerchief. Maya\u2019s job was to translate the doctor\u2019s rapid-fire English into a gentle Tagalog, but the medical terms felt like stones in her mouth. She saw the confusion in her grandmother's eyes and a flash of shame. That helplessness hardened into resolve. She wasn\u2019t just translating words; she was witnessing a gap she would spend her life working to close.\n\n2.\nSpring 2020. The world was terrified and online. Maya was on the phone, trying to walk an elderly man named Mr. Chen through setting up his telehealth portal. She could hear the tremor in his voice, his quiet frustration at the password requirements and the endless clicks. After twenty minutes, he sighed, \"I'll just wait. It's too much.\" Hearing that gentle surrender was like a physical blow. It was in that moment her mission clarified from a concept into an urgent, tangible mandate: technology could not become another wall.\n\n3.\nThe bike ride is a daily prayer. One specific morning, pedaling through the Panhandle, a thick Karl the Fog morning muted the city's noise. The damp air smelled of eucalyptus and earth. She thought of Leo, likely tending to their monstera, and the day's work ahead. Coasting through that quiet green tunnel, suspended between her home and her purpose, she felt a profound sense of peace. This city wasn't just a place she lived; it was the landscape of her life, a partner in her daily rhythm.\n\n4.\nLast year, at a digital literacy workshop she was leading in the Mission, she watched a woman in her seventies, Mrs. Ramirez, hesitantly navigate the enrollment screen. Her brow was furrowed in concentration. Then, a small, triumphant click. Mrs. Ramirez looked up, her face breaking into a wide, relieved smile as she successfully booked a virtual appointment for her husband. Seeing that bridge connect in real-time\u2014that a path she helped build was truly being walked\u2014filled Maya with a quiet, powerful joy that erased months of exhaustion.\n\n5.\nA recent Saturday, her hands were deep in the cool soil of the community garden in the Bayview. Her knees were stained with dirt, the sun was warm on her back, and she was laughing with a woman she\u2019d just met about the stubbornness of kale. Surrounded by a shared effort to cultivate and nourish, Maya felt a deep, grounding connection. Her work was often in the abstract world of systems and platforms, but here, with dirt under her nails, she was reminded that all bridges, digital or otherwise, are built for this: community."
