Born in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, Wei is the only child of parents who immigrated from Guangzhou, China, in the late 1980s. His father ran a small, successful wholesale produce business, and his mother worked part-time as a seamstress. While they provided a stable and loving home, the pressures of navigating a new country and ensuring their son\u2019s success often translated into high expectations for Wei. He grew up speaking Cantonese at home and English at school, constantly bridging two worlds.\n\nHis educational path was initially influenced by his parents\u2019 desire for him to pursue a more \u201cpractical\u201d degree, perhaps in engineering or business. However, during his volunteer work at a local community center in high school, assisting with after-school programs for underprivileged children, Wei discovered a deep sense of fulfillment in helping others. This led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Social Work at San Francisco State University. He excelled in his studies, particularly in courses focusing on child development and trauma-informed care. Following graduation, he gained valuable experience working as a case manager for a non-profit organization serving at-risk youth in the Tenderloin, an experience that solidified his desire to work directly with individuals in need of mental health support.\n\nA significant turning point came when Wei witnessed the impact of systemic barriers on the families he served. This fueled his decision to pursue further training and become a licensed clinical social worker. He currently works for a local school district, providing counseling and support to students and their families facing a range of challenges, from academic struggles to mental health issues and housing instability.\n\nWei\u2019s personal life is both rich and grounded. He maintains close relationships with his parents, visiting them for Sunday dinners in the Sunset. His social circle is a blend of former classmates, colleagues, and friends he\u2019s met through shared interests, like hiking and photography. He\u2019s in a committed relationship with his partner, Alex, a graphic designer he met at a community event. They share a small but comfortable apartment in the Richmond District, a neighborhood that feels familiar and diverse.\n\nHis days typically begin with a bicycle commute along the scenic routes of the city, a time for reflection and exercise before the demands of his job. His work is challenging but deeply rewarding, and he finds solace in knowing he\u2019s making a tangible difference in the lives of his clients. His hopes for the future include potentially pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in trauma-informed social work and perhaps opening a small private practice focused on serving the Asian American community. He dreams of a more equitable and supportive San Francisco for all its residents, and he\u2019s committed to being a part of that change, one client at a time. San Francisco is more than just a city to Wei; it's his home, the place where his roots run deep and where his passion for helping others flourishes."
