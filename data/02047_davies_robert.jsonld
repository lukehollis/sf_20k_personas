Born in South Korea and adopted as an infant by a kind, aging couple in Fresno, his name never quite seemed to match his face in the mirror. Growing up in the Central Valley, he was one of only a handful of Asian kids in his school. He was loved, but always felt a step removed, an observer by nature. This quiet introspection led him to community college without a clear direction, where he initially drifted through general education requirements.\n\nThe turning point came not in a classroom, but in a sterile hospital room. When his adoptive mother faced a long battle with cancer, Robert became her primary support. He spent countless hours by her side, witnessing the profound impact of the patient care technicians. While doctors made their brief, important rounds, it was the PCTs who provided the constant, grounding comfort\u2014adjusting pillows, sharing a quiet word, and offering a steady hand. He saw a purpose there that had always eluded him. He promptly enrolled in a Medical Assisting program, earning his Associate\u2019s degree with a newfound focus.\n\nSeeking to build a life of his own, Robert moved to San Francisco for a PCT position at a major medical center. He found a small, rent-controlled studio apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood perpetually kissed by fog, its quiet streets a world away from the city\u2019s frantic core. His commute is a ten-minute walk to the hospital, a daily ritual that allows him to clear his head before and after his demanding 12-hour shifts.\n\nNow 37, Robert\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine and quiet service. His social circle is small, mostly consisting of a few colleagues with whom he shares a knowing, gallows humor. The deepest connections he forms are often with his long-term patients, becoming a familiar, calming presence in their tumultuous journeys. His dream is not to leave his world, but to go deeper into it. He\u2019s slowly taking online prerequisite courses, saving every spare dollar with the singular goal of becoming a Registered Nurse. To Robert, fulfillment isn\u2019t found in a grand new life, but in elevating the purpose he has already discovered, one patient at a time."
