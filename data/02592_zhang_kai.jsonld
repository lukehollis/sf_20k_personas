The only son of Chinese immigrants who settled in Cupertino, his childhood was a structured process of academic excellence and quiet expectation. His father, a hardware engineer, and his mother, a math tutor, viewed a STEM education not as an option, but as a roadmap to stability. Kai followed it dutifully, earning an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering before pursuing a Master\u2019s in Materials Science at UC Berkeley. This move to the Bay Area felt like both a graduation and a homecoming to the epicenter of his parents\u2019 ambitions for him.\n\nHe landed a coveted role as a Process Engineer at a burgeoning battery technology company. For years, his life was a predictable commute to a South Bay campus, optimizing fabrication lines and refining chemical deposition techniques. He was good at it, finding a certain satisfaction in improving a system\u2019s efficiency by a fraction of a percent. The turning point was the pandemic. His company went fully remote, and Kai\u2019s 0.0-mile commute became permanent. Suddenly untethered from the office, the clean, logical lines of his life began to blur.\n\nNow 34, Kai lives alone in a minimalist one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are a quiet hum of virtual meetings and data analysis, the window beside his desk often filled with fog rolling in from the nearby Presidio. The solitude, compounded by a relationship that ended a year ago, pushed him to seek a more tactile connection to the world. He found it in a community ceramics studio a few blocks away.\n\nThree nights a week, Kai trades his keyboard for a potter\u2019s wheel. The unpredictable nature of clay\u2014its tendency to crack, warp, and slump\u2014is a therapeutic counterpoint to the rigid certainties of his job. His connection to San Francisco is not found in downtown happy hours, but in the quiet ritual of walking to his studio, grabbing dumplings on Clement Street, and feeling the city\u2019s creative undercurrent. His hope is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder, but about saving enough to one day open a small studio of his own\u2014a space where he can perfect a different kind of process, one driven by art instead of algorithms."

He remembers tracing the iridescent, perfect grid with a finger, smelling the clean, sterile scent. \u201cThis is the future, Kai,\u201d his father said. He felt the weight of that perfect, logical world settle on his shoulders. It wasn\u2019t a choice, but a blueprint he was handed. That moment defined the path he believed he was destined to follow, a map drawn by his parents\u2019 quiet, unwavering expectations.\n\n2.\nDuring his Master\u2019s program at Berkeley, around age 23, he took a shortcut through the arts quad. A ceramics class had left their projects to dry on an outdoor rack. He stopped, mesmerized by a row of misshapen, lopsided mugs. They were fundamentally flawed, yet each had a distinct personality. The image stuck with him\u2014a stark, human contrast to the flawless crystalline structures he studied in the lab. It was the first time he recognized a beauty in imperfection, a feeling he didn't yet have the words for.\n\n3.\nThe day his relationship ended, about a year ago, the silence in his Inner Richmond apartment felt crushing. He walked aimlessly until he found himself on a foggy stretch of Ocean Beach. He watched the waves chaos-crash against the shore, a powerful, unruly system he could never optimize or control. The sheer, indifferent force of it all didn't diminish him; it strangely liberated him. It mirrored his own internal state and made him realize he craved something real and untamable in his hermetically sealed life.\n\n4.\nHis first night at the ceramics studio, three months after the beach walk. His hands, so precise with lab equipment, were clumsy on the wheel. The clay collapsed again and again. Frustration warred with a novel sensation: the feeling of cool, gritty slip coating his skin. When he finally centered a small lump of clay, the focused calm that settled over him was more profound than any solved equation. It was a physical anchor in a life that had become entirely digital and formless.\n\n5.\nJust last week, he pulled a small tea bowl from the studio's kiln. The dark tenmoku glaze he\u2019d used had broken over the rim into an unexpected, beautiful rust color. It was a happy accident, a gift from the fire. He took it home, filled it with tea, and sat by his window. Holding its warmth and heft\u2014a tangible result of surrender, not control\u2014he felt a quiet click of purpose. This was it. This was the process he wanted to build his future around."
