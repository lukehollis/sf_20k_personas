The daughter of a second-generation Chinese-American sign painter from Chinatown and an Irish-American nurse from the Sunset, Mei\u2019s childhood home was a library of blended cultures. Her father filled sketchbooks with elegant calligraphy while her mother recited Yeats from memory. Mei, a quiet and observant child, found her own world in the local branch library, a sanctuary of ordered stories amidst the city's beautiful chaos.\n\nThis love for organized knowledge naturally guided her path. She earned a bachelor's degree in History from San Francisco State University, fascinated by the narratives that shaped her hometown. A key turning point came during her final year when her father passed away, taking with him a trove of family history and neighborhood anecdotes. The loss crystallized her purpose: she wasn't just interested in stories on pages, but in preserving the living memories of people. This conviction led her to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), after which she began her career in the San Francisco Public Library system, working her way up from a reference desk associate to her current role as a Senior Librarian at the Main Library.\n\nNow at 39, Mei\u2019s life is a testament to intention. She lives in a modern, compact apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that allows her a zero-mile commute. Her daily routine begins with a short walk across the Civic Center Plaza, coffee from a local cart in hand, watching the city wake up before she steps into the grand library. Her days are a mix of managing digital archives, leading research workshops, and offering guidance to the diverse patrons\u2014from curious tourists to unhoused residents seeking warmth and connection.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, centered around a bi-weekly book club with fellow bibliophiles and quiet evenings with her long-term partner, a cellist with the SF Symphony. Mei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees herself as a custodian of its multifaceted identity. Her ultimate aspiration is to launch a major library initiative: a multilingual oral history project dedicated to capturing the stories of the city's aging residents, ensuring that no more histories, like her father\u2019s, are lost to time."

Her father\u2019s brush moved silently over newsprint, painting the character for \u201chome.\u201d Her mother, watching, quietly recited a line of Yeats. In that moment, the scent of ink and the lilt of Irish poetry weren\u2019t separate things; they were the air she breathed. It wasn\u2019t a collision of cultures, but a seamless, gentle weaving. This memory became her lifelong definition of home: a space where every story belongs and enriches the others.\n\n2.\nAt twelve, during a particularly chaotic, fog-drenched afternoon, she fled the noise of Clement Street for the local branch library. Pushing open the heavy oak door felt like closing a door on the world\u2019s frantic energy. Inside, the hushed quiet and the sight of books standing in silent, ordered rows filled her with a deep sense of peace. It was the first time she understood the library not just as a place for stories, but as a sanctuary of logic and calm\u2014a structure that made the world feel manageable.\n\n3.\nA month after her father died, she found his last sketchbook. He was 21. Among the elegant, half-finished characters were notes in the margins\u2014names of old Chinatown shops, a \"remember to ask Uncle...\" that would never be asked. The sight of that unfinished thought struck her with the force of a physical blow. It wasn't just her father who was gone, but an entire library of stories. In that dusty workshop, her abstract love for history became a fierce, personal mission to preserve living memory.\n\n4.\nIn her mid-twenties, working the reference desk, an elderly Russian man asked for help finding a photo of his old neighborhood. After some digging in a digital archive, they found it. He pointed a trembling finger at a faded storefront and, with tears in his eyes, told her about the girl he met there sixty years ago. For Mei, it was a lightning bolt of realization. Her job wasn't just to find information; it was to provide the key that unlocked the vast, magnificent libraries people carry inside them.\n\n5.\nJust last fall, she was walking home with her partner after a symphony performance. They paused in the plaza, the grand library glowing behind them. As her partner hummed a cello suite, she watched an unhoused woman carefully arranging her cart for the night. The juxtaposition of soaring art, civic grandeur, and stark reality felt like the city's true heartbeat. It wasn't jarring, but whole. In that moment, she felt a profound sense of purpose: her work was to create a place for every one of these stories to be heard."
