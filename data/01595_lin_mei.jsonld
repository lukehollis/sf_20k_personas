The daughter of a second-generation Chinese-American sign painter from Chinatown and an Irish-American nurse from the Sunset, Mei\u2019s childhood home was a library of blended cultures. Her father filled sketchbooks with elegant calligraphy while her mother recited Yeats from memory. Mei, a quiet and observant child, found her own world in the local branch library, a sanctuary of ordered stories amidst the city's beautiful chaos.\n\nThis love for organized knowledge naturally guided her path. She earned a bachelor's degree in History from San Francisco State University, fascinated by the narratives that shaped her hometown. A key turning point came during her final year when her father passed away, taking with him a trove of family history and neighborhood anecdotes. The loss crystallized her purpose: she wasn't just interested in stories on pages, but in preserving the living memories of people. This conviction led her to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), after which she began her career in the San Francisco Public Library system, working her way up from a reference desk associate to her current role as a Senior Librarian at the Main Library.\n\nNow at 39, Mei\u2019s life is a testament to intention. She lives in a modern, compact apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that allows her a zero-mile commute. Her daily routine begins with a short walk across the Civic Center Plaza, coffee from a local cart in hand, watching the city wake up before she steps into the grand library. Her days are a mix of managing digital archives, leading research workshops, and offering guidance to the diverse patrons\u2014from curious tourists to unhoused residents seeking warmth and connection.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, centered around a bi-weekly book club with fellow bibliophiles and quiet evenings with her long-term partner, a cellist with the SF Symphony. Mei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees herself as a custodian of its multifaceted identity. Her ultimate aspiration is to launch a major library initiative: a multilingual oral history project dedicated to capturing the stories of the city's aging residents, ensuring that no more histories, like her father\u2019s, are lost to time."
