Raised in a working-class family where practicality trumped academia, college was never a serious topic of discussion. Instead, David learned about infrastructure from the ground up, first on construction sites and later as a draftsman for a small municipal office. His real education happened at night, poring over books by Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford, his passion for urban design a quiet, self-taught pursuit.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco two decades ago, drawn by the city\u2019s complex tapestry of stunning geography and intractable social problems. Lacking a formal degree, he faced constant rejection until a savvy manager at the Planning Department took a chance on him, impressed by his practical knowledge and detailed portfolio of small-town revitalization projects. David started at the bottom, meticulously checking zoning compliance and mapping public right-of-ways. His dogged work ethic and intuitive understanding of how people use space saw him slowly ascend the ranks.\n\nNow, at 45, David is a Senior Urban Planner, his career a testament to grit over credentials. His commute is a zero-mile journey from his bed to his desk in a Hayes Valley apartment overlooking the urban ballet he helps choreograph. A long-term relationship amicably ended years ago, a casualty of his quiet devotion to the city\u2019s complex problems. His life is his work. Mornings are for virtual meetings and policy review; afternoons are for \"ground-truthing\"\u2014walking the very blocks he's planning, observing pedestrian flow, and noting the subtle interplay of shadow and sunlight.\n\nHis social life is woven into his neighborhood: coffee at a local cafe, a beer at a corner bar with a small circle of fellow civic servants. David's connection to San Francisco is profound and granular. He sees the city not just as a place, but as a living organism he is privileged to tend to. His dream isn't grand but tangible: a protected bike lane that gets used, a new public plaza that fosters community, a housing project that offers dignity. He hopes to leave behind a city that is just a little more equitable, walkable, and human than he found it."
