Born to a Filipina mother and an Irish-American father in a working-class Richmond neighborhood, she never felt she fully belonged to either world. This sense of being an outsider defined her early life, leading her to adopt \u201cNone\u201d as an answer to any question about ethnicity; it was less a denial of her heritage and more an acceptance of her unique, unclassifiable space.\n\nFormal education felt like a cage to her restless, pattern-seeking mind. She dropped out of high school at 17, finding the rigid curriculum stifling. The next few years were a blur of low-wage jobs\u2014deli counter, bookstore clerk, bike messenger\u2014that paid the bills but starved her intellect. The turning point came via a temp agency that placed her as an administrative assistant at a small, old-school investment firm in Oakland. Her boss, a grizzled partner nearing retirement, noticed her preternatural ability to spot numerical discrepancies and market trends in the reports she was filing. He saw raw talent where others saw a high school dropout.\n\nHe became her unofficial mentor. Monique devoured every book he gave her, spent her nights on investment forums, and taught herself complex data analysis. She had no degree, but she had a ferocious work ethic and an intuitive grasp of market psychology. Within five years, she was doing freelance analysis for her mentor\u2019s contacts, building a reputation for her sharp, contrarian insights.\n\nNow 42, Monique lives and works from her quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a sanctuary she built after years of instability. Her days are structured with discipline: up at 5:00 AM to analyze European markets, a walk to a small caf\u00e9 on Irving Street for coffee, and then hours of intense focus in her spare-bedroom office. Her connection to San Francisco isn't the flashy tech world, but the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park, which she walks through every afternoon to decompress. Her social circle is small\u2014a few long-term clients, the baristas who know her order, and her brother in San Diego.\n\nHer ultimate dream isn't immense wealth, but unshakeable security. Having escaped precarity, she aspires to start a small, private fund that invests specifically in undervalued, unconventional local businesses, giving a chance to others who, like her, don't fit the traditional mold."
