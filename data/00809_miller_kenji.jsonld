            "value": "Kenji Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s quiet resilience. Born to Nisei (second-generation) Japanese-American parents in the Outer Richmond, his childhood was steeped in the values of hard work and community. His father, a meticulous gardener for the city\u2019s affluent, and his mother, a skilled seamstress, instilled in him a deep appreciation for the unseen labor that holds a city together. He watched them navigate a world that wasn't always welcoming, fostering in him a desire not just to succeed, but to serve.\n\nThis drive led him to UC Berkeley, where he witnessed the energy of student activism. However, it was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that solidified his path. Seeing the city\u2019s vulnerability and the heroic, often bureaucratic, efforts to rebuild, he pursued a Master of Public Policy. He wanted to understand the machinery of the city to make it work better for everyone, especially for families like his own.\n\nKenji\u2019s career has been a slow, steady climb within the labyrinthine halls of the City & County of San Francisco. He has weathered shifting political tides and managed projects from park renovations to public transit initiatives. A key turning point was his divorce a decade ago. The split, amicable but draining, prompted a recalibration. He moved from a family home in the Sunset to a smaller, quieter apartment in Cole Valley, embracing a more solitary life.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his days begin not with a rush, but with the ritual of pour-over coffee and reading the news. His small apartment is his office, a world of Zoom calls, policy documents, and the Sisyphean task of untangling bureaucratic knots. Evenings are for unwinding with a home-cooked meal, listening to old jazz records, and occasionally meeting a small circle of longtime friends\u2014fellow city employees who share his cynical brand of hope.\n\nKenji\u2019s dream is no longer to change the world, but to see the one major housing initiative he currently manages break ground before he retires. He hopes to one day travel extensively through Japan, connecting with a heritage he knows mostly through his parents\u2019 stories. He loves San Francisco with the complicated familiarity of a lifelong resident, seeing all its flaws and faded glory, yet remaining stubbornly dedicated to its care."
