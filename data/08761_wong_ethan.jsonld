Born to first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a bustling neighborhood bakery, Ethan\u2019s childhood was a mix of foggy coastal mornings and the scent of warm pastries. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, instilled in him a powerful sense of duty, envisioning a future for him in a stable profession, secured by a college degree.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State University, dutifully pursuing a degree in business administration, a path chosen more for its practicality than for passion. However, two years in, his father suffered a serious health complication, forcing him to step away from the bakery. Without hesitation, Ethan put his education on hold to help his mother run the family business. The temporary measure stretched into two years. By the time his father recovered, the momentum for college was lost, replaced by a proficiency in inventory management and customer service.\n\nFeeling a need to forge his own path away from the family business, Ethan leveraged his experience into a retail job. He was a natural, quickly rising from a sales associate to an assistant manager at a trendy apparel store in Hayes Valley. This led to his most defining life choice: moving into a modern studio apartment directly above the store. His commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs.\n\nThis 0.0-mile commute has shaped his entire existence. His life unfolds within a three-block radius. His morning coffee is from the cafe next door, his social life consists of after-work drinks with his staff at a nearby bar, and his connection to San Francisco is an intense, microscopic understanding of his immediate neighborhood. While convenient, the proximity blurs the line between work and life, leaving him feeling perpetually on the clock.\n\nAt 31, Ethan feels a quiet restlessness. He\u2019s respected and competent, but unfulfilled. In stolen moments, he sketches logos on inventory sheets, a ghost of a long-dormant interest in graphic design. His dream is to save enough to break free from the corporate retail cycle, perhaps opening a small, curated lifestyle shop of his own\u2014a place where his creative vision, not a corporate planogram, dictates the aesthetic. He loves the city's energy but yearns to experience it beyond the confines of his work-life bubble."
