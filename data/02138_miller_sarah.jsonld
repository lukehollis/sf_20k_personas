Raised in a quiet suburb of Portland, Oregon, she absorbed her father\u2019s engineering logic and her mother\u2019s passion for art. This dual upbringing left her perpetually fascinated not with *what* things were, but *how* people used them. She pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Washington, studying the mechanics of human thought while teaching herself graphic design principles in her spare time. She filled sketchbooks with user interface ideas, seeing a clear path where her peers saw none.\n\nThe major turning point was her decision to move to San Francisco after graduation. Armed with a non-traditional degree and a scrappy portfolio of personal projects, she faced months of rejections before landing a role as a Junior Design Assistant at a mid-sized tech company. The job offered a foothold in her dream industry, but with a modern catch: it was fully remote.\n\nNow, at 24, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by the walls of her small Hayes Valley studio. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of moving from her bed to her standing desk. Her days are a digital flurry of Figma mockups, user-flow diagrams, and Zoom calls, translating complex engineering needs into intuitive design. While grateful for the opportunity, the isolation can be profound.\n\nTo combat this, Sarah has built a life outside her apartment. She\u2019s a regular at her local bouldering gym, where the physical problem-solving offers a tangible escape from digital work. Her small circle of friends consists of a few fellow UW alumni and climbing partners. She feels her connection to San Francisco most acutely on her evening runs past the Painted Ladies or while browsing the shelves of a local bookstore, small rituals that ground her in the city's culture.\n\nHer aspiration is to grow beyond her \"junior\" title, to one day lead a design team and create products that feel effortless to use. She dreams of a future where her career is secure enough to afford a space for a pottery wheel\u2014a tangible link back to the artistic roots her mother first planted. For now, she navigates the paradox of being hyper-connected to a global tech industry while striving to forge a real, physical connection to the city she calls home."
