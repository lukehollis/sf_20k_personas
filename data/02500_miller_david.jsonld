Raised in a quiet Cleveland suburb, the only son of a pragmatic civil engineer and a methodical librarian, David grew up surrounded by blueprints and card catalogs. His childhood was one of ordered lines and quiet systems, but his imagination sought to break free. While his father saw grids and support beams, David saw stages and galleries. A high school art teacher recognized his unique talent for spatial reasoning combined with an artist's eye, encouraging him to pursue a path that his parents struggled to understand.\n\nHe found his escape and his calling at Columbia University, earning a Master of Fine Arts in Architectural Design. New York City cracked his world open, but it was a post-graduation trip to San Francisco that felt like a true homecoming. He was captivated by the city's audacious topography and its embrace of rebellious creativity. He took a junior position at a boutique firm and made his name with a clever, light-filled renovation of a small Hayes Valley gallery, a project that solidified his decision to stay.\n\nNow 45, David is a Senior Project Architect specializing in cultural spaces. His life and work are seamlessly integrated within a sprawling SoMa live/work loft. The 0.0-mile commute means his day begins not in traffic, but with coffee and a sketchbook at the massive concrete drafting table that dominates his living space. His work\u2014designing museum expansions, black box theaters, and artist residencies\u2014keeps him deeply embedded in the city's creative heart. His closest friends are a tight-knit circle of curators, artists, and writers, with whom he often debates art over dinner at unfussy neighborhood spots.\n\nThough respected and successful, David remains quietly driven. His career has been one of refining and reimagining existing spaces, but his deepest aspiration is to design a major cultural institution from the ground up\u2014a landmark building that will become a permanent part of the San Francisco landscape. It is his ultimate dream: to give the city that shaped him a new space where future generations can find their own inspiration."
