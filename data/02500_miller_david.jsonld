Raised in a quiet Cleveland suburb, the only son of a pragmatic civil engineer and a methodical librarian, David grew up surrounded by blueprints and card catalogs. His childhood was one of ordered lines and quiet systems, but his imagination sought to break free. While his father saw grids and support beams, David saw stages and galleries. A high school art teacher recognized his unique talent for spatial reasoning combined with an artist's eye, encouraging him to pursue a path that his parents struggled to understand.\n\nHe found his escape and his calling at Columbia University, earning a Master of Fine Arts in Architectural Design. New York City cracked his world open, but it was a post-graduation trip to San Francisco that felt like a true homecoming. He was captivated by the city's audacious topography and its embrace of rebellious creativity. He took a junior position at a boutique firm and made his name with a clever, light-filled renovation of a small Hayes Valley gallery, a project that solidified his decision to stay.\n\nNow 45, David is a Senior Project Architect specializing in cultural spaces. His life and work are seamlessly integrated within a sprawling SoMa live/work loft. The 0.0-mile commute means his day begins not in traffic, but with coffee and a sketchbook at the massive concrete drafting table that dominates his living space. His work\u2014designing museum expansions, black box theaters, and artist residencies\u2014keeps him deeply embedded in the city's creative heart. His closest friends are a tight-knit circle of curators, artists, and writers, with whom he often debates art over dinner at unfussy neighborhood spots.\n\nThough respected and successful, David remains quietly driven. His career has been one of refining and reimagining existing spaces, but his deepest aspiration is to design a major cultural institution from the ground up\u2014a landmark building that will become a permanent part of the San Francisco landscape. It is his ultimate dream: to give the city that shaped him a new space where future generations can find their own inspiration."

The crisp blue lines represented tensile strength and load distribution to his dad, but David saw something else entirely. In the precise cross-hatching and graceful arcs, he saw the skeleton of a great cathedral waiting for skin and light. It was the first time he felt the quiet, thrilling distance between his world and his father\u2019s\u2014a space he knew he would spend his life exploring.\n\n2.\nMr. Harrison, his high school art teacher, held up David's charcoal drawing of the school\u2019s drab library. \u201cMost people see a room,\u201d he'd said, his voice low, \u201cYou see volume, you see how light falls. Don't ever let that go.\u201d At sixteen, it wasn't just praise; it was permission. It felt like being handed a map to a country his parents didn't know existed. That moment of recognition gave him the courage to defy the predictable blueprint laid out for him and draw his own.\n\n3.\nA week after his Columbia graduation, jet-lagged and aimless at twenty-five, he stood at the top of the Filbert Street steps. He watched the flat grid of Manhattan dissolve in his mind, replaced by this impossible, beautiful chaos. The bay, the angular houses clinging to the hill, the sheer audacity of it all. It wasn\u2019t a city built on a plan; it was a city built on a dare. A profound, electric sense of belonging surged through him. He was home.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty-nine, standing alone in the finished Hayes Valley gallery the night before its reopening. The smell of fresh paint hung in the air. As the sun set, a perfect, golden rectangle of light from the skylight he\u2019d fought for crept across the polished concrete floor. It wasn't just a design feature; it was a moment of silent dialogue between space and light. In that quiet glow, he felt the immense satisfaction of creating not just a structure, but a stage for experience.\n\n5.\nJust last year, during a foggy afternoon at the de Young, he watched a child trace the patterns of the perforated copper facade with her finger, completely mesmerized. He felt a sudden, sharp pang\u2014not of envy, but of intense purpose. His successful career suddenly felt like a prologue. The true work was yet to come. His ambition crystallized then, shifting from a distant dream to a driving, vital need: to create a building that could elicit that same sense of civic wonder."
