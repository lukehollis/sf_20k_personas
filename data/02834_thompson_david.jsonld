Raised by a practical engineer father and a librarian mother, David inherited a dual nature: a methodical approach to problems and a quiet love for the narratives of the past. This led him to San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the city\u2019s vibrant history and enrolling at SF State to pursue a Bachelor's degree in History.\n\nHis timing was both perfect and disastrous. David graduated directly into the crater left by the dot-com bust. Jobs for history majors were nonexistent, and the city\u2019s optimism had curdled into anxiety. In a pivot born of necessity, he channeled his father\u2019s pragmatism, teaching himself A+ certification and network administration. He discovered a knack for it; troubleshooting a network wasn't so different from tracing historical causality. He landed his first help-desk job and began a steady, if unglamorous, career in IT.\n\nNow 45, David\u2019s life is a testament to the routines he has perfected. His 0.0-mile commute leads from his bedroom to a meticulously organized desk in the corner of his Inner Sunset apartment. His days are a cadence of support tickets, remote system updates, and patiently walking users through password resets. His social life is small but meaningful, centered around a weekly board game night with friends he\u2019s known for over a decade.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. He\u2019s a regular at the coffee shop on Irving Street, knows the best trails in Golden Gate Park for a lunchtime walk, and appreciates the quiet hum of his neighborhood over the chaotic energy of downtown. The city isn\u2019t a playground for him; it's a familiar, comfortable habitat.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream, however, has never been about climbing the tech ladder. On his personal hard drive, far from his work folders, lies a meticulously researched, half-written manuscript on the maritime history of the Barbary Coast. His ultimate aspiration is to finish it\u2014to finally connect the passion that brought him to the city with the quiet, ordered life he built here. He is a man of routines and hidden currents, an IT specialist who solves today\u2019s problems while dreaming of yesterday\u2019s stories."
