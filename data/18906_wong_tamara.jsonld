Raised in Oakland, the only child of a shipyard welder and a school secretary, she was always drawn to the magnetic pull of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant, chaotic art scene. She crossed the bridge for SF State in the late 1980s, intending to get a degree in Arts Administration, but life had a different curriculum. While juggling classes and a work-study job, she met David Wong, a gentle architecture student whose family had deep roots in Chinatown. They fell in love, and when an opportunity arose for an entry-level position at a small dance collective, she chose the practical experience over the diploma, a decision she has never regretted.\n\nHer career was built brick by brick, not through academic theory but through sheer competence and passion. Starting as a volunteer coordinator, Tamara's fierce organizational skills and innate ability to connect with artists and donors saw her rise steadily. She learned grant writing on the fly, balanced budgets with a razor-thin margin, and became the institutional memory of her organization. David\u2019s sudden passing from a heart attack a decade ago was a seismic shock that reshaped her world. It solidified her resolve, channeling her grief into her work of championing emerging artists, something David had always encouraged. She kept his name as a permanent tribute.\n\nToday, Tamara\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. Her mornings start in her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, where she tends to a small collection of succulents before catching the 38-Geary express to her office near Hayes Valley. Her work is her calling; she thrives on the energy of creative people and the challenge of securing the funding that makes their visions possible. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings, board meetings, or enjoying quiet dinners with a close-knit circle of friends, most of whom also came up through the city\u2019s non-profit trenches.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep and complex. She loves its defiant creativity but worries about the artists being priced out. She hopes to build a sustainable endowment for her organization, ensuring it thrives long after she steps down. Secretly, she dreams of one day curating a small exhibition dedicated to David\u2019s architectural sketches, a final, personal project to honor the man who helped her build a life in the city she calls home."
