Born to a young single mother in Oregon, he was adopted as an infant by a Japanese-American (Nisei) couple in San Jose. Raised by a soft-spoken accountant father and a warm, pragmatic librarian mother, David grew up Caucasian with a Japanese surname in a community that valued education and quiet diligence. This duality shaped him, fostering a deep sense of observation and an appreciation for the mechanics of how things\u2014and people\u2014fit together.\n\nHis fascination with tangible systems led him to Cal Poly for his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, where the \"learn by doing\" philosophy resonated deeply. He followed this with a Master's from Stanford, focusing on product design. His career began at the ground level, designing enclosures for enterprise servers during the dot-com boom. David was never the flashy founder type; he was the indispensable engineer who made the physical product reliable and elegant. His steady climb through the ranks to Director was a testament to his expertise and calm, methodical leadership.\n\nA key turning point came in his early forties with an amicable divorce. The split, stemming from divergent life goals rather than conflict, prompted his move from the Peninsula to San Francisco. He bought a home in the Inner Richmond, craving the city's energy but also the neighborhood's foggy, residential calm. Here, his life found a new rhythm. His 6.8-mile commute to his SoMa manufacturing lab is a quiet affair in his EV, a brief window of reflection before a day of managing teams, budgets, and complex production timelines.\n\nNow 52, David\u2019s life is one of comfortable consolidation. He honors his late parents' memory through his work ethic and by tending to a small, immaculate Japanese garden in his backyard. His social circle is small but tight, consisting of a few colleagues and old university friends. His dream isn't to launch a startup, but to mentor the next generation of engineers and perhaps, one day, take a long trip to Japan to connect with a culture he inherited by name but not by blood."

The teacher paused, a flicker of confusion on her face before she smiled and moved on. It wasn't mean, just a fact. In that moment, he felt a quiet separateness, the first awareness of the space between his face and his name. It became the puzzle he would spend his life observing, learning how disparate parts could form a whole. This happened when he was eight.\n\n2.\nOne Saturday, he watched his father prune a small juniper bonsai on the patio. He asked why he didn\u2019t just use bigger clippers. His father, without looking up, said softly, \"The goal isn't to be fast, David. It's to be right.\" The deliberate, patient snip of the tiny shears echoed in the quiet San Jose morning. That single sentence became the foundation of his engineering philosophy: the pursuit of the elegant, correct solution over the merely expedient one. He was about fourteen at the time.\n\n3.\nThe all-nighter in the Cal Poly machine shop was a haze of frustration. The housing for their senior project simply wouldn't align. Then, around 3 a.m., it hit him. Not a grand insight, but a tiny adjustment to a single tolerance. He re-milled the part, and with a soft, satisfying click, it slid perfectly into place. That feeling\u2014the visceral thrill of a physical system resolving into harmony\u2014was more addictive than any caffeine. It was the moment he knew he would build things for the rest of his life. This was his senior year, age twenty-one.\n\n4.\nHis first night in the Inner Richmond house was unnervingly quiet. After his ex-wife had kindly helped him move the last box, the silence felt immense. The fog rolled in, swallowing the streetlights and muffling the city into a distant hum. He stood by the window, not feeling lonely, but feeling the sheer weight of his own solitude. It was the closing of a chapter, not with a slam, but with a quiet turn of the page. This marked the beginning of his new life in the city, at forty-three.\n\n5.\nA young engineer on his team, frustrated by a persistent flaw in a prototype, sat in his office. David didn't give her the answer. Instead, he simply asked questions, guiding her thoughts back to first principles. He watched her face as she connected the dots herself, the sudden light in her eyes. The pride he felt wasn't for his own knowledge, but for hers. He realized then that his purpose had shifted: from designing elegant objects to helping design elegant minds. This happened just last year; he was fifty-one."
