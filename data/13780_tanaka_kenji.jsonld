Born in San Jose to Nisei (second-generation) parents, his upbringing was steeped in the expectation of stability. His father, an engineer, and mother, a bookkeeper, saw the world through a lens of post-war caution and hoped for a secure, professional path for their only son. Kenji, however, was drawn to the tactile world of creation\u2014the shape of things, the play of light, the power of a well-designed space.\n\nHis choice to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts at San Francisco State University was a gentle rebellion. While his parents worried, Kenji found his calling not in a starving artist\u2019s garret, but in the structured creativity of museum work. After graduating, he took an entry-level job as a fabricator at the California Academy of Sciences, a position that felt like coming home. Here, his passion for sculpture and form found a practical, impactful outlet. Over two decades, he meticulously worked his way up, his keen eye and collaborative spirit earning him the title of Senior Exhibit Designer.\n\nA key turning point was his early 30s, when he led the design for a blockbuster rainforest exhibit. Its success cemented his career but coincided with the amicable end of his marriage to a fellow artist, their paths diverging as his became more structured. Now 48, Kenji\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. He lives alone in a cozy Inner Sunset apartment, his daily 4.5-mile commute on the N-Judah MUNI a time for sketching ideas in his worn notebook. His days are a mix of digital renderings, team meetings, and the familiar scent of sawdust and paint in the museum\u2019s workshop.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and neighborhood-focused. He knows the best places for ramen on Irving Street and spends weekends tending to his small collection of bonsai trees or walking through Golden Gate Park, observing how families interact with the public spaces he helps create. His aspiration is no longer about climbing a ladder, but about legacy: he dreams of designing a permanent, iconic exhibit that will spark curiosity in children for generations to come. And privately, he hopes to set up a small pottery wheel in his spare room, to once again create art just for himself."

He was 18, bracing for a fight about art school. Instead, his father picked up a sketch of a bridge, tracing its lines. \u201cThere is structure here,\u201d he said, a quiet admission. That reluctant approval wasn\u2019t a victory, but a pact. It taught Kenji that his artistic integrity could be grounded in the practical, a lesson that would define his entire career.\n\n2.\nHe was 23, his hands dusty from cutting foam for a diorama. The air in the Cal Academy workshop smelled of sawdust and resin, a scent that felt more like home than any gallery. He wasn\u2019t a celebrated artist; he was a maker, a small cog in a giant, beautiful machine of knowledge. It was in that moment, sanding a faux-rock, that the anxiety of his BFA dissolved. This was it. This was where his tactile love for form had a purpose beyond his own expression.\n\n3.\nIt wasn\u2019t the opening night gala for the rainforest exhibit that he remembered. It was a Tuesday morning, a week later. From a discreet corner, he watched a little girl, no older than six, reach out a tentative hand to touch the mist rising from a fabricated stream. Her eyes were wide with genuine wonder. In that silent, unscripted moment, his work ceased to be about proving himself. It became about sparking that exact feeling in another person. His ambition shifted from climbing to connecting.\n\n4.\nHe was 34, standing in the studio he shared with his wife. Her canvas was a chaotic, brilliant splash of color, an argument in paint. His own table held precise models for an upcoming exhibit. There was no anger, just a quiet, painful clarity. Their art, like their lives, was headed in opposite directions. He saw then that his path required blueprints and collaborations, a structure she found confining. Their love hadn't failed; it had simply completed its form, and it was time to let go.\n\n5.\nLast week on the N-Judah, rattling toward the museum, Kenji saw the morning light hit the condensation on the window, creating a perfect, ephemeral curve. He instinctively opened his notebook, but instead of sketching an exhibit idea, he drew the simple, elegant shape of a tea bowl. It was a small act, lasting only a few stops. But for the first time in years, the drawing wasn't for a project or a team. It was a private promise of clay and art made for no one but himself."
