Born in Daly City to a Filipina mother who worked as a caregiver and a second-generation Hawaiian-American father who cooked in a local diner, Leilani\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the values of family, hard work, and community. The eldest of three, she naturally fell into a caretaker role, a responsibility that was cemented in her mind at sixteen when her grandmother had a stroke. It was Leilani who calmly called 911 and translated between her shaken family and the paramedics, a moment of crisis that ignited her calling toward healthcare.\n\nWhile her friends dreamed of four-year universities, Leilani chose a more pragmatic path. Seeing her parents' financial struggles, she enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree and her certification as a Medical Assistant. It was a direct route to a stable career where she could make a tangible difference.\n\nNow 25, Leilani has found her professional niche at the San Francisco State University Student Health Center. Her 4.5-mile commute from her small apartment in the Outer Sunset is a daily ritual on the M-Ocean View Muni line, a time for podcasts and quiet reflection. At work, she\u2019s more than just an MA; she\u2019s a reassuring presence for students navigating health anxieties far from home. Her days are a blur of taking vitals, administering vaccines, and assisting with minor procedures.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco\u2019s working-class neighborhoods. She lives with a roommate, carefully budgeting her $65,000 salary to cover rent and send money home. Weekends are for family dinners in Daly City, dim sum with her close-knit group of friends on Clement Street, or long walks along Ocean Beach with her boyfriend, a fellow CCSF graduate.\n\nLeilani\u2019s dreams are as practical and compassionate as she is. She is slowly taking prerequisite science courses at night, with the long-term goal of bridging her certification to become a Registered Nurse. Her ultimate aspiration is to one day help run a community clinic in a neighborhood like the Excelsior, serving the very same multilingual, hardworking families that raised her."

Her Lola was on the floor, and her mother's Tagalog prayers were frantic. A cold, sharp clarity cut through Leilani\u2019s fear. She dialed 911, her voice impossibly calm as she translated between her family\u2019s terror and the paramedic's questions. In that moment, she stopped being just a daughter and became an anchor. Her calling wasn't a choice after that; it was a fact revealed in crisis.\n\n2.\nOne foggy morning on the M-Ocean View, around age 23, the train lurched to life at the West Portal station. Leilani looked at the other passengers: nurses in scrubs, construction workers with dusty boots, students clutching coffee. A profound sense of belonging washed over her. She wasn't an outsider dreaming of the city; she was part of its working machinery, its essential, beating heart. This commute, this job\u2014it was her own piece of San Francisco, earned and real. The quiet pride warmed her more than her jacket.\n\n3.\nHer first year at the SFSU clinic, a freshman from San Diego was near tears over a routine vaccination. He confessed he was terrified of needles and terribly homesick. Leilani found herself talking to him not about the shot, but about where to find the best burritos in the Mission. His laughter, sudden and genuine, broke the tension. As she administered the vaccine, she realized this was it\u2014the other side of the 911 call. Not just managing panic, but easing fear with simple, human connection.\n\n4.\nOn a rare Saturday off last year, she found her father on his break, sitting outside his diner. He was rubbing his tired eyes, the smell of grease and coffee clinging to his clothes. He showed her a picture of his new non-slip shoes, prouder of them than any luxury item. Looking at his worn hands, Leilani saw decades of quiet sacrifice and love poured into flipping pancakes for strangers. It reinforced why she budgeted so carefully to send money home; it was a tribute to that same hardworking love.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, walking with her boyfriend as the sun set over Ocean Beach, the cold wind whipped her hair across her face. She stopped and finally said the words she'd been holding in her heart. \"I'm going to do it. I'm going to become a nurse.\" He didn't miss a beat, just squeezed her hand and said, \"Okay. Let's look at the night classes at CCSF.\" Hearing her vast dream treated as a practical, shared plan made it feel solid, like the sand beneath her feet."
