            "value": "Marco Reyes-Jones is a product of two worlds, his name a testament to a story that began when a US Navy sailor from Ohio met a nurse from Cebu in the Philippines. Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Excelsior District, Marco grew up navigating the city\u2019s working-class realities. His childhood was a vibrant mix of his mother\u2019s Filipino cooking, his father\u2019s midwestern pragmatism, and the diverse chorus of his neighborhood.\n\nAs a young man in the 1980s, Marco was adrift, working odd jobs and unsure of his path. The turning point was the AIDS crisis. He watched in horror as friends and neighbors grew sick and the city struggled under the weight of grief and fear. It was in the volunteer kitchens and at the bedsides of the dying that he found his purpose. Witnessing the tireless work of community health advocates forged his resolve. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Human Services.\n\nFor the past two decades, Marco has been a Community Health Case Manager, working primarily with high school students. His $82,000 salary means he lives carefully in a city built for millionaires, but his wealth is measured in the lives he touches. He is a fierce advocate, helping teenagers navigate food insecurity, housing instability, and mental health challenges\u2014the very systems that once failed his own friends.\n\nHis daily routine is a testament to his connection to the city. He catches the N Judah from his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a 2.8-mile journey that takes him through the city\u2019s evolving heart. Evenings are often spent at community meetings or sharing a simple meal with his \u201cchosen family\u201d\u2014a tight-knit group of old friends who have weathered life\u2019s storms together. He is quietly single, his life rich with connection but unmoored from a traditional partnership.\n\nAt 54, Marco\u2019s dreams are modest but profound. He hopes to see the students he counsels build stable lives in the Bay Area, a possibility that feels increasingly remote. He dreams of one day taking a long trip to the Philippines to reconnect with his mother\u2019s heritage. More than anything, Marco hopes to remain a steady, compassionate presence in a city that is constantly reinventing itself, a quiet anchor in the turbulent sea of change."

His mother, her hands warm and sure, guided his as he stirred the pot of sinigang. \"The sour makes you strong, *anak ko*,\" she'd said. It wasn\u2019t just a recipe; it was the first time he understood that providing sustenance was an act of profound love. That memory is the foundation of his need to care for others.\n\n2.\nThe fog rolled heavy over Dolores Park. It was 1984, long before the park became a weekend spectacle. Marco was 22, just finished with a bar-back shift, with no idea what he was doing with his life. He sat on the damp grass, watching the city lights flicker below, feeling both deeply in love with San Francisco and utterly lost within it. The memory is a touchstone for the anxiety he now sees in his students, a reminder of how terrifying and beautiful it is to be young and adrift.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the cold vinyl of the chair in the hospice ward at SF General in 1989. His friend Javier weighed less than 100 pounds, his breath a faint whisper. Marco just sat there for hours, holding a hand that was mostly bone, a silent witness when words were useless. The immense, crushing feeling of helplessness forged a vow in him that day. He would never again stand by, unequipped and powerless, while his community suffered. That moment of grief was the true beginning of his life\u2019s work.\n\n4.\nJust last year, Marco sat in the back of a crowded high school auditorium for a scholarship ceremony. He watched a student named Alani, a girl he had spent months helping secure stable housing and food benefits, walk to the podium. When she spoke about her future, her voice steady and full of hope, Marco felt a quiet, profound victory. It was the inverse of his memory of the hospice ward\u2014not an ending, but a beginning he helped make possible. It was proof his work mattered.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, his chosen family gathered in his Inner Richmond apartment. The N Judah rattled past the window as his friend Elena recounted a story from the 90s, making them all erupt in laughter. Looking at the faces of the people who had weathered every storm with him, Marco felt a deep, anchoring peace. This was the wealth that couldn't be quantified\u2014a life built not on a grand plan, but on the simple, resilient strength of showing up for each other, year after year."
