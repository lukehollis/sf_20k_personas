He was born in the small caretaker's apartment tucked behind the school\u2019s boiler room, a space his father, an immigrant from Hong Kong, had secured along with his job as the school\u2019s custodian in the early 90s. Growing up, Kevin\u2019s playground was the empty basketball court after hours, his world shaped by the ringing of school bells he never answered as a student.\n\nHis own educational journey was fraught. Attending a packed public high school across town, he felt a profound disconnect from his peers. He wasn't a part of the privileged world of St. Augustine, nor did he fit in with the kids at his own school. Socially adrift and struggling to focus, he dropped out at 17, intending to find work. The turning point came a year later when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. To support his mother and ensure they wouldn\u2019t lose their home, Kevin earned his GED and officially took over his father\u2019s duties. When his father passed away two years later, the job became his legacy and his anchor.\n\nNow 27, Kevin\u2019s life follows the academic calendar. His commute is a walk up a flight of concrete stairs. He knows the school\u2019s every groan and secret\u2014which floorboards creak, which window rattles in the wind. He is a silent, reliable presence, respected by the longtime faculty who remember him as a boy. His social connections are few; a friendly nod with the night security guard, conversations in Cantonese with his mother, and a polite, distant rapport with the teachers.\n\nIn the quiet hours after the school empties, Kevin\u2019s true self emerges. He is a talented artist, filling sketchbooks with charcoal drawings of empty hallways, sunlight streaming through dusty classroom windows, and the gnarled cypress trees in the courtyard. His dream isn\u2019t to leave, but to be seen. He hopes to one day have a small exhibition at a local Clement Street gallery, to show people the hidden beauty he witnesses daily. Kevin Wong is a native son of San Francisco, his identity inextricably linked not to a grand landmark, but to the quiet, dignified stewardship of his small corner of the city."
