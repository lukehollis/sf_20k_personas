His father, a Filipino engineer with distant Spanish-Levantine roots, passed down the surname, while his Chinese-American mother, a nurse, instilled in him a relentless work ethic. Raised in the foggy, close-knit suburbs of Daly City, David was the quintessential child of immigrants, his life a straight line aimed at academic and professional success. His parents preached stability; David saw the explosive potential of risk.\n\nHis journey began at UC Berkeley, where he studied electrical engineering, quickly landing a job at a booming tech firm during the first dot-com bubble. He was thrilled by the innovation but sobered by the spectacular 2001 crash that vaporized fortunes overnight. It was his critical turning point. He realized he didn't want to just build the products; he wanted to be the one strategically placing the bets. This conviction led him to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning an MBA that became his passport into the exclusive world of venture capital.\n\nNow a General Partner at a SoMa firm, David is known for his sharp, unsentimental analysis, forged in the fires of that first market collapse. He has spent two decades identifying patterns, backing founders, and navigating the brutal cycles of tech. His personal life is his anchor. He met his wife, Elena, an architect, shortly after business school. Together, they raised their daughter, now a sophomore at UCLA, in a meticulously renovated Victorian in Noe Valley.\n\nDavid\u2019s daily routine is a study in controlled efficiency. A 7 AM ride-share whisks him to his office, the 3.5-mile journey his quiet time to scan global markets. His days are a marathon of pitches, board meetings, and networking. Yet, at 54, a new desire is emerging. The thrill of a 10x return is being replaced by a search for legacy. He finds himself drawn to startups tackling climate change and healthcare, dreaming of funding a company that doesn't just disrupt an industry, but genuinely improves human lives. Weekends are for the Noe Valley Farmers' Market and long runs in the Presidio, moments where he can breathe the city air and contemplate a future defined less by financial wins and more by lasting impact."

His father, calloused hands resting on a schematic, spoke of the elegant certainty of engineering. In that moment, David felt the immense weight of their immigrant dream: a stable, predictable future. It was a loving cage he knew he had to break out of, not by rejecting their work ethic, but by applying it to a world of risk they couldn't comprehend.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe dot-com crash wasn\u2019t a graph on a screen; it was the silence that fell over the office in 2001. The ping-pong table gathered dust. He watched the brilliant, 25-year-old founder he\u2019d admired stare blankly at a liquidation notice. David didn\u2019t feel schadenfreude, but a cold, clarifying fear. He vowed then that he would never again be just a passenger on someone else\u2019s rocket ship. He would be the one standing in the control tower, deciding which ones were cleared for launch.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe met Elena not at a networking event, but at an open house for a home she\u2019d designed. While others discussed comps, David was mesmerized by a scale model. He saw how she had carved light into a narrow space, creating beauty from constraints. It was a structural genius completely different from his own world of abstract numbers and market projections. He realized that night that all his ambition was for naught if he didn't have a place like this\u2014a life built with such intention\u2014to come home to.\n\n***\n\n4.\nDropping his daughter off at her UCLA dorm was the proudest moment of his life. He saw the culmination of his work in her confident smile. But on the long, quiet drive back up the I-5 to his perfect Noe Valley home, a profound hollowness set in. The primary mission of his adult life\u2014providing for her\u2014was accomplished. The house felt too big, too still. The question, \u201cWhat now?\u201d wasn't about the next fund, but about the next purpose.\n\n***\n\n5.\nDuring a recent run in the Presidio, he stopped to catch his breath, the fog weaving through the cypress trees. He\u2019d just heard a pitch for a carbon-capture startup the day before. He\u2019d analyzed the numbers, the TAM, the team. But standing there, breathing the cool, salty air, he didn\u2019t see a 10x return. He saw the air itself as the asset. Funding that company wasn't just a strategic bet; it was a way to protect this exact moment, this feeling, for a future he wouldn't see."
