The eldest daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants, she was raised in a tight-knit community where tradition was paramount and the concept of seeking help for mental distress was often viewed as a private shame. She watched relatives and family friends grapple with the immense pressure of assimilation, financial stress, and intergenerational conflict, all while maintaining a stoic facade. It was this silent suffering that planted the seed for her life's work.\n\nDriven by a quiet determination to understand and heal, Jasleen pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Davis before making the pivotal move to the Bay Area. She was accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Master of Social Work program, a world away from her upbringing. There, she finally found the language and framework for the unspoken pains she had witnessed. After graduating, she earned her clinical hours in the demanding environment of a community health clinic in the Mission District, specializing in trauma and culturally competent care. This experience solidified her path, leading her to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).\n\nA key turning point came five years ago. Burnt out from the relentless pace of agency work, Jasleen took a leap of faith and established her own private practice. This decision coincided with her move to a quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond. Now, at 43, her life has found a sustainable rhythm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to a meticulously organized home office, where she conducts telehealth sessions.\n\nHer days start with a misty walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that grounds her before she delves into the complex inner worlds of her clients. She is single, having ended a long-term relationship amicably years ago, and finds fulfillment in her deep connections with a small circle of friends\u2014fellow therapists and healthcare professionals. While she loves the diverse tranquility of her neighborhood, her heart remains connected to her roots. Jasleen\u2019s ultimate dream is to develop a non-profit organization that provides accessible, stigma-free mental health resources specifically for the South Asian immigrant community in California, bringing her journey full circle."
