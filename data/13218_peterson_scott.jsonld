The son of a pragmatic nurse and a high school history teacher, his upbringing was grounded in public service and the patient untangling of complex problems, whether it was a medical chart or the fall of Rome. This environment nurtured a fascination not with machines, but with the human minds behind them, leading him to a Cognitive Science degree at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nGraduating in the wake of the dot-com bust, Scott\u2019s first job was a soul-crushing stint at an insurance company's call center. It was there, listening to the daily frustration of customers trying to navigate broken digital systems, that his career path crystallized. He realized the problem wasn't the user; it was the design. This insight propelled him into Quality Assurance, then usability testing, and finally into the burgeoning field of UX Research. A turning point came a decade ago when, tired of optimizing for clicks and conversions at a large e-commerce company, he deliberately sought work with a social mission.\n\nFor the last twelve years, San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond has been home. Scott shares a classic rent-controlled apartment with his long-term partner, Clara, a public health advocate. His daily routine is a city ritual: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, followed by a 4.8-mile ride on the 38-Geary bus, where he listens to podcasts on behavioral economics. His work is his passion\u2014interviewing students about learning apps or observing how seniors interact with telehealth portals.\n\nAt 43, Scott is comfortably settled. He isn't chasing a startup unicorn or a venture capital payday. His aspiration is less about climbing a corporate ladder and more about building a better one for others. He dreams of leading a project that demonstrably lowers barriers to mental healthcare access for young adults. He finds satisfaction not in stock options, but in the quiet, profound victory of seeing someone\u2019s life made just a little bit easier through thoughtful, human-centered design."

His dad wasn't just teaching a sequence of events; he was trying to make Scott understand the fear of the soldiers, the ambition of the kings. That day, Scott realized history wasn't about dates, but about human experience. This quiet lesson in empathy would become the bedrock of his entire worldview and, eventually, his career.\n\n2.\nThe memory from the call center is still visceral. He was twenty-three, listening to an elderly man try to navigate a labyrinthine website to file an insurance claim for his recently deceased wife. The man\u2019s voice, thick with grief and confusion, cracked. Scott felt a hot, useless anger\u2014not at the man, but at the careless system that was compounding his pain. In that moment of shared frustration, his purpose crystallized: he wasn\u2019t meant to explain broken things, but to fix them so no one else had to suffer through them.\n\n3.\nOn his third date with Clara, they were walking in Golden Gate Park when she stopped to critique a public health poster about vaccinations. She spoke with a fiery, articulate passion about its confusing message and missed opportunity to genuinely connect with the community it was meant to serve. He felt a profound jolt of recognition. Here was someone who saw the world as he did: a series of design problems with immense human consequences. He knew then that he had found his partner.\n\n4.\nAt thirty-three, he sat in a sterile conference room celebrating a 0.8% increase in \"add-to-cart\" clicks after a month of obsessive A/B testing on a button\u2019s color. As his colleagues high-fived, a deep sense of hollowness washed over him. All this talent, all this data, all this human effort, all for a click. The victory felt profoundly meaningless. That evening, he went home and told Clara he was quitting. He needed to build something that mattered more than a shopping cart.\n\n5.\nJust last year, watching a usability test from behind a one-way mirror, he saw it. A college student, struggling with anxiety, was testing a new telehealth portal prototype. After fumbling with the old version, she navigated the new one with ease, scheduling an appointment in seconds. She didn't say anything, but she let out a small, quiet sigh of relief. That tiny, private sound was the loudest victory Scott had ever heard. It was the entire reason he did his job."
