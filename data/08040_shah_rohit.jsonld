Born in Fremont to an engineer father and an accountant mother, his childhood was a blueprint for a stable, respectable life in Silicon Valley. He was expected to follow a similar path, and for a while, he played the part. However, while his parents saw spreadsheets and code, Rohit saw composition and color in the world around him. Secretly, he spent his weekends taking the BART into San Francisco, losing himself for hours in the de Young Museum and SFMOMA, absorbing the language of art that felt more native to him than the Gujarati spoken at home.\n\nThe first major turning point was his application to UC Berkeley. He allowed his parents to believe he was pursuing economics, but he declared a major in Art History. The reveal caused a rift, one that took years to mend. To prove his choice wasn't a flight of fancy, Rohit poured his energy into his career, armed with his degree and an innate understanding of aesthetics. He started as an unpaid intern at a small gallery in Hayes Valley, distinguishing himself with a keen eye for emerging talent and a surprising knack for market analysis\u2014a trait he grudgingly credited to his upbringing. He quickly rose through the ranks, moving to a larger international firm, and at 30, he is now the Head Buyer.\n\nRohit\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. He lives in a minimalist SoMa loft in a converted warehouse, a space that doubles as his office, hence the 0.0-mile commute. His days are a disciplined mix of digital deep dives\u2014tracking artists on Instagram, monitoring auction results\u2014and physical immersion in the city\u2019s art scene, from studio visits in the Dogpatch to gallery openings in the Mission. His social circle is composed of artists, fellow curators, and tech investors looking to diversify into art.\n\nThough outwardly successful, Rohit feels a persistent pull to do more. He is deeply connected to San Francisco not just as a marketplace, but as a crucible of innovation and culture. His ultimate dream is to open his own gallery in the city\u2014a space that champions diverse, local artists who are blurring the lines between technology and traditional media. For Rohit, it\u2019s not just about buying and selling art; it\u2019s about shaping the future narrative of the city he chose as his own."
