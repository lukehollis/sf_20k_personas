Raised in a meticulously planned suburb of Portland, Oregon, she was the younger child in a stable, loving family that valued predictability above all else. Her upbringing was comfortable but creatively stifling. Seeking an escape, she pursued a passion, not a profession, at the University of Oregon, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. She dreamed of curating exhibits, of living a life surrounded by beauty and historical context.\n\nThe reality after graduation was harsh. The art world was insular and low-paying. After a year of barista work and unpaid internships, pragmatism won out. She followed a boyfriend to San Francisco, drawn by his tech job and the city\u2019s vibrant promise. She fell into administrative work through a temp agency, discovering a surprising aptitude for the meticulous organization required to keep a chaotic tech startup running smoothly. While the work wasn't her passion, the steady paycheck was a newfound freedom.\n\nThe key turning point came two years later when the relationship that brought her to the city dissolved. Stranded but resolute, Sarah decided to stay. It was then that San Francisco shifted from being his city to *her* city. She found her own apartment in the Inner Richmond, a small one-bedroom that, since the pandemic, has also become her full-time office.\n\nHer days are structured by a 0.0-mile commute from her bed to her desk. She manages calendars, coordinates meetings, and wrangles expense reports via Slack and email. But her life truly begins at 5 PM when she closes her laptop. She religiously walks through Golden Gate Park, her Art History background allowing her to see the intentional design in the landscapes and the architectural flourishes of the de Young Museum.\n\nSarah\u2019s social circle is small but tight-knit, composed of a few friends from former jobs. Her dream of a life in art hasn\u2019t died; it has just transformed. She runs a semi-anonymous Instagram account cataloging the hidden murals and public sculptures of San Francisco, a private passion project that brings her immense joy. She hopes to one day save enough to consult for companies on incorporating local art into their office spaces. For now, Sarah is content. Her job funds her life, but it is her connection to the visual tapestry of her adopted city that truly sustains her."
