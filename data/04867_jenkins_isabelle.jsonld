The daughter of a Korean immigrant mother, a master of traditional embroidery (*jasu*), and a Caucasian-American history professor, Isabelle grew up in a quiet Sacramento suburb. Her childhood home was a study in contrasts: her father\u2019s shelves of academic tomes stood opposite her mother's vibrant silks and intricate threadwork. For Isabelle, her mother\u2019s craft wasn\u2019t just decoration; it was a language of heritage, a silent narrative of a land she\u2019d never seen.\n\nHer academic path seemed set to follow her father's, leading her to pursue a Master's in Art History. The turning point came during a summer trip to visit her maternal grandmother in Jeonju, South Korea. There, she saw folk art not in sterile galleries but as a living, breathing part of daily life\u2014in the earthenware kimchi pots, the hand-dyed hanbok, and the humble wooden furniture. This visceral connection to the art of the people became her obsession. She re-focused her graduate studies on material culture and folkloric arts, understanding that an object\u2019s true value lay in the story of its creation and use.\n\nLanding the curator position at San Francisco\u2019s Museum of Craft and Folk Art felt less like a career move and more like coming home. Her life is deeply integrated with her work; her 0.0-mile commute is from her minimalist loft apartment on the building's top floor down to the galleries. Her days are spent researching acquisitions, designing exhibits, and passionately advocating for artisans whose work is often overlooked. She sees San Francisco, with its vibrant murals, diverse street fashion, and rich immigrant traditions, as a living extension of her museum.\n\nWhile her demanding career leaves little room for deep romance, Isabelle's social life is a rich tapestry of artists, academics, and the dedicated patrons she\u2019s cultivated. Her dream is to curate a groundbreaking exhibition that uses technology to tell the ancient stories behind folk crafts, connecting a new generation to the soul of handcrafted objects. For Isabelle, her life's work is ensuring these fragile, beautiful histories are never forgotten."

Her father\u2019s books told stories with words, but this was a story told in knots and color. In that quiet Sacramento living room, she felt the weight of a history she didn\u2019t just read, but could touch. It taught her that some legacies are held in the hands, not just the mind. This moment was the root of her lifelong reverence for craft.\n\n2.\nShe was 24, watching her grandmother in Jeonju. The old woman's hands, stained from gochugaru, expertly packed kimchi into a dark earthenware pot. It wasn't an artifact; it was a vessel for life, for sustenance. The earthy smell of the clay mixed with the sharp scent of fermentation. That visceral moment shattered her academic view of art. It wasn't something to be observed; it was something to be lived. This memory redirected her entire professional life, from art history to material culture.\n\n3.\nHer first night in the museum loft, she woke at 3 a.m. to the city\u2019s muffled hum. Silence, then the realization: just below her floor, sleeping in the climate-controlled dark, were textiles and carvings from a dozen cultures. She wasn\u2019t just a curator; she was a guardian, living above the quiet breath of a hundred artisans\u2019 legacies. The profound sense of purpose she felt in that moment cemented her choice. This wasn't a job; it was her life\u2019s home.\n\n4.\nOne Sunday, a few months after moving to San Francisco, she wandered through Balmy Alley in the Mission. She watched a young artist on a ladder delicately repaint a detail on a vibrant mural as a family posed for a photo below. The creation, appreciation, and documentation were all happening at once\u2014a living exhibition on a garage door. It was a potent reminder that folk art isn't just history; it's a continuous, unfolding story, and the city was her greatest gallery.\n\n5.\nTwo years into her curatorship, she saw a teenager scroll through his phone, utterly bored by the intricate Peruvian weaving in front of him. The past felt inert, trapped behind glass. Instead of frustration, a spark ignited. What if his screen could show the weaver\u2019s hands, the mountain village, the story spun into the wool? That moment of disconnect didn't feel like failure; it felt like a challenge. It became the blueprint for her most ambitious professional dream: to bridge the ancient with the immediate."
