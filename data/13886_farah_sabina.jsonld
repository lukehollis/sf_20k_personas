Growing up in a home filled with the scent of saffron rice and turpentine, she learned early that there were many languages beyond words. Her quiet, observant nature was shaped by watching her parents navigate their different worlds with a deep, intellectual love. The true turning point, however, was her younger brother, who struggled with a severe stutter. Sabina saw how he retreated into himself, only to blossom when he was drawing, his sketchbook a vibrant world where he was fluent and fearless. This formative experience planted the seed for her future.\n\nShe pursued her undergraduate degree in psychology at UC Santa Cruz before finding her true calling in a graduate program for Counseling Psychology with an Art Therapy concentration. San Francisco, a city she had always admired for its embrace of the unconventional, became her home. Today, she is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) at a community health center in the Mission District, working primarily with adolescents navigating trauma, identity, and family conflict. Her small office is a sanctuary of paper, clay, and paint, where she helps teens unlock unspoken narratives and find healing not in what they say, but in what they create.\n\nSabina lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is a ritual of self-care before she gives her energy to others: a cup of strong tea, a 3.5-mile MUNI ride with a podcast on social justice, and an evening run through the foggy trails of Golden Gate Park. Recently out of a long-term relationship, she finds solstice in her close-knit circle of friends and in her own artistic practice\u2014small, abstract watercolors that process the emotional weight of her day.\n\nShe feels deeply connected to San Francisco's resilience and its patchwork of communities. Sabina\u2019s dream is to one day open a small, sliding-scale private practice in her neighborhood, making art therapy more accessible. She envisions a space where every person, regardless of their background, can find their own visual language and begin to heal."

Then, he grabbed his sketchbook. Sabina watched, mesmerized, as his small hands brought a fierce, intricate dragon to life on the page. In those pencil strokes, he was powerful and clear. A wave of understanding washed over her: some voices don't need sound. It was the moment, around age ten, she knew her life\u2019s work would be to listen to the pictures.\n\n2.\nHer first grad school practicum was at a shelter for unhoused youth. The air felt heavy, the teens guarded. An instructor simply placed a block of clay in the center of the table. For an hour, no one spoke, but hands were busy\u2014pounding, shaping, smoothing. Sabina felt a profound sense of rightness, of coming home to a language she\u2019d known her whole life. This city, she realized, understood that healing could be a quiet, tactile thing. She knew then that she would stay in San Francisco.\n\n3.\nIt was with a quiet 15-year-old girl in her Mission office who hadn\u2019t spoken about her family trauma. For weeks, she only painted gray squares. Then one session, she picked up a crimson pastel and drew a single, jagged red line through the center of the gray. She looked up at Sabina, her eyes filled with tears. It was a confession, a wound, a boundary\u2014all at once. Sabina felt not pride, but a deep, shared humanity. This sacred trust reaffirmed her entire professional purpose.\n\n4.\nThe evening after she moved the last of her ex-partner\u2019s boxes out, the fog in Golden Gate Park was thick enough to swallow sound. She just ran, her breath a ragged rhythm against the grief. She stopped at Stow Lake, watching the mist obscure the opposite shore. It felt like her future\u2014unseen and uncertain. But the damp, earthy smell grounded her. In that solitude, she understood her own healing could be an abstract process, a slow bleed of heartbroken color onto a blank page.\n\n5.\nLast week, walking home on Clement Street, she saw an elderly Chinese man teaching his granddaughter calligraphy on a bench, their heads bent in concentration. Next to them, two teens skateboarded past, their laughter echoing in Spanish. The sight filled her with a quiet joy. This intricate, layered community was the San Francisco she loved. It crystallized her dream: to create a space right here in the Inner Richmond, a small sanctuary where every one of these languages\u2014ink, paint, word, and silence\u2014was equally heard."
