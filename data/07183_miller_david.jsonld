            "value": "David Miller\u2019s life has been a study in shrinking scales and deepening focus. Raised in the orderly suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, he was instilled with a Midwestern belief in civic duty and pragmatic solutions. This led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy from the University of Michigan, convinced he could engineer better systems for people.\n\nHis early career began, as it does for many idealists, in Washington D.C. However, the immense, impersonal scale of federal bureaucracy quickly wore him down. The change he sought to create felt abstract and distant. A job opening for a policy analyst in San Francisco in his late twenties offered a compelling alternative: a city that fancied itself a laboratory for progressive ideas, where the impact of his work on housing or transportation might actually be visible on the streets.\n\nFor over a decade, David thrived, rising to Senior Policy Analyst. He became an expert in the city\u2019s labyrinthine housing regulations, a field that provided endless intellectual challenges and profound frustrations. The key turning point wasn\u2019t a single event, but a slow erosion. A promising affordable housing project he championed for years became mired in committees, and the professional burnout coincided with the quiet end of a long-term relationship.\n\nNow 44, his world has contracted. The pandemic normalized his 0.0-mile commute, and he never went back to the office. His one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley is his entire professional world. His daily routine is meticulously structured: a morning walk to a favorite cafe for an oat milk latte, hours spent dissecting zoning codes and drafting reports, and an afternoon stroll through Patricia\u2019s Green. His connection to San Francisco is now intensely local. He knows the names of the baristas, the grocers, and the homeless man who sleeps near his building.\n\nHis grand dreams of systemic change have been replaced by a more tempered, focused aspiration: to see one significant housing project through from proposal to occupancy. He hopes to unclog a small part of the bureaucratic artery he knows so well, creating something tangible and lasting in the few square miles he now calls his entire world."
