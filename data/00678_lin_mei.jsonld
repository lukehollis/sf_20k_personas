Born in the Sunset District to first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood was scented with the salty air and the diligent hum of her parents' small grocery store. She watched them work relentlessly, their pragmatism and sacrifice steering her away from their path of precarious entrepreneurship and towards the promise of stability. While her parents hoped she\u2019d become a doctor, Mei found her calling not in clinical practice, but in the systems that supported it. She was drawn to order and efficiency, a stark contrast to the beautiful chaos of her family\u2019s life.\n\nAfter earning her undergraduate degree from UC Davis, she returned to the city to complete a Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA). Her career began with a clear, upward trajectory within one of the city\u2019s major hospital networks. The turning point came a decade ago when her father suffered a heart attack. Navigating the labyrinth of insurance claims and hospital bureaucracy for him ignited a fierce passion in Mei. She wasn't just managing budgets and staff schedules anymore; she was fighting to make a convoluted system more humane from the inside.\n\nNow 40, Mei is a senior administrator who, since the pandemic, has worked entirely from her sleek Hayes Valley condo\u2014hence her zero-mile commute. Her days are a disciplined sequence of Zoom meetings and complex spreadsheets, managing departmental operations across the bay. Her professional life is a success, but her personal life feels muted. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of her demanding career. Her social circle is small but loyal, consisting of a few friends from her graduate program who meet for wine in North Beach or brunch in her neighborhood.\n\nLately, Mei feels a quiet yearning for something more. The stability she chased has been achieved, but it has cost her spontaneity. Her aspiration is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder, but about broadening her life\u2019s blueprint. She dreams of consulting for a health-tech startup that values innovation over inertia, of finally taking that solo trip to Japan, and of building connections that aren't scheduled in a calendar. She is a quintessential San Franciscan: rooted in the city's history, professionally successful, yet searching for a deeper sense of purpose beyond the walls of her perfectly curated life."
