Raised in Cupertino, the daughter of a first-generation Taiwanese hardware engineer and an American-born Chinese schoolteacher, her childhood was a structured regimen of academic excellence, piano lessons, and the implicit expectation of success. She was diligent and sharp, absorbing her parents\u2019 work ethic while quietly craving a world with more nuance than a circuit board.\n\nShe excelled, earning a B.A. in Economics from UC Berkeley before securing a spot in Stanford\u2019s prestigious MBA program. It was there she found her footing, not just in corporate strategy, but in her personal life. She met Mark Wright, a thoughtful architecture student whose creative spirit balanced her analytical mind. They married shortly after graduation, and her choice to hyphenate her name\u2014Tan-Wright\u2014was a deliberate act of embracing both her heritage and her new partnership.\n\nWhile her peers flocked to established tech giants, Mei-Ling made a pivotal choice. She joined a boutique management consulting firm, drawn to the high-stakes problem-solving for a diverse roster of tech and biotech startups. The work was grueling, but it gave her a sense of direct impact that a larger corporation couldn't offer.\n\nToday, Mei-Ling\u2019s life is centered in her sleek Hayes Valley condo, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her standing desk. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls, data analysis, and crafting strategic roadmaps for clients. She decompresses by jogging through the Panhandle or meeting Mark for dinner at a favorite neighborhood spot. Her connection to San Francisco isn't one of landmarks, but of routine and curated locality\u2014the specific coffee shop with the best oat milk latte, the Sunday farmers' market, the independent bookstore on the corner.\n\nBeneath her composed, professional exterior, Mei-Ling harbors a growing ambition. She dreams of leveraging her expertise to launch a venture capital fund focused on investing in underrepresented founders. She has achieved the stability her parents dreamed of for her; now, she is quietly planning how to build a legacy defined by her own values."
