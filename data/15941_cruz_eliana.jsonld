The daughter of a Filipino father who worked in construction and a Costa Rican mother who cleaned houses, she grew up in Daly City, perpetually straddling two vibrant cultures. Her official \"Other\" designation on forms felt less like a box and more like a true description of her identity\u2014a blend she found both enriching and isolating. This early experience in understanding cultural nuances planted the seed for her future career.\n\nThe true turning point came during her teenage years when her younger brother struggled with severe, undiagnosed anxiety. Witnessing her parents' difficulty in navigating a school system that lacked the resources to help him lit a fire in Eliana. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a psychology degree not for academic prestige, but to gain the language and tools to help families like hers.\n\nAfter graduating, she found her calling as a Behavioral Health Coach, working with students in an outpatient program. Her job is a perfect synthesis of her skills and passion. She doesn't just offer therapy; she provides practical strategies, helping young people manage stress, set goals, and feel understood. Her daily 3.8-mile commute on the Muni from her Inner Richmond apartment gives her time to decompress, listening to podcasts before diving into the emotionally demanding work.\n\nNow 28, Eliana lives a life of careful intention. Her $85,000 income affords a small apartment shared with a roommate, but requires mindful budgeting. Evenings are often spent with a run through Golden Gate Park, her sanctuary of fog and eucalyptus, or cooking at home. Her social life is a close-knit circle of college friends who meet for cheap eats in the Mission or trivia nights at a neighborhood pub.\n\nSan Francisco is more than a city to Eliana; it\u2019s a reflection of her own multifaceted identity. She feels at home in its diverse, often chaotic, embrace. Her dream is to eventually pursue a Master's in Social Work to become a licensed therapist, deepening her ability to help. For now, she finds profound meaning in her work, knowing that for every student she helps, she's honoring the little brother she once fought so hard for."

A cousin asked, \u201cSo what *are* you?\u201d and Eliana felt a flush of confused shame. She wasn't just one thing. That moment wasn't about the food; it was the first time she realized her identity wasn't a simple answer, but a space she had to define for herself, planting a seed of deep empathy for others in-between.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she sat on a too-small chair outside the principal\u2019s office. She heard the muffled voices inside\u2014her parents\u2019 earnest, accented English and a school counselor\u2019s dismissive tone about her brother\u2019s \u201cbehavioral issues.\u201d He wasn't misbehaving; he was terrified. The feeling of helpless rage that washed over her was suffocating. In that cold hallway, her life\u2019s purpose was forged: she would learn the language of the system, not to join it, but to dismantle it for kids like him.\n\n3.\nIt was a rainy Tuesday during her sophomore year at SF State. Her professor was lecturing on cultural barriers in mental healthcare, using the exact phrases\u2014\"cultural stigma,\" \"systemic misunderstanding\"\u2014that had defined her family's struggle. Eliana felt tears well up, not of sadness, but of profound recognition. She wasn't just angry anymore; she had found the framework, the vocabulary for her fight. Her personal pain was becoming her professional purpose right there in that lecture hall.\n\n4.\nLast year, a quiet Salvadoran student who hadn't spoken for weeks finally looked at her and described the buzzing anxiety in his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s like static,\u201d he whispered. In him, she saw her brother. But now, she wasn\u2019t helpless. She nodded, handed him a grounding stone, and said, \u201cI know the static. Let\u2019s turn down the volume together.\u201d The boy's small, relieved sigh felt like a victory, a healing of a wound she\u2019d carried since she was a teenager.\n\n5.\nOn a draining evening a few months ago, she was running her usual loop in Golden Gate Park. The fog was so thick it muffled the city, leaving only the scent of eucalyptus and the rhythm of her feet on the damp trail. As she crested a small hill, the Sutro Tower materialized from the gray mist. She stopped, breathing hard, feeling completely and utterly part of the foggy, complicated landscape. It wasn't an escape; it was a profound feeling of belonging."
