Born and raised in the Richmond District, she is the only child of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Clement Street for thirty years. Her childhood was steeped in the rhythms of the neighborhood: the clang of the 38 Geary bus, the scent of fresh pastries from the Chinese bakeries, and the unspoken expectation of filial duty. Her parents, valuing security above all else, encouraged a practical path.\n\nAfter graduating from George Washington High School, Sarah felt adrift. While friends left for universities across the country, she stayed, held by a sense of obligation and financial limitations. The turning point came when her mother had a prolonged health scare. Navigating the complex world of clinics and specialists, Sarah discovered a quiet competence in caregiving. She was the one who could patiently translate medical jargon for her parents and soothe their anxieties. This experience gave her a purpose. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Medical Assisting.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, Sarah has worked as a medical assistant at a family practice just a few blocks from her childhood home. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from the in-law unit she rents from her now-retired parents. At the clinic, she is invaluable, a calming presence who can effortlessly switch between English and Cantonese, acting as a cultural and linguistic bridge for the neighborhood's older residents.\n\nHer life is one of routine and deep-rooted connection. Evenings are often spent sharing meals with her parents, her social life a small, tight circle of friends from high school. While the city around her transforms with tech booms and soaring rents, Sarah\u2019s world remains anchored. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s the quiet, almost impossible hope of one day affording a small condo in the Richmond, ensuring she can care for her parents as they age. She is a pillar of her community, a testament to the fact that the true heart of San Francisco lies not in its glittering downtown, but in the steadfast residents who sustain its neighborhoods."
