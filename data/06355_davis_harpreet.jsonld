            "value": "Harpreet Singh Davis was a name that told a story before he ever spoke a word. Born in Punjab, India, he was adopted as an infant by a loving, progressive couple from Berkeley, Ellen and Mark Davis. They raised him with immense affection, encouraging him to embrace both his given name, Harpreet, and the rich cultural tapestry of the Bay Area. Despite this security, his childhood was marked by a quiet sense of duality\u2014being the only South Asian face in his class, navigating questions about his origins with a story that was loving, but not entirely his own.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Harpreet enrolled at SF State, drawn to the city's promise of anonymity and reinvention. He dabbled in art history, captivated by how objects and images held entire histories within them. But his educational journey was cut short. The \"some college\" on his record is a testament to a life interrupted when his adoptive mother, Ellen, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Harpreet dropped out to become her primary caregiver, a role that would fundamentally reshape his future. Over the next few years, he discovered a quiet, profound purpose in the demanding rhythms of caregiving\u2014a calling he had never anticipated.\n\nAfter his mother passed, the path forward was clear. He became a certified Patient Care Assistant, finding that the patience and empathy forged in his own home were his greatest assets. For the past fifteen years, Harpreet has worked at a residential care facility in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of his life; he lives in a small staff apartment on the ground floor. His days are a predictable loop of assisting residents with meals, medication, and mobility, but within that routine, he finds deep connection. He is the keeper of stories for those whose memories are fading, a steady presence in the final chapters of their lives.\n\nNow at 51, his social circle is small but meaningful\u2014a weekly coffee with a head nurse, a shared smile with the facility\u2019s cook. He finds peace walking through Golden Gate Park on his days off. His aspirations are not for wealth or status, but for continuity. He dreams of one day visiting Punjab, not to find a family he never knew, but to stand in the place where his own story began, finally connecting the two halves of his name and his life."
