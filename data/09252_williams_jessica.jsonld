Her father, a skilled mechanic from the Philippines, and her mother, a vibrant homemaker from Mexico, instilled in her a strong work ethic and a deep sense of compassion. Growing up in the diverse Mission District, Jessica witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by many in her community \u2013 poverty, language barriers, and limited access to resources. These experiences ignited a desire within her to help others navigate the complexities of life.\n\nHer educational journey led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Social Work. During her studies, she volunteered at local shelters and non-profits, gaining practical experience and solidifying her commitment to the field. After graduation, she pursued her LCSW license, driven by a passion to provide more specialized support to individuals and families.\n\nA significant turning point came during her early career while working with at-risk youth in a challenging public school. Witnessing the profound impact trauma had on their lives, she realized the critical need for accessible mental health services within educational settings. This experience shaped her focus, leading her to her current role as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a healthcare organization that partners with local schools.\n\nJessica\u2019s personal life is anchored by a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom she met in college and through her work. She values deep connections and often spends weekends exploring the city\u2019s parks or trying new restaurants with her friends. While currently single, she dreams of finding a supportive partner with whom she can build a family.\n\nHer current lifestyle in a modest apartment in the Richmond District is centered around her work and community engagement. Her daily routine involves an early start, a comfortable commute via public transportation, and long, fulfilling days providing counseling and support to students. Evenings are often spent unwinding with a book or attending community meetings related to mental health advocacy.\n\nJessica feels deeply connected to San Francisco. The city's energy, diversity, and unwavering spirit of resilience resonate with her. She appreciates her neighborhood's quiet charm and proximity to both the ocean and Golden Gate Park, finding solace and inspiration in these natural spaces. Her hopes for the future are rooted in making a tangible difference in the lives of young people in San Francisco, advocating for greater access to mental healthcare, and ultimately, contributing to a more equitable and compassionate city."

A surge of immense pride and gratitude washed over her \u2013 for their sacrifices, her journey, and the tangible step towards the future she\u2019d always envisioned. It solidified her resolve to use her education to uplift others. This was her early adulthood, a pivotal moment of accomplishment.\n\n2.  Holding the hand of a tearful middle school student in the school counselor's office, listening intently as they finally opened up about their struggles. A quiet click happened within her; this was why she chose this path. The weight of responsibility mixed with a profound sense of purpose fueled her dedication to providing that safe space. It was a defining moment in her early career.\n\n3.  Sharing a picnic blanket in Golden Gate Park with college friends, the scent of eucalyptus in the air, laughing until their sides hurt. In that ease and genuine connection, she found belonging. It taught her the vital importance of chosen family and the strength found in shared vulnerability, a touchstone throughout her young adulthood.\n\n4.  Watching her father expertly repair a neighbors\u2019 car, patiently explaining each step despite the language barrier. His quiet dedication and willingness to help, expecting nothing in return, deeply impacted her. It showed her the power of simple acts of service and instilled in her own desire to heal and fix things, even in the human heart. This was a childhood memory that shaped her core values.\n\n5.  Walking along Ocean Beach as the fog rolled in, the vastness of the Pacific stretching before her. A sense of peace settled over her, a reminder of the city\u2019s unique blend of nature and grit. It became her go-to place for solace and reflection, reinforcing her deep connection to San Francisco and her commitment to its people. This was a recent memory, a recurring source of peace."
