Adopted at six months old by a warm, Irish-American couple, he was raised in the suburbs of Sacramento. His parents, a teacher and a firefighter, gave him a loving home, but Daniel always navigated a quiet sense of displacement. With his Korean features and Irish surname, he felt like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit in the predominantly white or the small, established Asian communities of his youth. This feeling of being an observer, of existing between worlds, planted the seed for his life\u2019s work.\n\nHis educational journey was a search for answers. He attended UC Davis, initially undeclared, before discovering sociology and psychology. It was during an internship at a youth services center that he found his calling. Seeing social workers help families navigate immense systemic and personal challenges, he recognized a path where his innate empathy could be a professional tool. He moved to San Francisco to earn his Master of Social Work from SF State, drawn to the city's promise of acceptance and its diverse tapestry of identities.\n\nNow 45, Daniel is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, splitting his time between a public high school and a community health clinic. His days are a marathon of empathy, helping teenagers manage trauma and families access critical resources. The work is draining but deeply fulfilling, a way of giving others the sense of stability he sometimes felt he lacked.\n\nDaniel lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset. His routine is his anchor: a morning coffee from a cafe on 9th Avenue, followed by a crowded N-Judah ride downtown. He unwinds by running through Golden Gate Park, the fog a familiar comfort against his skin. After a long-term relationship ended years ago, strained by the emotional demands of his career, his social life is a small, tight circle of friends, most of whom also work in helping professions. San Francisco is more than a home; it's the place where his complex identity feels not just accepted, but understood. His quietest dream is to one day visit Busan, not to search for his birth family, but simply to stand in the city of his origin and feel a sense of peace."

The professor asked them to state their \u201cpositionality.\u201d But as others shared their complex identities, Daniel felt a shift. For the first time, being a Korean adoptee with an Irish name wasn\u2019t a source of confusion, but a point of view. It was a lens, not a liability. In that moment of academic acceptance, a deep, personal validation clicked into place, turning his lifelong feeling of displacement into his greatest strength.\n\n2.\nThe memory is of a silent teenager in his small office at the high school, about ten years ago. For months, there was nothing. Then, one Tuesday, the boy quietly described a scene of chaos at home. Daniel felt a dual shock: the vicarious trauma, and the profound, electric honor of being trusted with it. The work was no longer theoretical. It cemented his commitment, but also taught him the true weight of the empathy he carried, a weight that would reshape the boundaries of his own life.\n\n3.\nIt was seven years ago, in the apartment he still lives in. His then-partner, packing a box, said quietly, \u201cYou bring all their pain home with you, Daniel, but there\u2019s no room left for yours. Or for mine.\u201d The words weren\u2019t an accusation, but a sad truth that landed with devastating clarity. He realized then that his career didn\u2019t just demand his time; it consumed his emotional space. The breakup wasn\u2019t a failure, but a painful lesson in the personal cost of his calling.\n\n4.\nHe often recalls a specific run in Golden Gate Park in his late thirties, after a brutal day at the clinic. The fog was so thick it felt like a physical presence, muffling the city and blurring the trees into soft silhouettes. The cold air on his skin felt cleansing. It wasn\u2019t loneliness he felt, but a deep, restorative solitude. That was when the fog stopped being weather and became a comfort, a reliable blanket that could hold the world at bay and give him space to breathe.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, flipping channels late at night, he landed on a travel show about South Korea. He watched footage of Busan\u2019s modern, sprawling docks and neon-lit streets, a place of vibrant energy. He felt no ache of loss, but a quiet, detached curiosity. It wasn't the \"what if\" of a different life, but a simple acknowledgment of a starting point. That night, his dream of visiting shifted from a search for answers to a desire to simply stand there, a complete person witnessing his own origin story."
