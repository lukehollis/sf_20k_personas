Born in Seoul, she was adopted at six months by a loving Irish-American couple and raised in the quiet, supportive suburbs of Marin County. While her childhood was happy, the feeling of being an outsider in a largely white community fueled an early fascination with visual language. Art became her first real home\u2014a place where identity could be constructed, questioned, and celebrated without words.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree, where an art history class transformed her path. She set aside a more \"practical\" career track for a graduate degree in Arts Administration from NYU. After cutting her teeth in the competitive New York gallery scene, she felt the pull of the Bay Area, seeking a community-focused role over a purely commercial one. San Francisco offered the perfect blend of cutting-edge art and social consciousness.\n\nA key turning point was landing a grant writer position at a prominent SoMa arts non-profit. Over a decade, she rose through the ranks, her sharp mind and genuine passion making her indispensable. Now, as Director of Programs, she thrives on the controlled chaos of shepherding ambitious projects for underrepresented artists. Her biggest professional heartbreak and triumph was curating a landmark exhibition that nearly fell apart due to funding, only to become a national success after she secured a last-minute benefactor.\n\nHer daily routine is a San Francisco ritual: a morning coffee from a local Mission caf\u00e9, followed by the 3.8-mile commute on the 14-Mission MUNI line to her SoMa office. Her life is rooted in her vibrant, rent-controlled apartment, surrounded by the Mission's murals and the energy of her chosen neighborhood. While a serious long-term relationship ended two years ago, her life is full with a close-knit circle of friends, weekend gallery-hopping, and pilates classes.\n\nAt 40, Nadia feels both established and restless. Her dream is to launch a revolutionary residency program for emerging BIPOC artists. On a more personal level, she\u2019s quietly saving for a trip to South Korea\u2014not to search for her birth family, but to finally walk the streets of the city where her story began, connecting with a heritage she\u2019s so far only known through art."

Instead of drawing the family dog, she drew a face\u2014her face. She focused on the eyes, making them bigger, more searching. When her dad hung it in his office, not saying it was good, but that it \"felt like you,\" she understood. This was a language she could control, a way to define herself before anyone else could. It was the first brick laid in her true home.\n\n2.\nThe moment of truth wasn't an email, but a quiet nod. It was the frantic opening night of her landmark exhibition, a year before her 40th birthday. The show was alive only because she\u2019d convinced a last-minute benefactor to save it. Across the crowded room, he caught her eye and gave a small, approving dip of his chin. The relief was so profound it almost buckled her knees. That single gesture affirmed her grit and transformed her from a capable employee into a true leader.\n\n3.\nA rainy Tuesday, maybe five years ago. Nadia was staring out the window of the 14-Mission as it rumbled down the street. The smeared neon of a taqueria reflected off a vibrant, rain-slicked mural she\u2019d seen a thousand times. In that instant, a profound sense of peace settled over her. This chaotic, beautiful city wasn\u2019t a place she was passing through; it was her ecosystem. Unlike in her childhood, she wasn\u2019t an outsider here; she was just part of the view.\n\n4.\nSix months after her long-term relationship ended, she felt adrift. A friend dragged her to a tiny pop-up gallery in an alley off 24th Street. Standing in the crowded room, a cup of cheap wine in hand, listening to an artist passionately explain their work, she felt a switch flip. Her world hadn't shrunk; its center had just shifted back to her. Her foundation wasn't a person, but this vibrant community she had built for herself, one gallery opening at a time.\n\n5.\nIn her late twenties, during her first grant-writing job in SoMa, she had to deny funding to a brilliant young sculptor. She remembered the artist\u2019s quiet devastation and her own feeling of powerlessness against the budget. The memory became a hot coal in her gut. It wasn't just about art; it was about the artists. That painful \u201cno\u201d planted the seed for her ultimate ambition: to one day build something where she would always have the power to say \u201cyes\u201d to vital new voices."
