Born and raised in the city, his upbringing was a patchwork of Outer Richmond apartments and a childhood spent in the care of his grandmother while his parents worked multiple, ever-changing service jobs. His family history was a collection of half-told stories from different continents, leaving David with a sense of being from everywhere and nowhere all at once, identifying simply as a San Franciscan.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma, earned more through stubbornness than academic passion. The world of universities felt distant and abstract compared to the immediate need to earn a living. The subsequent decade was a blur of restaurant kitchens, security guard shifts, and delivery gigs\u2014a firsthand tour of the city\u2019s working-class underbelly. The turning point came not in a classroom, but in a sterile hospital waiting room. His own father, uninsured and suffering from a chronic condition, became lost in a maze of paperwork and medical jargon. David took it upon himself to become his advocate, spending months learning to navigate the labyrinthine healthcare and social services systems.\n\nThis difficult, personal journey became his true education. He discovered a talent for cutting through bureaucracy and a deep, empathetic desire to help others do the same. A sharp-eyed director at a Tenderloin community clinic noticed him helping another family in the waiting room and offered him a volunteer position. Within two years, he was a full-time Community Health Worker.\n\nNow 37, David\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the Tenderloin. He lives in a small studio apartment just three blocks from the clinic, making his commute a short, observant walk. His days are spent on the streets and in cramped SROs, checking on elderly clients, connecting newly arrived families with food resources, and guiding people struggling with addiction toward recovery services. He is a familiar, trusted face in a community often invisible to the rest of the city. His relationships are forged in shared struggle and small victories\u2014a coffee with a fellow caseworker, a quiet conversation with a client who\u2019s been sober for a week. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth or escape; it\u2019s to see the people he serves find stability and dignity. He hopes to one day secure funding for a dedicated street outreach team, a small expansion of the work that gave his own life purpose."
