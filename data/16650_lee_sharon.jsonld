Raised in West Oakland, she was the daughter of a pragmatic auto mechanic and a meticulous high school administrator. From her father, she learned to appreciate the elegant logic of a well-running machine; from her mother, the importance of structure and planning. Her childhood was grounded in a community that valued hard work and resilience, qualities that propelled her across the bay.\n\nHer educational journey began at San Francisco State University, where she earned a B.S. in Business. After several years working as a junior production manager, she recognized a ceiling she was determined to break. Enrolling in the part-time MBA program at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business was her key turning point. Juggling a full-time job with rigorous coursework was grueling, but it honed her expertise in operations management and solidified her path to leadership. She steadily climbed the career ladder, eventually landing her current role as Director of Operations for a medical device manufacturer in the Dogpatch neighborhood.\n\nA brief marriage in her early thirties ended amicably, a life event that taught her the value of self-reliance and the importance of a chosen family. Her closest connections are a tight-knit group of professional women she\u2019s known for over twenty years; their regular dinners are a source of unwavering support and laughter. She is also a devoted aunt, actively mentoring her niece through her own college applications.\n\nToday, Sharon\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine and quiet satisfaction. She lives in a bright, airy apartment in Noe Valley. Her mornings begin with the calming ritual of the J-Church MUNI line, a 5.5-mile journey where she reads or listens to podcasts, mentally preparing for a day of optimizing production lines and managing supply chains. Weekends are for exploring the farmers' market on 24th Street, hiking in the Marin Headlands, and hosting small get-togethers. Though professionally accomplished, Sharon dreams of a future with more travel and creative pursuits. She aspires to eventually move into a consulting role, helping smaller, minority-owned businesses build efficient operations, a way of bringing the lessons from her career back to the community spirit of her upbringing."

In their West Oakland garage, her father was explaining a carburetor, pointing out the precise, non-negotiable ratio of fuel and air. It wasn\u2019t the engine that fascinated her, but the system\u2014the elegant, undeniable logic. That moment, years before her MBA, planted the seed. She understood that bringing order to chaos was its own kind of beauty, a principle that would define her career. This happened when she was around twelve.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 a.m. in the Haas library, a supply chain textbook open before her. The city lights glittered across the Bay, a world away from the exhaustion seeping into her bones. Juggling her job and the MBA program, she wondered if she\u2019d made a mistake. But then a quiet resolve hardened within her. This struggle was the price of entry to the life she wanted. That night wasn\u2019t just about passing a class; it was about proving to herself, in her late twenties, that she couldn\u2019t be broken.\n\n3.\nAfter the divorce papers were signed, it was the first Saturday morning alone in her Noe Valley apartment that felt real. The silence was immense, the space suddenly all hers. She made coffee, sat by the window, and watched the fog roll down the hills. There was no searing grief, just a quiet, profound sense of stillness. This was her life now, to build and own completely. It was in that solitude, in her early thirties, that she learned self-reliance wasn't a failure, but a foundation.\n\n4.\nShe\u2019d been passed over for a big promotion and the sting of failure was sharp. At their regular dinner spot in the Mission, she barely spoke. Then Maria told a ridiculous story about a client, Elena chimed in, and soon they were all laughing until tears streamed down their faces. In that moment, surrounded by their unwavering support, the lost job seemed insignificant. These women, her chosen family, were her real accomplishment. That dinner, nearly a decade ago, solidified what mattered most.\n\n5.\nOn a Tuesday morning, the J-Church rumbled past Dolores Park. She was listening to a podcast about startup founders when the idea crystallized. All her knowledge\u2014of systems, supply chains, efficiency\u2014could be a lifeline for small, minority-owned businesses like the ones she grew up around. The thought landed with the force of a revelation, cutting through the morning calm. The daily commute wasn't just a routine; it was the space where her future took shape. It was on that ride, just last spring, that her next chapter began."
