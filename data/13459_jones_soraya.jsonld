Born in Berkeley to an Iranian mother who fled Tehran in 1980 and a Black American father, a sociology professor, she grew up in a household where debates on policy, identity, and social justice were the dinner table norm. The \"Other\" box on forms was never a void for Soraya, but a space she filled with a rich, complex heritage that taught her to see systems from multiple perspectives.\n\nHer path seemed set when she enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Public Policy program. Her initial post-grad years were spent at a housing non-profit, full of idealism that quickly soured against the reality of bureaucratic inefficiency and outdated technology. A turning point came during a frustrating attempt to help a non-English-speaking family navigate a labyrinthine online application for aid. She realized her passion wasn't just policy, but its delivery. True equity, she decided, was impossible without accessible digital infrastructure.\n\nThis epiphany pivoted her career toward public administration, where she quickly found her niche managing digital services for the City of San Francisco. Now, at 40, Soraya is a respected and highly effective manager, earning her $175,000 salary by untangling digital red tape. She leads a team dedicated to making city websites and services user-friendly, secure, and accessible to all residents, a mission she takes personally.\n\nHer daily routine is an exercise in civic participation. She leaves her modern Hayes Valley condo, grabs a coffee from a local cafe, and takes the MUNI bus for the 3.5-mile ride to her office near City Hall. The commute is her time to observe the city she serves, noticing the people who are her end-users. After a decade in the city and the end of a long-term relationship three years ago, her social life is a curated circle of close friends.\n\nSoraya\u2019s dream is to one day lead a city-wide Digital Equity Initiative, ensuring every San Franciscan, regardless of income or background, has the tools and skills to thrive in the modern world. For her, San Francisco is not just a home; it is a complex, flawed, beautiful system she is determined to improve, one line of code and one simplified user interface at a time."

Her father was mapping redlined Oakland districts on a napkin while her mother quietly recalled the whispers before the revolution in Tehran. It wasn\u2019t jarring, but clarifying. Soraya saw two worlds, one story: how systems can fail people, how lines on a map and whispers in a market can steal a future. It wasn't politics; it was the blueprint of her life\u2019s work, handed to her over plates of ghormeh sabzi and cornbread.\n\n2.\nAt 26, in a stuffy non-profit office, she watched a mother\u2019s hope curdle into shame as a housing application timed out for the third time. The website was only in English. Soraya felt a hot, useless anger at the code, at the policy, at her own inability to help. In that moment of failure, her idealism didn't die; it was forged into something harder, more practical. Equity, she realized with burning clarity, wasn\u2019t a policy brief. It was a functioning 'Submit' button.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after he left, her Hayes Valley condo felt cavernous. She walked to Patricia\u2019s Green at dawn, nursing a coffee, watching the city wake up alone for the first time in years. The quiet wasn't peaceful, it was just\u2026 empty. But as the sun hit the steel sculptures, she saw not an end, but a system reset. The painful, necessary audit of her own life began there, teaching her to find stability within herself, not just in a partnership.\n\n4.\nOn the MUNI last year, she saw a man in a painter's uniform paying a parking ticket on his phone. He was using the new portal her team had spent 18 months fighting for, streamlining a ten-step nightmare into three simple screens. He finished, grunted in satisfaction, and put his phone away. No fanfare, no thank you. For Soraya, watching him, it was better than any award. It was proof. A small, invisible knot of civic frustration, finally untangled.\n\n5.\nJust last week, staring out the MUNI window on her way to City Hall, she saw them all. The tourist, the unhoused man, the tech worker, the nanny pushing a stroller\u2014each a potential user, each with a different need. The city wasn\u2019t an abstract problem to solve from her desk; it was this messy, vibrant, unequal ecosystem right outside the glass. The sight settled a deep resolve in her chest. This is the system, she thought. My system. And her work had never felt more urgent."
