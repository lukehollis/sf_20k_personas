The son of a pragmatic civil engineer and a socially conscious history teacher, Rob\u2019s upbringing was a blend of blueprints and big ideas. He watched his Rust Belt town grapple with industrial decline, an experience that instilled in him a deep-seated belief in the power of well-managed urban spaces to shape human lives.\n\nThis conviction led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy. In the late 1990s, he was drawn to San Francisco, a city that seemed to be a laboratory for the progressive ideals he\u2019d studied. He started as a junior planner, full of ambition, his desk cluttered with zoning maps and reports on community development. He rose steadily through the ranks of the City Planning Department, eventually becoming a Program Coordinator\u2014a crucial, if unglamorous, role managing the intricate dance of permits, public feedback, and political interests.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce a decade ago. It was amicable, but he recognized that his marriage had become a casualty of his devotion to his work. The long hours spent in community meetings and poring over environmental impact reports had left little room for his personal life. After, he doubled down on his connection to the city itself. He sold the Sunset district house he\u2019d shared with his ex-wife and bought a modern condo in Hayes Valley, just a few blocks from City Hall.\n\nToday, his life is defined by that proximity. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk past the opera house, coffee in hand from a local caf\u00e9 where the barista knows his order. His daily routine is a familiar rhythm of meetings, emails, and navigating bureaucracy. He\u2019s no longer the wide-eyed idealist; he\u2019s a pragmatist who has seen brilliant projects die in committee and mediocre ones thrive on political will. His friends are a tight-knit circle of fellow civic employees and long-time residents who share his cynical affection for the city.\n\nRob\u2019s dream is no longer to reinvent San Francisco, but to safeguard its soul. He hopes to shepherd a few key housing and public space initiatives to completion, leaving small, tangible marks on the city's fabric. He is a quiet guardian of the city\u2019s long-term health, a man whose life story is written not in grand proclamations, but in the fine print of planning codes and the subtle, hard-won improvements of the city he calls home."
