Raised in Fremont by first-generation Korean immigrants who owned a bustling dry-cleaning business, her childhood was a study in diligence and unspoken expectations. Her parents envisioned a secure, prestigious future for her as a doctor or lawyer. However, it was her grandmother\u2019s silent struggle with depression, a condition the family addressed with stoicism rather than support, that truly shaped Sarah\u2019s calling. Witnessing this pain, compounded by cultural stigma, ignited in her a fierce desire to give voice to the unheard.\n\nChoosing a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University was a quiet act of rebellion. She threw herself into her studies and began her career in the trenches of a public hospital's behavioral health unit. The work was grueling but deeply rewarding, confirming she was on the right path. The turning point came with the pandemic. Overwhelmed by the system's strain and her own encroaching burnout, she saw a new way to serve. Leaving the hospital, she launched her own private telehealth practice.\n\nNow, her commute is the few steps from her bedroom to the small, sunlit office in her Inner Sunset apartment. Her days are a carefully structured mosaic of virtual sessions, helping clients navigate anxiety, trauma, and loss through a screen. To decompress from the weight of her work, she finds solace in long, foggy runs through Golden Gate Park, just blocks from her door. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate; she feels the city's collective stress and resilience through her clients' stories.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other healthcare workers who understand the emotional toll of the job. While dedicated to her practice, Sarah dreams of finding a more sustainable balance. Her aspirations include expanding her practice into a group that specializes in culturally competent care for the Asian-American community and, on a more personal level, reclaiming time to travel, perhaps finally visiting Korea not as a tourist, but as someone seeking to understand her own roots."

Her grandmother sat by the window, staring at the Fremont traffic with a gaze that saw nothing. Sarah placed a small hand on her arm, only to have it gently removed. It wasn\u2019t cruelty, but a deep, unreachable sorrow. In that silent rejection, Sarah didn\u2019t feel hurt, but a profound helplessness. It was the moment she understood that some wounds were invisible, igniting a need to find the words for a pain that had none.\n\n2.\nThe thick envelope from San Francisco State felt impossibly light on the kitchen table, dwarfed by the LSAT prep book her father had strategically placed there. That evening, after her parents were asleep, she opened it in her room. The acceptance letter for the Master of Social Work program wasn\u2019t just paper; it was a quiet declaration of independence. She felt a tremor of fear mixed with exhilarating resolve. This was the first choice she had ever made that was entirely for herself, a secret path away from her family\u2019s dreams.\n\n3.\nIt was 3 AM during the pandemic peak, standing in the harsh fluorescent light of a hospital bathroom. She stared at her reflection, recognizing the deep, purple hollows under her eyes but not the person wearing them. The constant thrum of crisis, the sheer volume of suffering, had finally hollowed her out. It was a moment of terrifying clarity: she was becoming a vessel for secondary trauma with no way to empty it. To survive, she knew she couldn't just leave her job; she had to build her own lifeboat.\n\n4.\nHer first telehealth session felt more nerve-wracking than any hospital intake. Sitting in her quiet Inner Sunset apartment, she watched the pixelated box on her screen, waiting. When the client\u2019s face appeared\u2014a young man in his own bedroom, looking exhausted\u2014the anxiety vanished. It was replaced by a sense of profound intimacy. There were no clipboards, no sterile walls, just two people in their own safe spaces. In that moment, she knew she had made the right choice, creating a new kind of sanctuary from scratch.\n\n5.\nOn a recent foggy morning, she was running hard through Golden Gate Park, the damp air a heavy cloak. The weight of a particularly difficult session about family trauma clung to her. She pushed herself up a hill near Stow Lake, her lungs burning, until she broke through a patch of mist. The city was gone, the noise was gone; there was only her ragged breath and the green, dripping ferns. This physical exertion wasn't an escape, but an anchor, reminding her that her body was her own, not just a witness to others' pain."
