Raised in Fremont by first-generation Korean immigrants who owned a bustling dry-cleaning business, her childhood was a study in diligence and unspoken expectations. Her parents envisioned a secure, prestigious future for her as a doctor or lawyer. However, it was her grandmother\u2019s silent struggle with depression, a condition the family addressed with stoicism rather than support, that truly shaped Sarah\u2019s calling. Witnessing this pain, compounded by cultural stigma, ignited in her a fierce desire to give voice to the unheard.\n\nChoosing a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University was a quiet act of rebellion. She threw herself into her studies and began her career in the trenches of a public hospital's behavioral health unit. The work was grueling but deeply rewarding, confirming she was on the right path. The turning point came with the pandemic. Overwhelmed by the system's strain and her own encroaching burnout, she saw a new way to serve. Leaving the hospital, she launched her own private telehealth practice.\n\nNow, her commute is the few steps from her bedroom to the small, sunlit office in her Inner Sunset apartment. Her days are a carefully structured mosaic of virtual sessions, helping clients navigate anxiety, trauma, and loss through a screen. To decompress from the weight of her work, she finds solace in long, foggy runs through Golden Gate Park, just blocks from her door. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate; she feels the city's collective stress and resilience through her clients' stories.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other healthcare workers who understand the emotional toll of the job. While dedicated to her practice, Sarah dreams of finding a more sustainable balance. Her aspirations include expanding her practice into a group that specializes in culturally competent care for the Asian-American community and, on a more personal level, reclaiming time to travel, perhaps finally visiting Korea not as a tourist, but as someone seeking to understand her own roots."
