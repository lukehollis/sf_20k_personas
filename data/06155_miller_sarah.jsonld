Raised in a quiet, manicured suburb of Chicago, her childhood was placid on the surface. Her family was loving but ill-equipped to handle the crisis that defined Sarah\u2019s adolescence: her older brother\u2019s spiraling battle with addiction. Watching him navigate a broken system of care, feeling her family\u2019s helplessness, planted a seed of purpose in her. She wouldn't just feel sorry for people; she would learn how to help them.\n\nSeeking both distance and a different way of life, she moved to California for her undergraduate degree at San Francisco State University. The city\u2019s raw energy and visible social complexities felt more honest than the curated perfection of her hometown. It was here she found her calling, dedicating herself to a Master of Social Work (MSW) from UC Berkeley, specializing in child and family services. Her career choice was a direct response to her past, a way to gain the tools her own family had desperately needed.\n\nNow 33, Sarah\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric of the neighborhood she serves. She lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, just blocks from the social services agency where she works, hence her zero-mile commute. Her days are a demanding mix of home visits, crisis intervention, and mountains of paperwork, advocating for vulnerable families caught in cycles of poverty and trauma. Her evenings are for decompression: long walks through Dolores Park, quiet dinners with a tight-knit circle of fellow social workers and artists who have become her chosen family, or simply reading by the window overlooking the vibrant street.\n\nHer relationship with her family back in Illinois is loving but distant, colored by the past and their gentle confusion at her life choices. Sarah\u2019s dreams aren\u2019t of wealth or status, but of systemic change. She dreams of a city with more robust mental health support, of seeing a client secure stable housing, of one day maybe launching a small non-profit for young people. For Sarah, San Francisco is not a backdrop for a tech career; it is the frontline of her life\u2019s work, and every small victory is a reason to stay."
