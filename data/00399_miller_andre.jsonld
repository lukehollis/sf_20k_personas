He was born and raised in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, the only son of a single mother who worked tirelessly as a home health aide. Growing up, Andre saw her exhaustion and vowed to find a different path. He was creative and tech-savvy, drawn to the promise of the digital world. He channeled this interest into an Associate's degree in Digital Media from City College, hoping to build a career in graphic design, far from the difficult, hands-on work his mother did.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived when his grandmother\u2019s health declined rapidly. The family couldn\u2019t afford full-time professional care, so Andre stepped in, using his flexible student schedule to help. In those quiet months of assisting with meals, medication, and simple companionship, he discovered a profound sense of purpose that his digital design projects lacked. He witnessed firsthand the dignity and comfort that compassionate care could provide. After his grandmother passed, the choice felt clear. His digital media degree was filed away, and he enrolled in a CNA certification program.\n\nToday, Andre lives and works at a small, private assisted living facility in the Inner Richmond, which explains his zero-mile commute. His life is woven into the fabric of the facility. His days are a rhythm of helping residents with their morning routines, sharing stories over lunch, and providing a calm presence during difficult moments. His colleagues are his closest friends, sharing inside jokes and supporting each other through the emotional demands of the job. The residents have become a second family, their life stories a rich tapestry he feels privileged to be part of.\n\nWhile content, Andre aspires for more. He dreams of eventually becoming a Registered Nurse, allowing him to take on greater medical responsibilities. His more immediate goal is saving enough to get his own apartment, a small sanctuary somewhere in the city where he can decompress\u2014and maybe, just maybe, dust off his old graphics tablet, merging the two distinct worlds he has come to inhabit."
