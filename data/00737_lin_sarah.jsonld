Born in Daly City to Taiwanese immigrants, she was the quiet observer in a bustling household. Her parents, who ran a small grocery store, instilled in her the values of hard work and community, but hoped she would pursue a more lucrative career in business or tech. Sarah, however, was always drawn to the stories behind people's eyes, the unspoken struggles her family\u2019s customers carried with them.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year at UC Davis. Her grandfather was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the family was thrown into the bewildering world of palliative care. It wasn't the doctors or nurses who left the deepest impression on Sarah, but the hospital social worker\u2014a calm, compassionate woman who navigated the family\u2019s grief, translated complex medical jargon, and secured resources they never knew existed. In that crucible of loss, Sarah found her calling. She switched her major and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 31, Sarah works at the sprawling medical center on Parnassus Avenue. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of her life\u2019s design: she lives in a small, rent-controlled studio on a street so close to the hospital that the announcement of a helicopter arrival is her version of a neighborhood siren. Her life is a tight orbit around her work, a constant practice of emotional triage for patients and their families facing life-altering diagnoses.\n\nHer days are a blur of crisis intervention, discharge planning, and providing a steadying presence in sterile rooms. To decompress, she seeks refuge in Golden Gate Park, her vast backyard. She runs through its winding paths, finding anonymity and peace among the eucalyptus and cypress trees. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, composed mostly of other healthcare professionals who understand the unique pressures of their world.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn't a corner office or a stock portfolio; it\u2019s a small plot in a community garden. She aspires to one day specialize in pediatric oncology social work, believing that advocacy is most critical for the most vulnerable. For Sarah, San Francisco isn't about tech booms or scenic views; it\u2019s about the human-level connections forged in moments of profound need, just a short walk from her front door."
