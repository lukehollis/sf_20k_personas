Born in San Jose to Iranian parents who fled Tehran after the Revolution, Soraya\u2019s childhood was steeped in tales of a lost, vibrant city juxtaposed with the sprawling suburbs of Silicon Valley. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a poet, instilled in her a dual appreciation for structure and beauty. This duality fueled her academic journey through UC Berkeley and eventually a Master's in Urban Planning.\n\nHer career began with a junior role at a large architectural firm, but she quickly distinguished herself. A turning point came early on while redesigning a neglected public plaza in a low-income neighborhood. Watching residents reclaim the space\u2014setting up impromptu markets and gathering on the new benches\u2014solidified her mission. Her work wasn't just about aesthetics or zoning codes; it was about fostering dignity and connection. This conviction propelled her to her current role as a Principal Urban Designer, where she now leads teams shaping large-scale projects.\n\nSoraya lives in a meticulously curated apartment in Hayes Valley, her 2.1-mile Muni commute a daily field study in urban flow. The neighborhood, itself a product of thoughtful redevelopment, feels like a testament to her life's work. Her days are a blend of high-stakes boardroom presentations and on-site visits in a hard hat, while evenings are often spent with a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, tech founders, and fellow planners\u2014debating city politics over dinner.\n\nWhile a demanding career has left little time for long-term romance, she finds deep fulfillment in her work and friendships. Soraya\u2019s ultimate dream is to spearhead a legacy project that heals one of the city's fractures\u2014a new model for integrated affordable housing or a landmark public space that bridges divided communities. For her, designing San Francisco isn't just a profession; it\u2019s a profound act of building a more intentional, equitable, and beautiful home."

Her father pointed out the engineering of the vaulted ceilings while her mother described the scent of saffron and the sound of haggling voices. Soraya felt a strange sense of loss for a life she never knew. It wasn't the buildings she mourned, but the life within them. It was then she first understood that a city\u2019s structure was merely the vessel for its soul.\n\n2.\nOne night during her final year at Berkeley, she stood on a windy overlook, watching the city lights flicker below. She saw the rigid grid of the streets, but also the organic flow of headlights moving like blood cells through arteries. It wasn\u2019t a static map; it was a living, breathing creature. A profound sense of responsibility washed over her. She didn\u2019t just want to study this organism\u2014she wanted to help it thrive, to heal its broken parts.\n\n3.\nThe plaza redesign, her first real project, had been open a month. She sat anonymously on a coffee shop patio across the street, watching. An elderly man set up a small chessboard on one of the new concrete tables, and within minutes, a young woman in a hoodie sat down to play with him. The quiet click of the pieces was the loudest validation she had ever heard. It cemented her belief that good design wasn't seen, but felt\u2014in the simple dignity of a shared space.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the acrid taste of defeat at a community meeting about a housing project in the Excelsior. She had presented a beautiful, integrated design. But she was shouted down, called a gentrifier by the very residents she aimed to serve. The raw pain and mistrust in the room was a physical blow. It taught her a harsh lesson: empathy and elegant plans mean nothing without first building trust, one conversation at a time, long before a single blueprint is drawn.\n\n5.\nRiding the 21-Hayes bus home last week, she watched a street musician on the corner play a saxophone, his melody weaving through the evening rush. Passersby, her neighbors, dropped bills into his open case. Her mind instinctively deconstructed the scene: the wide, walkable sidewalk, the mixed-use zoning, the sheer density of people. But her heart just felt a quiet, fierce pride. This was it. This symphony of planned and unplanned moments was exactly what she was building for."
