The only child of Korean immigrants who ran a successful dry-cleaning business in Daly City, her childhood was steeped in the scent of steam and the quiet but immense pressure to achieve a stable, respectable career. Heeding her parents' wishes, she pursued a practical degree in Business Administration at San Francisco State University, a path she followed with dutiful competence but little passion.\n\nThe turning point came during her senior year in a required arts elective: a textile design workshop. The tactile world of thread and dye offered a tangible escape from the abstraction of market projections. After graduating, Sarah lasted exactly eleven months as a marketing coordinator in a soulless Financial District office. One Tuesday morning, staring at a spreadsheet, she realized she was fading into grayscale. She quit that week.\n\nThis decision caused a rift with her parents, but it led her to an internship, and eventually a Production Assistant position, at a small, renowned textile arts collective. Her life is now entirely contained within a few blocks of the Dogpatch. She lives in a small loft apartment above the very studio where she works, making her commute a simple flight of stairs. Her days are a sensory blend of organizing shipments of organic yarn, mixing custom dye vats for the lead artists, and occasionally weaving samples on the large floor looms after hours.\n\nHer social life revolves around this creative hub\u2014sharing cheap wine with ceramicists and printmakers, discussing projects and the perpetual challenge of making art pay the bills. Though her income is modest, her life feels rich. Sarah\u2019s dream isn't wealth, but autonomy. She spends her evenings sketching patterns and experimenting with natural dyes, saving carefully to one day launch her own small line of hand-dyed silk scarves. For Sarah, San Francisco is not a city of tech booms, but a city of workshops and studios, a place where she is patiently weaving a life that is, finally, her own."
