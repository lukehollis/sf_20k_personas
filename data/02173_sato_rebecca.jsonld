Born in Berkeley to a quiet, third-generation Japanese-American father and a sharp, intellectual Jewish-American mother, she grew up in a household rich with two cultures but belonging fully to neither. This \"hyphenated\" existence fostered in her a profound empathy for those feeling lost or unheard, a trait that would later define her professional life.\n\nHer educational journey was initially aimless. She studied sociology at UC Davis, fascinated by systems but unsure of her place within them. The turning point came when her father was diagnosed with a prolonged illness. Rebecca witnessed her family\u2019s struggle not just with the disease, but with the bewildering maze of insurance, palliative care options, and hospital bureaucracy. The one constant source of clarity and compassion was a medical social worker who guided them through the process. Inspired, Rebecca enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master of Social Work to become that anchor for other families.\n\nFor fifteen years, Rebecca worked in the demanding environment of a major downtown hospital, an expert at crisis intervention and patient advocacy. The pandemic, however, shifted her entire world. Her role transitioned to a remote position, and she suddenly found herself with a zero-mile commute. She now lives and works from her quiet, second-floor apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her days are a structured blend of personal peace and professional intensity. Mornings begin with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by hours of emotionally charged telehealth calls, helping patients and their families navigate end-of-life decisions and a fractured healthcare system from her spare bedroom office.\n\nNow 47 and contentedly single after a long-term relationship ended in her late thirties, Rebecca\u2019s social life is small but deep, centered on a book club and a few trusted friends. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyper-local\u2014the Clement Street Farmers' Market, the green expanse of the park, the familiar faces at her neighborhood coffee shop. Her dream isn\u2019t one of grand ambition, but of quiet impact: she hopes to write a practical, compassionate guide for families thrust into medical crises, a way to scale the support she provides one person at a time."
