Raised in Cupertino by Taiwanese immigrant parents, her childhood was a blend of high academic expectations and the vibrant cultural tapestry of the South Bay. Her parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a prestigious, high-paying career for their daughter\u2014a doctor, perhaps. But a pivotal experience during her late teens altered her course. Her grandmother, her beloved *Nai Nai*, suffered a debilitating stroke, and Sarah became a key family caregiver. She spent countless hours in hospitals, witnessing firsthand the confusion and fear her family felt navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system. It wasn't the doctors who left the deepest impression, but the compassionate social worker who helped them secure resources, explained complex jargon, and offered a steadying hand.\n\nThis experience solidified her calling. While she earned her undergraduate degree in Psychology at UC Davis to appease her parents, her heart was set on a different kind of healing. She pursued a Master of Social Work at SF State, drawn to the city's progressive values and diverse communities. Upon graduating, she accepted a position at a major hospital, deliberately finding a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset just a few blocks away. Her 0.0-mile commute is a cherished ritual\u2014a short walk past misty gardens and the sounds of the N-Judah streetcar, allowing her to mentally prepare for the day\u2019s emotional weight.\n\nSarah\u2019s life is defined by her demanding job. She spends her days connecting patients with post-hospital care, counseling grieving families, and helping the vulnerable navigate crises. Her evenings are her sanctuary. She decompresses by jogging through Golden Gate Park, trying new recipes in her small kitchen, or meeting with her tight-knit group of friends\u2014mostly fellow social workers who understand the unique pressures of their field. She maintains a close, now deeply respectful, relationship with her parents, who have come to admire the strength and compassion her work requires.\n\nAt 26, Sarah feels both grounded and in-progress. Her primary goal is to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) to expand her scope of practice. She dreams of one day specializing in palliative care or policy advocacy, hoping to fix the systemic gaps she confronts daily. For now, she finds fulfillment in small victories: securing a hospice bed for a lonely patient, or helping a new parent access mental health support. She is a quiet, vital thread in the complex fabric of San Francisco, offering solace and support within the very hospital walls that once changed her life."
