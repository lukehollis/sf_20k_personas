The son of a pragmatic engineer and a thoughtful librarian, his childhood in Berkeley was a blend of meticulous order and the quiet wonder of the printed page. While his father instilled in him an appreciation for precision, his mother gave him a love for the tangible quality of books\u2014the weight of the paper, the smell of ink, the crispness of a well-bound spine.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in History at UC Berkeley, fascinated by narratives of the past but unsure how to translate that passion into a career. After graduating, he took a job at a small, independent print shop in the Mission District, initially just to pay the bills. It was a revelation. Kenji discovered a profound satisfaction in the technical craft of printing, from calibrating colors to selecting the perfect paper stock. He had found a way to honor both his father's precision and his mother's love for physical media.\n\nThe turning point came when the print shop, a victim of rising rents, was forced to close. By then, Kenji had built a reputation among local artists and galleries. Instead of seeking employment elsewhere, he went independent, transforming a spare room in his Hayes Valley apartment into a meticulously organized home office. This move solidified his 0.0-mile commute and gave him the autonomy to curate his projects.\n\nToday, Kenji\u2019s life is one of controlled creativity. His mornings start with a pour-over coffee from a local roaster before he settles into his day of coordinating print runs for gallery catalogs, artist monographs, and limited-edition prints. He is the unseen hand ensuring the artist's vision is perfectly translated to paper. His partner of twelve years, an architect named David, shares his appreciation for clean lines and considered design. Their apartment is a testament to their shared aesthetic, filled with contemporary art\u2014much of it from artists Kenji has worked with.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate; he helps create the city's cultural artifacts. Kenji\u2019s dream is not to be the artist, but the master craftsman. He aspires to coordinate a major exhibition catalog for SFMOMA, a legacy project. Privately, he hopes to one day learn traditional Japanese woodblock printing, a way to connect his modern craft to his ancestral roots."
