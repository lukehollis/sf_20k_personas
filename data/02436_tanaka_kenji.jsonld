A third-generation Japanese American, his grandparents were stoic figures who spoke little of their time in the internment camps but instilled in their family a deep sense of resilience and community obligation. Growing up in Daly City, Kenji\u2019s father was a gardener and his mother a dental hygienist; they preached the virtues of a steady job and a quiet life. For a long time, Kenji tried to honor that.\n\nHis undergraduate years at San Francisco State were aimless, a drift through sociology courses without a clear purpose. The turning point came not in a lecture hall, but in the harsh reality of a friend\u2019s battle with addiction and homelessness. Kenji felt profoundly helpless trying to navigate the fractured system of city services on his friend's behalf. That raw frustration became his catalyst. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work (MSW) to learn the language of the bureaucracy he once found so infuriating.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Kenji has been a Case Manager at a non-profit in the Tenderloin that provides supportive housing for individuals with chronic health conditions. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down two flights of stairs from his modest staff apartment to his office on the ground floor. His life is inextricably linked to his work. Mornings are for coffee and navigating a mountain of paperwork; afternoons are for client check-ins, crisis intervention, and advocating for people the system often forgets.\n\nKenji is single, a long-term relationship having ended amicably years ago with a partner who wanted a life beyond the city's complex core. His social life is a small, tight circle of colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their work. He finds solace in the quiet ritual of making ramen from scratch and tending to the surprisingly lush collection of bonsai trees on his fire escape. His dream isn't to climb a career ladder, but to witness his clients find stability and dignity. He loves San Francisco not for its landmarks, but for its defiant, resilient spirit\u2014a spirit he sees reflected every day in the people he is dedicated to serving."
