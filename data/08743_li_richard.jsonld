Born and raised in San Francisco to hardworking Cantonese immigrants, his childhood was a symphony of sizzling woks, clattering dishes, and the constant, aromatic steam of broth. The restaurant, then his father\u2019s, was both his playground and his prison. He was determined to escape it, enrolling at San Francisco State University with vague ambitions of a business degree and a life lived in a quiet office, far from the frantic energy of the kitchen.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. His father, a man who seemed as tireless as the city itself, suffered a major heart attack. Duty, ingrained in Richard since birth, pulled him from his studies and back into the family business. He started at the bottom, in the dish pit, learning the relentless rhythm of the restaurant. He worked his way through every station, from prepping vegetables to mastering his father\u2019s recipes, earning the respect of the long-time staff who had watched him grow up.\n\nWhen his father finally retired, Richard took over completely. He honored the tradition but infused it with his own vision, rebranding and modernizing the menu slightly. The restaurant became his life\u2019s work, a demanding partner that eventually led to the amicable dissolution of his marriage; his ex-wife had wanted a life beyond the 16-hour workdays. Now, at 50, his staff is his family, and his regulars are his closest confidants.\n\nHis days are a predictable, comforting loop: pre-dawn trips to the wholesale markets, overseeing the lunch rush, a brief afternoon respite, and the long, steady service of dinner. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal, rooted in the fog-dampened streets of the Richmond District. While he sometimes dreams of traveling\u2014of seeing the mountains of Huangshan his parents described\u2014his immediate aspiration is simpler: to keep the restaurant thriving as a neighborhood institution, a legacy of a life devoted to good food and hard work, one bowl of noodle soup at a time."
