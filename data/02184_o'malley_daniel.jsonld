His father, a union carpenter, taught him the value of a well-made object, while his mother, a librarian, instilled in him a love for the stories objects could tell. Art, in a formal sense, was absent from his upbringing, but craftsmanship and narrative were not.\n\nDrawn by a desire to understand the soul of a city, Daniel moved west to pursue a Master\u2019s in Urban Studies at UC Berkeley. He planned a career in city planning, but a part-time job at a small SoMa gallery became his true education. It was there he had his epiphany: a gallery wasn't just a store, but a vital nexus where culture, community, and conversation converged. He found he was more interested in curating the city's artistic narrative than its zoning maps.\n\nAfter a decade of working for others, a modest inheritance from his grandfather gave him the courage to take a risk. At 38, he poured everything he had into opening \"Curation O'Malley,\" a small, minimalist gallery in a Hayes Valley storefront with a two-bedroom flat upstairs. This move established his defining characteristic: a 0.0-mile commute.\n\nHis life is a curated loop. Mornings begin upstairs with strong coffee, the mournful jazz of a vinyl record, and emails to artists. By 11 a.m., he descends into the clean, white space of the gallery. His days are a quiet rhythm of meeting with emerging Bay Area painters and sculptors, speaking with the few collectors who appreciate his specific taste, and rewriting artist statements. His social life is deeply intertwined with his work; dinner with a new ceramicist or drinks with the architect who lives next door.\n\nDaniel holds a deep, often conflicted, love for San Francisco. He laments the relentless tide of tech that he feels washes away authenticity, yet he believes his gallery is a necessary anchor. His aspiration isn't to become a major art world player, but to remain a vital local voice\u2014to discover one or two truly significant artists and give them their start, proving that in a city obsessed with the future, the tangible, thoughtful present still matters."
