The son of Korean immigrants who settled in Daly City, he was raised on the twin pillars of hard work and risk aversion. His parents, who ran a small grocery store, chose his Anglicized name hoping it would smooth his path. They envisioned a future for him in medicine or law, a stable profession far removed from the precariousness they knew. David, however, was drawn to the abstract. He quietly enrolled at UC Berkeley and, in an act of minor rebellion, declared his major as Art History, losing himself in the lines of Renaissance architecture and the chaos of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nHis graduation in the late '90s coincided with the dot-com boom, but the subsequent bust, followed by the 2008 financial crisis, solidified his parents' fears. The art world felt like a decadent fantasy. With a sense of duty, David pivoted. He took an entry-level job at a lending firm, his sharp, analytical mind\u2014once used to deconstruct paintings\u2014proving adept at assessing financial risk. He climbed the ladder steadily, his passion replaced by a quiet, meticulous competence.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. His ex-wife, a graphic designer, had often lamented that he\u2019d \u201carchived the most interesting part of himself.\u201d Her departure left a silence in his life that his six-figure income couldn't fill. Now, at 45, David is a Senior Loan Officer who works from a sterile, glass-walled home office in his SoMa condominium. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his desk, overlooking the Bay Bridge. His days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis, client calls, and a solitary workout in the building\u2019s gym.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is largely aesthetic. He appreciates the city as one might a landscape painting from his condo window\u2014the shifting fog, the distant lights of Oakland. On weekends, he sometimes walks to SFMOMA or the galleries in the Dogpatch, an anonymous observer. His dream isn't to quit his job; he's too practical for that. Instead, he aspires to make a quiet pact with his younger self: to one day use his financial success to become a patron, to fund the very art he was forced to abandon, and reclaim a piece of the man he once was."
