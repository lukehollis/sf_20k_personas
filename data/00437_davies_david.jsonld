The son of Korean immigrants who settled in Daly City, he was raised on the twin pillars of hard work and risk aversion. His parents, who ran a small grocery store, chose his Anglicized name hoping it would smooth his path. They envisioned a future for him in medicine or law, a stable profession far removed from the precariousness they knew. David, however, was drawn to the abstract. He quietly enrolled at UC Berkeley and, in an act of minor rebellion, declared his major as Art History, losing himself in the lines of Renaissance architecture and the chaos of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nHis graduation in the late '90s coincided with the dot-com boom, but the subsequent bust, followed by the 2008 financial crisis, solidified his parents' fears. The art world felt like a decadent fantasy. With a sense of duty, David pivoted. He took an entry-level job at a lending firm, his sharp, analytical mind\u2014once used to deconstruct paintings\u2014proving adept at assessing financial risk. He climbed the ladder steadily, his passion replaced by a quiet, meticulous competence.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. His ex-wife, a graphic designer, had often lamented that he\u2019d \u201carchived the most interesting part of himself.\u201d Her departure left a silence in his life that his six-figure income couldn't fill. Now, at 45, David is a Senior Loan Officer who works from a sterile, glass-walled home office in his SoMa condominium. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his desk, overlooking the Bay Bridge. His days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis, client calls, and a solitary workout in the building\u2019s gym.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is largely aesthetic. He appreciates the city as one might a landscape painting from his condo window\u2014the shifting fog, the distant lights of Oakland. On weekends, he sometimes walks to SFMOMA or the galleries in the Dogpatch, an anonymous observer. His dream isn't to quit his job; he's too practical for that. Instead, he aspires to make a quiet pact with his younger self: to one day use his financial success to become a patron, to fund the very art he was forced to abandon, and reclaim a piece of the man he once was."

The strained silence on the other end felt heavier than any lecture. In that moment, he felt a thrilling, terrifying pang of self-determination mixed with the shame of their disappointment. It was the first and last time he truly chose his passion over their pragmatism, a rebellion that felt like a lifetime ago.\n\n2.\nIn the sterile, beige lobby of the lending firm in 2002, he stared at a generic, framed print of a sailboat. He didn\u2019t analyze its composition or color; he felt nothing at all. He just saw it as part of the decor he would have to accept. This was during his final interview, and the numbness was a kind of surrender. He felt the trade being made: the vibrant, chaotic world of art for the predictable, grayscale world of finance. It hardened him, making their risk aversion his own.\n\n3.\nStanding beside his then-wife, Sarah, at an SFMOMA gala about seven years ago, he heard himself appraising a Franz Kline painting not for its raw kinetic energy, but for its market appreciation. The look she gave him wasn't angry, just mournful, as if she were seeing a ghost. A flush of shame washed over him. He realized he was no longer a participant in that world, merely a spectator with a checkbook. Her observation that he\u2019d \u201carchived himself\u201d began to crystallize into a painful truth.\n\n4.\nThe first Saturday after the divorce, five years ago. He sat in his new SoMa condo as the fog consumed the Bay Bridge. The silence was architectural, vast and empty. His six-figure salary had bought him a perfect, sterile view of a city he didn't touch. Seeing his faint reflection in the floor-to-ceiling glass, he realized he had become another polished surface in his own life. This utter stillness was the catalyst, forcing him to acknowledge the profound void he needed to fill.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a small gallery in the Dogpatch, he watched a young artist, no older than his Berkeley self, nervously discuss her work. He saw the fire in her eyes and the scuffed toes of her boots\u2014a perfect collision of passion and precariousness. He didn't feel the desire to paint alongside her, but a powerful, quiet urge to ensure she could afford her canvas. In that moment, a new ambition clicked into place: his financial acumen wasn't a betrayal of his past, but the tool to honor it."
