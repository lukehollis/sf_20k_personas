The daughter of a first-generation Mexican-American farm foreman and a seamstress, she grew up in a close-knit Fresno community where family and faith were paramount. Her childhood was filled with the sounds of boisterous family dinners and the quiet lessons of hard work and resilience. The true catalyst for her career, however, was her older brother, Mateo, whose struggles with undiagnosed bipolar disorder cast a long shadow over their family, highlighting the vast cultural and linguistic gaps in mental healthcare.\n\nDriven by this personal mission, Sarah excelled in her studies. She attended UC Davis for her undergraduate degree in psychology before earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. The program solidified her desire to work within the healthcare system, where she could become the advocate her own family had needed. Upon licensure, she accepted a position with a major San Francisco hospital network.\n\nNow 28, Sarah\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life. Her office is a quiet corner of her Richmond District apartment, where she provides telehealth counseling to patients navigating chronic illness, new diagnoses, and grief. Her days are a series of deeply personal video calls, offering a steady, compassionate presence through a screen. To decompress from the emotional weight of her work, she finds solace in the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, just blocks from her home.\n\nHer life in the city is intentionally grounded. She shares her apartment with her partner, Alex, an urban planner she met in graduate school. Their evenings often involve cooking together or exploring the diverse, low-key restaurants of their neighborhood. Sarah's connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic skyline and more about the quiet community she has built\u2014a stark contrast to her demanding virtual work. Looking forward, she dreams of transitioning to a role that allows for more in-person community work, perhaps developing a bilingual program to support families just like the one she grew up in."
