She was found as a newborn on the steps of a Waverly Place temple, swaddled in a plain blanket with a small, unadorned jade pendant. Raised within the city\u2019s foster care system, she was a quiet, observant child who moved between homes in the Sunset and Excelsior districts. With no ancestral stories or family traditions to ground her, San Francisco itself became her heritage. The libraries were her sanctuaries, and the city\u2019s complex histories became the folklore of her youth.\n\nLacking a formal high school diploma, Meilin became a prodigious autodidact. She devoured everything from city planning documents to sociological studies, teaching herself data analysis through online tutorials and open-source software. Her education was a mosaic of public resources, pieced together with intense curiosity. Her turning point came when she compiled an unsolicited, deeply researched report on food insecurity among seniors in the Richmond District and sent it to a local community aid nonprofit. They were so impressed by the depth and clarity of her data that they created a junior research position for her.\n\nNow 26, Meilin works remotely from her small, tidy studio in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is largely contained within a few blocks. Her days are structured: eight hours sifting through datasets and writing reports that give a quantitative voice to human struggles, followed by a ritualistic walk through Golden Gate Park. She feels a profound connection to the park\u2019s quiet corners, from the Dutch Windmills to the serene Japanese Tea Garden.\n\nHer social circle is small but loyal, consisting of a few friends from a former group home and a mentor at her nonprofit. Meilin doesn't dream of wealth or fame. Her primary aspiration is to use her work to effect tangible policy changes that protect the city's vulnerable populations. But quietly, in the back of her mind, is another hope: that one day, a piece of data, an old record, or a chance encounter will offer a single clue to the first chapter of her own story."
