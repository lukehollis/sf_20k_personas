At 50, his world is circumscribed by the leafy confines of \u201cUmi Nursery,\u201d the plant shop he manages in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a flight of creaky stairs from his modest apartment into the humid, earthy air of the greenhouse below.\n\nThe son of pragmatic Nisei parents, Kenji was raised to pursue stability. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from SF State, a credential now gathering dust in a forgotten box. For over a decade, he worked in the Financial District, translating life into numbers on a spreadsheet. The job was lucrative but hollow, and the towering glass buildings felt more like a cage than a career. The turning point came at 38, after a particularly grueling project left him feeling utterly disconnected from himself. He quit without a plan, much to the dismay of his long-term girlfriend, a relationship that soon withered under the strain of his existential crisis.\n\nHe found his purpose by chance, taking a part-time job at the then-struggling neighborhood nursery. The tangible work of nurturing life\u2014repotting a ficus, coaxing a shy orchid to bloom\u2014was a powerful antidote to his corporate burnout. When the original owner retired, Kenji used his savings to take over, renaming it Umi, the Japanese word for \"sea,\" a nod to the foggy climate he now worked with, not against.\n\nHis social life is quiet and deeply rooted in his work. He knows his customers by the plants they\u2019ve bought and the pests they\u2019ve battled. His most cherished relationships are with his silent, leafy companions, particularly a 30-year-old bonsai pine he inherited from the previous owner. Kenji\u2019s aspiration is no longer to climb a ladder but to cultivate patience and beauty. His dream is to see the rare night-blooming cereus he\u2019s been tending for years finally open, a singular, perfect event in the quiet heart of the city he has finally made his own."
