He grew up in a manicured Marin County suburb where appearances were paramount. His parents\u2019 marriage was a performance of affluence and stability, until the curtain fell abruptly during his junior year of high school. The divorce was acrimonious, and Caleb, a sensitive and observant teen, found himself cast as the unwilling mediator, absorbing the anxieties of both parents. This painful ordeal ignited a deep desire within him to understand family dynamics and help others navigate the fractures he couldn't fix in his own.\n\nHe fled Marin for the intellectual rigor and social diversity of UC Berkeley, where he majored in Psychology. San Francisco, visible across the bay, represented a new start\u2014a place to build an identity separate from his family's history. He enrolled in a Marriage and Family Therapy graduate program at San Francisco State University, fully immersing himself in the city. Now, as a registered MFT Associate, he works at a public middle school in the Western Addition, counseling adolescents grappling with everything from academic pressure to trauma.\n\nCaleb\u2019s life is a structured routine built around purpose. He shares a fog-gray apartment in the Inner Sunset with a fellow grad school alum. His mornings begin with the rumbling screech of the N-Judah Muni line, a 2.5-mile journey that takes him from his quiet, residential neighborhood to the vibrant, complex world of his students. After long days of active listening and crisis management, he de-stresses with long, winding runs through Golden Gate Park, letting the cool air clear his head. His social life is small but solid, centered around a few close friends who understand the emotional demands of their shared profession.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound; the city gave him the anonymity to heal and the community to grow. Caleb\u2019s primary aspiration is to complete his 3,000 hours of supervised experience and become a fully licensed therapist. Long-term, he dreams of opening a small private practice, specializing in helping teens and families navigate conflict. For Caleb, building a life in San Francisco isn't just about career or lifestyle; it's about taking the broken pieces of his past and using them to build a future of healing, for himself and for others."

Standing in the empty, fog-gray room, the rumble of the N-Judah outside wasn\u2019t an annoyance; it was a promise of distance from Marin\u2019s manicured quiet. For the first time, he felt the profound peace of a space that was entirely his own, a blank slate. That day, just before starting his MFT program, he realized San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a city; it was the foundation for a new self.\n\n2.\nIt happened during his first year at the Western Addition middle school. A withdrawn 7th-grader, silent for weeks, finally looked up and mumbled, \u201cThey just\u2026 murmur all the time.\u201d That word\u2014murmur\u2014was the English echo of Caleb\u2019s own *su\u00ec su\u00ec ni\u00e0n*. In that moment of shared anquish, the room filled not with sadness, but with a clarifying purpose. It solidified that he wasn't just running from his past; he was using its broken pieces to build a bridge for others, validating every painful step of his journey.\n\n3.\nAbout six months into his traineeship, after a particularly heavy day of crisis counseling, he ran deeper into Golden Gate Park than ever before. He crested a hill just as the fog began to swallow the cypress trees below. The city sounds vanished, replaced by the wind. Standing there, heart pounding, he felt his students\u2019 anxieties dissipate into the cool, gray air. That run, early in his career, established a vital ritual: he wasn't escaping problems, but finding a space vast enough to hold them and then let them go.\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday, two years into his associate hours, he and his roommate, Leo, sat in their dim living room after a brutal day. Neither spoke of specific cases. Leo just sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy job.\u201d Caleb nodded, the simple acknowledgment lifting an invisible weight from his shoulders. He felt a surge of gratitude for that shared silence, a bond forged not over beers, but in quietly holding space for each other\u2019s burdens. It taught him that the most profound support is often unspoken.\n\n5.\nRiding the N-Judah last fall, he overheard a family\u2019s hushed, tense argument\u2014the same low frequency of his parents\u2019 fights. His stomach clenched with a familiar dread. But then, a new feeling surfaced: calm analysis. He recognized the patterns, the bids for connection masked as criticism. He was no longer the child trapped between them, but a therapist observing a dynamic. In that moment on the rattling train, he knew a deep part of him had finally healed. The city had given him the distance to see."
