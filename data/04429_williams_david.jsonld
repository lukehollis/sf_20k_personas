Born and raised in the Sunset District, he is the second-generation son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. His childhood was a blend of Mandarin spoken at home and the fog-laced streets of outer SF. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable career in medicine or law, David was drawn to the world of stories, losing himself in novels from the local library.\n\nHe stayed local for college, attending San Francisco State University and earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. Graduating in the late 90s, he faced the classic humanities-major dilemma: passion versus pragmatism. The dot-com boom provided an answer. He stumbled into a technical writing gig, his ability to translate complex jargon into clear prose proving invaluable. This was his entry into the tech world, not as a coder, but as a communicator. Over two decades, he navigated the industry's booms and busts, eventually landing in his current role as a Project Coordinator, a position that values his organizational skills and calm demeanor.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. The separation was amicable but left him with a profound sense of solitude. It prompted him to sell the larger house he\u2019d shared with his ex-wife and move into a cozy one-bedroom apartment in Cole Valley. The pandemic-induced shift to permanent remote work solidified this new, smaller world. His 0.0-mile commute means his life is now hyper-local. His days follow a familiar rhythm: a morning coffee from the cafe on Cole Street, a lunchtime walk through the Panhandle or Golden Gate Park, and afternoons spent on video calls, coordinating sprints and deadlines from his living room.\n\nDavid\u2019s San Francisco is not the city of disruptive startups and venture capital, but one of familiar faces at the local bookstore and the comforting chime of the N-Judah streetcar. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a few long-time friends from college. His quiet aspiration is to finally use his English degree and write a novel\u2014a story about the changing soul of his city. He hopes to capture the San Francisco he knows: a place of quiet routines and gentle melancholy, lived just beneath the glossy surface of tech innovation."

His father is on the phone, speaking rapid-fire Mandarin to a supplier, then hangs up and greets Mrs. Henderson in perfect, gentle English. In that moment, David doesn't just see two languages; he sees a bridge. He understands that words are tools for navigating different worlds. It\u2019s a quiet revelation that will later define his entire career as a translator of complex ideas.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, hiding in a corner of the Sunset Branch Library, he discovered a dog-eared copy of a novel that felt like a secret handshake. The world outside, with its parental expectations of medical school, went silent. For the first time, he felt seen not by a person, but by a story. It was more than just reading; it was a quiet act of defiance. This was his true calling, a conviction that felt as real and solid as the library card in his wallet, even if he had to tuck it away for years.\n\n3.\nHis first day at the dot-com startup in 1999 was a sensory shock. The air hummed with server fans, smelling of whiteboard markers and stale pizza, a world away from the musty pages he loved. Surrounded by engineers speaking in acronyms, he felt like an imposter. But when he wrote his first manual, translating their jargon into clear prose, he saw their relief. He wasn't a builder, but he could draw the map. It solidified his role as a pragmatist, finding his value in the space between worlds.\n\n4.\nFive years ago, he did a final walkthrough of the empty house in the Richmond he\u2019d shared with his ex-wife. The only sound was the echo of his footsteps on the hardwood. Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dust motes where their life used to be. It wasn't just sadness he felt, but a profound, unnerving quiet. His life, once sprawling and shared, had been edited down to its essential self. That hollow echo pushed him toward a smaller, more deliberate existence in Cole Valley, a life he had to furnish from scratch.\n\n5.\nJust last autumn, on his daily walk through the Panhandle, he stopped. The fog was rolling in thick, muting the city's noise to a distant hum and blurring the tops of the eucalyptus trees. He saw a tech shuttle glide silently past, its occupants illuminated by their laptops, and then he saw an elderly woman carefully tending her roses. He suddenly understood the novel he had to write was not about one or the other, but about the quiet, melancholic space between them\u2014the real story, hiding in the fog."
