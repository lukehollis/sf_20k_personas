The daughter of a pragmatic civil engineer and a detail-oriented librarian, she grew up keenly aware of infrastructure, yet frustrated by the car-centric world around her. Her childhood was a landscape of wide streets and long drives, instilling in her a deep yearning for the kinetic energy of a dense, walkable metropolis.\n\nThis ambition propelled her to UC Berkeley for her graduate degree in Urban and Regional Planning. Arriving in the Bay Area in the early 1990s was a revelation. For the first time, she felt she was in a place built for people, not just for cars. After graduating, she accepted a junior planner position with the city of San Francisco and never looked back. Her career became her anchor, especially after a key turning point in her mid-thirties: an amicable divorce. Her then-husband accepted a job in Texas, and Rebecca was faced with a choice. She chose San Francisco, choosing her professional mission over the relationship.\n\nNow the Director of Transit Planning, Rebecca is a quiet force within the city\u2019s transportation authority. She has spent nearly three decades navigating the bureaucratic and political complexities of improving the MUNI system. Her days are a blur of budget meetings, community outreach, and long-term strategic planning. Her lifestyle is a testament to her beliefs. She lives in a tastefully minimalist condo in Noe Valley and begins each morning with a walk to a local cafe before her 2.1-mile commute on the J-Church line. This daily ride is both a routine and a field study, where she mentally notes everything from late arrivals to the design of a new bus shelter.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle of long-term friends\u2014other career-driven professionals she met over the years. They share dinners, go on weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands, and attend lectures at the Commonwealth Club. Rebecca\u2019s ultimate hope is one of legacy. She doesn\u2019t dream of retirement but of seeing key projects, like a new subway line or fully integrated ticketing, become a reality. She wants to leave the city\u2019s circulatory system healthier and more equitable than she found it, ensuring the San Francisco she fell in love with remains a vibrant, accessible place for generations to come."

The groan of the historic car turning onto Market Street, the press of bodies, the city unfolding in the windows\u2014it was a symphony of human density. It wasn't just transportation; it was a living organism. For the first time, she felt the thrill of a city built to a human scale. That rumble settled deep in her bones, a feeling of arrival that solidified her academic pursuit into a lifelong calling.\n\n2.\nThe final phone call with her husband still echoes with a quiet clarity. It was 2005. He was describing the spacious yard he\u2019d have in Austin while she looked out her window at the fog rolling over Twin Peaks. There was no anger, just a simple, unbridgeable distance. In that moment, hanging up felt less like an ending and more like turning a key in a lock. She was choosing the intricate, demanding, imperfect anatomy of San Francisco over a simpler life. She was choosing her mission.\n\n3.\nAt a bitter community meeting around 2011, a man whose bus route was being consolidated stood up and called her a heartless bureaucrat. His voice was raw, and his anger felt intensely personal. Rebecca listened, her face calm, feeling the sting but processing his words not as an insult, but as a critical data point of human impact. That night taught her a profound lesson: to improve the system for the many, she had to be strong enough to absorb the legitimate pain of the few.\n\n4.\nOne rainy morning on the J-Church three years ago, she saw it: a young mother, wrestling a stroller with one hand, effortlessly tapping her phone on the new Clipper reader she had fought for in a dozen budget meetings. The woman didn\u2019t look up or notice anything special. For Rebecca, the moment was monumental. It was the invisible, seamless success of her work made manifest. This small, quiet victory against daily friction was the fuel that sustained her through every political battle.\n\n5.\nStanding at the windy groundbreaking for a major transit project in the last decade, she didn't focus on the politicians giving speeches. Her gaze was on the massive tunnel-boring machine, a dormant giant waiting to carve a new artery beneath the city. She felt a profound sense of setting a legacy in motion\u2014a system that would serve people who hadn't even been born yet. It was the ultimate fulfillment of her work: not just planning, but building a promise to a future San Francisco."
