The only child of Taiwanese immigrants, she grew up surrounded by the pragmatism of survival. Her parents, who worked relentlessly, measured success in balanced ledgers and paid bills. For Sarah, however, true value lay in the few precious objects her grandparents had brought from Taipei: a hand-painted silk fan, a set of celadon tea bowls, and worn calligraphy scrolls. She was fascinated by their silent histories, a language her parents were often too tired to speak.\n\nThis fascination became a quiet rebellion. While her parents hoped for a doctor or a lawyer, Sarah enrolled in Art History at UC Berkeley, following it with a Master\u2019s in Museum Studies. It was a source of gentle friction, but her resolve was firm. Her life\u2019s turning point came not with a dramatic flourish, but with a quiet email offering her an internship in the collections department of San Francisco\u2019s Asian Art Museum. She felt she was finally coming home.\n\nNow 37, Sarah is the museum\u2019s Collections Manager. Her life is a study in meticulous care. Living in a modest Hayes Valley apartment, her commute is a short walk past the opera house, a journey from her quiet personal space to the climate-controlled vaults she considers her true domain. She is a librarian of things, responsible for the preservation and cataloging of priceless artifacts. Her daily routine is a peaceful ritual of database entries, condition reports, and the delicate handling of history.\n\nHer social circle is small and intimate, comprised mostly of fellow academics and museum professionals who understand her passion. A previous long-term relationship ended amicably, frayed by her partner\u2019s inability to appreciate a life dedicated to the past. Sarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she is a steward of the city's cultural soul. She dreams of one day overseeing the acquisition of a major collection and, more personally, of taking a long trip to Taiwan to trace the journey of the very heirlooms that first sparked her imagination. For Sarah, fulfillment isn't found in a spotlight, but in the quiet, enduring legacy of the objects she protects."
