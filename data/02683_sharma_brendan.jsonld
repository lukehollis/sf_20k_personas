The son of a pragmatic, second-generation Irish-American mother from the Sunset and an idealistic father from Rajasthan, India, Brendan grew up in a home filled with the scent of both soda bread and simmering curries. His father, who drove a cab to make ends meet, had dreamed of being a chef, a passion he poured into family meals and passed on to his son. For Brendan, the city wasn't a postcard of the Golden Gate Bridge; it was the clang of the N Judah streetcar and the diverse flavors of his own kitchen.\n\nForegoing college, which he saw as an abstract detour, Brendan dove headfirst into the restaurant world at 18. His education was earned over sizzling grills and frantic prep stations in kitchens across the city, from North Beach to the Mission. He learned the industry from the drain up\u2014dishwasher, line cook, sous chef\u2014absorbing not just techniques, but the grueling economics of the business. The turning point came a decade ago when he met Lena, a sharp front-of-house manager who shared his vision but possessed the business acumen he lacked. They pooled their life savings and took a massive risk, leasing a small, neglected space in Cole Valley.\n\nToday, at 43, Brendan\u2019s life is his restaurant, \"Garam.\" As his zero-mile commute suggests, he lives in the small apartment directly above it. His day begins before dawn with calls to suppliers and ends long after the last customer has left, the scent of cardamom and roasted fennel clinging to him as he climbs the stairs to bed. The demanding lifestyle cost him a long-term relationship years ago; he is now married to his work. His partnership with Lena remains the most stable relationship in his life\u2014a bond forged in shared stress and triumph.\n\nBrendan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into the menu at Garam, a Cal-Indian concept that mirrors his own heritage. His dream isn\u2019t expansion or fame, but survival and legacy. He aspires for Garam to become a true neighborhood institution, a place of warmth and community that fulfills the dream his father could only nurture at home."
