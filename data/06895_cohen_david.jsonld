Adopted at six months old by a warm, intellectual Jewish-American couple, he was raised in the quiet Bay Area suburb of Millbrae. His parents, a professor and a librarian, filled their home with books, debate, and love. Yet, despite their unwavering support, David grew up navigating the subtle complexities of being an Asian child with the surname Cohen, feeling perpetually between worlds. This internal search for identity, a quiet but constant hum beneath the surface of his life, would ultimately define his professional calling.\n\nHis undergraduate years were a period of exploration, but it was a volunteer position at a youth crisis hotline that provided clarity. Hearing the raw, unfiltered struggles of others resonated with his own unspoken questions. He pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, finding a home in the language of therapy and human behavior. After graduation and rigorous clinical hours, he earned his LCSW and took a position with a major San Francisco hospital network.\n\nA key turning point came at age 25 when he took a long-planned trip to South Korea. He had hoped for a profound connection, a sense of homecoming. Instead, he felt distinctly like an American tourist, a stranger in his own birth land. The experience was not one of rejection, but of acceptance. He realized his roots weren't in Seoul\u2019s soil, but in the foggy, liberal air of the Bay Area with the family who raised him.\n\nNow 33, David lives and works in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a product of the post-pandemic shift; he provides telehealth therapy sessions from a small, dedicated office space in his home. His days are structured: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, back-to-back sessions helping patients navigate trauma and anxiety, a quiet lunch, and an afternoon of charting and follow-ups. His partner, Maya, a graphic designer, brings vibrant energy into his ordered world. They spend evenings cooking together or exploring the city\u2019s lesser-known restaurants. David dreams not of wealth, but of impact\u2014perhaps one day opening a small group practice specializing in identity and adoption issues. He has found his place, not by finding where he came from, but by building a life of purpose right where he is."
