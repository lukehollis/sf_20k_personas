            "value": "David Lee is a product of San Francisco's fog-dusted west side. Raised in the Sunset District by Cantonese immigrant parents who ran a small, beloved neighborhood dry-cleaning business, David\u2019s childhood was a mix of steamed buns, the drone of the N-Judah line, and the quiet but immense pressure to succeed. He was the studious son, the one who would transcend the family\u2019s working-class roots.\n\nHis path seemed clear and linear. He excelled at Lowell High School, then earned a B.A. in Political Economy from UC Berkeley. Feeling the pull of ambition and a desire to shape the world, he moved to Washington D.C., securing a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown. He spent five years there, working for a federal regulatory agency, analyzing financial legislation. But the slow grind of bureaucracy and a growing homesickness for the specific character of SF\u2014the scent of eucalyptus after the rain, the vibrant chaos of a neighborhood festival\u2014wore him down. The turning point was a brief trip home, where the city\u2019s energy felt more tangible and real than the abstract power he wielded in D.C.\n\nHe returned to San Francisco and landed his current role as a Policy Analyst for a major fintech company headquartered downtown. With the post-pandemic shift to remote work, his commute became non-existent. Now, his world is his well-appointed apartment in Hayes Valley. His days are structured: a morning espresso from a local caf\u00e9, hours of analyzing global financial regulations from his standing desk, and a midday walk through Patricia's Green to clear his head.\n\nSocially, David maintains a tight circle of college friends. He\u2019s currently single, navigating the city\u2019s complex dating scene with a reserved patience. His connection to San Francisco is deep; he is both a native who understands its history and a returnee who appreciates its evolution. His dream is to one day pivot from the corporate world to a city-level position, perhaps at the SFMTA or the Planning Department, using his analytical skills to directly impact the home that shaped him. He wants to be more than a resident; he aspires to be a steward of the city's future."
