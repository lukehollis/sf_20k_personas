Born and raised in Jaipur, India, he was the son of a botany professor and a librarian. His upbringing was steeped in academia and the promise of a scientific career. He pursued this path diligently, earning a Master's degree in pharmacology and securing a respectable position at a pharmaceutical research lab. For fifteen years, his life was predictable: a loving arranged marriage to his wife, Priya, the birth of two children, and steady professional work.\n\nThe major turning point came at age 38. Driven by the desire for greater opportunities for their children, Rajeev and Priya made the difficult decision to immigrate, sponsored by Priya\u2019s sister in Daly City. The reality of the American job market was a harsh awakening. Rajeev\u2019s advanced degree and Indian lab experience didn't translate into equivalent work. Faced with mounting bills and the need to provide, he swallowed his pride and enrolled in a certificate program to become a Medical Assistant. It was a humbling pivot from researcher to clinician\u2019s aide, but he discovered an unexpected aptitude for patient care, finding a quiet satisfaction in easing others' discomfort.\n\nThree years ago, he found a unique position that would define his San Francisco existence. A small, family-run assisted living home in the Inner Richmond needed a live-in Medical Assistant. The job came with a modest salary and a small apartment above the facility. This solved his commute and housing worries in one stroke.\n\nToday, Rajeev\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the facility and the neighborhood. His daily routine begins not with a commute, but with the soft chime of a resident's call button. He knows each of the twelve elderly residents by name, managing their medications, assisting with daily needs, and simply offering a comforting presence. His social life revolves around Priya, their now college-aged children, and the handful of nurses he works with. His connection to San Francisco is intensely localized\u2014the aroma of dim sum from Clement Street, the familiar faces at the local market, and the dense fog rolling in from the park. He has let go of his dream of scientific discovery, replacing it with a more immediate one: to provide a life of dignity for his patients and a future of possibility for his children."
