His father, an engineer who ended up running a successful corner market, and his mother, a teacher, instilled in Rami a deep appreciation for structure and community. Growing up, he witnessed the Bay Area\u2019s complex dance of prosperity and inequality, fueling a desire to understand the systems that governed people\u2019s lives.\n\nHe was a focused student, earning his undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley before pursuing a Master's in Public Policy. The turning point came during a post-graduation trip to Lebanon. While mesmerized by the vibrant chaos of Beirut, he was struck by its fractured infrastructure. He saw firsthand how a lack of reliable public transit stifled opportunity and deepened social divides. Returning to the Bay Area, his path was clear: he would dedicate his career to building the equitable, functional systems his ancestral home lacked.\n\nLanding a job at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) felt like a homecoming. He began as an analyst and, over a decade, methodically worked his way up to Senior Program Manager. Now 37, Rami is a key figure in planning major capital projects. His daily 1.7-mile commute from his Hayes Valley apartment is more than just a trip; it\u2019s field research. He rides the 21-Hayes or the N-Judah, observing passenger flow, noting delays, and quietly celebrating the moments the system works perfectly.\n\nRami lives with his partner of five years, Liam, an architect. Their home is a testament to their shared passion for urban design, filled with city maps, blueprints, and books on civic planning. Evenings often involve lively debates over dinner about public space and sustainable development. His social life is a tight-knit circle of policy wonks, city planners, and old friends from Berkeley.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is etched into the very bus routes and rail lines he works to improve. Rami\u2019s ultimate dream isn't a promotion, but to see a project like the Geary Bus Rapid Transit through from conception to completion. He aspires to leave a tangible legacy: a city that is easier to navigate, more connected, and more equitable for the next generation of San Franciscans, a tribute to the family that sacrificed so much for a better system."

His dad, an engineer by training, explained the elegant logic of inventory\u2014how placing popular items at eye-level not only boosted sales but created a more efficient flow for hurried shoppers. Rami felt a surge of pride, seeing the hidden system behind the daily chaos. It was his first lesson in how thoughtful structure could build a community, turning a simple market into a neighborhood anchor. This moment planted the seed for his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt 23, standing on a dusty curb in Beirut, he watched an elderly woman give up waiting for a bus that never came. He saw the city\u2019s fractured beauty and his own family's history in her resigned sigh. The injustice was visceral\u2014a city\u2019s potential being strangled by its lack of reliable movement. It wasn\u2019t a policy paper; it was her tired face. In that moment, his abstract ambition crystallized into a concrete mission. He knew he had to return to San Francisco to build the systems that this place, his ancestral home, deserved.\n\n3.\nThe day the first phase of the Geary Bus Rapid Transit project was approved by the board felt less like a professional victory and more like a quiet, volcanic click inside him. He was 34. Sitting in the back of the hearing room, he wasn't just Senior Program Manager Rami Haddad; he was the kid from the Daly City market, the student who saw a problem in Beirut. He felt the weight and honor of being able to shape a city\u2019s artery, a profound sense of responsibility that was both terrifying and exhilarating.\n\n4.\nOn their third date, Liam steered him away from a bar and onto a walk tracing the path of a defunct streetcar line. Standing on a street corner, Liam pulled out a pen and sketched on a napkin how a new parklet could honor the old route. Rami felt an electric shock of recognition\u2014someone else who saw the city not just as it was, but as a layered story of what it had been and could be. It was the moment he knew their lives would be built together, designing a shared future.\n\n5.\nLast winter, huddled on a packed 21-Hayes bus during a downpour, he watched a young man in a service uniform pull out a textbook, balancing it on his knees. The protected bus-only lane they were gliding through was Rami\u2019s project. Seeing that student able to reclaim twenty minutes of his commute for studying, an opportunity carved out of the city\u2019s chaos, felt more significant than any promotion. It was a tangible piece of equity, a quiet affirmation that his work was delivering people not just to a destination, but to a better life."
