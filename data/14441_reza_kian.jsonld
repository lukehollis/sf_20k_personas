The son of Iranian professionals who settled in San Jose before the revolution, Kian grew up between two worlds. His father, an engineer, instilled a sense of precision and structure, while his mother\u2019s kitchen was a vibrant realm of saffron, cardamom, and rosewater\u2014a place where hospitality was the highest form of art. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a traditional career, Kian was always drawn to the energy and emotion of a shared meal.\n\nAfter earning a business degree from UC Davis, a post-graduation trip through Spain and Italy crystallized his calling. He saw how food was intrinsically woven into culture, history, and public life. This revelation led him to a graduate program in Hospitality Management on the East Coast. He honed his skills in the demanding, high-stakes hotel restaurants of New York City, but found the corporate environment creatively stifling. The turning point came when a headhunter called about a unique position: Culinary Director for a major San Francisco arts institution. It was the perfect fusion of his passions.\n\nNow at 39, Kian is at the pinnacle of his career. He lives in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, just a 0.9-mile walk from the institution he now helps define. His days are a blur of meetings, budget oversight, and his favorite part: creative development. He collaborates with curators to design menus for exhibition openings and works with local purveyors from the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market. His commute through the vibrant, boutique-lined streets is his time to decompress and observe the city\u2019s rhythm.\n\nKian shares his life with his partner, a landscape architect, and their social circle is a tight-knit group of artists, designers, and fellow food industry professionals. Though he has achieved significant success, Kian dreams of something more personal. His ultimate aspiration is to open a small, intimate restaurant that reinterprets the Persian flavors of his childhood through a modern, Californian lens\u2014a true homecoming on a plate, and his own contribution to the city\u2019s rich cultural tapestry."

She cradles a few saffron threads like jewels, grinding them with a sugar cube. The scent fills the kitchen\u2014a fragrant, golden cloud of pure alchemy. In that moment, he understood there was a different kind of precision, one measured not in numbers but in color, aroma, and love. It was the first time food felt like art to him.\n\n2.\nIt was a tiny piazza in Seville, after his UC Davis graduation. He was 22, armed with a business degree he didn\u2019t know how to use. He watched a family share a simple plate of jam\u00f3n and manchego, their laughter echoing off the ancient stones. It wasn\u2019t a meal; it was a conversation, a ritual woven into the city\u2019s very fabric. He realized then that hospitality wasn\u2019t just a service industry. It was the connective tissue of culture, and he had to be a part of it.\n\n3.\nHe was 28, in a sterile New York hotel kitchen. The executive chef told him to use a cheaper, synthetic truffle oil for the risotto special. \"Make it pop for the investors,\" he\u2019d said. The artificial scent felt like a betrayal of everything he loved about food. That night, plating dish after identical dish, his passion dimmed under the fluorescent lights. He knew then he wasn\u2019t just cooking food; he was manufacturing a product. That feeling of creative suffocation cemented his resolve to find a different path.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the exact spot on Hayes Street where his phone rang. He was 32, interviewing for the Culinary Director position. The headhunter's voice confirmed the offer, and Kian stopped walking. He looked at the boutiques, the artful window displays, the mural down the block. It felt like the whole city was a gallery, and this wasn't just a job\u2014it was a curatorial role within it. For the first time, his disparate worlds of business, art, and food clicked perfectly into place. He was home.\n\n5.\nLast spring, at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market with his partner. He was holding a basket of miraculously sweet, sun-warmed apricots, the scent transporting him back to his mother\u2019s kitchen. His partner, a landscape architect, simply said, \u201cYou should build a place around that feeling.\u201d Looking from the vibrant fruit to the Bay Bridge, Kian saw it clearly for the first time: not just a restaurant, but a space. A modern Persian garden on a plate, right here in his chosen city. The dream finally had a foundation."
