Raised in suburban Ohio by a teacher and an engineer, David inherited both a love for narrative and a respect for systems. This duality led him to surprise his practical parents by pursuing a graduate degree in colonial American history on the East Coast. He loved the archives, the meticulous process of piecing together a story from fragmented data. However, the uncertain academic job market pushed him toward a more lucrative field: finance.\n\nHis pivot was successful. David\u2019s analytical mind, honed by historical research, excelled at dissecting market trends. He moved to San Francisco for a high-powered job in the Financial District, embracing the city\u2019s energy. The 2008 financial crisis was his crucible. Witnessing the chaos and emotional panic firsthand solidified a cynical belief: the only reliable element in his work was the data itself, stripped of human fallibility. This event, more than any other, shaped his career trajectory.\n\nA long-term relationship ended amicably a few years later, the divergence clear: she craved adventure and spontaneity, while David sought stability and order. When the pandemic normalized remote work, he seized the opportunity, giving up his office for good. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a fortress against the unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nHis days are structured. He wakes with the market open, analyzing global indices with a local-roast coffee in hand. He works from a minimalist desk overlooking the rooftops, the city\u2019s hum a distant, abstract soundtrack. Afternoons often involve long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, a landscape as curated as his own life. His social circle is small but deep\u2014a weekly dinner with two old friends, monthly calls with his sister. He values Cole Valley for its village-like containment, a predictable pocket within the sprawling metropolis.\n\nNow 43, David feels a new yearning. He dreams not of a bigger portfolio, but of using his financial freedom to trade market charts for historical maps. His quiet aspiration is to one day write a book on the economic underpinnings of the American Revolution, finally uniting the two halves of his life."
