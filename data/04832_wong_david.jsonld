Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, he is the only son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. His childhood was a mix of stocking shelves, helping elderly neighbors with their bags, and translating between Cantonese and English. He witnessed firsthand the quiet struggles of his community\u2014navigating a complex healthcare system with language barriers and limited resources.\n\nThis upbringing shaped his path. A sharp student, he attended UC Berkeley, initially aiming for a business degree to modernize the family store. However, a turning point came when his father suffered a preventable health crisis, exacerbated by delayed and culturally incompetent care. The experience ignited a new purpose in David. He switched his focus, eventually earning a Master's in Public Health. He began his career not in a corporate high-rise, but in community clinics, doing outreach and building trust one family at a time.\n\nNow, as the Director of Community Health Initiatives, David works from his cozy Inner Sunset flat, his commute a mere shuffle from the bedroom to his home office. His days are a marathon of Zoom meetings with city officials, grant writing to fund mobile clinics, and analyzing data to identify underserved populations. He is a bridge-builder, connecting the massive engine of a healthcare corporation to the street-level needs of the city\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nHis personal life is a quiet counterpoint to his demanding job. He lives with his partner of twelve years, Mark, an urban architect. Their evenings often involve cooking together and dissecting the city\u2019s latest triumphs and follies. David decompressess with long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that connects him to the city\u2019s natural rhythm. He feels a deep, protective love for the San Francisco he grew up in, even as he grapples with its rapid changes. His ultimate aspiration is to launch a self-sustaining preventative health program for immigrant seniors, a legacy that would honor his parents and ensure others have the support his father never did."

As he translated the dense bureaucratic English into her familiar Cantonese, he saw her shoulders physically relax. The weight of her trust felt heavier than the crate he stood on. It was his first real understanding that language was more than words; it was a lifeline, and he was holding the rope. This moment planted the seed of his duty as a community advocate.\n\n2.\nDuring his sophomore year at Berkeley, he stood helplessly in a sterile hospital corridor. His father, bewildered by the medical jargon, just nodded at a rushed doctor. David tried to translate, but the information was a firehose of complex terms. He felt a cold rage mix with a profound sense of failure. It wasn't just a communication gap; it was a system designed to fail people like his father. In that hallway, his ambition shifted from commerce to care, forging his purpose in the fire of that preventable crisis.\n\n3.\nFresh out of his Master\u2019s program, working in a Chinatown clinic, he spent an entire afternoon with a family, simply explaining how to use an asthma inhaler for their son. He drew pictures, used a translation app, and waited patiently. When the boy\u2019s mother finally demonstrated it correctly, her face illuminated with understanding and relief, David felt a joy more profound than any academic achievement. This was the work. It wasn't abstract policy; it was breathing easier, one family at a time, directly mending the system's flaws.\n\n4.\nOn their eighth anniversary, David and Mark stood at Grandview Park at dusk, watching the city lights flicker to life below. Mark, ever the architect, spoke about the city\u2019s grid as a living organism. David, exhausted from a week of fighting for grant funding, felt the stress melt away. The view wasn't just data points or underserved districts; it was a breathtaking, complicated whole. With Mark\u2019s hand in his, he felt a surge of protective love for it all\u2014a love that anchored him and fueled his work.\n\n5.\nHe remembers the exact moment he secured the initial funding for his mobile clinic pilot program. It wasn't in a boardroom, but via a simple email that landed in his inbox at 10 PM in his Inner Sunset flat. He closed his laptop and walked to the window, looking out into the fog. It was a quiet, solitary victory, yet it felt monumental. He pictured the van, a new kind of neighborhood store, bringing care instead of groceries. It was the first true brick laid for the legacy he vowed to build for his parents."
