Born in Guangzhou, China, he was the only son of two factory administrators who pinned their pragmatic dreams on him. They encouraged a path of stability, so when Feng was accepted into a Master's program at San Francisco State, it was in Urban Planning\u2014a respectable field focused on systems, not people. He arrived in San Francisco in his early twenties, a serious young man determined to understand how cities worked.\n\nThe turning point came during an internship. Tasked with community outreach for a controversial redevelopment project in the Western Addition, Feng witnessed the human cost of blueprints and zoning laws. He watched an elderly woman, a long-time resident, break down in tears, utterly lost in the bureaucratic jargon that was evicting her from her home of forty years. In that moment, the abstract systems of urban planning felt hollow. Feng realized he didn't want to design the city; he wanted to help the people navigating its unforgiving edges.\n\nHe abandoned his planning career before it began, taking an entry-level position at a Chinatown social services agency. The pay was a fraction of what he could have earned, but the work resonated deep within him. Over three decades, he became a pillar of the community, rising to Senior Social Worker. His Master's degree wasn't wasted; it gave him a unique understanding of the civic machinery he now helped others fight.\n\nFeng lives in a small apartment above the very community center where he works, his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His life is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. He is the go-to translator for medical appointments, the advocate for tenants facing eviction, and a patient listener for lonely elders over games of mahjong. A lifelong bachelor, his \"family\" consists of the hundreds of individuals he has supported. At 52, his dream is simple: to find and mentor a successor who understands that a city\u2019s true foundation isn't concrete, but compassion."
