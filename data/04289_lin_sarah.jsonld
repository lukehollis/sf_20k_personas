A first-generation child of Taiwanese immigrants, she spent her youth translating not just words, but cultural nuances for her parents and their customers. She watched neighbors struggle with issues that had no name in her household\u2014stress, isolation, and quiet despair\u2014all while her parents championed resilience and forward momentum above all else.\n\nThe turning point came during her time at UC Davis. While her family hoped for a career in medicine, Sarah was preoccupied with her grandmother\u2019s deepening depression after her grandfather\u2019s passing. She saw firsthand how cultural stigma and language barriers created an insurmountable wall to mental healthcare. This experience became her calling. She pivoted, pursuing a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, determined to bridge the exact gap her family had faced.\n\nNow 38, Sarah is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) specializing in geriatric and palliative care for a major San Francisco hospital system. Since the pandemic, her practice has become entirely remote. Her commute is a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her small home office in her Inner Richmond apartment, a space she shares with her partner, a graphic designer named Alex.\n\nHer days are a structured rhythm of confidential video calls with patients and their families, navigating end-of-life decisions, and providing support for grief and caregiver burnout. To decompress, she takes long, fog-laced walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace under the cypress trees. Her social life is intentional and small; dinners with a tight-knit group of friends who understand the emotional weight of her work.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal\u2014it is the city that shaped her, and the community she now serves. Her ultimate aspiration is to launch a non-profit providing culturally competent, multilingual mental health services for Asian elders in the city. For Sarah, it isn\u2019t just a career; it is the fulfillment of a promise she made to herself in her grandmother's quiet living room years ago."

Her mother, ever practical, suggested ginseng tea. But Sarah, translating, heard the real words underneath: loneliness, a house too quiet. She saw the deeper ache her mother\u2019s focus on resilience couldn't acknowledge. It was the first time she understood some ailments had no name in her parents\u2019 language, a quiet grief that got lost in translation. This moment planted the seed of her life's work.\n\n2.\nIt was her sophomore year at Davis, home for a weekend. She found her grandmother sitting in the armchair, shrouded in a silence as heavy as the fog outside. Her grandfather's reading glasses were still on the side table. Sarah felt a profound helplessness, the weight of a grief that cultural stoicism and language barriers made untouchable. This wasn't a problem medicine could fix. In the stillness of that living room, she abandoned her parents\u2019 dream for her and made a silent vow to build a bridge for people like her grandmother.\n\n3.\nHer first end-of-life case as an intern was a man who spoke only Cantonese, his family strained and distant. She felt utterly inadequate, her textbook knowledge failing her. For weeks, she just sat with him, sharing silence. Then one afternoon, as she was leaving, he gripped her hand and whispered, \u201cThank you, child.\u201d That simple, profound acknowledgment from across a generational and linguistic divide was a brutal, beautiful confirmation. She knew then, with absolute certainty, that she had chosen the right, difficult path.\n\n4.\nSpring 2020. She held space for a family saying goodbye to their father over a flickering video feed from her spare room. Guiding them through final words on a laptop screen felt both clinical and shattering. She was an intimate stranger, a disembodied voice of comfort managing a sacred moment through a weak Wi-Fi signal. That call crystallized the strange reality of her modern practice\u2014a testament to grief\u2019s persistence through any medium and the new, isolating contours of her San Francisco life.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, after a day spent helping a family decide to withdraw care, she came home, the emotional residue clinging to her like soot. She tried to tell Alex about it but only choked on a sob. He didn\u2019t press for details. He simply wrapped a blanket around her shoulders and put a warm mug of tea in her hands. In that quiet gesture of being cared for, without explanation, she felt the profound relief of having a safe harbor, a sturdy anchor that made her demanding work possible."
