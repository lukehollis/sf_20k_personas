Born in Daly City to a Filipino-American father who worked for the postal service and a Native Hawaiian mother who taught hula, Leilani grew up between two cultures, always feeling more like an observer than a participant. Her childhood was filled with the scent of adobo from her father\u2019s kitchen and the soft melodies of her mother\u2019s ukulele. These dualities instilled in her a deep appreciation for stories and the artifacts that carry them. She found her sanctuary not on a stage or in a crowd, but in the hushed aisles of the public library.\n\nHer educational path was a direct line from this early passion. After earning a history degree from SF State, she witnessed the nascent chaos of the early internet during the first dot-com boom. While others saw a gold rush, Leilani saw a future archive at risk of being lost\u2014a digital deluge of uncatalogued history. This realization propelled her to the University of Washington for her Master of Library and Information Science. She returned to San Francisco not to create the next big thing, but to preserve it.\n\nA key turning point was a devastating apartment fire in her twenties that destroyed most of her family photographs. The loss was profound, cementing her professional mission with personal conviction. She became a media archivist, a guardian against the erasure of memory. For the past two decades, she has meticulously cataloged film reels, digitized political pamphlets, and preserved the audio files that form the city\u2019s sprawling, unofficial history.\n\nNow 54, Leilani lives a peaceful, deliberate life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her days begin with a 3.5-mile ride on the 5-Fulton bus, where she reads or listens to history podcasts. Her social life is a small, warm circle of fellow archivists and a weekly book club. She is a quiet pillar of the city, not by building its future, but by safeguarding its past. Her dream is to secure funding to digitize a fragile collection of photos from the Manilatown era before it fades completely, ensuring the stories of her father\u2019s generation are never lost to a fire."

From one side came the sharp, comforting scent of her father\u2019s simmering adobo; from the other, the soft strum of her mother's ukulele. She wasn\u2019t torn, but felt like a quiet bridge between two beautiful histories. In that stillness, she learned that the most precious things weren\u2019t objects, but the melodies and aromas they carried. It was her first, unspoken lesson in stewardship.\n\n2.\nShe was 26. The fire itself was a blur of alarms and scorching heat, but the aftermath was silent and sharp. Standing on the wet curb, she watched a firefighter carry out a warped, waterlogged photo album. The faces of her grandparents, her mother as a girl\u2014all reduced to blurred ink and buckled paper. It wasn\u2019t just loss; it felt like an erasure of her own history. In that hollowed-out moment, her professional goal became an absolute, personal mission.\n\n3.\nIt was well past midnight in the university archive, the only sound the hum of the climate control. She was cataloging a dusty box of unlabelled audio reels, a routine task. Then she threaded one onto the machine and pressed play. Through the hiss, a clear voice emerged\u2014a forgotten Fillmore poet from 1968, reading to a small, laughing crowd. Leilani felt an electric jolt, as if she'd reached through time and shaken a hand. This was why: not for grand histories, but for these small, rescued voices.\n\n4.\nJust last autumn, on her evening commute. As the 5-Fulton rumbled through Golden Gate Park, the setting sun cast long, golden fingers of light across the faces of her fellow passengers. No one spoke. Everyone was in their own world, yet they were all moving together through the city she loved. A profound sense of peace settled over her. She realized she didn't need to be a main character in the city's story; being part of its steady, daily rhythm was more than enough.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, she was shown a cardboard box from an old Kearny Street family. Inside were fading silver gelatin prints of Manilatown. One showed a group of men\u2014postal workers among them\u2014laughing outside a restaurant. In their posture, their hopeful smiles, she saw her father. She saw an entire generation whose stories were as fragile as the paper they were printed on. The sight was a gut punch of recognition and urgency. This was the one fire she knew she absolutely had to prevent."
