Born in Daly City to a Filipina mother, a compassionate nurse, and an Argentine immigrant father who poured his heart into running restaurant kitchens, Liliana\u2019s identity was shaped by a blend of patient resilience and passionate hard work. While her parents built a life with their hands, they encouraged her to build one with her mind. She was the first in her family to navigate the corporate world, a path she chose with pragmatic determination.\n\nShe attended San Francisco State University, earning a a Bachelor's in Business Administration while working part-time. Her early career was a steady, unremarkable climb in financial analysis until the 2008 recession. Being laid off was a terrifying but clarifying moment. It forced Liliana to recognize her true talent: not just analyzing systems, but diagnosing their faults and architecting solutions. This realization led her to management consulting, where her ability to bring order to corporate chaos allowed her to thrive. The job was demanding, and a long-term relationship frayed and eventually ended in her early thirties, cementing a fierce independence she hadn't known she possessed.\n\nNow 43, Liliana lives a life of curated balance in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant Latino roots resonate with her Reyes heritage. Her daily 4.5-mile commute on the J-Church streetcar is a sacred ritual\u2014a time to decompress with a podcast before stepping into the sterile high-rise world of her Financial District office. Weekends are for running through Dolores Park, exploring the Alemany Farmers' Market, and hosting intimate dinners for a small, loyal circle of friends.\n\nProfessionally secure, Liliana\u2019s ambitions have shifted. The six-figure salary is comfortable, but no longer the sole motivator. She dreams of pivoting her expertise toward social-impact consulting for non-profits or sustainable startups. Her deepest aspiration, however, is to finally take the extended trips she sacrificed for her career\u2014to walk the streets of Buenos Aires and explore the villages of the Philippines, connecting the disparate, vibrant threads of her own remarkable story."
