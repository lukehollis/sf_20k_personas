            "value": "Miguel Rodriguez was born and raised in Fresno, the only child of hardworking immigrants from Oaxaca, Mexico. His parents, a farmworker and a house cleaner, instilled in him a deep respect for stability and tangible skills. While they dreamed of him becoming a doctor or an engineer, Miguel\u2019s world was digital. He spent his youth dismantling and reassembling old computers, a talent that seemed more like a hobby than a career to his family.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco to attend SF State, enrolling in their Digital Media program with aspirations of becoming a video game artist. However, his journey was cut short after three semesters. His father suffered a workplace injury, and without a second thought, Miguel left school and returned home, taking on odd jobs to support his family. The pressure to earn a stable income eclipsed his artistic dreams. During this time, he leaned into his technical skills, earning several IT certifications online. This pragmatic pivot landed him a remote IT Support Technician job with a growing SF-based tech startup.\n\nNow 25, Miguel\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of his small apartment in the Outer Richmond. His commute is a zero-mile walk from his bed to his desk, where he spends his days navigating a queue of support tickets, patiently guiding colleagues through technical frustrations. His social life mirrors his work setup; his closest friends are members of his online gaming guild, scattered across the country. While he appreciates the quiet of his neighborhood and takes long, thoughtful walks along Ocean Beach to clear his head, he often feels like an observer of San Francisco rather than a participant.\n\nThe IT job pays the rent and allows him to send money home, fulfilling his duty to his family. But late at night, after his work is done, Miguel\u2019s true passion emerges. He opens Blender and Photoshop, not to fix a problem, but to create one. He\u2019s slowly, secretly, building the world for an indie game\u2014a story inspired by Oaxacan folklore and the stark landscapes of the Central Valley. His dream is no longer to just work in games, but to create a game that honors where he came from, hoping to one day bridge the gap between the practical world he lives in and the vibrant one he carries inside."
