The only daughter of Indian immigrants, she was raised on a dual diet of her mother\u2019s chai and her father\u2019s unyielding belief in the American dream, which, for him, was synonymous with engineering. Priya, however, was always more interested in the intricate machinery of people. She dutifully excelled in her studies but chose her own path, earning a Master\u2019s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from the University of Michigan, a field that baffled her practical-minded parents.\n\nHer early career unfolded in Chicago's corporate towers, where she climbed the HR ladder with methodical precision. She married young, to a fellow ambitious professional, but their parallel career tracks eventually diverged into separate lives, leading to an amicable divorce in her early thirties. This turning point, coupled with the siren song of the late-90s dot-com boom, spurred a desire for change. Feeling constrained by corporate bureaucracy, Priya packed her life into two suitcases and moved to San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s chaotic energy and the burgeoning tech scene\u2019s desperate need for human systems.\n\nShe found her niche in consulting, thriving on the challenge of parachuting into start-ups to build their HR foundations from scratch. Now a senior consultant, Priya works from her serene Nob Hill apartment, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her espresso machine to a desk with a view of Coit Tower. Her days are a calibrated mix of intense Zoom meetings and strategic planning, broken up by walks through Huntington Park.\n\nHer life is rich and cultivated. She maintains a close circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow consultants, artists, and academics\u2014with whom she shares dinners in North Beach and weekends in wine country. While professionally fulfilled, Priya now aspires to a different kind of impact. She dreams of phasing out of corporate work to mentor young women of color entering the tech industry, perhaps even establishing a small pro-bono consultancy for non-profits. For Priya, San Francisco is no longer just a place of opportunity; it is the home she deliberately built, a city whose constant reinvention perfectly mirrors her own."
