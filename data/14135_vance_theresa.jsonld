            "value": "Theresa Vance is a product of San Francisco\u2019s working-class heart. Born in the South of Market district before it was rebranded as SoMa, she was the eldest daughter of Filipino immigrants. Her father was a cook on a merchant marine vessel, often gone for months, while her mother worked tirelessly as a hotel housekeeper. The family mantra was simple: work hard, stay quiet, and provide. Higher education was a distant luxury; for Theresa, graduating from Mission High School was the expected finish line, a gateway to a steady job.\n\nIn her early twenties, a whirlwind romance led to a short-lived marriage with a serviceman named Vance. The marriage ended within three years, but the name stuck, a remnant of a youthful dream of a different life. Newly single and needing to support herself, Theresa drifted through various service jobs until her mother\u2019s declining health became her turning point. Caring for her, and witnessing the profound impact of the Certified Nursing Assistants who came to their small apartment, ignited a sense of purpose. At 30, she enrolled in the CNA program at a community college.\n\nFor the past two decades, Theresa has been a CNA at a residential care facility for adults with developmental disabilities in the Inner Sunset. Her work is physically demanding and emotionally taxing, but it provides a deep, quiet satisfaction that a simple paycheck never could. Her $62,000 income, a result of her seniority and union benefits, allows her a stable, if modest, life in her rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond District.\n\nHer daily routine is a familiar comfort: the 6:15 AM alarm, the brisk walk to the MUNI stop on Geary, and the 2.5-mile ride where she reads a chapter of a library book. After her shift, she might meet her younger sister for pho or tend to the small collection of succulents on her apartment balcony. Her social circle is small but loyal, mostly consisting of a few coworkers who understand the unique pressures of their job.\n\nTheresa has watched San Francisco transform around her, mourning the loss of old diners and affordable grocery stores, but she remains fiercely attached to her city. Her dreams aren't grand; she hopes to save enough to visit her extended family in Cebu one day. More immediately, she aspires to a peaceful retirement where she can walk through Golden Gate Park without an aching back and simply have the time to enjoy the city she has always called home."

When she was nine, he\u2019d be gone for six months at a time, and his duffel bag would fill their small SoMa apartment with the scent of diesel, salt, and foreign tobacco. She would bury her face in his jacket, a brief, overwhelming moment of having him back. It taught her early that love was often a powerful presence followed by a long, quiet absence, a lesson she carried into the rest of her life.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-four, after the papers were signed, she stood at a post office counter filling out a form. She paused at the name: *Vance*. Her ex-husband was a ghost, a memory of a rash decision. But the name felt like a sturdy coat she had worn through a storm. In that moment, she decided to keep it. It wasn't for him; it was for her. It was a testament to survival, a marker of a life she had lived and moved beyond on her own terms.\n\n3.\nIt was a CNA named Maria who set her future. Her mother, frail in her bed, had been quiet all day. Maria came in, sat beside her, and began to gently brush her mother\u2019s thin, graying hair, humming softly. Theresa watched from the doorway, her throat tight. It wasn\u2019t a medical task; it was an act of grace. That small moment of dignity shown to her mother was a revelation, illuminating a path of purpose she desperately needed just before her thirtieth birthday.\n\n4.\nA decade into her career, she was caring for Samuel, a non-verbal man who spent his days rocking. One afternoon, exhausted and running on fumes, she began humming a simple melody her mother used to sing. Samuel stopped rocking. He looked at her, his eyes clear for a moment, and placed his hand over hers. The profound, silent connection was a jolt of pure meaning. It was the quiet satisfaction that no paycheck could ever provide, affirming her work reached the person inside.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, sitting on a bench in Golden Gate Park after her shift, a familiar ache settled deep in her back. She watched a young couple chasing a frisbee, their movements light and effortless. There was no envy, only a quiet, fierce longing for a future where she could walk through these same gardens without pain. The moment crystallized her goal not as a grand dream, but as a tangible finish line: to one day enjoy her city with a body at peace."
