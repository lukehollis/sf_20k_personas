The son of a pragmatic high school history teacher and a nurturing librarian, his upbringing was one of books, structured debate, and the Midwestern value of building things to last. This foundation led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy from the University of Michigan, fueled by a genuine, if somewhat naive, desire to untangle complex systems for the public good.\n\nHis early career in a D.C. think tank, however, felt frustratingly slow. The turning point came in his late twenties, when a college friend, flush with dot-com 2.0 optimism, lured him to San Francisco. David discovered his knack for policy and strategic thinking translated perfectly to the burgeoning tech landscape. He could build systems and forge partnerships far faster in the private sector than he ever could in government. He came to the city for a job but stayed, even after the long-term relationship that initially anchored him here dissolved a few years later.\n\nNow 46, David is the Director of Business Development for a major software company. His commute is a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to the standing desk in his meticulously restored Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. His days are a disciplined blur of international Zoom calls, bookended by a solitary morning run through the fog in Golden Gate Park and an evening glass of Russian River Pinot Noir while reviewing contracts. He is a regular at his local wine bar and the Alemany Farmers' Market, small rituals that ground him in a city he loves for its dramatic beauty, not just its industry.\n\nWhile financially secure, David feels a growing pull back toward his idealistic roots. The abstract nature of \"scaling a platform\" leaves him longing for something more tangible. He quietly dreams of leveraging his capital and experience to advise local, sustainable startups, or perhaps mentoring first-generation students navigating corporate America. He\u2019s searching for a new kind of deal to close\u2014one that builds community, not just a customer base."

In one afternoon, they built a more actionable plan than anything he\u2019d done in a year in D.C. The slow, theoretical world of policy dissolved, replaced by the thrilling velocity of tech. It was the moment he traded methodical public good for the intoxicating speed of private-sector creation. He was hooked.\n\n2.\nHe was 34. The front door clicked shut for the last time, leaving an echo in the now-empty living room where their couch used to be. The person who anchored him to San Francisco was gone. He stood at the bay window, watching the fog swallow Sutro Tower, feeling a profound solitude. But beneath the ache was a quiet, defiant resolve. The city was no longer a shared venture. It was his alone to claim, to build a life in on his own terms.\n\n3.\nHe remembers being about ten, his father unrolling a massive historical map of Cleveland\u2019s rail lines on the dining room table. \u201cThis is how a city works, David,\u201d he\u2019d said, his finger tracing the arteries of industry. \u201cReal things, made to last.\u201d The memory now surfaces during investor calls about scaling digital platforms. He feels a quiet shame contrasting his father\u2019s tangible history lesson with his own abstract work. He\u2019s building something, but he can\u2019t hold it in his hands.\n\n4.\nIt was a Saturday morning at Alemany, maybe four years ago. A farmer with dirt-caked fingers handed him a deeply scarred heirloom tomato. \u201cDry-farmed,\u201d the man said. \u201cTastes like sun.\u201d In a week of negotiating abstract cloud platform integrations, holding that solid, imperfect fruit felt like an act of rebellion. It was a tangible good, grown from the earth just miles away. That simple, honest transaction felt more valuable than any deal he\u2019d closed that quarter, planting a seed of deep dissatisfaction.\n\n5.\nOn a run last winter, the fog in Golden Gate Park was a solid, silent wall. He stopped by a gnarled cypress near Stow Lake, its roots gripping the damp earth. It stood alone, yet supported an entire ecosystem in its branches. The phrase \u201cscaling our platform\u201d echoed in his mind, feeling suddenly thin and rootless. Looking at that tree, he didn't feel ambition; he felt a profound longing. He no longer wanted to scale endlessly into the abstract cloud. He wanted to plant something."
