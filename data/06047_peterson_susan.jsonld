She was raised in Davis, California, the daughter of a pragmatic UC Davis agricultural science professor and a meticulous homemaker. Her childhood was defined by academic expectation and quiet suburban stability, a life she found profoundly underwhelming. Seeking a grander scale, she fled to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies and later pursued a Master's degree in Architectural History, fascinated not by dusty archives but by the power structures and aesthetic statements that buildings represented.\n\nHer career pivot was a stroke of calculated genius. During a postgraduate internship, she realized her academic knowledge gave her a unique edge in commercial real estate. She could articulate a building's soul, not just its square footage. She got her license in the early '90s and dove into San Francisco's market just as the first dot-com bubble began to inflate. Susan thrived on the high stakes and brutal pace, quickly earning a reputation for her intellect and relentless negotiation style. Her defining moment was structuring the lease for a nascent tech giant in a historic Market Street building, a complex deal that cemented her as a major player.\n\nSusan\u2019s personal life was secondary, and often a casualty of her ambition. A brief, intense marriage in her late 30s to an equally driven venture capitalist dissolved under the pressure of two competing careers. Since then, her primary relationship has been with the city itself. She lives in a sleek SoMa high-rise, in the same building as her firm's office, rendering her commute a simple elevator ride. Her days are a disciplined sequence of market analysis, high-stakes calls, and power lunches.\n\nNow, at 54, she stands at the pinnacle of her profession. From her condo, the skyline she helped shape sprawls before her. The thrill of the deal remains, but a new desire for legacy is taking root. She dreams of launching her own boutique firm focused on architecturally significant properties, or perhaps using her formidable capital to create a foundation for historic preservation. For Susan, it would be the ultimate closing: ensuring the city's most beautiful bones endure long after the markets have turned."
