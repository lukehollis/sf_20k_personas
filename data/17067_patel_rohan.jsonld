The son of an Indian immigrant civil engineer and a first-generation Filipina-American nurse, he grew up in Daly City, in a home filled with the aromas of both adobo and dal. This blended heritage fostered in him a quiet adaptability and an appreciation for diverse perspectives. He was a pragmatic, observant child, naturally drawn to the order and logic of science.\n\nHis path seemed set when he enrolled at UC Davis for a Biology degree, with the unspoken expectation of medical school. However, a summer internship at a small South San Francisco biotech startup became his pivotal turning point. While his peers were engrossed in lab work, Rohan found his true calling in orchestrating the chaos. He was the one creating Gantt charts for experiments, translating complex scientific jargon for stakeholders, and ensuring the team hit its milestones. He realized he didn't want to be the scientist at the bench; he wanted to be the one who cleared the path for the science to happen.\n\nThis revelation reshaped his career. He methodically climbed the corporate ladder, moving from a project coordinator to his current role as a Senior Program Manager in Clinical Operations for a major pharmaceutical company. His daily 3.8-mile MUNI ride from his Hayes Valley apartment to the Mission Bay campus is a moment of mental transition, shifting from his personal life to the high-stakes world of managing clinical trial logistics.\n\nNow 37 and single after a long-term relationship ended two years ago, Rohan\u2019s life is structured and focused. Weekdays are demanding, but he unwinds by jogging through the Panhandle or attempting elaborate recipes in his well-organized kitchen. Weekends are for his tight-knit group of friends\u2014hikes in the Marin Headlands or trivia nights at a Mission dive bar. As a near-native, he holds a deep, non-performative love for San Francisco, appreciating its innovative spirit as much as its foggy, moody landscapes. His dream is no longer about personal ascent, but about impact; he hopes to eventually leverage his skills at a non-profit, guiding life-saving treatments to developing nations, seeking a legacy more profound than a job title."

From the stove, his mother stirred a pot of adobo, its sharp, vinegary scent mingling with the cumin from the previous night's dal. It wasn\u2019t a conflict of worlds, but a perfect, logical fusion. He felt a deep sense of peace in that overlap, the foundation for a life spent translating between complex, disparate systems.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, an intern at a tiny biotech startup. During a tense investor meeting, the lead scientist was fumbling, lost in technical jargon. Rohan felt a surge, not of panic, but of purpose. He stood and pointed to his Gantt chart, explaining the project not as cellular mechanics, but as a series of simple, achievable milestones. Seeing understanding dawn on the investors' faces was more thrilling than any lab result. He knew then he didn't want to discover the drug; he wanted to deliver it.\n\n3.\nThe night his eight-year relationship ended was unnervingly quiet. After she left, the Hayes Valley apartment felt vast and wrong. He put on his shoes and just ran, past the Panhandle, through the park, not stopping until his feet hit the cold sand of Ocean Beach. He stood as the fog erased the horizon line, feeling utterly adrift but also strangely whole in the grey solitude. It was the end of a chapter, and the stoic landscape held him in his grief.\n\n4.\nHe was on his daily MUNI ride to Mission Bay, maybe 34 at the time. The T Third light rail curved past the ballpark, the morning sun glinting off the water. The day before, his team had averted a crisis in a Phase III trial, thanks to a logistical plan he\u2019d designed. As the train rumbled on, he felt a profound sense of rightness\u2014not joy, but the deep, quiet satisfaction of being a crucial, competent part of an important machine.\n\n5.\nLast year, hiking in the Marin Headlands, he stood looking back at the city skyline. A friend was retelling a news story about the logistical nightmare of getting vaccines to a remote village. For Rohan, it wasn\u2019t a nightmare; it was a puzzle he knew how to solve. In that moment, his entire career\u2014the charts, the calls, the planning\u2014snapped into a new focus. His skills weren't just for corporate milestones; they were the tools needed to build a bridge from a lab to a life."
