Born in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District to parents who had emigrated from Guangzhou, her childhood was a symphony of foghorns, the rattle of the 38 Geary bus, and the constant, comforting scent of dried mushrooms and star anise from her family\u2019s small grocery, \u201cWu\u2019s Good Fortune Market.\u201d She was the American dream her parents envisioned\u2014bright, quick-witted, and the first to navigate the English-speaking world for them. They poured their hopes into her, saving every possible dollar for her education.\n\nMei dutifully enrolled at San Francisco State University, intending to major in business. For two years, she experienced a life separate from the store, full of late-night study sessions and thoughts of a corporate career downtown. The turning point came swiftly and without sentiment. Her father suffered a major heart attack, and the choice was stark: let the family business crumble or step in. Mei left college, telling herself it was temporary. That was twenty-five years ago.\n\nNow 47, Mei is the store\u2019s manager, owner, and heart. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a flight of creaky stairs from the apartment where she grew up. Her days are a familiar rhythm: unlocking the gate at 7 AM, bargaining with produce vendors, and advising elderly neighbors on which brand of soy sauce is best for braising. She knows three generations of local families by name. Her own personal life has been quieter; a serious relationship in her thirties ended when her partner couldn't understand why she wouldn't sell the \"old-fashioned\" store and move away.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn't one of glittering tech parties or Golden Gate Bridge vistas; it\u2019s the worn linoleum floor of her store and the trust of her community. Her dream is no longer a C-suite office but a simple one: to keep the market thriving long enough to pass it to her younger cousin. She aspires to finally take a real vacation\u2014perhaps to see the Terracotta Warriors in Xi'an\u2014and to find a quiet satisfaction in the life of service she chose, one customer at a time."
