Raised in Des Moines, Iowa, by a pragmatic accountant father and a librarian mother, David\u2019s upbringing was orderly and predictable. He was expected to follow a similar path: get a business degree from Iowa State, find a stable job, and settle down. He began that journey, but in his sophomore year, his father suffered a massive stroke, and David\u2019s world tilted on its axis.\n\nHe left school to help his mother, taking a temporary job at a local title insurance agency to make ends meet. What began as a necessity soon revealed an aptitude. The meticulous, rule-based world of titles, deeds, and escrow accounts appealed to his innate sense of order. He thrived on the precision required, finding a strange comfort in the black-and-white nature of the work amid the emotional chaos at home. He never returned to college, instead earning certifications and building a career from the ground up.\n\nTen years ago, after his father\u2019s passing, a fully remote position as a Senior Title Processor for a San Francisco-based firm offered him an escape hatch. He packed two suitcases and moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy tranquility suited him.\n\nToday, David\u2019s apartment is his entire world. His commute is the ten-foot walk from his bed to his ergonomic desk. His days are structured with disciplined routine: strong coffee at 7 AM, processing files until lunch, and a mandatory one-hour walk through the nearby Presidio or Golden Gate Park to feel the sun and escape his screen. His social life is small but meaningful\u2014a weekly trivia night at a pub on Clement Street and a shared appreciation for dim sum with a neighbor. A long-term relationship ended a few years after he moved to the city, the vibrancy of SF pulling his ex-partner outward while David burrowed further inward.\n\nHis dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup or change the world. It\u2019s to finally buy his own small condo, a permanent sanctuary. He aspires to a quiet contentment, perhaps finding a partner who understands that his love for San Francisco is less about its chaotic energy and more about the peaceful, anonymous life it allows him to lead within it."
