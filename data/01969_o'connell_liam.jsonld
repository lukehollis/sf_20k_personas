Born in Seoul, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by Patrick and Siobhan O\u2019Connell, a warm, boisterous Irish-American couple in Sacramento. He grew up surrounded by Celtic music, the smell of soda bread, and a profound, unconditional love that never quite silenced the unspoken questions about his origins. His childhood was a happy one, yet marked by a subtle dissonance\u2014a feeling of being a cherished guest in a heritage that wasn't biologically his own.\n\nThis search for clarity drew him to the world of absolutes. While others struggled with ambiguous literature, Liam found sanctuary in mathematics and logic. He pursued an Economics degree at UC Davis, captivated by the power of data to reveal hidden patterns and provide concrete answers. The transition into a data analyst role at a San Francisco tech startup felt like the most natural step in the world. It was a career built on order, a stark contrast to the complexities of his own identity.\n\nThe key turning point was his move to the city. Landing a fully remote position, he settled into a small apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute transformed his apartment into his entire world during the workday. His days follow a quiet rhythm: brewing strong coffee as the morning fog rolls in, losing himself in spreadsheets and SQL queries, and taking late afternoon walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress. His social circle is small but tight, mostly old college friends and a few colleagues he knows primarily through a screen.\n\nNow 25, Liam stands at a personal crossroads. He enjoys the intellectual challenge of his job, but his aspirations are shifting inward. He dreams of bridging the gap between \"Liam O'Connell\" and the face he sees in the mirror. He\u2019s tentatively begun exploring his Korean heritage, visiting Koreatown on his own and trying to learn basic Hangul through apps. His hope is to build a life in San Francisco that feels whole\u2014one where his love for the city's foggy shores, his appreciation for his Irish-American upbringing, and a newfound connection to his Korean roots can finally coexist in harmony."
