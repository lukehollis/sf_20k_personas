            "value": "Kenji Cohen\u2019s name tells the story of his upbringing. The son of a pragmatic, Kyoto-born landscape architect and a verbose, idealistic Jewish-American historian from New York, Kenji was raised in Berkeley in a home filled with lively debate, meticulously arranged stones, and the scent of both matzo ball soup and miso. His dual heritage taught him to see the world from multiple perspectives, a skill that defined his academic and professional path. He was the quiet observer who could synthesize his parents' differing worldviews into a coherent, thoughtful whole.\n\nThis innate ability to find middle ground led him to pursue political science at UCLA, followed by a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley. He was less interested in the theater of politics and more in the mechanics of it\u2014the complex, often invisible systems that shape a city. A key turning point came during graduate school when a close friend\u2019s family was evicted from their Oakland home of two decades. The abstract data points on housing insecurity suddenly had a face and a name, hardening his resolve to work within the system to enact change.\n\nNow 30, Kenji is a Policy Analyst for the City of San Francisco, focusing on zoning reform and affordable housing initiatives. His 0.0-mile commute is to a desk in the corner of his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are a disciplined mix of data analysis, virtual meetings, and policy brief writing. This remote setup has rooted him deeply in his neighborhood. His routine includes a morning walk through Golden Gate Park, lunch from a Clement Street dim sum spot, and picking up produce from the same corner market for years.\n\nHis social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of grad school friends who share his earnest desire to improve the world. While he hopes for a long-term relationship, his primary focus remains his work. Kenji\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but something far more tangible: to walk through a San Francisco neighborhood ten years from now and see a thriving, diverse community living in housing that he had a small part in making possible. He wants to help the city he loves live up to its progressive promise, one policy at a time."
