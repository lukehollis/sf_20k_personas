The only child of parents who ran a tiny, perpetually busy noodle stall, her earliest memories are of steam, the scent of five-spice, and the constant clatter of bowls. She learned the art of service by observation: how a kind word could soothe a weary customer, how quick hands were essential, and how community was forged over shared meals. At seventeen, seeking opportunities beyond what her parents could offer, she was sent to live with an aunt in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nThe transition was jarring. She finished her education through a GED program, her English learned in late-night study sessions after long shifts washing dishes in a banquet hall. It was here, in the chaotic back-of-house world, that she found her footing. She was promoted to busser, then barback, where she became fascinated by the bartenders. They weren't just pouring drinks; they were chemists, performers, and confessors. This was a craft. Mei began studying, memorizing classic recipes and experimenting with flavors that reminded her of home\u2014lychee, osmanthus, and star anise.\n\nHer turning point came when she landed a job at a storied, dimly lit bar on the edge of Chinatown and North Beach. Her skill, work ethic, and quiet authority saw her rise to Lead Bartender. The bar is her kingdom, and her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her devotion; she lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment directly above it. Her days start late, prepping unique infusions and syrups. Her nights are a blur of shaking tins, listening to the stories of her regulars, and managing her small, tight-knit staff, who have become her chosen family.\n\nNow 36, Mei is a fixture of her neighborhood. She\u2019s the steady presence behind the bar, a keeper of secrets and a master of her craft. While she values her independence, her dream is to one day take a risk. She saves diligently, hoping to open her own small, intimate cocktail lounge\u2014a place that honors both the traditions of Guangzhou and the innovative spirit of San Francisco, a true reflection of the world she has built for herself, one drink at a time."
