            "value": "Mei Cohen begins her day before the San Francisco fog has a chance to burn off. From her Russian Hill apartment, the Golden Gate Bridge is a faint red phantom. At 50, she is the Vice President of a major investment bank, a position she commands from a minimalist home office overlooking the bay. Her commute is zero miles, a hard-won victory after a lifetime of relentless forward motion.\n\nBorn Mei-Ling Kwan in the Sunset District, she was the only child of a seamstress from Hong Kong and a second-generation Chinese American grocer. Their lives were a testament to grueling work, and they instilled in Mei an unshakeable belief that success required twice the effort for half the recognition. She excelled, earning a scholarship to Columbia University, where she shed her San Francisco skin for an East Coast ambition. There, she met David Cohen, a charismatic law student, and armed with a Master's in Economics, she became Mei Cohen, ready to conquer Wall Street.\n\nHer rise in investment banking was meteoric, fueled by a sharp mind and an immigrant\u2019s hunger. She and David built a life of power and prestige, culminating in a transfer back to San Francisco. But the foundation was brittle; their formidable partnership fractured under the weight of two all-consuming careers. The divorce was a brutal, multi-year negotiation that became her life\u2019s most difficult deal.\n\nWinning that battle forged the Mei of today. She demanded the fully remote VP position, swapping the physical boardroom for digital dominance. Her life is a fortress of control and efficiency. A 5 AM start for the East Coast markets, a disciplined Peloton ride at noon, and a day of high-stakes calls that often bleeds into the evening. Her social life is sparse, curated to a few trusted colleagues and her son, now a sophomore at UCLA, who she loves with a fierce, slightly distant pride.\n\nLately, however, staring at the city she grew up in but no longer truly touches, a different kind of longing has emerged. She has the view, the title, and the security her parents dreamed of for her. Now, she dreams for herself\u2014of traveling without a laptop, of finding a connection that isn't transactional, and of one day walking across the Golden Gate Bridge not as a symbol of conquest, but simply to feel the wind on her face."
