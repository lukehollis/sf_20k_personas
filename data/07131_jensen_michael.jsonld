Born Kim Min-jun, he was adopted as an infant by a loving Lutheran couple from rural Minnesota. His childhood was filled with Midwestern warmth but also a quiet sense of otherness, a feeling of being a cherished but visibly different piece of the community puzzle. This internal dissonance fueled a deep curiosity about identity and belonging, guiding him towards a career where he could help others navigate the very fractures he once felt within himself.\n\nHis educational journey took him west, culminating in a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. He was drawn to the Bay Area's diversity, a place where his unique background felt less like an anomaly and more like a common story. After graduating, he settled in San Francisco and began his career as a clinical social worker, specializing in trauma and identity issues within the healthcare system. He found purpose in offering the kind of guidance he had longed for as a young man.\n\nA key turning point came in his late thirties when, after years of contemplation, he chose not to seek out his birth family. He realized the home he sought wasn't in his past, but one he could build for himself. This decision brought a profound sense of peace and self-acceptance.\n\nNow, at 50, Michael\u2019s life is deeply rooted in his Inner Sunset apartment. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen to a sun-drenched second bedroom converted into a home office, where he conducts telehealth sessions. His days are structured and calm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, hours spent listening and guiding patients, and quiet evenings cooking or reading. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow therapists, artists, and neighbors\u2014who meet for dim sum in the Richmond or drinks in the Castro.\n\nMichael\u2019s dream is no longer about finding where he came from, but about deepening his connection to where he is. He aspires to mentor younger social workers of color and to one day cultivate a proper garden on a small balcony. He found his identity not by unearthing his roots, but by planting new ones in the foggy, accepting soil of San Francisco."
