            "value": "Mei-Ling Davies has always lived in the hyphen, the space between worlds. Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she was the only child of a Welsh literature professor and a first-generation immigrant from Hong Kong. Her childhood was a gentle collision of cultures: reciting Dylan Thomas with her father in the foggy afternoons and folding wontons with her mother in the evenings, the scent of baking bread mingling with ginger and soy sauce. This duality made her a keen observer, always translating not just language but emotions and cultural cues for her family and herself.\n\nThis innate skill guided her educational journey. After studying sociology at UC Berkeley, a family mental health crisis became her pivotal turning point. Witnessing the profound impact of compassionate therapy firsthand, she felt a calling. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning her Master of Social Work. Mei-Ling spent the next decade working in demanding community health clinics, earning her LCSW licensure while navigating the bureaucratic and often heartbreaking realities of the public system. The experience solidified her resolve to create a different kind of healing space.\n\nNow, at fifty, Mei-Ling\u2019s life is one of deliberate design. She runs her private practice from a soundproofed, serene office in her Inner Richmond Edwardian flat, making her commute a simple walk down the hall. Her days begin with a walk through Golden Gate Park with her partner of twelve years, Clara, a landscape architect. From late morning until early evening, she holds space for her clients, specializing in identity, cross-cultural issues, and life transitions\u2014subjects she knows intimately.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is bone-deep. She loves the Inner Richmond for mirroring her own identity; she can buy world-class dim sum on Clement Street and artisanal cheese just blocks away. Having achieved professional stability, Mei-Ling\u2019s aspirations have turned toward legacy. She dreams of writing a book on navigating bicultural identity and mentoring young therapists of color, ensuring the next generation has the support she once craved. Her life, once defined by the space between, is now about building bridges for others."
