Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she was the only child of a Welsh literature professor and a first-generation immigrant from Hong Kong. Her childhood was a gentle collision of cultures: reciting Dylan Thomas with her father in the foggy afternoons and folding wontons with her mother in the evenings, the scent of baking bread mingling with ginger and soy sauce. This duality made her a keen observer, always translating not just language but emotions and cultural cues for her family and herself.\n\nThis innate skill guided her educational journey. After studying sociology at UC Berkeley, a family mental health crisis became her pivotal turning point. Witnessing the profound impact of compassionate therapy firsthand, she felt a calling. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning her Master of Social Work. Mei-Ling spent the next decade working in demanding community health clinics, earning her LCSW licensure while navigating the bureaucratic and often heartbreaking realities of the public system. The experience solidified her resolve to create a different kind of healing space.\n\nNow, at fifty, Mei-Ling\u2019s life is one of deliberate design. She runs her private practice from a soundproofed, serene office in her Inner Richmond Edwardian flat, making her commute a simple walk down the hall. Her days begin with a walk through Golden Gate Park with her partner of twelve years, Clara, a landscape architect. From late morning until early evening, she holds space for her clients, specializing in identity, cross-cultural issues, and life transitions\u2014subjects she knows intimately.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is bone-deep. She loves the Inner Richmond for mirroring her own identity; she can buy world-class dim sum on Clement Street and artisanal cheese just blocks away. Having achieved professional stability, Mei-Ling\u2019s aspirations have turned toward legacy. She dreams of writing a book on navigating bicultural identity and mentoring young therapists of color, ensuring the next generation has the support she once craved. Her life, once defined by the space between, is now about building bridges for others."

Her father\u2019s voice, a low Welsh rumble, recites Dylan Thomas while the sharp scent of ginger and scallions rises from her mother\u2019s wok. In that moment, she isn't choosing between worlds; she *is* the space between them. She understood then that love could speak two languages at once, and it was her job to listen to both. This taught her to find harmony in dissonance, a skill she would build her life upon.\n\n2.\nShe was twenty-two, perched on a worn chair in a clinic waiting room. The silence was heavy with the unsaid things that had fractured her family. But when her mother emerged from the therapist\u2019s office, Mei-Ling saw it: a tiny shift in her shoulders, a loosening around her eyes. It wasn't a cure, but it was *air*. In that moment, the abstract concept of sociology shattered, replaced by an urgent, tangible calling. She knew then she had to learn how to offer that same sacred breath of air to others.\n\n3.\nThe community clinic was perpetually fluorescent and smelled of disinfectant. Her client, a quiet teenager who felt like a ghost in their own home, hadn\u2019t spoken for three sessions. Then, one Tuesday, they whispered their secret, and Mei-Ling simply nodded, saying, \u201cI know that feeling.\u201d The quiet tears that followed felt like a dam breaking. The system was failing them, but in that small, sterile room, she knew she could build a raft. It solidified her resolve, at thirty, to one day create her own healing space.\n\n4.\nIt was an early walk with Clara in Golden Gate Park. She was thirty-eight. Clara, a landscape architect, stopped not just to admire a flower, but to explain how the huckleberry and sword fern created a supportive understory for the redwood sapling. Mei-Ling realized with a sudden, quiet joy that Clara saw *her* the same way\u2014not as a collection of conflicting parts, but as a whole, integrated landscape. For the first time, love felt less like translation and more like simply being understood.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young client, a brilliant designer struggling with familial expectations, said, \"It's just... you *get* the code-switching. I don't have to explain myself before I even start.\" The words landed with the weight of a lifetime. All the years of feeling \"in-between\" suddenly coalesced into their true purpose: not a space of lack, but a vantage point. At forty-nine, she understood this was her legacy\u2014holding a space where no translation was needed, a quiet room where you could finally arrive as yourself."
