Raised by a civil rights lawyer father and a university administrator mother, her childhood dinner table was a nightly seminar on policy, ethics, and social justice. This upbringing instilled in her a pragmatic idealism, a belief that systems could be improved from the inside. She pursued this belief with academic rigor, earning a Political Science degree from Vassar before completing a Master's in Public Policy at Georgetown.\n\nHer early career was a predictable D.C. trajectory: a junior fellowship at a think tank, followed by a policy advisor role for a senator focused on emerging technology. But Sarah grew frustrated with the glacial pace of legislative change, feeling she was writing reports that gathered dust while the world was being rapidly reshaped by code. The turning point came as a lucrative offer from a major San Francisco tech company. They wanted her D.C. experience to help them navigate the complex world of regulation. To her D.C. colleagues, it was selling out; to Sarah, it was a chance to have a more immediate, tangible impact.\n\nNow, at 35, her life is a study in contrasts. Her 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in the bay window of her Hayes Valley apartment. From here, she shapes global data privacy policies, her video calls connecting her to Brussels and Singapore. Yet, her daily life is hyperlocal. Mornings begin with a coffee from Ritual and a walk with her rescue dog, Buster, in Alamo Square Park. She knows the baristas and other dog owners by name, finding community in these small, consistent interactions.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech transplants and native San Franciscans\u2014with whom she debates the city's future over drinks at Anina or dinner in the Mission. While she values her career, her true aspiration is to lead a dedicated digital ethics team, one with the power to veto projects that cross moral lines. Sarah Cohen lives at the intersection of global tech and the neighborhood block, constantly striving to reconcile the fast-moving, often amoral world she influences from her laptop with the grounded, community-focused life she has carefully built for herself in San Francisco."
