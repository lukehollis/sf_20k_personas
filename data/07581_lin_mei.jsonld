Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants who poured their life savings into a modest multi-unit apartment building, Mei was raised on the principles of hard work and familial obligation. She was a dutiful daughter, quiet and observant, but nurtured a private passion for art and design, filling sketchbooks with vibrant cityscapes that contrasted with the muted tones of her neighborhood.\n\nHer educational journey began with promise at San Francisco State University, where she enrolled in the graphic design program. For two years, she thrived, feeling for the first time that her life was truly her own. However, this chapter was cut short when her father suffered a major health setback, leaving him unable to manage their property. Without hesitation, Mei put her education on hold to step in, believing it was a temporary sacrifice. The temporary became permanent.\n\nNow 31, Mei is the unofficial manager of her family\u2019s building and works as a remote administrative assistant for a larger real estate firm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk from her own apartment to the small, converted office space on the ground floor. Her days are a predictable rhythm of processing paperwork, coordinating maintenance, and listening to the familiar complaints and stories of her tenants, many of whom have known her since she was a child.\n\nSocially, her life is small but steady. She has a few close friends from high school and maintains a loving, if sometimes suffocating, relationship with her parents. The turning point in her quiet life is an internal one. The creative spark she suppressed for a decade has begun to reignite. She spends her evenings sketching again and secretly browses online courses, a quiet rebellion against her prescribed role.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; the Sunset is in her bones. Yet, she dreams of a different city\u2014one where she isn\u2019t just Mei, the landlord\u2019s daughter. Her greatest hope is to finally finish her degree, not for a career change, but for herself. She aspires to one day have an apartment in a different neighborhood, to pay her own rent, and to define her life not by duty, but by a design of her own making."
