Raised in a large, boisterous family where privacy was a luxury, she learned to be observant and efficient from a young age, mastering the art of being indispensable yet invisible. Her formal education was fragmented and practicality was valued over diplomas; her real schooling came from navigating complex family dynamics and managing a chaotic household.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco at 26, her heart tethered to a partner who had painted a picture of a shared, vibrant future. For a few years, that dream felt real. But the relationship frayed and eventually snapped, leaving her alone in a city that suddenly felt vast and indifferent. This was her defining turning point. Stripped of her support system, Mei had to rely solely on her innate resourcefulness. She took on a series of thankless jobs\u2014cleaning offices, washing dishes\u2014always punctual, meticulous, and silent.\n\nHer diligence was eventually noticed by the manager of the apartment building where she was cleaning. He needed someone to handle paperwork, answer tenant calls, and keep records. Mei, with her quiet competence, was perfect. The position came with a small apartment in the building, and just like that, her world shrank from the sprawling city to a few city blocks. Her commute became a walk down one flight of stairs.\n\nNow 44, Mei\u2019s life is a study in routine. She is the quiet hub of her building in Nob Hill, the person who knows when packages arrive, which faucet is dripping, and whose rent is late. Her social connections are a web of brief, polite interactions: a nod to the mail carrier, a shared word about the fog with Mrs. Gable in 3B, a smile for the family in 5A. Her past is a locked room she rarely enters.\n\nHer dreams are no longer grand. She doesn\u2019t aspire to own a condo managed by her agency, but simply to maintain the quiet stability she has fought so hard to build. Her greatest hope is to one day have an apartment with a small balcony, where she can grow herbs in pots. For Mei, San Francisco isn't the Golden Gate Bridge; it's the comforting rattle of the cable car two streets over and the view of rooftops from her fourth-floor window\u2014a small, ordered world she carefully maintains."
