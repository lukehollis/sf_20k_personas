His parents, an engineer and a school administrator who arrived from Uttar Pradesh in the 1970s, instilled in him a dual reverence for academic excellence and tireless work. Rohan absorbed these lessons, excelling through the demanding Bay Area school system and earning a biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nInitially on a pre-med track, a pivotal summer internship at a biotech firm revealed his true passion was not in the lab, but in the boardroom where strategic decisions gave science its direction and funding. This realization led him to pursue an MBA at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, a decision that initially disappointed his parents but ultimately defined his career. He was recruited straight out of his program into a prestigious consulting firm in San Francisco.\n\nFor over a decade, Rohan\u2019s life was a blur of slide decks, stakeholder meetings, and cross-country flights. He thrived on the intellectual rigor, helping pharmaceutical giants and ambitious startups navigate the complex path to market. His six-figure income afforded him a sleek condo in Hayes Valley, but the cost was personal. A serious relationship in his early thirties crumbled under the weight of his 70-hour workweeks, a sacrifice he still quietly regrets.\n\nNow 41, Rohan\u2019s routine is disciplined. His day begins with a strong coffee and a scan of industry news before he catches the MUNI for the short ride to his FiDi office. Evenings are often spent finalizing proposals, but he carves out time for the gym or dinner with a close circle of friends, mostly fellow professionals.\n\nLately, a sense of restlessness has crept in. The prestige of his title feels less fulfilling. Rohan finds himself dreaming not of a bigger paycheck, but of tangible impact. He aspires to leave consulting and join a mid-stage biotech company as a Chief Strategy Officer, wanting to build something lasting rather than just advise. He looks out from his balcony at the bustling city lights, no longer seeing just a landscape of opportunity, but a place where he hopes to finally build a life of deeper meaning and connection, one that balances ambition with partnership."

When he told his father he wasn\u2019t taking the MCAT, the silence on the other end felt heavier than any textbook. His father finally said, \"This is not the plan.\" Rohan's reply, \"It's my plan,\" was the most terrifying and liberating sentence he had ever spoken. It was the first time he chose his own ambition over their shared dream, a choice that defined his independence.\n\n2.\nThe digital confirmation for their anniversary weekend in Napa was still open on his laptop. He can still see Chloe\u2019s face when he told her he had to fly to Boston for a last-minute client pitch. It wasn't anger, but a quiet, weary resignation that hurt more. She\u2019d simply nodded and said, \"Of course.\" That night, the silence in their apartment felt final. It was the moment he realized that in his relentless climb, he had sacrificed the very partnership he was supposedly building a life for.\n\n3.\nHis first night in the Hayes Valley condo, around age thirty. He stood on the small balcony, holding a bottle of expensive whiskey, the city lights glittering below like a conquered kingdom. This was it\u2014the view he\u2019d paid for with 70-hour workweeks and cancelled plans. He felt a sharp, profound sense of achievement, immediately followed by an equally profound loneliness. He had the prize, but he was celebrating entirely alone. It was the first crack in the facade of his success.\n\n4.\nIt was a celebratory dinner. They had just saved a client $200 million on a drug launch. As the senior partner raised a champagne flute, Rohan looked around the table at the smiling, exhausted faces. He felt nothing. The victory was abstract, a number on a slide deck that felt utterly disconnected from any real human impact. In that moment, surrounded by colleagues, he felt like an imposter at his own party, realizing the prestige he'd chased for a decade felt hollow. This occurred just last year.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, on a rare, clear Saturday, he walked through the Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park. He stopped before a sign detailing the medicinal properties of a rare fern. He felt a ghost of the fascination that had first drawn him to biology at Berkeley\u2014a pure, uncomplicated curiosity. It was a stark contrast to his work reducing science to market-share projections. That quiet moment crystallized his desire: to get back to the root of it all, to build something real from that initial spark."
