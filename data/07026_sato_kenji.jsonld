A third-generation Japanese-American, he grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento, the only son of a landscape gardener and a dental hygienist. His parents, models of quiet diligence, instilled in him a powerful work ethic, hoping he\u2019d pursue a stable career in medicine or engineering. Kenji, however, was captivated by stories. He spent his youth lost in books about feudal Japan and the California Gold Rush, which led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in History from UC Santa Cruz, a choice his parents quietly questioned.\n\nAfter graduating, the reality of a historian's salary set in. Following a few years of low-paying work cataloging artifacts for a small Bay Area museum, Kenji hit a turning point. Watching his friends find success during the tech boom, he made a calculated pivot. He leveraged his methodical research skills and knack for organization to earn a project management certification. This new credential was his ticket into San Francisco\u2019s tech world, where he discovered a surprising aptitude for steering complex software projects toward their deadlines.\n\nNow, at 39, Kenji\u2019s life is anchored in his Inner Richmond apartment, the source of his 0.0-mile commute. His days follow a steady rhythm: a morning pour-over from a local cafe on Clement Street, hours of focused work coordinating between remote engineering and design teams, and a late afternoon walk through Golden Gate Park to decompress. His social life is small but meaningful, centered around a weekly bouldering session with a few close friends and exploring the city\u2019s diverse culinary scene.\n\nWhile content with the stability he\u2019s built, Kenji feels a familiar pull toward the past. His great-grandparents were interned at Manzanar, a history he feels a deep responsibility to preserve. His ultimate aspiration is to merge his two worlds: he dreams of leading a project to create an immersive digital archive or a historical walking tour app, using technology not just to build products, but to tell the forgotten stories of his city and his heritage."
