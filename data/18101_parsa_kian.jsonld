His parents, a doctor and a professor, fled Tehran in 1981 with little more than their education and a fierce determination to provide for their unborn son. Settling in San Jose's burgeoning Iranian community, they instilled in Kian a quiet debt of gratitude and an unspoken expectation of success. He internalized this, excelling in school and pursuing a practical computer science degree from UC Davis, landing a solid software engineering job in the wake of the dot-com bust.\n\nFor years, Kian coded diligently, but he found himself more captivated by the 'why' than the 'how'. He was fascinated by user behavior and business strategy. This led to his major turning point: enrolling in UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. The MBA was his bridge from the server room to the boardroom. He pivoted into product management, his blend of technical fluency and strategic thinking making him a natural. He climbed the ladder steadily, through successful product launches and one failed startup that taught him more than any success. Now, as a Director of Product, he navigates complex roadmaps and mentors a team of ambitious PMs.\n\nHis personal life has been less linear. A marriage in his early thirties ended amicably after five years, a casualty of two demanding tech careers pulling in different directions. Now 42, Kian lives a life of disciplined comfort in a modern Hayes Valley condo. His daily routine begins with a run through the Panhandle, followed by a 3.5-mile MUNI ride downtown\u2014a cherished buffer between his serene home life and the relentless demands of his SoMa office. He finds solace in the city's culture, from chamber music at the SFJAZZ Center to exploring the Mission's culinary scene with a tight-knit group of friends.\n\nHaving achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of for him, Kian\u2019s aspirations have shifted. He feels a pull to create something with a more personal legacy, perhaps advising Iranian-American founders or investing in ventures with a social conscience. He seeks a life defined not just by professional achievement, but by a deeper sense of connection and impact."

It was her faculty ID from the University of Tehran. Her face, younger and framed by a hijab, stared back. He\u2019d heard the stories, but holding this worn relic made it real\u2014the life, the career, the country she abandoned for him. In that silent San Jose bedroom, the abstract weight of his parents' sacrifice settled onto his shoulders, becoming the quiet, defining force of his ambition.\n\n2.\nIt was 10 PM in a sterile conference room. As an engineer, Kian was just supposed to be a fly on the wall during the product roadmap debate. But he saw a flaw in the user acquisition model nobody else did. Heart pounding, he spoke up, outlining the problem and a potential fix. The Director of Product stopped, looked at him, and nodded slowly. \"He's right.\" In that moment, Kian felt a thrilling clarity. He wasn't just building the 'how'; he belonged in the room that decided the 'why'. He started his Haas application the next week.\n\n3.\nThe startup was dead. After the final meeting, Kian and his co-founder sat alone in the empty office, sharing a warm beer from the now-unplugged kegerator. There were no tears or recriminations, just a profound, shared exhaustion. They laughed about a disastrous early pitch and toasted to their expensive failure. He realized then that success wasn't the only valuable outcome. The experience forged a humility and resilience in him that no successful product launch ever could, a lesson he now passes on to his junior PMs.\n\n4.\nThe movers were gone. He and his wife\u2014soon to be ex-wife\u2014sat on the hardwood floor of their empty condo, sharing a final pizza from a box balanced between them. There was no anger, only a deep, quiet sadness for the future they couldn't build together. Their demanding careers had pulled them apart with respectful, relentless gravity. That amicable ending taught him that a successful life required more than professional alignment; it needed a shared, breathable space that their parallel ambitions could never allow.\n\n5.\nHe almost skipped the pitch event for immigrant founders, but a name on the list\u2014a young Iranian-American woman\u2014intrigued him. He watched her present her app with the same fierce intelligence he recognized in his own parents. Afterwards, he sought her out, not as a Director of Product, but simply as Kian. Listening to her story, he felt a powerful sense of purpose crystallize. The security his parents had fought for wasn't just for him to keep; it was for him to reinvest in stories that felt like his own."
