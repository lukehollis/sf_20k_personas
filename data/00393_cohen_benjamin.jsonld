Born in Seoul, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish couple in a quiet Chicago suburb. His parents, a history professor and a librarian, raised him with a deep appreciation for education, debate, and cultural traditions that were theirs, not his by birth. Benjamin grew up feeling both deeply loved and subtly out of place, a studious Asian boy celebrating Hanukkah in a predominantly white neighborhood. This duality fostered in him a quiet, observant nature and a powerful need for order in a world that felt intrinsically complex.\n\nHe pursued the most orderly profession he could imagine: accounting. After earning an undergraduate degree in finance, he completed an MBA at Northwestern. His path was a straight line of logical decisions, a stark contrast to the unanswered questions of his origins. In his late twenties, drawn by the tech boom and the promise of a city where no one\u2019s background was a novelty, he moved to San Francisco. He built a successful career as a CPA, his methodical and trustworthy nature making him an invaluable asset to venture capital firms and tech startups navigating complex financials.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce a decade ago. It was amicable, a mutual agreement that their paths had diverged, but it solidified his preference for a solitary, controlled existence. The pandemic then normalized his ideal work environment: his quiet, book-lined home office in Noe Valley. Now, at 51, his life is a testament to routine. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his kitchen, coffee in hand, to his desk. His days are a rhythm of spreadsheets, client calls, and walks through his peaceful neighborhood, where he\u2019s a familiar face at the local bakery and bookstore.\n\nBenjamin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. He loves the city\u2019s comforting fog, the feeling of being in a metropolis that allows for anonymity. While he has friends, his social life is curated and small. His deepest aspiration isn't a career pinnacle\u2014he\u2019s already achieved stability\u2014but a quiet, personal pilgrimage. He dreams of one day visiting Seoul, not to find his birth family, but simply to walk the streets and breathe the air of his birthplace, closing a circle on his own terms."
