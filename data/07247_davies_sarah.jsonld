Born in Cardiff, Wales, to a Welsh dockworker father and a Filipina nurse mother, Sarah\u2019s early life was a blend of misty UK shores and the vibrant warmth of her mother's heritage. The Davies family immigrated to the United States when Sarah was ten, seeking better opportunities and settling in San Francisco\u2019s historically working-class Dogpatch neighborhood.\n\nSarah\u2019s formal education ended with a diploma from a local SF high school. College was a luxury her family couldn't afford, and a sense of duty was instilled in her early on. She found work almost immediately, her nimble fingers and unwavering focus making her a natural fit for a small, specialized electronics firm that manufactured custom medical components. She started on the line and never left, mastering the intricate assembly of delicate devices.\n\nThe most significant turning point in her life was her father\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack when she was 25. Overnight, she became the primary caregiver for her aging mother. This cemented her path, tethering her to the steady, reliable income of her assembly job. Her world shrank to the few blocks around her home.\n\nToday, at 38, Sarah\u2019s life exists within a unique bubble. She lives in a live/work loft, just one floor above the small manufacturing workshop where she is employed. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of industrial stairs. Her daily routine is a metronome of precision: wake, care for her mother, descend to the cleanroom environment for her shift, and return upstairs in the evening. Her social life is minimal, consisting of polite conversations with her few colleagues and a shared nod with neighbors.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is not one of landmarks, but of sensory details\u2014the rumble of the T-Third streetcar, the scent of sea salt and coffee from a nearby roaster, the specific quality of the light as fog blankets the Potrero hills. Her dream isn't of career advancement or a different life, but something more profound. Every spare dollar is saved for a single purpose: a trip to the Philippines with her mother, to finally see the villages and meet the family she only knows from faded photographs and heartfelt stories."
