A third-generation Japanese-American, she was raised in the quiet suburbs of San Jose by practical, second-generation parents who preached stability. However, it was her Nisei grandmother, with her serene ikebana arrangements and collection of vintage silk kimonos, who secretly nurtured Naomi\u2019s eye for beauty and form. This led her to pursue a Master's in Art History from UC Berkeley, a choice that baffled her engineer father.\n\nFacing the limited prospects of academia, Naomi took a part-time job at a high-end boutique in San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley to pay her bills. Here, her academic knowledge found a surprising and powerful application. She could articulate why a certain silhouette echoed Art Deco lines or how a color palette drew from Impressionist painters. Her talent for visual storytelling and trend forecasting was undeniable. She quickly ascended from the sales floor to assistant buyer, then was recruited by a major apparel corporation. Over two decades, she built a formidable career, becoming the Director of Merchandising she is today.\n\nNow 46, Naomi\u2019s life is centered in her meticulously designed Hayes Valley condo, which doubles as her office. The 0.0-mile commute, a product of the post-pandemic shift, has reshaped her days. Mornings begin not with a rush, but with the quiet ritual of tending to her bonsai tree and brewing a perfect cup of sencha. Her workday is a whirlwind of Zoom calls with global vendors, intense data analysis, and digital mood boards. After work, she reclaims her neighborhood, enjoying walks to discover new art installations at Proxy or dining with a small, close-knit circle of friends, many of whom also work in creative industries.\n\nThough professionally fulfilled, Naomi yearns for a deeper connection to her heritage. Her dream is to take a six-month sabbatical to study traditional textile arts in Kyoto, the city her grandmother left behind. She aspires to eventually leave the corporate world behind, perhaps opening her own consulting firm advising brands on sustainable sourcing and timeless design\u2014a final, perfect merger of her family history, her education, and her hard-won expertise."
