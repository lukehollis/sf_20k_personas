Born to a Caucasian-American father and a first-generation Chinese mother, Ethan grew up navigating two cultures. His childhood was filled with the aroma of his grandmother\u2019s (Nai Nai\u2019s) cooking, stories of Guangzhou, and the constant, comforting presence of the Pacific fog rolling in from Ocean Beach. He was a quintessential city kid, bright and full of kinetic energy.\n\nHis path seemed clear. After graduating from a local high school, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a degree in Kinesiology. He was fascinated by the mechanics of the human body and imagined a future as a physical therapist. For two years, his life was a familiar rhythm of classes, late-night study sessions at the library, and pick-up basketball games with friends.\n\nThe turning point was abrupt and unforgiving. During his junior year, his beloved Nai Nai suffered a debilitating stroke. The family couldn\u2019t afford the exorbitant cost of full-time professional care, and his mother was already working two jobs. Faced with an impossible choice, Ethan made the decision that would redefine his life: he put his education on indefinite hold to become his grandmother\u2019s primary caregiver. He took a short certification course to become a Caregiver Assistant, formalizing the role he was assuming out of love and duty.\n\nNow, at 24, Ethan's 0.0-mile commute is the walk from his small in-law apartment to his grandmother\u2019s room in the main house. His days are a meticulously planned loop of administering medication, preparing soft foods, assisting with physical therapy exercises, and providing companionship. His old college friends call less frequently, their lives of career-building and travel a world away from his. His social connections are now the pharmacist on Geary, his grandmother\u2019s doctors at UCSF, and the quiet nod exchanged with other caregivers at the park.\n\nWhile he still dreams of finishing his degree, his aspirations have shifted. The sacrifice has forged a new purpose within him. He now envisions a future not just in physical therapy, but specifically in geriatrics, using his profound, firsthand experience to bring dignity and compassion to the elderly. In the quiet hours after his Nai Nai is asleep, Ethan often walks the few blocks to Ocean Beach, the cold sand and roaring surf a vast, solitary comfort. It is here he feels the weight of his responsibility, but also the deep, unwavering connection to the family and the city that he refuses to leave behind."

Her hands, nimble and sure, guided his clumsy ones as she laughed, telling him stories of the Dragon Boat Festival in Guangzhou. The kitchen was filled with the earthy scent of bamboo and pork belly. That memory of her vitality and joyful patience became the anchor for his devotion, a reminder of the person he was fighting to honor.\n    \n    *Occurred: Age 9*\n    \n    ***\n    \n    2.  The fluorescent lights of the SF State library hummed at 2 AM. Ethan stared at the complex diagram of the rotator cuff muscles until it suddenly clicked. A jolt of pure academic bliss shot through him. He imagined telling his clients exactly how their body worked. This memory from his old life isn't a source of regret, but a private reminder of the dream he once had, a foundation of knowledge he now applies with more love and purpose than he could have ever imagined.\n    \n    *Occurred: Age 20*\n    \n    ***\n    \n    3.  At the kitchen table, his mother\u2019s shoulders slumped over a pile of medical bills. Ethan listened to the labored sound of his Nai Nai\u2019s breathing from the other room. He saw the path his life was on and the path his family needed him to take. \"I'll do it,\" he said, the words feeling both impossibly heavy and absolutely right. \"I'll stop school and take care of her.\" In that moment, his kinetic energy settled into a profound gravity, trading his future for hers.\n    \n    *Occurred: Age 21*\n    \n    ***\n    \n    4.  He was gently massaging his Nai Nai\u2019s hand, a daily ritual that often felt fruitless. Her eyes had been vacant for days. Suddenly, her fingers tightened around his, a flicker of recognition in her gaze. She turned her head and whispered a single, raspy word: \u201cEthan.\u201d The sound was a tidal wave of relief and love, washing away weeks of exhaustion. It was a small victory that affirmed his purpose, proving that his presence was more powerful than any medicine.\n    \n    *Occurred: Age 23*\n    \n    ***\n    \n    5.  One night, he stood at the edge of Ocean Beach, the fog so thick it swallowed the surf's spray. The loneliness was immense, a physical weight. Yet, listening to the ocean's roar, he didn't feel lost. He felt rooted. This was his city, his home, his responsibility. There, in the cold and the dark, he accepted that his world had shrunk to a few blocks, but in doing so, his capacity for love had become as vast and deep as the Pacific before him.\n    \n    *Occurred: Age 24*"
