Born in Apia, she moved to Daly City with her family at age seven. Her immigrant parents, rooted in practicality, saw her natural artistic talent as a charming hobby, not a viable career. They encouraged a path of stability, leading her to a Bachelor's in Business Administration from SF State\u2014a degree she earned with competence but little passion.\n\nThe sterile environment of a downtown corporate office felt like a betrayal to her spirit. After three soul-crushing years, she quit. In her late twenties, she took a significant pay cut for a part-time job at \"The Pigment Pot,\" an old, cluttered art supply store in the heart of the Mission Arts District. Here, surrounded by the familiar scents of turpentine and linseed oil, she felt home. Her business degree, once a symbol of compromise, made her an invaluable employee. She understood inventory and margins as well as she understood the difference between cadmium and vermilion.\n\nA major turning point came fifteen years ago when the aging owner retired. Seeing her unmatched dedication, he offered her the manager position and the chance to rent the small but light-filled apartment above the shop. This cemented her place in the neighborhood, creating her 0.0-mile commute.\n\nNow 49, Sarah is the quiet matriarch of the local art scene. She has never married or had children; her family is the community she serves. She knows which SF State student is struggling with perspective and which muralist needs a specific shade of spray paint. Her days are a routine of service and expertise. Evenings are her own. In her small apartment studio, she finally creates for herself\u2014expressive, abstract landscapes that echo her Samoan heritage and Mission upbringing.\n\nHer greatest hope is to one day buy The Pigment Pot, protecting it from the gentrification that has claimed so many local businesses. Sarah\u2019s dream isn't fame, but preservation: to ensure the store remains a sanctuary, a place where the next generation can always find their tools, and some quiet guidance from the woman who lives upstairs."
