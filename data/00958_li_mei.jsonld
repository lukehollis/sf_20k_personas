Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, her world was the small, family-owned Cantonese restaurant her parents poured their lives into. Formal education was a distant luxury; her classroom was the front counter, where she took orders, and the back office, where she tallied receipts. Though she never attended college, Mei possessed a sharp, orderly mind that saw patterns in everything\u2014from the ebb and flow of dinner rushes to the most popular dishes on specific days of the week.\n\nHer turning point came not in a lecture hall, but during a slow Tuesday night at age 22. Frustrated with wasted inventory, she started tracking sales in a simple spreadsheet. This small act of optimization ignited a passion. She discovered a world of free online courses and coding bootcamps, devouring lessons on SQL, Python, and data visualization late into the night after the restaurant closed. The methodical logic of code was a profound comfort, a secret language that made sense of the world\u2019s chaos.\n\nArmed with a portfolio of personal projects\u2014analyzing Muni's on-time performance, mapping neighborhood farmers' market trends\u2014she landed a junior contract role at a small tech startup that valued raw skill over a framed diploma. Her intuition, honed by years of real-world observation, made her a natural. She wasn\u2019t just crunching numbers; she was telling stories with them. Within a few years, her reputation for clear-sighted analysis led to her current position as a Senior Data Analyst.\n\nNow 34, Mei's life is contained within a few square miles. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a standing desk in the corner of her quiet Sunset apartment, just six blocks from her childhood home. Her days are a disciplined mix of focused work, video calls, and walks to Ocean Beach to clear her head in the salt-laced air. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of her retired parents, whom she visits for weekly dinners, and a handful of friends from a local pottery class. She dreams of one day creating a mentorship program to help others from non-traditional backgrounds break into tech, proving that the most valuable education is often the one you build for yourself."
