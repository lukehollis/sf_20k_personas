Born in Fremont to immigrants from Delhi, he was raised under the long shadow of Silicon Valley\u2019s promise. While his father, an engineer, hoped he\u2019d follow a technical path, David was always more interested in people than processors. He pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Communications from San Jose State University, a choice that baffled his family but set the course for his unique career.\n\nHe entered the tech world during the frenetic dot-com boom of the late 90s. He wasn't a coder, but he excelled at managing them. David found his niche as a \"translator\" between brilliant but chaotic engineering teams and the rigid demands of product deadlines. He survived the dot-com bust by being pragmatic and reliable, eventually rising to Production Supervisor. For over two decades, his life was defined by the grueling commute down the 101, a necessary sacrifice for a stable career.\n\nThe key turning point was an unexpected one: the global pandemic. The mandated work-from-home order that trapped so many became David\u2019s liberation. His company went fully remote, and his commute evaporated to zero. This change fundamentally reshaped his life. He and his wife, Priya, an elementary school principal, had bought their home in the Inner Sunset years earlier, but now David could truly live in it.\n\nNow an empty-nester with two daughters in college, his days have a peaceful rhythm. He starts with coffee from a cafe on 9th Avenue, manages his international teams via Zoom from a sunlit home office, and takes midday breaks to walk among the redwoods in Golden Gate Park. His social life consists of quiet dinners with a few long-time friends and weekend trips with Priya. Having navigated the tech industry's volatility, his aspirations are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He dreams of buying a small sailboat to explore the Bay, a tangible skill completely removed from the digital world. For David, San Francisco is no longer just a prestigious address; it's a neighborhood, a park, and a hard-won peace he cherishes every day."
