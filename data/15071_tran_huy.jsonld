At five years old, his most vivid memories are of water, the crush of a boat, and his mother\u2019s tight grip. His family arrived in the city as refugees, settling into a cramped apartment in the Tenderloin. They carried almost nothing with them, their history reduced to oral stories and a single, creased photograph of his grandparents. This absence of a visual past would become the defining force of Huy\u2019s life.\n\nHis father worked two jobs, his mother sewed garments from their living room, and the pressure to contribute was immense. Huy was a quiet, observant student, but after graduating from high school, he bypassed college to work full-time, helping support his aging parents. He found a clerical job in the city\u2019s records department, a role that suited his meticulous nature. It was there, surrounded by microfilm and decaying documents, that he discovered his calling. A senior archivist, noticing Huy\u2019s fascination with old photographs, took him under her wing, teaching him preservation techniques and the art of telling stories through images.\n\nOver two decades, Huy became an expert, his lack of a degree overshadowed by his passion and deep institutional knowledge. Now a photo archivist for a local historical society, he spends his days saving the memories of other families. His key turning point wasn't a grand event, but the slow, dawning realization that he could give others the one thing his family had lost.\n\nToday, Huy lives a life of quiet routine in the Outer Sunset. His small apartment, filled with books on photography and San Francisco history, is his sanctuary. Each morning, he takes the N Judah downtown, watching the city wake up through the train window. His social circle is small but devoted: his younger sister and her family, with whom he shares Sunday dinners, and a few colleagues who share his reverence for the past. His dream is a deeply personal one: to one day curate an exhibition on the Vietnamese refugee experience in the Bay Area, ensuring those histories, including his own, are never lost to time. Huy sees his work not as a job, but as a quiet rebellion against forgetting."

It was the only tangible proof of a life before the water. His mother told him their names, but Huy saw only silent, smiling ghosts. He felt a profound, childish duty to protect this fragile connection to a world he couldn\u2019t remember. That piece of paper wasn\u2019t just a picture; it was his family\u2019s entire visual history, and its loneliness planted a seed in him.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe was eighteen, sitting at the small kitchen table. He watched his father rub his tired eyes and knew what he had to do. Announcing he wouldn't go to college wasn't a moment of defiance, but of quiet resignation. He saw the flicker of disappointment in his parents' faces, quickly replaced by relief. In that moment, the weight of their sacrifice settled fully onto his own shoulders. It wasn't a burden, but a purpose. This act of duty cemented a core part of his character: family first, always.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was a dusty Tuesday afternoon in the city archives, years before his promotion. Eleanor, the senior archivist, handed him a glass plate negative\u2014a portrait of a girl from 1910. He held it up to the light, seeing not just an image, but the captured soul of a past he could touch. It felt sacred. He understood then that this wasn't about filing documents; it was about stewardship. That fragile piece of glass, and Eleanor's trust in him, unlocked the door to his life's true work.\n\n***\n\n4.\nA woman in her nineties, with hands as delicate as old paper, brought in a shoebox. Inside was a photo of her family arriving at the Ferry Building. As Huy scanned the image, he wasn\u2019t just looking at her history. He saw his own un-photographed arrival reflected in their hopeful, weary faces. He felt a sudden, powerful kinship that transcended culture and time. This was the moment his job became a mission: to stand guard over these shared stories of becoming, especially for those who couldn\u2019t.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, at Sunday dinner, his young niece asked to see a picture of him as a little boy in Vietnam. Huy opened his mouth to tell a story, but the words felt hollow without an image to anchor them. A familiar ache, sharp and sudden, pierced through his quiet contentment. He saw the same absence he\u2019d felt his whole life reflected in her curious eyes. It was then his vague dream of an exhibition became an urgent need\u2014a quiet rebellion to ensure no other child had to ask that question in vain."
