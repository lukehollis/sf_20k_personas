Raised in a historic suburb of Boston, the son of a pragmatic engineer father and a bookish librarian mother, he learned early to appreciate both the structural integrity and the narrative soul of old buildings. This dual fascination led him not to architecture itself, but to the preservation of it. After completing a Master of Science in Historic Preservation, he began his career in New York City, meticulously documenting and managing restoration projects.\n\nThe turning point came at 32 with a job offer from a prestigious San Francisco design firm. They needed a project manager with his unique skillset for an audacious task: seismically retrofitting and transforming a dilapidated Ghirardelli Square warehouse into a modern culinary arts academy. David moved west, trading colonial brick for Pacific-facing concrete and falling for a city that wore its history in visible, sometimes volatile, layers.\n\nNow 43, David is a Senior Project Manager, the vital link between visionary architects and grounded construction crews on projects breathing new life into old spaces\u2014theaters, galleries, and cultural centers. His 0.0-mile commute is the result of his most personal project: the painstaking conversion of a former machine shop in Dogpatch into a stunning live/work loft. This space is his sanctuary and his showroom, filled with salvaged materials and clean, modern lines.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm of video conferences from his steel-framed home office, site visits via his e-bike, and evenings spent either sketching out personal project ideas or sharing wine with a tight-knit circle of friends from the city\u2019s design and art scenes. A long-term relationship ended amicably a few years ago, the casualty of two ambitious careers, and he now values his thoughtful independence. David\u2019s aspiration is to eventually launch his own consultancy specializing in adaptive reuse, helping preserve the architectural character of San Francisco. He finds deep satisfaction not just living in the city, but in actively shaping its future by honoring its past."

While his new colleagues saw dilapidation, David saw the ghost of its past life in the scarred concrete floors and the vast, steel-sash windows facing the bay. He ran a hand over a rust-stained girder and felt not a chill, but a current of potential. In that echo-filled silence, the anxieties of his cross-country move dissolved. He knew, with absolute certainty, he was home.\n\n2.\nHe must have been nine, sitting on the dusty attic floor of their colonial home in Massachusetts. His father, smelling of sawdust and patience, was meticulously sistering a new joist alongside a cracked, centuries-old beam. His mother sat nearby, absorbed in a book about the house's original builders. He watched his father\u2019s careful hands respect the old wood while making it strong, and understood, even then, the dialogue between structure and story. It was the day he learned a building\u2019s soul needs a sound body to survive.\n\n3.\nThe day the last contractor left his Dogpatch loft two years ago, David didn't have a party. He just stood in the center of the room as evening light poured through the massive industrial windows, listening to the silence. He'd personally salvaged the Douglas fir beams and milled them for his bookshelves. This space wasn't just designed; it was curated from the city\u2019s bones. It was the first home that was entirely, unapologetically his\u2014the physical manifestation of his hard-won independence and professional philosophy made real.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the conversation not as a fight, but as a quiet, heartbreaking treaty. Around age 40, he and Anna were on the floor of their old apartment, blueprints for their respective projects spread between them. \"We're building beautiful things, just... separately,\" she'd said. It wasn\u2019t a failure of love, but an honest acknowledgment of ambition. That moment taught him that some structures, no matter how well-designed, can't be retrofitted to hold two fundamentally different futures. It solidified a bittersweet appreciation for his own path.\n\n5.\nIt was a foggy Tuesday last spring. He was gliding on his e-bike through the Mission to a site visit, the hum of the motor a soft counterpoint to the city waking up. He passed a vibrant, block-long mural splashed across a Victorian facade, then a gleaming new condo next to a beloved, generations-old taqueria. The fog muted the colors but amplified the feeling\u2014a city constantly editing itself, layering new stories onto the old. He felt less like an observer and more like a participant, a stitch in its complex fabric."
