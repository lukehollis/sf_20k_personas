Raised in the manicured suburbs of Portland, Oregon, by a dentist father and a high school principal mother, Ethan was an anomaly\u2014a quiet observer in a family of structured achievers. They saw his fascination with color and form as a hobby, encouraging a more practical path. He complied, enrolling at the University of Oregon and earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, a pragmatic choice that felt like a foreign language. His true education, however, happened in the elective courses of his Art History minor, where the lives of Rothko and de Kooning felt more real than any supply-and-demand curve.\n\nThe turning point was a college road trip to San Francisco. While his friends gravitated toward Fisherman's Wharf, Ethan found himself lost in the Mission District, stumbling into a small, vibrant gallery. It wasn't just the art on the walls; it was the energy, the community of artists and patrons discussing a piece with fierce passion. He saw a future where his organizational skills, honed by his business degree, could serve the world he truly loved.\n\nAfter graduation, he moved to a cramped room in the Outer Richmond, taking an unpaid internship at a SoMa gallery and bussing tables at night to survive. For two years, he learned the trade from the ground up\u2014crating canvases, managing mailing lists, and talking to artists about their process. His diligence and quiet competence paid off when he was hired as the Gallery Coordinator for Aperture Contemporary, a respected space in Hayes Valley.\n\nNow 28, Ethan lives in a small studio apartment directly above the gallery. His life is a blur of artist liaisons, installation planning, and opening nights. His social circle is woven from the art world\u2014curators, collectors, and the struggling painters he champions. A recent breakup with a partner who felt second-place to the gallery has left him feeling both liberated and a little lonely. His daily routine consists of a morning walk to a local caf\u00e9 for an oat latte, followed by a full day immersed in the art downstairs. San Francisco, for Ethan, isn't the Golden Gate Bridge; it's the specific hue of the fog rolling down Hayes Street and the raw, creative ambition that pulses from every studio and gallery. His dream isn't to create art, but to be the one who nurtures it\u2014to one day become a full curator, shaping the city's artistic conversation one discovery at a time."
