The son of a pragmatic accountant and a high school English teacher, David\u2019s fascination with art was a private rebellion. His turning point was a high school field trip to the Art Institute, where a towering Willem de Kooning painting ignited a passion his parents would never fully understand. He pursued this calling with quiet determination, earning a Master's in Art History with a focus on Post-War American Abstraction from NYU.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the rebellious energy of the Mission School artists and the burgeoning wealth of the first dot-com boom. David cut his teeth working for a prestigious Union Square gallery, but he found the retail aspect stifling. He was a gifted connector, more interested in understanding a collector\u2019s psychology than just making a sale. In 2008, a prominent tech founder, tired of gallery politics, hired David to manage his entire collection privately. This was the launch of his independent advisory career.\n\nNow 46, David operates his business from a meticulously designed Pacific Heights condo, which explains his zero-mile commute. His home is a living gallery, with rotating pieces from emerging artists showcased against stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge. His days are a mix of disciplined solitude and intense social engagement: mornings spent researching auction records and Skyping with European gallerists, evenings spent at exclusive gallery dinners and SFMOMA galas.\n\nDavid's social circle is a tightly-knit web of artists, curators, and clients. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, a casualty of his all-consuming career, leaving a subtle air of melancholy beneath his polished exterior. He maintains close friendships but keeps his inner world guarded. His deepest connection is to the city itself\u2014its restless ambition and its appreciation for aesthetics. David\u2019s ultimate dream is not just to accrue wealth for his clients, but to discover the next visionary artist and help build a collection so significant it will one day hang in a museum, a legacy far more enduring than any stock portfolio."
