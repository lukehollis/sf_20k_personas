From his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset, he spends his days navigating the most turbulent moments in other people's lives. The son of software engineers who immigrated from Mumbai to Fremont, Rohan was raised on a steady diet of high expectations, with a clear path laid out for him: engineering or medicine. He began his undergraduate studies at UC Davis on a pre-med track, dutifully memorizing biological pathways while feeling a profound sense of detachment.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer rotation at the university\u2019s medical center. It wasn\u2019t the procedures or diagnoses that captivated him, but the shell-shocked families in the waiting rooms, lost in a maze of jargon, insurance forms, and fear. He saw a gap where human support was desperately needed. Abandoning his parents\u2019 dream, he pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, a decision that initially caused a deep rift in his family.\n\nNow, at 34, Rohan is a medical social worker for a major San Francisco hospital system. His 0.0-mile commute is a blessing of the post-pandemic work model; he manages his caseload of patients\u2014from new parents in the NICU to families arranging hospice care\u2014primarily through telehealth. His days are a sequence of intense, empathetic video calls, followed by necessary moments of decompression. He finds this solace on long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park or by grabbing a coffee on 9th and Irving, immersing himself in the neighborhood\u2019s calm rhythm.\n\nHis partner of five years, a landscape architect named Caleb, provides a vital counterbalance to the emotional weight of his job. Their relationship is built on quiet support and a shared love for the city's hidden green spaces. While his parents now see the value in his work, having witnessed him guide a family friend through a scary diagnosis, Rohan\u2019s aspirations have shifted. He dreams of moving into a healthcare policy role, hoping to address the systemic fractures he witnesses daily. For Rohan, San Francisco isn't a city of tech glamour; it\u2019s a community of real people in need, and he has found his purpose in being the steady, capable voice on the other end of the line."
