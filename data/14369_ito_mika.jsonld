Born to a Nisei (second-generation Japanese-American) father whose family history was quietly shaped by internment camps, and a free-spirited white mother who migrated to the city from Ohio in the 70s, Mika grew up in the Outer Richmond feeling perpetually in-between. She learned stoicism and the value of a well-tended garden from her father, and expressive, sometimes messy, emotional honesty from her mother. This duality fostered a deep empathy for anyone who felt they didn\u2019t quite fit a mold.\n\nHer path seemed set when she enrolled in the Social Work program at SF State, driven by a fierce desire to help others navigate the systems she found so complex. However, her formal education was cut short when her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Mika dropped out to become her primary caregiver, a grueling, decade-long education in patience, bureaucracy, and unconditional love. This experience, more than any degree, became her qualification. After her mother\u2019s passing, she leveraged her profound real-world experience to land a case manager position, eventually finding her home at a nonprofit supporting LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nNow 44, Mika\u2019s life is one of disciplined purpose. She lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in Duboce Triangle, a neighborhood she loves for its vibrancy and community feel. Her mornings begin with strong coffee and a view of the fog rolling over Twin Peaks before she catches the N-Judah for the short ride to her office in the Mission. Her days are a challenging tapestry of securing housing for trans teens, connecting young people with mental health services, and offering the steady, non-judgmental presence she once needed herself. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of old friends, many from the service industry, who gather for potlucks and hiking trips in the Marin Headlands.\n\nMika\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or recognition, but of stability and impact. She hopes to one day secure a down payment on a small condo through the city\u2019s BMR program, creating a permanent sanctuary. More than anything, she aspires to continue her work, to be a constant for the kids who have none, ensuring that in a city of constant change, there are still places\u2014and people\u2014that feel like home."

A few feet away, her mother, laughing loudly, was trying to coax a wild, rambling rose bush into the ground, dirt smeared on her cheek. Mika looked between them\u2014the controlled quiet and the joyful chaos\u2014and felt the pull of both. It wasn't a conflict, but her first understanding that there were vastly different, equally valid ways to tend to a life.\n\n2.\nAt 15, riding the N-Judah by herself for the first time felt like an act of true rebellion. The rumbling dark of the Sunset Tunnel, then the sudden, shocking burst of light and color as it emerged above Duboce Park. The city unfolded before her, a vibrant world far from the foggy quiet of her neighborhood. It was the moment she fell in love with San Francisco\u2019s kinetic energy; a feeling of being anonymous and yet part of something enormous, a piece in a beautiful, chaotic mosaic.\n\n3.\nThe doctor\u2019s office was sterile, the words \u201cearly-onset Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d clinical and cold. Mika, then 21, remembers the feeling of her mother\u2019s hand going limp and cold in hers. Her mom, the expressive, emotional center of their family, just stared blankly at the wall. In that instant, Mika\u2019s own future\u2014her degree, her plans\u2014dissolved. A fierce, protective love surged through her, heavy and absolute. It wasn't a choice to drop out and care for her; it was simply what came next. It was the end of her youth.\n\n4.\nIt happened in her third year as a case manager. A trans teen, kicked out of their home, hadn\u2019t spoken a word to her in three weekly sessions. Mika just sat with them, drinking her coffee, not pushing. On the fourth visit, the kid whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re the first adult who doesn\u2019t seem to want something.\u201d That was it. A decade of sitting in quiet patience with her mother, of offering presence without expectation, clicked into place. Her greatest sorrow had become her most profound skill.\n\n5.\nLast autumn, cresting a hill in the Marin Headlands with her friends, the wind whipped her hair across her face. Below, the city was a jewel box half-swallowed by fog, the top of the Sutro Tower poking through like a promise. The easy laughter of her chosen family, people who knew her story without her needing to tell it, surrounded her. It wasn\u2019t a moment of wild happiness, but of deep, earned peace. This, she thought, is what stability feels like. This is the feeling I want to build a home on."
