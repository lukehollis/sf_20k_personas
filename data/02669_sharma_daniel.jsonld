Born in Cupertino to Indian immigrant engineers, his childhood was mapped out with the familiar landmarks of academic excellence and the implicit promise of a lucrative tech career. He was surrounded by ambition, but it was an ambition that felt foreign to him. He dutifully followed the path, enrolling in computer science at UC Berkeley, but found the logic of code cold and unsatisfying.\n\nThe turning point was a summer volunteer trip to build community gardens in West Oakland. The tangible result of his labor\u2014seeing families access fresh produce\u2014ignited a passion that coding never could. He returned to Berkeley, switched his major to Sociology, and, to his parents' quiet dismay, dedicated himself to a future in public service. After graduating, he earned a Master of Public Administration online while working entry-level jobs, slowly building his credentials in the nonprofit world.\n\nNow 41, Daniel is a seasoned Project Manager for a national nonprofit focused on urban food security. His 0.0-mile commute is a key feature of his life; he works from his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days begin not with a drive, but with a walk to a local bakery for coffee and a pastry, followed by a stroll through Golden Gate Park with his scruffy rescue terrier, Astro. His work is a series of intense Zoom calls, coordinating logistics for projects in cities across the country, from creating rooftop farms in Chicago to supporting food banks in New Orleans.\n\nDaniel\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of friends met through activism and former colleagues. They are his chosen family, gathering for potlucks or catching indie films at the Balboa Theatre. Though he's had serious relationships, his dedication to his work has often taken precedence, a fact he is beginning to reassess.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and neighborhood-centric. He loves the Richmond's foggy, quiet streets, a peaceful respite from the city's frantic energy. His dream is less about career advancement and more about impact; he hopes to one day lead a project that fundamentally changes San Francisco\u2019s own food landscape. Daniel rejected his parents\u2019 specific path, but he inherited their drive, channeling it not toward creating code, but toward cultivating a more just and sustainable world."
