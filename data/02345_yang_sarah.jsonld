Born and raised in the fog-laced avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Outer Richmond, she is the daughter of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business on Geary Boulevard. Her childhood was a symphony of hissing steam presses, the scent of chemical detergents, and the responsibility of helping her parents after school. College was a distant, abstract dream, overshadowed by the immediate, tangible needs of the family business.\n\nAfter graduating from George Washington High School, Sarah, with her steady hands and quiet focus, found work in the burgeoning electronics industry of the '90s. While others were designing software, she was on the assembly line, meticulously piecing together the physical hardware that powered the digital revolution. She never wrote a line of code, but she built the machines that ran it.\n\nThe key turning point in her life came fifteen years ago when her mother fell ill. Needing to be home as a full-time caregiver, Sarah was on the verge of quitting her job. In a rare act of corporate flexibility, her long-time employer allowed her to transition to a specialized work-from-home role, assembling delicate, high-value prototypes from a custom-built, anti-static station in her spare bedroom.\n\nHer mother passed away five years ago, but the work arrangement remained. Now, Sarah\u2019s days follow a quiet, solitary rhythm in the same rent-controlled apartment she grew up in. Her commute is the ten steps from her kitchen to her workstation. Her colleagues are voices on a weekly check-in call. Her social life is modest, consisting of weekly dim sum with a cousin in the Sunset and conversations with the aging shopkeepers on Clement Street.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep and intensely personal. She sees the city not as a hub of innovation, but as a collection of memories: the specific bench at Land's End where her father taught her to fly a kite, the changing murals in the alleys, the persistent cry of the gulls. Her dream is not to launch a startup or change the world, but to save enough to one day visit her parents' ancestral village in Guangdong and to finally have the time to learn watercolor painting, capturing the foggy, ethereal landscapes just outside her window."
