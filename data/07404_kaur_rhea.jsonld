Raised in Fremont, she was the daughter of a Punjabi Sikh father, a meticulous software engineer who valued structure, and a White mother from Oregon, a watercolor artist who saw the world in gradients of light and emotion. Her childhood home was a place of quiet discipline punctuated by bursts of creative chaos. It was watching her mother find solace from her struggles with anxiety through her art that planted the seed for Rhea\u2019s future. For her mother, painting wasn't a hobby; it was a necessary act of translation for feelings that had no words.\n\nThis core observation guided Rhea\u2019s educational journey. She pursued a psychology degree at UC Santa Cruz, finding herself drawn to the expressive arts, before completing a Master's in Art Therapy. San Francisco, with its vibrant, wounded, and fiercely artistic soul, felt like the only place to begin her career. She landed a role as a Program Coordinator for a non-profit that provides art therapy services to underserved communities.\n\nNow at 29, Rhea lives and works from her airy, plant-filled apartment in the Mission District. The 0.0-mile commute means her personal sanctuary is also her office, a space she curates with intention. Her days are a structured rhythm of Zoom calls with therapists, grant-writing, and coordinating virtual workshops for clients. Mornings often start with a walk to a local panaderia for coffee, absorbing the neighborhood's murals and energy. Evenings are for her own creative practice\u2014usually ceramics at a nearby studio\u2014or quiet dinners with a close-knit group of friends from the arts and non-profit sectors.\n\nHaving recently ended a long-term relationship, Rhea is in a period of introspection, pouring her energy into her work and community. She feels a deep connection to the Mission, seeing both its raw beauty and its systemic pains. Her ultimate dream is to move beyond coordinating and open her own community-based art therapy studio, a truly accessible space where anyone, regardless of income, can find the same lifeline her mother did in a palette of paint. For Rhea, healing and creating are one and the same."
