Raised in a quiet, middle-class suburb of Sacramento, he was the son of an accountant and a librarian, a background that instilled in him a sense of order and a quiet curiosity. He attended UC Davis, choosing to study History, fascinated by the grand narratives of societal change. However, upon graduating in the late 1990s, he found the job market for historians bleak and the allure of the dot-com boom irresistible.\n\nHe fell into technology by accident, starting with a helpdesk job he took to pay the bills. Scott discovered a natural talent not for coding, but for untangling complex systems and, more importantly, for calmly explaining them to frustrated users. He was reliable and empathetic, qualities that propelled him up the ladder. He moved to San Francisco in 2005 for a senior support role, eventually becoming the IT Support Manager he is today\u2014a shepherd of processes and people.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago, an amicable but heart-wrenching split that left him feeling adrift. The final severance from his old life came with the pandemic, when his company went fully remote. His commute vanished overnight. While he initially celebrated the freedom, the last few years have contracted his world to the size of his Cole Valley apartment. His social connections, once forged in the office kitchen and at after-work drinks, have withered, replaced by scheduled video calls and a handful of loyal friends he struggles to see regularly.\n\nScott\u2019s daily routine is a loop. He wakes, makes coffee, and logs on. Lunch is often a sandwich from the deli on Cole Street. After work, he might take a walk through Golden Gate Park or up to Tank Hill for a view of the city he feels increasingly disconnected from. He\u2019s a fixture in his small neighborhood but a stranger to the rest of San Francisco. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder; it\u2019s about reconnecting. He hopes to use his remote flexibility to travel, find a partner who shares his quiet nature, and maybe, finally, dust off the history books that sit on his shelf, searching for a narrative that makes sense of his own life."
