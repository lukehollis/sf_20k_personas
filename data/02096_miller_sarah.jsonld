As Principal City Planner, she lives in Hayes Valley, in a state-of-the-art mixed-use building she helped shepherd through the approval process\u2014a tangible symbol of her life\u2019s work.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Sarah is the only daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in the Outer Sunset. Her childhood was a landscape of fog-dampened streets, the clatter of the N-Judah streetcar, and the quiet diligence of her parents. They hoped she would become a doctor, but Sarah was always more fascinated by the city's anatomy: the flow of people, the logic of the grid, and the invisible lines that separated communities.\n\nThe defining moment came with the violent shake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a student at SF State, she witnessed the fractured Embarcadero Freeway and the city\u2019s collective will to rebuild. This raw, powerful display of urban vulnerability and resilience ignited her passion. She pursued a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, determined to shape a more equitable and resilient city.\n\nHer career was a steady, methodical ascent through the city\u2019s Planning Department. She married a landscape architect, and together they had a daughter, Maya. While their marriage eventually ended amicably, their shared love for urban design remains a cornerstone of their friendship.\n\nNow 54, Sarah's life is deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her morning begins with a walk to a local cafe, observing the pedestrian flow she meticulously advocated for. She spends her days in virtual meetings from her sunlit apartment, debating zoning codes and green infrastructure projects. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of fellow civil servants and old friends who remember a pre-tech San Francisco.\n\nHer greatest hope is to leave behind a city that is more livable for everyone, not just the wealthy. She dreams of seeing her long-term affordable housing projects break ground and of preserving the quirky, independent soul of the city she has loved her entire life. For Sarah, every new parklet and protected bike lane is a small victory in a lifelong conversation with her hometown."

While they restocked shelves, she watched the fog roll down Judah Street, listening to the clatter and hum of the N-Judah streetcar. It was her first, unofficial study of a neighborhood\u2019s circulatory system. The quiet flow of people, the rhythm of deliveries, the unspoken community\u2014it instilled in her a deep, foundational understanding that a city isn't just buildings, but a living organism she felt an instinctual need to care for.\n\n2.\nDays after the '89 Loma Prieta quake, she stood with other SF State students, staring at the fractured Embarcadero Freeway. It was a terrifying wound slashed across the city\u2019s face. But in the midst of the awe and fear, she felt a powerful surge of purpose. This wasn't just destruction; it was a raw, undeniable opportunity to rebuild, to rethink, to heal the city\u2019s bones. In that moment of shared vulnerability, her vague fascination with urban life crystallized into a fierce, unwavering a vocation.\n\n3.\nShe remembers a crisp Saturday morning at the newly opened Patricia\u2019s Green, her young daughter Maya chasing a butterfly across the lawn. Her then-husband, Mark, was explaining his choice of drought-tolerant plants along the walkway. Seeing her daughter's pure joy on land that was once a freeway off-ramp, a project she had championed, fused her personal and professional worlds into one. Her work wasn't just policy; it was the soft grass under her child\u2019s feet, a tangible legacy of livability.\n\n4.\nThe memory isn\u2019t the celebratory groundbreaking, but the 11 PM email on a Tuesday. After years of contentious public meetings and fighting for every affordable unit, the notification simply read \u201cFINAL APPROVAL.\u201d Sarah leaned back in her chair, the weight of a thousand compromises lifting. It was a moment of profound, exhausted relief. She hadn't shouted or celebrated, but in that silent apartment, she felt the immense power of persistence. She had willed a better place into existence.\n\n5.\nAt a heated community meeting about a protected bike lane, an elderly Chinese man approached her afterwards. He didn\u2019t speak about traffic flow, but simply said in Cantonese, \u201cNow, my granddaughter can bike to your old neighborhood to visit me safely.\u201d In his words, she heard the echo of her father. The comment cut through all the bureaucratic noise, reminding her that every small, hard-won victory was never just about infrastructure; it was about connecting generations and protecting the city\u2019s soul."
