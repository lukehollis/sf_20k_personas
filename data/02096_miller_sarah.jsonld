As Principal City Planner, she lives in Hayes Valley, in a state-of-the-art mixed-use building she helped shepherd through the approval process\u2014a tangible symbol of her life\u2019s work.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Sarah is the only daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in the Outer Sunset. Her childhood was a landscape of fog-dampened streets, the clatter of the N-Judah streetcar, and the quiet diligence of her parents. They hoped she would become a doctor, but Sarah was always more fascinated by the city's anatomy: the flow of people, the logic of the grid, and the invisible lines that separated communities.\n\nThe defining moment came with the violent shake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a student at SF State, she witnessed the fractured Embarcadero Freeway and the city\u2019s collective will to rebuild. This raw, powerful display of urban vulnerability and resilience ignited her passion. She pursued a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, determined to shape a more equitable and resilient city.\n\nHer career was a steady, methodical ascent through the city\u2019s Planning Department. She married a landscape architect, and together they had a daughter, Maya. While their marriage eventually ended amicably, their shared love for urban design remains a cornerstone of their friendship.\n\nNow 54, Sarah's life is deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her morning begins with a walk to a local cafe, observing the pedestrian flow she meticulously advocated for. She spends her days in virtual meetings from her sunlit apartment, debating zoning codes and green infrastructure projects. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of fellow civil servants and old friends who remember a pre-tech San Francisco.\n\nHer greatest hope is to leave behind a city that is more livable for everyone, not just the wealthy. She dreams of seeing her long-term affordable housing projects break ground and of preserving the quirky, independent soul of the city she has loved her entire life. For Sarah, every new parklet and protected bike lane is a small victory in a lifelong conversation with her hometown."
