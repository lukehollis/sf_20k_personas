His commute is a ten-step walk from his espresso machine to the ergonomic chair in his home office, a routine cemented by the pandemic and now preferred. From his window, he has a framed, calculated view of San Francisco\u2014a city he lives in, but rarely feels a part of.\n\nDavid\u2019s sense of being an outsider started early. Raised in a working-class Sacramento suburb by a Filipina mother and a father of indistinct European heritage, he never felt he belonged to any single group. He was simply \u201cother.\u201d His parents worked multiple jobs, and their primary lesson was one of brutal pragmatism: security is paramount. There was no money for college, so after high school, David took a data entry job at a Bay Area brokerage firm, his only assets a sharp mind for numbers and a quiet, relentless ambition.\n\nHe didn't have a degree, so he made himself indispensable. While his peers were at university, David was teaching himself market analysis, memorizing regulations, and building complex financial models in his spare time. A manager, impressed by the initiative, gave him a junior analyst role. It was his turning point. For the next two decades, David\u2019s life was a single-minded climb, validating his existence through promotions and performance bonuses. His career became his identity and his fortress.\n\nThis focus came at a cost. A long-term relationship withered under the weight of his 70-hour workweeks, and his social circle narrowed to colleagues he now only sees on Slack. At 42, he is a success by every metric he once valued. He is a Senior Analyst, financially secure beyond his parents\u2019 wildest dreams.\n\nYet, a quiet unease has settled in. His daily routine\u2014market open, analysis, reports, market close\u2014feels like a loop. He looks out at the city lights and feels a profound sense of disconnection. His dream is no longer a bigger title but something less quantifiable: a genuine connection. He yearns to join a pottery class, learn to sail on the bay, or simply have a conversation that isn\u2019t about quarterly earnings. David Harrison built his entire life to secure his future, and now that he\u2019s arrived, he\u2019s finally starting to wonder how to live in his present."
