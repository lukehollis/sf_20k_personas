The daughter of a respected architect and a university professor, her childhood was one of intellectual curiosity and cultural richness. This idyllic world was shattered by the 1979 Revolution. At age seven, her family fled with what little they could carry, leaving behind their home, status, and history. They settled in Berkeley, where her parents traded prestige for the safety of their children, taking on menial jobs to provide.\n\nThis experience of displacement and rebuilding shaped Roxana profoundly. Watching her community rally to support newcomers instilled in her a deep belief in the power of public institutions. She excelled academically, eventually earning a Master's in Public Administration from UC Berkeley, driven by a desire to create the stable, supportive civic structures her family had lost.\n\nHer career path felt pre-ordained, but the specifics were a personal choice. She chose the San Francisco Arts Commission not just for the administrative challenge, but to champion the cultural expression that had been suppressed in her homeland. For over two decades, she has navigated the city\u2019s bureaucracy, securing funding for murals in the Mission, installations in Golden Gate Park, and performances at Civic Center Plaza. She is the pragmatic force behind the city\u2019s creative soul.\n\nNow 52, Roxana lives a life of curated independence in a tidy Hayes Valley apartment. An amicable divorce in her late thirties left her with a \u201cchosen family\u201d of fellow civil servants, artists, and activists. Her daily 3.8-mile MUNI ride is a ritual, a time to observe the city she serves. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or neighborhood meetings, her work and life seamlessly intertwined.\n\nRoxana\u2019s dreams are now grounded and tangible. She aspires to launch a fellowship for immigrant and refugee artists, giving them the platform her parents never had. Her greatest hope is to ensure her legacy isn\u2019t just in policy documents, but visible on the very streets of the city that gave her refuge. For Roxana, every successfully funded art project is a testament to resilience and a tile carefully placed back into the mosaic of a life once fractured."

She remembers gripping the armrest, watching her father\u2014a man who designed grand buildings\u2014stare blankly ahead, his own world completely dismantled. In that moment, she understood that security was not made of brick and mortar, but was a feeling that could vanish like smoke. This memory became the foundation for her lifelong drive to build things that could endure.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt fourteen, she visited her father during his evening shift as a janitor at a Berkeley library. She saw him meticulously wiping down a long oak table with the same intense focus he once gave his architectural blueprints. He looked up, gave her a small, dignified smile, and simply nodded. The quiet grace of that act, devoid of any shame, struck her more than any lecture. It cemented her belief that a person\u2019s value was inherent, not defined by a title or a salary.\n\n***\n\n3.\nDuring grad school, a walk through Balmy Alley left her breathless. It wasn't just the vibrant colors; it was the defiant storytelling on the garage doors and fences\u2014unfiltered histories, unapologetically public. This was the vibrant antithesis to the monitored, suppressed culture she had fled. In that moment, her vague ambition to serve sharpened into a razor-point. She wouldn't just build systems; she would defend the spaces where a city paints its soul onto its walls for everyone to see.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHer divorce was finalized in her late thirties. A week later, after a brutal budget hearing, she came home to find two friends\u2014an artist and a city planner\u2014on her doorstep with takeout and cheap wine. They didn't rehash her marriage or her long day. They just ate on the floor of her new apartment, laughing about city politics. In the easy warmth of that evening, she realized family wasn't something you lost, but something you continuously build. It became the bedrock of her independence.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, at the dedication of a light installation in a SoMa alleyway, she watched the artist, a young refugee from Syria she had championed, weep with joy. He turned to her and said, \"You helped me make a memory solid.\" Seeing his story permanently woven into the fabric of the city, refracting light onto the pavement, felt like a personal victory. This wasn't a policy win; it was a life remade, a tile carefully placed back into the mosaic of her own fractured past."
