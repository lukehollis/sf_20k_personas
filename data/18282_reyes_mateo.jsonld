Born in Daly City to a Filipino father who worked the docks and a second-generation Japanese-American mother whose family ran a small neighborhood grocery, Mateo\u2019s childhood was steeped in the values of hard work, community, and the quiet resilience of those building a life far from their ancestral homes. He saw firsthand the support systems families create when official ones fall short.\n\nInitially, he pursued a business degree at SF State, a practical choice urged by his parents. However, a volunteer position at a youth center in the Mission District became his turning point. Witnessing the profound impact of dedicated social workers on teens navigating poverty and identity struggles ignited a passion he couldn't ignore. He changed his path, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Mateo started as a caseworker, his calm demeanor and deep empathy making him a natural advocate. Over two decades, he rose through the ranks, becoming the Program Director for a community health clinic that serves low-income families.\n\nNow 46, Mateo\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco. He shares a rent-controlled apartment in the Castro with his partner of twelve years, David, a graphic designer. His daily commute is a 3.5-mile MUNI ride to the Mission, a journey that bookends days spent fighting for funding, mentoring staff, and ensuring the clinic remains a sanctuary for its clients. He loves the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy but carries a persistent ache for the communities being displaced by staggering inequality.\n\nHis social life is centered on a close-knit \"chosen family,\" sharing potlucks and hiking the trails of the Marin Headlands on weekends. Mateo hopes to secure long-term funding to expand the clinic\u2019s mental health services for LGBTQ+ youth. His personal dream is simpler: to one day travel with David to the Philippines and Japan, to walk the streets his grandparents left behind and connect the threads of his own story."

Mrs. Sandoval, a tiny Filipina woman who always smelled of Vicks VapoRub, came to the counter with rice and milk, her hand trembling as she presented a few crumpled bills. His mother simply nodded, bagged the groceries, and said quietly, \u201cPay next time, Manang.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a transaction; it was a promise. That silent act of dignity became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work, the quiet understanding that a community holds itself when no one else will.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, interning at the Mission youth center, he was supposed to be helping a high schooler named Sofia with her algebra homework. Instead, she pushed the book away, her face crumbling as she whispered about the eviction notice taped to their apartment door. A social worker knelt beside her, not with pity, but with a plan. In that moment, Mateo\u2019s business textbooks felt like a foreign language. He saw the chasm between a balance sheet and a human life, and consciously chose which side he was meant to be on.\n\n3.\nThe first time he and David stood in their empty, rent-controlled Castro apartment, the air still thick with the smell of old paint, was a moment of profound disbelief. After years of cobbled-together living situations, this felt like an impossible prize. David took his hand and said, \u201cWe can build a life here.\u201d The statement wasn't just about the apartment; it was about permanence. In a city that constantly pushes people out, they had found an anchor. That feeling of security became the safe harbor he fights to create for others.\n\n4.\nHe was 28, a new caseworker running on fumes. He spent a frantic week finding shelter for a terrified, undocumented trans youth who had been kicked out of her home. After securing her a bed and a referral for medical care, she looked at him, tears streaming down her face, and simply said, \"You saw me.\" The exhaustion vanished, replaced by a fierce, protective clarity. That single sentence affirmed his career change more than his graduate degree ever could, becoming the fundamental mission of his work: to truly see people.\n\n5.\nOn the MUNI home last spring, he watched a family\u2014a mother and two kids he recognized from the clinic\u2014hauling taped-up boxes onto the bus, their faces set with a familiar resignation. They were headed to a cousin's in Antioch, the mother explained, the rent hike being the final blow. A few stops later, a group of young tech workers boarded, laughing about a multi-million-dollar acquisition. The whiplash was dizzying. It solidified the persistent ache he feels for the city: a place of limitless innovation and heartbreaking displacement, all on a single 3.5-mile ride."
