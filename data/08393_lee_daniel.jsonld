            "value": "Daniel Lee is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laced avenues. Born and raised in the Outer Sunset, he is the son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, beloved grocery store on Irving Street for twenty-five years. His upbringing was defined by pragmatism and diligence. While his parents hoped he\u2019d take over the family business, Daniel was always drawn to a different kind of system: the logical, ordered world inside a computer. He was the kid who took apart the family PC and, to everyone\u2019s surprise, put it back together better than before.\n\nThis natural aptitude led him to City College of San Francisco after high school. He bypassed the traditional four-year university track, opting for an Associate\u2019s degree in Network Administration\u2014a direct, no-fuss path to a stable career. His first job was a grueling commute downtown to a soulless cubicle, providing helpdesk support. The key turning point came with the pandemic-induced shift to remote work. Daniel discovered he thrived in the quiet solitude of his one-bedroom apartment. When his company made remote work permanent for his role, he never looked back, explaining his 0.0-mile commute.\n\nToday, Daniel\u2019s life is a disciplined routine. His workday is spent in his small home office, methodically resolving network issues for unseen colleagues across the country. His social life is a tight-knit circle of high school friends, with whom he plays basketball at a neighborhood park on Saturdays. Though comfortable, a quiet restlessness has begun to brew. His real passion unfolds after he logs off: restoring vintage audio equipment. His apartment is filled with half-assembled turntables and amplifiers, their warm analog mechanics a welcome contrast to his digital day job.\n\nHis dream is to one day open a small audio repair and Hi-Fi shop, perhaps in the Richmond or his native Sunset. He feels a deep, protective love for the San Francisco that exists beyond the glittering tech campuses\u2014the quiet neighborhoods, the family-run businesses, the enduring communities. Daniel\u2019s aspiration isn\u2019t to build a unicorn startup, but to create a small, tangible legacy in the only city he\u2019s ever called home."
