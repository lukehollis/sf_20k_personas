His immigrant parents, who arrived from Hong Kong with little more than a capacity for relentless work, preached a gospel of stability. For them, success meant a steady job with benefits, a world away from the precariousness of their own lives. David, ever the dutiful son, followed their advice, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College.\n\nHis twenties were spent in a gray cubicle downtown, processing invoices for a shipping company. The work was soul-crushing, a slow erosion of his spirit. His only solace was in the kitchen of his small apartment, where he began meticulously recreating his mother's recipes, finding a creative spark in the alchemy of soy, ginger, and star anise. The turning point came at 31, after his father\u2019s sudden passing. Faced with his own mortality and a modest inheritance, David quit his job. He took a position as a line cook in a bustling North Beach restaurant, starting at the bottom and absorbing every technique with ferocious intensity.\n\nAfter a decade of honing his craft in other people\u2019s kitchens, David returned to his home turf. He cashed out his savings to open \"Clement Street Provisions,\" a modern butcher shop and deli that was his vision entirely. His commute is a short flight of stairs; he lives in the small two-bedroom apartment directly above the shop.\n\nHis days are long, starting before dawn to receive deliveries and prep for the day. He knows his regulars by name\u2014the elderly woman who buys a single pork chop every Tuesday, the young tech couple who rave about his house-cured pastrami. His staff is his found family. His personal life is quiet; the business is a demanding partner. His widowed mother often visits, bringing homemade soup and offering unsolicited but loving critiques of his char siu. David's dream isn't expansion or fame. It\u2019s to see his shop become a neighborhood institution, a place of quality and connection that honors his family's legacy of hard work while being entirely his own."
