The son of a Black social worker and a Jewish-American high school history teacher, his upbringing was a rich blend of community activism, Passover seders, and a deep appreciation for storytelling. He learned early on that not all stories are told with words. His younger sister, Maya, who struggled with a severe speech impediment, communicated her vibrant inner world through sketchbooks filled with fantastical creatures and expressive, swirling colors. Art became their shared language, and seeing Maya flourish through her creativity planted a seed in Jordan\u2019s mind.\n\nThis seed blossomed during his undergraduate studies in psychology at UC Berkeley. While his peers were drawn to traditional talk therapy, Jordan found himself gravitating toward the a more hands-on way of helping. He pursued a graduate degree in Marriage and Family Therapy, specializing in Art Therapy, driven by the memory of his sister\u2019s breakthroughs. He learned to see a smear of charcoal not as a mistake, but as an expression of anger, and a detailed pencil drawing as a window into a world a child couldn't otherwise describe.\n\nNow, at 25, Jordan lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His daily commute is a ritual: a 3.8-mile ride on the 5-Fulton Muni bus, which takes him to the non-profit community center in the Mission where he works as an Associate Therapist. His days are spent with children and teens navigating everything from learning disabilities to family trauma, using clay, paint, and collage as tools for healing. His $72,000 salary requires careful budgeting, but he finds richness in simple pleasures: cheap, delicious burritos in his work neighborhood, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, and weekend pickup basketball games.\n\nJordan's immediate goal is to complete the thousands of supervised hours required for full MFT licensure. His ultimate dream, however, is to open his own art therapy practice dedicated to serving underserved youth across the Bay Area. He views San Francisco not just as a city to live in, but as a community to invest in. For Jordan, helping a child find their voice with a paintbrush is his way of giving back to the place that shaped him, one colorful, powerful story at a time."

She snatched a purple one and drew a fierce, wailing dragon, its tears a cascade of rainbow colors. It wasn't just a drawing; it was a roar. For the first time, he truly *heard* his sister. That moment taught him that some voices don\u2019t use words, and it became his life\u2019s mission to learn how to listen to them. (Age 10)\n\n2.\nHe was in a cavernous Wheeler Hall lecture, junior year at Cal. The professor was diagramming cognitive-behavioral models on the board\u2014all neat boxes and arrows. Jordan found himself idly sketching a swirling vortex in his notebook margins, thinking of Maya's art. The professor\u2019s rigid theories felt hollow, a language that couldn't capture the raw emotion of a crayon stroke. He knew then that his path wasn\u2019t in deciphering words, but in understanding the stories told through color and clay. (Age 20)\n\n3.\nHe remembers a 12-year-old boy named Leo, six months into his job. For weeks, Leo was a silent wall. Then one afternoon, Jordan just put a block of gray clay on the table. Leo stared at it, then slowly, deliberately, smashed his fist into it. He didn't build anything; he just destroyed it, over and over, with a focused intensity. Jordan saw the release, the wordless articulation of rage and powerlessness. It was the first real conversation they'd ever had. (Age 24)\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday last winter, the 5-Fulton crawling through the thick Richmond fog. He was exhausted, the weight of his clients\u2019 stories heavy on his shoulders. He pressed his forehead against the cool, damp window, watching the hazy glow of streetlights blur past. Despite the fatigue and his tight budget, a wave of profound peace washed over him. This city, this bus, this quiet, foggy journey home\u2014it was his. He was exactly where he was supposed to be. (Age 25)\n\n5.\nA few months ago, during a pickup game at a court near his non-profit, a teenager he was playing with mentioned his little brother was getting into trouble. \u201cNowhere for him to go, you know?\u201d the kid said between shots. The casual, desperate comment landed like a stone in Jordan\u2019s chest. His dream of opening his own space stopped being a distant goal. It became an urgent blueprint for a specific building, on a specific street, for a specific kid like that one. (Age 25)"
