Born in Daly City to Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store, she was the family\u2019s designated translator, cultural navigator, and keeper of unspoken anxieties. The weight of her parents' dreams was a heavy but familiar cloak, and she initially pursued a pre-law track at UC Berkeley, the path of predictable success. However, a volunteer position at a youth center in Oakland during her senior year became her pivotal turning point. Witnessing the complex interplay of trauma, poverty, and resilience in young people, she saw her own family's struggles reflected in a wider context.\n\nThis revelation led her to pivot, much to her parents\u2019 initial dismay, and enroll in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. Her early career was spent in the trenches of community mental health, working with underserved families in the Mission and Bayview-Hunters Point. The burnout was immense, but it solidified her expertise and passion. After a challenging divorce in her late thirties, Jisu realized she needed to model the self-care she preached. She took a significant risk, leasing a small, sunlit office in Hayes Valley and launching her own private practice.\n\nNow, at 50, Jisu\u2019s life is one of curated intention. Her 0.8-mile walk to work is a daily meditation, past the boutiques and cafes that mark her adopted neighborhood. Her practice is thriving, focusing on acculturation stress, career anxieties in the tech sector, and family therapy. Her clients see a calm, insightful therapist; they don\u2019t see the young girl who once struggled to find the right words in English for her mother at a parent-teacher conference.\n\nJisu\u2019s social life is a close-knit circle of old colleagues and friends. She is single by choice, finding fulfillment in her work and community. She is deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014the city that gave her the anonymity to find herself and the community to build a life. Her future aspirations are not about expansion, but depth. She hopes to start a mentorship group for young AAPI therapists and dreams of one day writing a book about the quiet strength passed down through generations of immigrant women."

At eight years old, she sat beside her mother at a parent-teacher conference, translating, \"Jisu is bright, but very quiet.\" She saw the flicker of pride in her mother\u2019s eyes, but felt a sharp, adult loneliness. In that moment, she was the sole bridge between two worlds, carrying the weight of unspoken context. This early responsibility forged a profound empathy in her, a lifelong drive to understand the silences between words and give voice to the unheard.\n\n2.\nAt 21, the path seemed set: law school. Then, at an Oakland youth center, a withdrawn teenager refused to talk, instead drawing a furiously detailed city on a napkin. In his fierce, protective posture and the world he created with a cheap pen, Jisu saw a resilience that no textbook had ever described. It was a lightning strike of clarity. The predictable success of a legal career felt hollow in comparison. This was the moment she pivoted, choosing the messier, more vital work of human connection over the clean lines of law.\n\n3.\nThe memory of her rattling Toyota in Bayview-Hunters Point is still vivid. She was 29, just after a gut-wrenching home visit where a mother\u2019s story of sacrifice mirrored her own family\u2019s history so closely. The burnout was a physical ache, a secondary trauma that felt like drowning. But staring into the fog, she had a revelation: her empathy was not an infinite resource. That crushing exhaustion wasn\u2019t a failure, but a boundary. It was the hard-won lesson that to heal others, she first had to learn how to protect herself.\n\n4.\nSigning the lease for her Hayes Valley office at 39 was an act of terror and triumph. Fresh from her divorce, the financial risk felt monumental. As she held the pen, she realized this space was the first thing in her life that was entirely her own\u2014not an extension of her parents' dreams or a compromise in a marriage. The smell of the empty, sunlit room was the scent of a new beginning. It was her declaration of independence and the physical start of modeling the self-sustainability she preached.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on her morning walk to work, she paused at the corner of Hayes and Gough. The murmur from the coffee shop, the chime of a cable car in the distance\u2014it all felt perfectly in place. She thought of the anxious girl at the parent-teacher conference and the terrified woman signing a lease. They were all still part of her, but their anxieties had softened into foundations. A quiet, profound sense of contentment washed over her. The city had once given her anonymity; now, it gave her a home."
