Born in 1975 to a Buryat family, his Russian name was a common product of the era\u2019s push for cultural assimilation. His childhood was colored by the austerity of the late Soviet period and the subsequent chaos of its collapse. Watching his parents, an engineer and a teacher, navigate hyperinflation and uncertainty instilled in him a deep-seated craving for stability and control.\n\nHe began studying business in Novosibirsk but saw the path to a secure future narrowing in post-Soviet Russia. At 22, he made the pivotal decision to follow a cousin to San Francisco. Arriving with rudimentary English and a fierce determination, Mikhail\u2019s first years were a blur of restaurant kitchens and delivery routes. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, meticulously completing the Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration he had started back home. His calm, methodical nature and ease with numbers made him a natural fit for the finance world. He started as a loan processor, and through relentless work, he steadily climbed the ranks to become a Senior Mortgage Loan Officer, finding satisfaction in guiding others toward the very symbol of stability he once lacked: a home.\n\nToday, Mikhail lives a structured life in the Inner Richmond. His 7.1-mile commute by car to the Financial District is a daily ritual, a quiet buffer between his personal and professional worlds. He is amicably divorced; the intense focus required to build his career a decade ago ultimately cost him his marriage. His greatest pride is his 19-year-old daughter, a student at UC Davis, with whom he has a close and supportive relationship. His social life is small but meaningful, revolving around a few colleagues and friends from the city\u2019s Russian-speaking community. He chose the Richmond for its proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he walks to unwind, a quiet man against the backdrop of the city that gave him everything. His dream is no longer about accumulation, but transition\u2014he hopes to one day trade his loan portfolio for a small vineyard in Sonoma, finding a final, peaceful stability amongst the vines."
