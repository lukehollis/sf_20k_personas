Raised in a suburb of Grand Rapids, Michigan, by an engineer father and a CPA mother, her childhood was one of structured logic and predictable outcomes. Sarah, however, found her language in the hushed halls of the local art museum and the vibrant chaos of her high school art room. Her parents, while loving, viewed her artistic sensibilities as a quaint hobby, not a viable future.\n\nFleeing the pragmatism of her upbringing, she pursued an Art History degree at a small liberal arts college in New England, finally finding her tribe among people who debated the merits of Rothko over Pollock. She continued her studies with a graduate degree in Museum Studies from NYU, which eventually landed her a coveted curatorial assistant position at SFMOMA in the early 2000s. She loved being surrounded by art but chafed under the institutional bureaucracy and slow pace. The turning point came when a friend in the burgeoning tech scene asked for help selecting art for his new, sterile office. Sarah discovered a profound joy in translating an individual's or a company's ethos into a curated collection, making art a living part of someone's daily environment.\n\nToday, at 45, Sarah runs a successful art consulting business from her expansive Dogpatch live-work loft, hence the zero-mile commute. Her days are a blend of focused research, video calls with international galleries, and private showings for clients in her own space. Divorced a decade ago after a long but amicable partnership, she has since poured her energy into her work and a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, chefs, and fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep; she thrives on the city's inherent tension between technological innovation and artistic soul. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to grow her business empire, but to establish a grant for emerging Bay Area artists, a way to protect the creative spirit that first drew her to the city and give others the validation she once craved."
