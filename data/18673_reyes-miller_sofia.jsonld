Born in Richmond, California, she was the daughter of a pragmatic, socially-conscious high school history teacher and a compassionate Mexican-immigrant mother who worked as a community health advocate, or *promotora*. Her childhood was a blend of her father\u2019s analytical view of societal structures and her mother\u2019s hands-on approach to community care. This dual perspective shaped her worldview, instilling a deep-seated belief that systemic problems required empathetic, scalable solutions.\n\nHer path led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies, where her passion for social justice flourished. After graduating, she worked for a Bay Area nonprofit, but felt frustrated by the limited impact of on-the-ground work. To enact change on a larger scale, she returned to academia, earning a Master of Public Health. Her early career in the SF Department of Public Health was formative, but she saw the potential for technology to overcome bureaucratic inertia. This realization was her key turning point, pushing her toward the burgeoning digital health sector.\n\nNow, as Director of Clinical Product, Sofia merges her two worlds. She leads teams that design digital tools to deliver mental health resources and healthcare education to underserved students, ensuring the technology is ethically sound and clinically effective. Her work is her mission.\n\nSofia lives in the Inner Sunset with her husband, Alex, a landscape architect, and their 12-year-old daughter, Maya. Her daily routine begins with a family breakfast before she catches the N-Judah for her 4.5-mile commute, using the time to review reports or listen to public policy podcasts. The city is her ecosystem; she loves the proximity to Golden Gate Park for weekend hikes and the diverse food scene on Irving Street.\n\nWhile she has achieved professional success, Sofia\u2019s aspirations remain tethered to her roots. She dreams of her company\u2019s work leading to a measurable decline in health disparities among California\u2019s youth. Personally, her hope is simpler: to raise a daughter who is as compassionate as her grandmother and as critically aware as her grandfather, ensuring the bridge she\u2019s built continues into the next generation."

The smell of her mother's pozole mingled with disinfectant from the screening tables. Her mother, a *promotora*, moved through the crowd, her hand resting warmly on someone's shoulder as she explained blood pressure results in Spanish. Sofia felt a profound sense of pride, realizing then that true healthcare wasn\u2019t about paperwork, but community and trust. It was a feeling she\u2019d chase for the rest of her career.\n\n2.\nShe was a sophomore at Berkeley, shouting on Sproul Plaza until her throat was raw, protesting another tuition hike. The energy was electric, a sea of righteous anger. But as the crowd dispersed, she felt a hollow echo. The system remained unchanged. In that moment of quiet frustration, standing amidst discarded signs, a thought crystallized: passion was the fuel, but it needed a better engine. She didn't just want to protest the system; she needed to learn how to rebuild it, piece by piece.\n\n3.\nWorking at the SF Department of Public Health, she remembers a specific manila folder, its corners soft with handling. It held a mental health referral for a teenager from the Mission that was lost in an inter-departmental transfer. The feeling of powerlessness as she explained the delay to the family was sickening. It wasn\u2019t malice, just bureaucratic friction with devastating consequences. That night, she went home and started researching \"digital health startups.\" The paper-based system was a barrier to care she had to break.\n\n4.\nJust last year, walking through the fog-dampened AIDS Memorial Grove with Alex, twelve-year-old Maya stopped reading a name etched in stone. \"Mom,\" she asked quietly, \"is a memorial enough? Or do we have to fix the things that let it happen?\" The question, a perfect blend of her father's pragmatism and her mother's compassion, made Sofia\u2019s breath catch. In that moment, she felt a profound surge of hope. The bridge she was building was already extending into the next generation.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, on her morning N-Judah commute, she saw a high school student scrolling through a mental health app. It was one her team had built. The student was tapping through a module on anxiety that Sofia had personally overseen. In the rocking quiet of the train, watching this anonymous act of self-care, her two worlds\u2014her mother\u2019s grassroots advocacy and her father\u2019s systemic view\u2014clicked into perfect alignment. This was the scale she had been seeking. This was working."
