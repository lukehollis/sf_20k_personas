Raised in a quiet Portland suburb by a practical accountant father and a high school teacher mother, Brandon was instilled with a sense of order and logical progression. He was the kid who built intricate Lego cities, more interested in their systems of governance than in smashing them. This fascination with underlying structures led him to UC Davis, where he pursued a degree in Cognitive Science\u2014a perfect compromise between his interest in the human mind and his aptitude for computational thinking.\n\nHis key turning point came during a summer internship. Initially planning on a PhD track, he took a role at a mid-sized tech startup in San Francisco to \"see the other side.\" The sheer speed and tangible impact of analyzing user data to improve a product hooked him instantly. The academic world suddenly felt slow and abstract. Upon graduation, he accepted a full-time offer from the same company as a Junior Data Scientist.\n\nNow 24, Brandon\u2019s life is defined by a discipline that borders on monastic. Since his job is fully remote, his commute is a ten-step walk from his bed to his standing desk. His apartment, neat and minimalist, is both his office and sanctuary. Mornings are for deep work, sifting through datasets to find the elegant-but-unseen patterns in human behavior. Afternoons are for breaking a sweat, either on a long run through Golden Gate Park or at the Dogpatch Boulders climbing gym, where his small, tight-knit group of friends convenes. These friends, mostly from college or the climbing community, form his entire social bubble.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is more atmospheric than social. He loves the cool fog that blankets his neighborhood, the quiet hum of Geary Boulevard, and the accessibility of world-class dumplings. He eschews the chaotic nightlife of the Mission for the calm predictability of his routine. Brandon\u2019s dream is to eventually lead a team that builds ethical AI\u2014systems that understand and assist users without exploiting them. He wants to prove that data can be used not just for profit, but for genuine human connection, a puzzle he is determined to solve, one line of code at a time."
