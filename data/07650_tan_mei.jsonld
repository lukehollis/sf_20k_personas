A second-generation Chinese-American, she was raised by parents who ran a small, bustling bakery, their lives dictated by the pre-dawn alchemy of flour and fire. They instilled in Mei a profound sense of duty and a quiet pragmatism. She was a dutiful daughter, absorbing the scent of egg tarts and the weight of familial expectation in equal measure.\n\nHer educational journey began at City College of San Francisco with plans to study business, a practical choice to one day help manage the family bakery. However, that path was abruptly rerouted two years in when her father suffered a major health crisis. With the bakery's future uncertain and medical bills mounting, Mei dropped out of college to help her mother. The dream of a degree was shelved, replaced by the immediate needs of her family.\n\nNow, at 24, Mei\u2019s life is a study in quiet responsibility. Her zero-mile commute is literal: she works as an administrative assistant for a small cultural preservation non-profit that operates out of the ground floor of her apartment building. Her days are a cycle of answering emails, organizing digital archives, and coordinating community events, all under the same roof where she sleeps. Her work is steady but lacks passion, a placeholder in a life temporarily paused.\n\nHer social circle is small; a high school best friend who now lives in Oakland, and occasional dinners with her older brother. Most evenings are spent helping her mother, who has since sold the bakery, or trying to rekindle her own ambitions by taking free online courses in graphic design. Mei feels a deep, complicated love for San Francisco. It is the city of her heritage and her burden. She dreams of one day finishing her degree\u2014not in business, but in art\u2014and creating something that is entirely her own. For now, she finds solace in the familiar rhythm of her neighborhood, a quiet administrator of other people\u2019s histories while waiting for the right moment to start writing her own."
