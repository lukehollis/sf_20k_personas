Raised in a blue-collar family, his father a mechanic and his mother a department store manager, the expectation was never college, but a steady trade and a reliable paycheck. School was something to get through, and after graduating with a general studies diploma, Cody worked a series of dead-end retail jobs, feeling the familiar pull of stagnation that had kept his family in the Central Valley for generations.\n\nAt 21, he made his escape. A high school friend living in San Francisco offered him a couch, and Cody packed a single duffel bag, chasing a vague notion of opportunity. The city was an overwhelming, exhilarating shock. After a few months of gig work, he landed what felt like a golden ticket: a full-time position as a content moderator for a major tech contractor. It was a foot in the door of an industry that seemed to power the entire world, and it didn't require a degree.\n\nThe initial pride quickly soured. Cody\u2019s days are now spent in a sterile office, sifting through the internet's darkest corners\u2014hate speech, graphic violence, and conspiracy theories. He has become a digital janitor, excising the toxicity that allows the platform to appear clean. The psychological toll is immense, leaving him with a quiet, pervasive numbness.\n\nHis 2.5-mile commute on the N Judah from his shared Inner Richmond apartment is a sacred buffer. He puts on his headphones, watching the city slide by, trying to reset before or after his shift. He lives with two roommates, a barista and a bike courier, whose daily grievances about rude customers feel worlds away from the horrors he silently polices. He rarely talks about work; the few times he tried, he saw the discomfort in his friends' eyes.\n\nCody\u2019s connection to San Francisco is a paradox. He finds refuge in walking through Golden Gate Park, feeling anonymous in the city\u2019s vastness. He loves the architecture and the cool, damp air. Yet, he feels trapped by the very industry that defines his new home. His dream is no longer grand; it\u2019s a simple, desperate hope to find a job that doesn\u2019t chip away at his soul. He spends his nights scrolling through online courses for web design, hoping to find a different door, one that leads to creating things instead of just deleting them."

Stepping out onto the Great Highway, the cold, salty wind hit him so hard it felt like a physical slap, chasing away the memory of Modesto\u2019s oppressive heat. He thought, *this is it, this is what different feels like.* That feeling of pure, raw potential was a high he\u2019d spend years chasing again. It cemented a love for the city that would later become his cage.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAbout six months into his content moderator job, a video landed in his queue. It wasn't the usual graphic violence, but something quieter, more insidious. The silence after he clicked \u2018delete\u2019 was deafening. He went to the sterile breakroom and saw his reflection in the microwave door\u2014pale, hollowed-out. The initial pride in his tech job curdled into a cold dread. That was the day he understood his job wasn\u2019t building a better internet; it was just hiding the rot, and the rot was getting on him.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday evening on the N Judah, after a particularly brutal shift. He was numb, headphones on, watching the Inner Richmond slide by. As his train crested the hill near UCSF, the setting sun lit up the rows of houses in a fiery, impossible orange. His music swelled at the exact same moment. For thirty seconds, the world was overwhelmingly beautiful, a perfect, fleeting antidote to the digital ugliness. This memory became a touchstone, proof that moments of grace still existed.\n\n***\n\n4.\nLast winter, he came home to his roommates complaining about a tourist who\u2019d given them a one-star review. Cody had just spent eight hours deleting hate speech disguised as memes. He opened his mouth to share, to connect, but then saw the simple, untroubled exhaustion on their faces. He closed his mouth, offered a vague nod, and went to his room. The memory isn\u2019t of their words, but of the vast, unbridgeable canyon that opened between them in that moment, cementing a profound loneliness.\n\n***\n\n5.\nA few months ago, feeling hopeless, he was walking aimlessly through the Botanical Garden. He watched a volunteer meticulously weeding and tending to a small plot of delicate, strange-looking flowers. The focused, gentle act of cultivation\u2014of helping something grow\u2014struck him with the force of a revelation. It wasn't just about escaping his job; it was about finding work that created instead of erased. He went home that night and finally paid for the web design course he\u2019d been looking at for months."
