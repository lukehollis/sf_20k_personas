            "value": "Mei Davis is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog and fortitude. Born in the Outer Richmond, she was the eldest daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery on Clement Street. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the boisterous English of the playground, her days measured by the rhythm of stocking shelves and helping customers after school. She was the responsible one, the bridge between her parents' world and the American one unfolding outside their door.\n\nHer dream was to be a graphic designer. In the late 1980s, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, energized by the creative possibilities. However, her journey was cut short. Just two years in, her father\u2019s health declined sharply, and Mei made the difficult choice to leave school to help her mother run the store full-time. The sacrifice cemented her role as the family anchor. After her father passed and her mother eventually sold the business, Mei\u2019s path was set toward stability over passion. She found her skills in organization and steady diligence were perfect for administration, and she built a career as a capable and indispensable Office Manager.\n\nNow 49, Mei\u2019s life has found a quiet equilibrium. She married a kind high school history teacher, Mark Davis, two decades ago, and they raised their daughter, now a sophomore at UC Davis, in the very same Richmond district house Mei grew up in. The pandemic shifted her work entirely remote, and her commute is now a ten-step walk from her bedroom to the small office overlooking her meticulously tended garden. Her daily routine is a comforting loop: a morning walk with Mark through Golden Gate Park, a day of managing schedules and logistics via Slack and Zoom, and an evening spent trying new recipes or video-calling her daughter.\n\nThough content, a flicker of her old dream remains. The \u201csome college\u201d on her resume is a quiet reminder of an unfinished chapter. With her daughter independent and her career stable, Mei has started browsing online courses at City College\u2014not for a degree, but for herself. She imagines spending a Saturday in a pottery studio, her hands covered in clay, finally creating something for no one\u2019s sake but her own."
