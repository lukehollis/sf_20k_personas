Adopted from Hunan, China, by a Berkeley architect and a sociologist, Owen\u2019s upbringing was a blend of structural logic and social theory. While his parents gave him a loving home, he navigated his identity as an Asian-American with a Western name by finding comfort in tangible systems he could control. He spent his youth dismantling electronics and building complex LEGO structures, finding solace in the predictable order of a well-designed process.\n\nThis passion for how things fit together led him to UC Berkeley for mechanical engineering and then Stanford for his Master's, where he specialized in robotics and additive manufacturing. His career turning point came not in a lab, but during a post-graduation trip to Shenzhen. He was mesmerized by the sheer scale of the electronics factories but deeply unsettled by the impersonal, often inefficient, human processes within them. He returned to the Bay Area with a new mission: to innovate manufacturing on a more humane and localized scale.\n\nHe landed his current role as a Manufacturing Process Engineer for a hardware startup developing next-generation audio equipment. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; the company sublets him a live-work loft with a small prototyping lab on the ground floor. His days are a cycle of refining CAD models, troubleshooting robotic arms via video calls with overseas factories, and running tests on their in-house 3D printers.\n\nHis life is disciplined and focused. Weekdays are for work, but weekends are for long, meditative bike rides across the city, exploring the physical contours of neighborhoods from the Outer Sunset to the Marina. His social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly grad school friends who share his quiet intensity. Owen\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its social scene and more about its role as a hub of creation. He dreams of pioneering a new process that could bring high-tech manufacturing back to urban centers like his own. He is building the future, one precise component at a time, finding his place in the world by redefining how it\u2019s made."

That\u2019s a cantilever. It distributes the load.\u201d In that moment, the abstract logic his father lived by became a tangible force in his hands. It wasn't about the plastic bricks; it was the first time he felt the world\u2019s hidden structures click into place. That day, play became purpose, solidifying a lifelong need to build things that made perfect, rational sense.\n\n2.\nThe air in the Shenzhen factory was thick with the scent of solder and the hum of fluorescent lights. He remembers the faces most\u2014a line of young workers performing one repetitive motion, their eyes vacant while assembling brilliant technology. The sheer scale was awe-inspiring, but the human inefficiency was a deep, physical ache. He felt a profound disconnect between the elegant circuits and the ghost-like process creating them. That discomfort became his mission: to design a better, more humane way to build the future, returning the soul to the machine.\n\n3.\nIt was 2 AM in his Dogpatch loft. The only sounds were the whirring motors of the robotic arm he\u2019d spent weeks calibrating and the faint foghorn from the bay. He watched it execute a flawless assembly, placing a delicate audio capacitor with micron-perfect precision. There was no grand explosion of joy, but a deep, resonant hum of satisfaction that echoed the machine. It was proof. He wasn\u2019t just dreaming of localized manufacturing; he was living in the middle of his first working prototype, building it right where he stood.\n\n4.\nGasping for air atop Twin Peaks after a grueling bike ride, Owen saw San Francisco not as a city, but as a schematic. The perfect grid of the Sunset, the organic curves of the coastline, the dense verticality of Downtown\u2014it was all a massive, interconnected system. He wasn't just an observer; he was tracing its circuits, understanding its physical logic. The ride wasn\u2019t just exercise; it was a form of communion, a way to map the city\u2019s soul onto his own fascination with how complex things fit together.\n\n5.\nAt fourteen, he was dismantling a dead VCR on the kitchen table when his mother, the sociologist, sat down. He braced for a lecture on making a mess. Instead, she asked him to explain what each component did, listening intently. \"It's like deconstructing a theory,\" she said finally, \"You're finding the core assumptions.\" In her eyes, he saw not a weird hobby, but a methodology she understood. He felt a profound sense of relief, of being seen. His tangible world and her theoretical one had finally, perfectly, connected."
