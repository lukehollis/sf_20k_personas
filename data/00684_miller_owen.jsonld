Adopted from Hunan, China, by a Berkeley architect and a sociologist, Owen\u2019s upbringing was a blend of structural logic and social theory. While his parents gave him a loving home, he navigated his identity as an Asian-American with a Western name by finding comfort in tangible systems he could control. He spent his youth dismantling electronics and building complex LEGO structures, finding solace in the predictable order of a well-designed process.\n\nThis passion for how things fit together led him to UC Berkeley for mechanical engineering and then Stanford for his Master's, where he specialized in robotics and additive manufacturing. His career turning point came not in a lab, but during a post-graduation trip to Shenzhen. He was mesmerized by the sheer scale of the electronics factories but deeply unsettled by the impersonal, often inefficient, human processes within them. He returned to the Bay Area with a new mission: to innovate manufacturing on a more humane and localized scale.\n\nHe landed his current role as a Manufacturing Process Engineer for a hardware startup developing next-generation audio equipment. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; the company sublets him a live-work loft with a small prototyping lab on the ground floor. His days are a cycle of refining CAD models, troubleshooting robotic arms via video calls with overseas factories, and running tests on their in-house 3D printers.\n\nHis life is disciplined and focused. Weekdays are for work, but weekends are for long, meditative bike rides across the city, exploring the physical contours of neighborhoods from the Outer Sunset to the Marina. His social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly grad school friends who share his quiet intensity. Owen\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its social scene and more about its role as a hub of creation. He dreams of pioneering a new process that could bring high-tech manufacturing back to urban centers like his own. He is building the future, one precise component at a time, finding his place in the world by redefining how it\u2019s made."
