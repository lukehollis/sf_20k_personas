His apartment sits directly above Hearth & Wok, his restaurant in the Mission District, meaning his commute is a single flight of stairs. He wakes not to an alarm, but to the rumble of the dough sheeter and the scent of yeast from the bakery prep downstairs.\n\nBorn and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, David\u2019s childhood was steeped in the sizzle of his parents\u2019 small, no-frills Chinese-American restaurant. He learned the rhythm of a kitchen before he learned long division, mastering knife skills under his father\u2019s watchful eye and memorizing his mother\u2019s recipes by taste and touch. His parents, however, envisioned a different life for him\u2014one free from the grueling hours and razor-thin margins of the food industry. They pushed for stability, for an office job with benefits.\n\nTo appease them, David enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration. It felt like a costume he was forced to wear. The turning point came during a particularly soul-crushing internship filing invoices. He walked out, traded his polo shirt for a chef\u2019s coat, and never looked back. He took a humbling job as a line cook at a French bistro in Hayes Valley, absorbing classical techniques that felt a world away from his mother\u2019s wok.\n\nHis career became a culinary tour of San Francisco, moving from Italian kitchens in North Beach to Californian concepts in SoMa. He built a reputation for his relentless work ethic and innovative palate. Five years ago, with a small loan and a mountain of ambition, he opened Hearth & Wok. His food is his life story on a plate: a marriage of traditional Cantonese methods with the fiercely local, seasonal ingredients of Northern California.\n\nHis social life is his kitchen staff\u2014a found family forged in the heat of service. His dream is a Michelin star, not for the ego, but as the ultimate validation to his parents that his passion was a worthy pursuit. Every night, after the last customer leaves, he walks upstairs, his life\u2019s work humming quietly beneath his feet, already planning the next day\u2019s menu."
