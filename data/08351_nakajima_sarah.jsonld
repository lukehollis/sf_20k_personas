A third-generation (Sansei) Japanese-American, her childhood was stable and quiet, shaped by her pharmacist father and elementary school teacher mother. Though never openly discussed, the silent weight of her grandparents\u2019 internment during WWII was a palpable presence in their home\u2014a legacy of unspoken trauma and resilience that would later define her career path.\n\nShe attended Lowell High School before completing her undergraduate degree at SF State, staying close to her roots. The pivotal moment came during a college trip to Manzanar. Walking the dusty grounds with her grandmother, who finally shared fragments of her experience, Sarah felt a profound calling. She realized that wounds could be passed down through generations, often invisibly. This solidified her decision to pursue a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on how medical and historical trauma impacts mental health.\n\nNow 34, Sarah works as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major Bay Area hospital, but entirely via telehealth from her sunny NoPa apartment. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her kitchen to a small, dedicated office space. Her days are a structured rhythm of virtual sessions, supporting patients navigating chronic illness, grief, and the anxieties of a fractured healthcare system.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and complicated. She cherishes her morning walks to The Mill for coffee and treasures afternoons in the Panhandle with her long-term partner, Alex, a landscape architect. Yet, she mourns the city\u2019s vanishing affordability and character. Her social circle is a small, tight-knit group of old high school friends and fellow therapists who understand the emotional toll of their work.\n\nHer greatest aspiration is to open a small private practice focused on serving multi-generational families and those with chronic health conditions\u2014a direct continuation of the work that began on that dusty afternoon at Manzanar. She dreams of owning a home in the city that holds her entire history, a place where she can continue to help others piece together their own stories of healing and resilience."
