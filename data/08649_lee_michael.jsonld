            "value": "Michael Lee is a product of San Francisco\u2019s western fog. The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up in the Sunset District, where the rhythmic rumble of the N-Judah streetcar was the soundtrack to his childhood. His parents ran a small, bustling bakery on Irving Street, instilling in him a formidable work ethic and a deep appreciation for community hubs. As a boy, his world was shaped by the city\u2019s arteries; he learned its grid by tracing Muni bus routes on a map, fascinated by how thousands of disparate lives were connected by these shared paths.\n\nThe pivotal moment came not in a classroom, but in 1989. At nine years old, he felt the violent jolt of the Loma Prieta earthquake. He watched the news with his parents for days, mesmerized by the images of the collapsed Cypress Street Viaduct and the damaged Embarcadero Freeway. It wasn't the destruction that captured his imagination, but the monumental task of putting the city back together, of rethinking the very lines that defined it. This cemented his future. He pursued a pragmatic undergraduate degree but found his true calling in graduate school, earning a Master of Urban and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley.\n\nNow 37, Michael works as a Transportation Planner for the city. His 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a pandemic-era shift to remote work that he has embraced. He lives in a modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood reborn from the very freeway removal the earthquake precipitated. His days are a disciplined blend of data analysis and digital mapping, as he meticulously models traffic flows and plans for a future of more sustainable, equitable transit.\n\nThough his work spans the entire city, his personal life is hyperlocal. He starts his day with an espresso from a cafe on Octavia Boulevard and often takes his lunch in Patricia's Green, observing the pedestrian traffic he helps manage. Thoughtfully single after a long-term relationship ended two years ago, his social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends. His deepest aspiration is to see a major project\u2014a new protected bike lane network or a rapid bus corridor he designed\u2014break ground. For Michael, improving San Francisco isn't just a job; it's a way of honoring the boy who watched a broken city and dreamed of how to make it whole again."
