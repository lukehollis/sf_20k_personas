Raised in Fremont, his home life was a vibrant mix of his Filipino-American father's boisterous family gatherings and his Indian immigrant mother\u2019s aromatic cooking and quiet diligence. From a young age, Rohan was fascinated by the intricate systems of the natural world, a passion he carried with him to San Francisco State University, where he enrolled as a biology major.\n\nHis academic path, however, was cut short. During his sophomore year, his mother was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, placing immense financial and emotional strain on the family. Without a second thought, Rohan left school to find work, landing an entry-level position as a lab assistant. It was a painful pivot, trading the promise of a bachelor's degree for the immediate necessity of a paycheck.\n\nBut Rohan\u2019s sharp mind and meticulous nature did not go unnoticed. He absorbed every technique, from PCR assays to cell culturing, proving more capable than many of his degreed colleagues. After two years, he was promoted to a full Lab Technician at a promising biotech startup in Mission Bay. Now 25, he earns a stable income, a quiet point of pride that he can help his parents while forging his own path.\n\nRohan\u2019s life is structured and routine. He shares a cramped but lively apartment in the Mission District with two roommates. Mornings are for the crowded Muni bus, a 3.5-mile journey where he listens to science podcasts, mentally preparing for the day. He finds a deep, personal satisfaction in his work, knowing that the data he generates could contribute to a breakthrough for diseases like his mother's.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is practical and deeply felt. He loves the city\u2019s energy, the easy access to climbing gyms in the Dogpatch, and the endless variety of food trucks. Though he\u2019s proud of his professional success, a quiet longing remains. Rohan\u2019s ultimate dream is to return to SF State and finish his degree, not for the credential, but to finally close that chapter and perhaps, one day, lead the research rather than just assist it."

She was explaining insurance forms, her voice thin. His father\u2019s usual boisterous energy was gone, replaced by a silent weight. In that moment, the abstract idea of his biology degree felt like a luxury. Announcing he\u2019d find a job wasn\u2019t a choice, but an inevitability. It was the moment he traded his own dream for his family\u2019s stability, a sacrifice that felt both crushing and deeply right. (Age 19)\n\n2.\nSix months into his first lab job, his hands moved with an instinct he didn't know he had, prepping a crucial PCR assay. His supervisor hovered, skeptical. When he saw the results\u2014flawless, glowing bands on the gel\u2014a hot wave of pride cut through his anxiety. It was the first time he truly felt he belonged there, that his meticulous nature was a tangible skill, not just a personality quirk. This quiet victory was his real diploma, earned not in a classroom but at the bench. (Age 20)\n\n3.\nLast year, pipetting a sample for an autoimmune study, he glanced at the anonymized patient code. For a split second, his mind replaced the number with his mother\u2019s name. The lab faded away, and he felt the profound weight of his task. This wasn't just data; it was a life, a family, a future. His work ceased to be a job and became an act of love and quiet rebellion against the cellular chaos he was fighting to understand. It gave his precision a purpose. (Age 24)\n\n4.\nHe remembers the satisfying ache in his forearms after a bouldering session in the Dogpatch. He bought a Mission-style burrito from a truck and, while leaning against a wall, transferred money to his father\u2019s account to cover a prescription. The city hummed around him, a place he was now a part of, not just a visitor to. In that simple act\u2014earning his own way, easing their burden\u2014he felt a profound, quiet sense of accomplishment that almost made up for the missing diploma. (Age 24)\n\n5.\nThe Muni bus paused near SF State two weeks ago, and Rohan found himself staring at the science building. He could almost feel the weight of his old backpack, the phantom excitement of a difficult lecture. It wasn't a painful memory anymore, but a quiet, persistent hum. It was a promise he\u2019d made to his younger self, a chapter he knew he had to finish. Not for a job, but for the simple satisfaction of closing the circle and finally becoming the person who asks the questions. (Recurring)"
