Adopted as an infant by a loving Vietnamese-American couple who had built a life in San Jose, she grew up in a household rich with the aromas of ph\u1edf and the soft tones of a language she never fully mastered. This dual existence\u2014a Caucasian child in a vibrant Vietnamese family, a bridge between cultures\u2014fostered a profound empathy and a lifelong inquiry into identity and belonging. She felt like an outsider in both worlds, a feeling that would later become her greatest professional asset.\n\nThis deep-seated desire to understand human connection guided her to a Master of Social Work (MSW) from UC Berkeley. She began her career in community mental health, working with marginalized families. While the work was vital, she saw a different kind of crisis brewing among her peers in San Francisco: the pervasive burnout and emotional isolation crippling the city\u2019s tech industry. These individuals had immense resources but lacked the tools for connection and self-regulation.\n\nThe turning point was witnessing a friend's breakdown from work-related stress. Amber realized her social work skills\u2014group facilitation, systems thinking, and empathy-building\u2014were desperately needed in the corporate sphere. She left the non-profit sector and founded the Mindful Tech Collective, a consultancy that helps tech companies foster healthier work cultures. As Lead Facilitator, she\u2019s a social worker for the soul of the digital age, teaching emotional intelligence and sustainable ambition.\n\nAmber\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the Mission District. Her days begin with a local pour-over coffee before she zips to her SoMa co-working space on her electric scooter. Evenings are for Vinyasa yoga, potlucks with her tight-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of fellow creatives and thinkers, or reading in Dolores Park. Having never quite fit in, she found her home in San Francisco, a city that prizes reinvention. At 35, she is focused on expanding her Collective\u2019s impact and dreams of writing a book. She hopes to find a partner who sees the strength in her complex story, a story that began with a name."

A great-aunt, her hands smelling of star anise, cupped Amber\u2019s face and said lovingly in Vietnamese, \u201cOur lucky beautiful one, with eyes the color of the sky.\u201d The room was warm with affection, but in that moment, Amber felt a transparent wall form around her. It wasn't unkindness but a simple fact: she was cherished, but she was different. That quiet, loving separation became the seed of her lifelong inquiry into what it means to truly belong.\n\n2.\nAt 29, she found her best friend, a brilliant software engineer, sitting on his apartment floor amidst takeout containers, staring blankly as his phone buzzed incessantly. \u201cI can\u2019t turn it off, Amber,\u201d he whispered. A surge of protective clarity washed over her. This wasn't a personal failing; it was a systemic wound. Her social work training saw the whole broken system, not just the man. This moment transformed her empathy into a mission, pivoting her career from community work to healing the very culture that was breaking her peers.\n\n3.\nThe first workshop for her Mindful Tech Collective was terrifying. The room was filled with skeptical engineers. Afterwards, a stoic senior manager who hadn't spoken all session approached her. He looked her in the eye and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t told my wife how bad it\u2019s gotten. I think I can now. Thank you.\u201d The immense weight of relief and validation nearly brought Amber to her knees. It was the first concrete proof that her strange bridge of a career path was not only stable, but essential.\n\n4.\nIt was a warm Tuesday evening during her first year in San Francisco, around age 27. She sat alone in Dolores Park with a book, watching the city\u2019s eclectic pageant unfold: tech bros playing spikeball near a group of drag queens rehearsing a number, families sharing picnics. No one belonged to just one world. In the fading light, a profound peace settled over her. She realized her feeling of being an outsider wasn't a flaw; in this city, it was the native tongue. She was finally home.\n\n5.\nFor her 33rd birthday potluck, her \"chosen family\" of Mission District friends gave toasts. Her friend, a poet, raised a glass to her \u201cfierce empathy born from a complicated story.\u201d He then read a short verse he\u2019d written about how the strongest bridges are built from different materials. Amber wept quietly, not from sadness, but from the overwhelming relief of being seen in her entirety. It was the moment she fully accepted that her complex story wasn't baggage, but the very source of her strength."
