Raised in Madison, Wisconsin, by a public-school teacher mother and an engineer father, she learned the values of both compassionate service and systematic thinking. Her path toward healthcare was solidified early, watching her family navigate the complex and often frustrating system to manage her younger brother's severe asthma. She saw firsthand how a good system could change a life, and how a bad one could break it.\n\nAfter completing her undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, Rebecca felt the pull of the West Coast's innovation. She pursued her Master's in Healthcare Administration in Los Angeles, drawn to the forefront of medical management. Her first job out of grad school was a disillusioning stint with a massive corporate HMO. The pursuit of profit over patient outcomes chafed against her core values, leading to a pivotal career change. She took a significant pay cut to join a burgeoning non-profit in San Francisco that provided integrated health and social services to at-risk youth.\n\nNow, as Director of Clinical Operations, Rebecca has found her calling. She lives in a tastefully minimalist condo in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that places her just a 1.2-mile walk from her office near the Mission District. Her days are a structured rhythm: a morning coffee from a local cafe, the walk to work listening to a policy podcast, long hours coordinating care, and an evening unwind with either a yoga class or dinner with a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom also work in the non-profit sector.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep; it\u2019s the city where her professional purpose and personal identity finally merged. She is amicably divorced, a partnership that ended when their paths diverged\u2014his toward corporate success, hers toward community impact. Rebecca\u2019s primary aspiration is not personal wealth, but to secure funding to expand her organization\u2019s mental health services. She dreams of a future where no child in the city falls through the cracks, a goal she walks toward, quite literally, every single day."
