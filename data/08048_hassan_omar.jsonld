He spent his childhood sketching the silhouettes of millennia-old monuments before his family immigrated to suburban New Jersey when he was nine. This stark transition from enduring history to planned uniformity ignited his fascination with how spaces shape human experience. He pursued this passion through a Master of Architecture degree from Yale, where his thesis explored the intersection of ancient funerary architecture and modern, sacred public spaces.\n\nHis early career at a prestigious New York firm, designing soulless corporate towers, felt like a betrayal of his principles. The turning point came in his early thirties with an offer from a boutique San Francisco firm specializing in cultural projects. He embraced the move, trading East Coast rigidity for the West Coast\u2019s eclectic energy and challenging topography. In San Francisco, Omar found his calling, designing spaces that prioritized human connection and artistic expression\u2014a small experimental theater in the Mission, a gallery extension in SoMa, a public memorial in Golden Gate Park.\n\nNow at 48, Omar is a Senior Designer who works from the sleek, airy loft in Hayes Valley he shares with his partner, Lena, a landscape architect. His commute is a walk to his desk, overlooking a bustling streetscape through a floor-to-ceiling window. His days are a disciplined blend of digital modeling, client calls, and sketching by hand with a pot of strong Egyptian coffee always nearby. He finds inspiration on his daily walks, observing the city\u2019s layered history and the way fog interacts with modern glass and Victorian filigree. His social circle is small and intimate, comprised of fellow artists and thinkers.\n\nOmar\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of monolithic skyscrapers, but of legacy on a human scale. He aspires to design a single, perfect building for San Francisco\u2014perhaps a library or a small museum\u2014that feels both deeply modern and as timeless as the pyramids he sketched as a boy, a space that holds the city\u2019s memories and inspires its future."
