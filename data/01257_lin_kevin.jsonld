Born in a Sacramento suburb to a pragmatic Chinese-American father and a third-generation Irish-Italian mother, Kevin\u2019s upbringing was a blend of cultures that resulted in him feeling simply \u201cCalifornian.\u201d He was a reserved child, far more interested in the guts of the family\u2019s Packard Bell computer than in team sports. While his parents hoped he\u2019d find a stable trade, they watched as his \"hobby\" became an obsession. Instead of textbooks, his guides were IRC channels and sprawling tech forums where he learned to code, troubleshoot, and build systems from scratch.\n\nForegoing college, Kevin saw his path forward online. He moved to San Francisco at 22, not for the culture, but for an entry-level help desk job that promised experience. For years, he was the reliable, unseen force on the other end of a support ticket, methodically rising through the ranks on sheer competence. The major turning point was his promotion to IT Support Manager six years ago. Suddenly, the solitary problem-solver had to manage a team, navigate personalities, and communicate with executives. The transition was rocky, forcing him to develop the people skills he\u2019d long neglected. It was a period of intense growth that reshaped him from a pure technician into a leader.\n\nNow 37, Kevin lives a contained life in his Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his desk defines his routine: a morning coffee from the cafe on Clement Street, a day of back-to-back video calls managing his remote team, and an evening walk in Golden Gate Park to decompress. The fog is his most consistent neighbor. His social circle is small, composed of a few old work friends and a partner from a long-term relationship that ended two years ago, a casualty of his intense focus on work.\n\nHaving achieved the professional stability his parents wished for him, Kevin now feels a different kind of longing. His aspirations are no longer tied to job titles, but to connection. He dreams of taking a real vacation, one without a laptop, and maybe finding a partner with whom to share the quiet rhythm of his life. He hopes to one day use his skills for a project of his own, building something new instead of just fixing what\u2019s broken."
