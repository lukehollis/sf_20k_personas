Born and raised in San Francisco's Richmond District, her childhood was a blend of traditional Chinese family values and the vibrant, diverse energy of the city. Her parents, immigrants who worked long hours, instilled in her the importance of hard work and community. Early on, she was fascinated by the city's complex infrastructure, the flow of people and goods, and the constant evolution of its urban fabric.\n\nThis fascination led her to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Urban Planning, a path that felt like a natural extension of her desire to improve the city she loved. Excelling in her studies, she developed a keen eye for detail and a passion for sustainable and efficient transportation solutions. Her career began with entry-level positions, gradually working her way up through various agencies, gaining invaluable experience in policy development, project management, and public outreach. Today, as a seasoned Transportation Planner, she earns a comfortable $115,000, contributing significantly to the city's transportation network.\n\nA key turning point in her life was witnessing the impact of traffic congestion and insufficient public transit on lower-income communities. This experience solidified her commitment to equitable planning, fueling her dedication to projects that prioritize access and affordability.\n\nMei Lin's personal life is rich with a strong sense of connection. She is married to a supportive partner, and they have two grown children who are building their own lives in different cities, though they remain close. She maintains strong ties with her extended family in the city's Sunset District and is an active member of several community organizations focused on urban development and environmental sustainability. Her social connections are a mix of professional colleagues and lifelong friends from her neighborhood and school years.\n\nHer current lifestyle is characterized by routine and purpose. She takes the BART 7.8 miles to her office daily, a commute that allows her to observe the city's rhythm and often catch up on industry news. Evenings are spent with her husband, attending community meetings, or pursuing her hobby of urban sketching, capturing the ever-changing streetscapes.\n\nHer hopes and dreams are deeply intertwined with the future of San Francisco. She aspires to contribute to large-scale projects that significantly improve public transit accessibility and reduce car dependency. Personally, she looks forward to retirement, perhaps dedicating her time to mentoring younger planners or volunteering for organizations focused on preserving San Francisco\u2019s unique character. Her connection to the city and her Richmond District neighborhood is a fundamental part of her identity; she sees herself not just living in San Francisco, but actively participating in its ongoing story."

It felt like entering another world, vast and full of possibility, cementing a lifelong fascination with the city's connections and boundaries. This sparked her early interest in infrastructure.\n\n2.  Sitting on the N-Judah streetcar as a teen, she watched a family struggle with groceries and a stroller, missing their stop due to the crowded aisle. A pang of frustration and understanding hit her \u2013 the system wasn't working for everyone. This fueled her dedication to equitable transit early on.\n\n3.  The day she presented her first transit proposal at City Hall felt like a crucial test. Her voice trembled slightly, but seeing familiar faces from her neighborhood in the audience gave her strength. It solidified her belief that planning was about serving the people.\n\n4.  Helping her elderly aunt navigate a complicated bus route after a system change highlighted the real-world impact of dense jargon and confusing schedules. It reinforced her commitment to clear communication and user-friendly system design in her work.\n\n5.  Sketching a detailed fire escape adorned with blossoming potted plants in North Beach, she felt a deep connection to the layers of history and hidden beauty in the city she helped shape. It reminded her why she worked so hard to protect and improve this unique place."
