Born and raised in Oakland, she is the daughter of a pragmatic South Asian immigrant mother, a nurse, and a free-spirited Black father, a jazz musician. This blend of practicality and artistry defined her upbringing. Growing up, she navigated the complexities of her mixed-race identity and struggled with sensitive skin, feeling unseen by a beauty industry that often catered to a narrow standard. This early experience planted a seed of passion that would take years to fully bloom.\n\nFollowing her mother\u2019s advice to build a stable foundation, Priya pursued a Bachelor's in Business Administration at San Francisco State University. She graduated and dutifully entered the corporate world, landing a respectable job in marketing. However, the sterile environment of spreadsheets and predictable campaigns left her feeling hollow. The turning point came during a particularly grueling project when she realized her true passion wasn't selling products, but helping people feel confident and cared for. On a bold impulse, she quit her job and enrolled in a premier esthetics program, funding her new path with her savings.\n\nThis was the synthesis she had been missing. Priya skillfully merged her business acumen with her newfound expertise in skincare. Four years ago, she took a leap of faith and opened her own studio in NOPA, named \u201cAura Collective.\u201d Her business thrives on a philosophy of inclusivity, creating customized treatments for the diverse clientele of San Francisco.\n\nToday, Priya lives in a sunny Hayes Valley apartment with her partner, an architect who appreciates her entrepreneurial drive. Her daily routine is a hum of city life: a morning walk for coffee at a local cafe, followed by a short MUNI ride to her studio. Evenings are for experimenting with new product formulations, sharing a home-cooked meal, or catching a show with a close-knit group of friends. San Francisco is more than her home; it\u2019s the canvas on which she built her dream. Her future aspirations involve launching her own small-batch skincare line and mentoring other young women of color looking to break into the wellness industry."

But Priya\u2019s eyes burned, scanning rows of products not made for her brown skin. It wasn't just about the rash; it was a profound feeling of being invisible. That sharp pang of otherness cemented a vow she didn't yet have words for: one day, she would create a space where everyone felt seen.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in a silent Financial District office, the screen glowing with analytics for a soda campaign. She felt a deep, soul-level exhaustion. It wasn't the hours; it was the hollowness. Looking out at the city lights, she thought of her father\u2019s hands on a saxophone, creating something from pure feeling. In that sterile room, Priya made the choice. She would no longer market things; she would build something that healed. This was the turning point, six years ago, that led her to esthetics.\n\n3.\nFour years ago, the night before Aura Collective opened. The smell of fresh paint and lavender oil filled her empty NOPA studio. She ran her hand over the cool quartz countertop, the key feeling impossibly heavy in her palm. It was terrifying. But in the quiet, she felt both her mother's pragmatism in the business plan and her father's artistry in the design. This wasn't just a risk; it was a homecoming. She was finally creating a legacy that was entirely her own.\n\n4.\nA college student with persistent acne, a regular for about six months, came in for her appointment last year. She quietly mentioned she\u2019d stopped wearing foundation for the first time since she was a teenager. She looked Priya in the eye and said, \"Thank you for giving me my face back.\" The simple, profound gratitude in her voice struck Priya deeply. It affirmed that her work wasn't about skin, but about restoring confidence and easing the burdens people carry.\n\n5.\nLast winter, in their Hayes Valley apartment. Rain slicked the streets outside, but inside was warm. Her partner was sketching at the dining table while she carefully measured out manuka honey and rosehip oil for a new serum. The scent of her creation mixed with simmering curry on the stove. This quiet, domestic moment felt like the ultimate success. It was a life built not from a template, but from scratch\u2014a perfect synthesis of her passion, partnership, and peace."
