Raised in a stoic, middle-class family in Modesto, he learned early that emotions were things to be managed, not explored. This changed when his younger sister developed a severe eating disorder in high school. David watched, frustrated and powerless, as his family struggled, ill-equipped to navigate the labyrinth of mental healthcare. It was this searing experience that ignited his purpose: he would learn the language of healing that his family never knew.\n\nHe pursued psychology at UC Davis, then moved to the Bay Area for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. San Francisco was a shock and a liberation. He threw himself into his studies and his practicum at a crisis clinic in the Mission, finding the city\u2019s raw, diverse energy a welcome antidote to the homogeneity of his youth. After earning his LCSW, he took a demanding job at a major San Francisco hospital, working with patients and families grappling with sudden, life-altering diagnoses. The work was fulfilling but draining, and after seven years, the specter of burnout loomed large.\n\nThis became his turning point. Prioritizing his own well-being, David transitioned to a telehealth position, allowing him to continue his work from the calm of his Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is now a walk from his bedroom to his small, dedicated home office. His days are structured: back-to-back virtual sessions followed by a mandatory hour of decompression, often a long walk through Alamo Square or the Panhandle.\n\nNow 36, David lives a deliberately balanced life. He maintains a close circle of friends\u2014mostly fellow therapists and healthcare workers who understand the pressures of their field. He\u2019s single but cautiously navigating the city's dating scene, wary of the performative energy he sometimes encounters. He loves San Francisco for its acceptance and access to nature, but remains critical of its frantic pace. His dream is to eventually open a small, private practice specializing in helping families navigate medical crises, bringing his own story full circle. He seeks not overt success, but a sustainable quietude\u2014a life where he can help others find their footing, while always remaining firmly on his own."
