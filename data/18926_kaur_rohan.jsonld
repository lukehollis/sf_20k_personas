In a deliberate act of progressive parenting, they gave their son the surname \"Kaur,\" traditionally reserved for Sikh women, to instill in him a lifelong sense of gender equality. Rohan grew up a quiet, observant boy who preferred a sketchbook and charcoal pencils to boisterous games. His true calling was revealed in his teens when his younger sister struggled with severe anxiety; Rohan found that the only way to truly reach her was by sitting side-by-side, drawing in shared, quiet understanding.\n\nThis pivotal experience guided his educational journey. He pursued psychology at UC Santa Cruz, where his passion for visual expression bloomed alongside his desire to heal. He followed this with a Master's degree in Art Therapy & Counseling, choosing a path of service over profit.\n\nNow 37, Rohan embodies a version of San Francisco that exists beyond the tech headlines. He lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, filled with half-finished canvases and the earthy smell of clay. His life is one of intention. Each morning begins with a short meditation before he bikes the 2.5 miles to his work. He splits his time between a public middle school and a community health clinic, where he uses art to help children process trauma and elderly clients combat loneliness. His $98,000 salary affords him a simple, stable life, rich with purpose.\n\nHis social circle is small and deep, consisting of fellow therapists, artists, and educators who gather for dim sum on Clement Street or bike rides through Golden Gate Park. Though currently single after a long-term relationship ended amicably last year, he finds companionship in his community and his work. Rohan\u2019s dream is not of wealth, but of impact. He hopes to one day open a small, sliding-scale community art therapy studio in his neighborhood\u2014a creative sanctuary where anyone, regardless of means, can find their voice and begin to heal."
