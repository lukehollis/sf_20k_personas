            "value": "David Miller\u2019s path to becoming a clinical social worker was paved with the\u788e\u77f3 of a difficult childhood. Raised in a working-class suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, he was the quiet observer in a home fractured by his father's untreated depression and the resulting emotional distance. David learned early to read the subtle shifts in mood, to mediate, and to absorb the unspoken anxieties that filled their small house. He became a caretaker by necessity, a role that would define his professional calling.\n\nHe sought escape and understanding through education, pursuing a sociology degree at a state university before feeling the magnetic pull of the West Coast. The promise of reinvention led him to UC Berkeley, where he earned his Master of Social Work, drawn to the clinical track to gain the tools he wished someone had possessed for his father. For two decades, David worked in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s public health system, stationed in a major hospital's emergency department. He navigated crises of addiction, psychosis, and domestic violence, becoming a calm anchor in the city\u2019s most turbulent storms. The work was vital but corrosive, slowly eroding his own reserves of hope.\n\nThe key turning point was burnout, a slow-creeping exhaustion that culminated just before the pandemic. The mandated shift to remote work became an unexpected lifeline. David transitioned his practice to telehealth, leaving the hospital's frantic energy behind.\n\nNow, at 50, his life is contained within the serene confines of his Inner Sunset apartment, which he shares with his partner of twelve years, a high school history teacher. His commute is the ten-foot walk from his kitchen to a small office overlooking a fog-shrouded street. His days are a structured rhythm of video sessions with clients, punctuated by long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. He has cultivated a small circle of close friends, preferring intimate dinners over loud bars. His connection to San Francisco is not with its glittering tech hubs but with its misty, quiet neighborhoods. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to save the world, but to maintain the fragile peace he has built for himself, helping his clients do the same, one session at a time."
