Born in San Jose to an Indian immigrant father who was an engineer and a second-generation Croatian-American mother, Rajan grew up in the nascent shadow of Silicon Valley. His childhood home was a chaotic workshop of circuit boards and half-finished projects. He never felt fully connected to either of his parents' cultures, instead identifying as a product of the tech-infused California landscape. School was a formality; his real education took place in the garage, taking apart radios and building computers from spare parts.\n\nHe bypassed college, finding it an unappealing detour from the hands-on work he craved. The dot-com boom of the late 1990s became his university. He worked for a small startup, learning networking and systems administration on the fly, earning a reputation as a calm, intuitive problem-solver. The subsequent bust was a defining turning point. Laid off and disillusioned with corporate volatility, Rajan decided to go independent. He built a freelance IT support business from the ground up, slowly acquiring a loyal client base of small businesses and individuals overwhelmed by the technology shaping their lives.\n\nIt was during this period he met his partner, Lena, a landscape designer whose love for the organic world balanced his digital one. They decided against having children, preferring a quiet, self-contained life. In the early 2000s, they pooled their savings and bought a small condo in the Inner Sunset, drawn to its foggy, village-like atmosphere and proximity to Golden Gate Park.\n\nNow at 54, Rajan\u2019s life is governed by a pleasant routine. His commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to a small office overlooking a patch of garden Lena cultivates. His days are spent on the phone or via remote desktop, patiently guiding a local bookstore owner through a POS system crash or helping an elderly client reset a password for the fifth time. His social circle is small but meaningful: Lena, a handful of long-term clients who have become friends, and the baristas at the Irving Street cafe where he gets his morning coffee. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or recognition, but of stability\u2014to pay off the mortgage, travel with Lena, and have enough free time to get back to his old hobby of building vintage-style audio amplifiers. He is a quiet anchor in the chaotic sea of technology, a man who found his place not by chasing the next big thing, but by helping others navigate the world that was already here."
