Raised in Walnut Creek by a French-immigrant mother and a meticulous American father, her childhood memories are sensory collages of her grandmother\u2019s Lyonnaise cooking\u2014the scent of coq au vin simmering, the rhythmic chop of vegetables, the sanctity of the family dinner table. Food was love and legacy. Yet, when it came time for college, her parents gently steered her towards a more \"stable\" creative path. She earned an Associate's degree in Graphic Design, spending two years creating sterile logos and layouts that felt a world away from the soulful, chaotic art of a kitchen.\n\nThe turning point came at 23, during a soul-crushing internship. Staring at a color palette on a screen, she realized her hands, which knew the weight of a chef's knife and the feel of perfect dough, were being wasted. She quit the next day, moved into a cramped apartment in San Francisco, and took the lowest job she could find: a prep cook in a notoriously demanding restaurant in SoMa. The grueling hours and brutal hierarchy didn't deter her; they forged her. It was in the heat of the service line, amidst the clatter and curses, that she found her professional rhythm and met her future business partner, a pragmatic sommelier named Leo.\n\nToday, Simone is the Executive Chef and co-owner of \"Fable,\" a cozy, critically-acclaimed bistro in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short flight of stairs from her small-but-tidy apartment above the restaurant. Her days are a well-orchestrated loop: pre-dawn visits to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, hours of meticulous prep with her team, the intense ballet of dinner service, and late-night paperwork with a glass of wine. Her social life is intertwined with her work; her staff is her family, and her regulars are her community. While she has achieved her dream of opening a restaurant, she now aspires to something more enduring: a Michelin Bib Gourmand and the stability to one day take a real vacation. For now, she finds contentment in knowing that every night, in a small corner of San Francisco, she is sharing her family's heritage, one plate at a time."

They weren\u2019t just browning chicken for coq au vin; they were building flavor, layering history into the cast iron pot. The sharp scent of thyme, the glug of red wine, her grandmother humming an old French tune. Simone understood then, in a way she wouldn't have words for until much later, that love was a recipe. It was a truth that settled deep in her bones, a compass pointing her home long before she ever felt lost.\n\n2.\nIt was a Pantone chip\u2014a sterile square of \"Sage Green.\" Her task at the internship was to build a logo around it. Staring at the lifeless color, she felt an almost physical revulsion. Her hands, which knew the heft of a potato and the delicate skin of a shallot, were numb. The quiet, air-conditioned office felt more suffocating than any walk-in freezer. It wasn't a choice anymore; it was a survival instinct. She closed her laptop, walked out, and never looked back, trading corporate safety for kitchen steel at age 23.\n\n3.\nThree hundred covers. The ticket machine was a relentless chatter, and the executive chef\u2019s voice was a raw-throated roar. Her SoMa station was buried. A slick of olive oil, a minor slip, and the searing kiss of a hot pan branded her forearm. She didn\u2019t cry out. She just wrapped it, grabbed her knife, and found her rhythm in the controlled chaos. The pain was real, but the feeling of surviving the rush, of earning a gruff \"good service, Dubois\" from the chef, was her true initiation into the craft.\n\n4.\nIt was 2 a.m., sitting on overturned milk crates behind the restaurant. The alley smelled of garbage and rain. Leo, the unflappable sommelier, poured them each a short glass of good Burgundy he\u2019d \u201cborrowed.\u201d He didn\u2019t talk about food costs or investors. He talked about a place that felt like home, with honest cooking and no pretense. In the dim light, his pragmatic vision met her soulful ambition. \"Fable,\" he'd said, musing. \"Like a good story.\" The dream suddenly had a name and a co-author.\n\n5.\nOne rainy Tuesday, a year after Fable opened, she glanced through the kitchen pass. At table four, a young girl was perched on her dad\u2019s lap, greedily spearing a piece of duck confit from his plate. Her mother watched, smiling. It was an echo of her own past, a reflection of her Mamie\u2019s table transplanted to Hayes Valley. Her pursuit of a Bib Gourmand felt distant in that moment. She was doing it\u2014creating a space where food was love. She had brought her family\u2019s legacy to life for someone else."
