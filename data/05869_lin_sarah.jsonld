The only child of Taiwanese immigrants\u2014a software engineer father and a pharmacist mother\u2014her world was one of high expectations and clear-cut paths to success. While she excelled in her studies, her true passion lived in the margins of her notebooks, filled with intricate sketches and imagined landscapes. Her parents saw art as a hobby, a gentle diversion from the serious business of securing a stable future in tech or medicine.\n\nHer time at UC Davis was a quiet rebellion. She placated her parents by majoring in Communications, a practical-sounding degree, but spent every spare moment in the university\u2019s art history department and student-run galleries. The scent of oil paint and the hushed reverence of exhibition halls felt more like home than any lecture on marketing strategy. The turning point came upon graduation. Faced with lucrative job offers from tech firms, Sarah made a choice that felt both terrifying and liberating: she accepted a low-paying position as a gallery assistant at Aether Gallery, a small, independent space in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood.\n\nThis decision defined her current existence. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a tiny, rent-subsidized studio apartment directly above the gallery, a deal offered by the gallery's discerning, older owner who saw a rare spark in Sarah. Her days are a blend of the mundane and the magical: carefully dusting sculptures, updating the gallery\u2019s website, and engaging with the city\u2019s eccentric art patrons. Evenings are either spent helping host vibrant gallery openings or retreating upstairs to her own small easel, where she works on her own paintings late into the night.\n\nThough her relationship with her parents is strained by their worry, she maintains a close circle of friends\u2014fellow artists, baristas, and writers who understand the creative grind. Sarah\u2019s dream isn't just to assist, but to curate. She aspires to one day discover an unknown artist and give them their first major show, shaping the cultural conversation of the city she now calls home. For Sarah, San Francisco isn't just a location; it's a canvas, and she is determined to make her mark on it."
