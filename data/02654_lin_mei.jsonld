Raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District by practical, second-generation parents, Mei Lin\u2019s path seemed destined for stability, not advocacy. Her family, who had run a neighborhood grocery for decades, saw the city through a lens of commerce and survival, and they pushed her toward a career in engineering.\n\nInitially pursuing architecture at UC Davis, she felt a disconnect. The focus on solitary, monumental buildings felt egotistical. A semester abroad in Copenhagen was the turning point. She was mesmerized by a city designed for people, not just cars\u2014a city that prioritized public squares, cycling, and accessible transit. She returned to California with a transformed worldview, switching her focus and eventually earning a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of city hall, navigating the labyrinth of permits, zoning codes, and contentious community meetings. Now, as a Senior Urban Planner working remotely from her Hayes Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute offers a front-row seat to the results of urban policy. Her apartment, filled with blueprints, topographical maps, and policy journals, is her command center.\n\nHer days are a mix of intense focus on digital models and stakeholder calls, broken up by walks through her neighborhood to observe pedestrian flow or grab coffee at a local cafe. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of architects, policy wonks, and non-profit leaders she often meets for drinks to debate the city\u2019s future. Having ended a long-term relationship years ago with a partner who couldn't match her civic passion, she finds fulfillment in her work.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s dream is not abstract; it\u2019s tangible. She aspires to lead a project\u2014a new light-rail line, a truly inclusionary housing development\u2014that will outlive her, leaving a legacy of a more equitable and livable San Francisco for generations to come."
