The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a bustling Chinatown grocery, Joshua grew up amidst the chaotic symphony of commerce and the quiet but immense pressure to achieve stability. His parents, having sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, saw education as the only path to a secure, white-collar life.\n\nJoshua, however, harbored a love for stories. He defied their practical hopes by majoring in English Literature at SF State, losing himself in poetry and prose. But reality intervened sharply after graduation. His father suffered a health crisis, and the family business teetered on the brink. The abstract beauty of a sonnet couldn't pay medical bills. Driven by a profound sense of duty, Joshua took the first stable job he could find: an entry-level position at a large insurance firm.\n\nThe career was an uncanny fit for his meticulous, analytical nature. He rose steadily, becoming a senior claims adjuster\u2014a professional skeptic who could dissect a tragedy into a series of liabilities and payouts. His 0.0-mile commute began with the pandemic and never ended; he found he preferred the controlled solitude of working from home. A ten-year marriage ended amicably a few years prior, a casualty of a predictability she called stagnation and he now quietly agrees with.\n\nHis days follow a strict rhythm: a morning walk through Golden Gate Park, coffee from a favorite Clement Street caf\u00e9, and then hours untangling the misfortunes of others from his ergonomic chair. His connection to San Francisco is one of quiet observation\u2014the fog rolling over the avenues, the familiar faces at the local market. His social life is small, consisting of a few old friends and his younger sister.\n\nBut after the last claim is closed and the city darkens outside his window, the English major re-emerges. Joshua\u2019s great, secret hope is not to escape his life, but to finally write the novel that has lived in his head for twenty years\u2014a sprawling story of a family, a city, and the quiet compromises that shape a life."
