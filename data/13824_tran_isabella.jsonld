Born in San Jose to a Vietnamese refugee father and a first-generation Mexican-American mother, her childhood was a symphony of competing, then complementary, aromas: the star anise of her father\u2019s pho broth and the earthy chilies of her mother\u2019s mole. Her parents poured their shared history into a small, beloved fusion cafe, where Isabella spent her youth learning that food was not just sustenance, but narrative.\n\nThis foundational belief guided her educational journey. After completing her undergraduate studies, she pursued a Master\u2019s in Hospitality Management, writing her thesis on the role of gastronomy in preserving cultural identity. Her career began in acclaimed San Francisco restaurants, but she craved a grander stage. The turning point came a decade ago when she was appointed Food and Beverage Director for a prestigious performing arts center. Here, she could pair the drama of an opera with the elegance of a perfectly crafted menu, telling stories with both food and wine.\n\nAt 46, Isabella\u2019s life is one of curated intention. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a sleek apartment in Hayes Valley, overlooking the very plaza that leads to her workplace. Her days are a seamless transition from her minimalist home to the controlled chaos of her job, managing everything from pre-theater cocktails to lavish donor galas. Divorced amicably years ago, her primary relationships are with her tight-knit circle of chefs, sommeliers, and artists. San Francisco, for her, is the perfect stage\u2014a city that embraces both high culture and the vibrant immigrant food scenes that remind her of home.\n\nIsabella\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a career ladder but about creating a legacy. She aspires to establish a mentorship program for young, first-generation chefs, helping them navigate the industry without sacrificing their heritage. She envisions a future where the stories told on San Francisco\u2019s plates are as celebrated as those told on its stages."
