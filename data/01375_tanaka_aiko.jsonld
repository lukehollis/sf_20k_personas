            "value": "Aiko Tanaka\u2019s life began amidst the quiet, fog-laced streets of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. A third-generation Japanese American, she was raised by parents who carried the unspoken weight of their own families\u2019 internment camp history. Her father, a stoic gardener, and her mother, a meticulous bookkeeper, preached stability and discouraged emotional displays. This environment, steeped in resilience and repression, planted the seeds for Aiko\u2019s future calling, though she wouldn't realize it for years.\n\nUnsure of her path after high school, Aiko bypassed college, instead drifting through a series of service industry jobs, feeling profoundly disconnected from the life her parents had envisioned for her. The turning point came in her mid-twenties when a close friend\u2019s mental health crisis revealed the stark lack of culturally competent support available. Witnessing this struggle ignited a fierce purpose in Aiko. At 28, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, eventually earning her Master of Social Work.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches of community mental health clinics in the Mission and Tenderloin, where she developed a reputation for her calm demeanor and deep empathy. After a decade of demanding work, she decided to open her own private practice, specializing in generational trauma and anxiety. The pandemic solidified her transition to a fully remote model, which explains her 0.0-mile commute today.\n\nNow 47, Aiko lives in a cozy Inner Richmond apartment where a spare bedroom serves as her office. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, broken up by long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. Having divorced in her early thirties, she is now contentedly single, finding fulfillment in a small, tight-knit circle of friends and the profound, professionally-bound connections she forges with her clients. Her deepest aspiration is to write a book demystifying trauma for a mainstream audience. She is a true San Franciscan: she grieves its struggles with inequality and homelessness while cherishing its enduring, eclectic soul. The city is not just her home; it\u2019s the complex, evolving patient she has dedicated her life to understanding and healing, one session at a time."
