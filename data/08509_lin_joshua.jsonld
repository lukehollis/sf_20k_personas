The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small corner grocery, his childhood was a quiet tapestry of homework, helping stock shelves, and the persistent expectation that he would become a doctor or engineer. Resisting this pressure, Joshua pursued his own passion, enrolling at San Francisco State University and earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, a decision that baffled his pragmatic parents.\n\nHis post-graduation years were a struggle. He dreamed of being a novelist, working as a barista and freelance copyeditor while trying to make his literary mark. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s was his turning point. Facing mounting debt and disillusionment, he made a pragmatic pivot. He discovered his skills in communication and organization were highly valued in the burgeoning tech industry. He found a foothold as a junior project coordinator, shelving his literary ambitions for the stability of a steady paycheck.\n\nOver the next two decades, Joshua built a successful, if unglamorous, career. He married his college girlfriend, and for a time, they shared a life in a small Noe Valley apartment. But their paths diverged; his focus on his career and her desire for a life outside the city\u2019s intense rhythm created a gentle, unbridgeable gap. They divorced amicably five years ago.\n\nNow 45, Joshua lives a life of curated solitude in his Hayes Valley condo. The 0.0-mile commute means his world is often contained within these walls. His days are structured: a morning walk to a local caf\u00e9 for an oat milk latte, hours of Zoom calls and managing Gantt charts, and an evening spent either with a small circle of old friends or watching foreign films. He feels like both a native and a stranger in his own city, nostalgic for the pre-boom era but fully entwined in its current incarnation. His deepest hope is a well-guarded secret: to finally finish the novel he started in his twenties. It\u2019s a quiet dream of proving to himself that the young man who chose poetry over programming is still in there, waiting for his own story\u2019s next chapter."
