The only child of a dedicated middle school teacher and a gifted, though often struggling, jazz saxophonist, she grew up understanding that expression was a vital currency. Nia witnessed how art could be both a refuge and a torment for her father, an observation that planted the seed for her life\u2019s work. In her family, community service and creative passion weren't separate ideals, but two sides of the same coin.\n\nThis led her to pursue a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology, where she specialized in Art Therapy, convinced that some traumas were too deep for words alone. After completing her licensure, she moved across the bay to San Francisco, drawn not by a tech boom, but by the city's mosaic of cultures and its history of progressive social services. She spent her first decade working for a non-profit before a key turning point: a divorce in her late thirties. The experience, while painful, solidified her resolve to be fully independent. She took the leap and established her own private practice.\n\nNow, at 47, Nia is a respected art therapist, contracting with schools in the Mission and a palliative care unit at a city hospital. Her days are structured but varied. She catches the N Judah from her quiet apartment near the Inner Sunset, a 2.8-mile journey that gives her time to mentally prepare for her clients. Her practice is her everything\u2014a space where she helps children process domestic turmoil through clay figures and guides elderly patients in finding peace through watercolor landscapes.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of friends, a \u201cfound family\u201d of other healers, artists, and educators who gather for potlucks and gallery walks. She finds her own solace in long, quiet walks through Golden Gate Park and tending to the jungle of plants on her balcony. Her dream is no longer just to sustain her practice, but to create a legacy: a grant-funded community art therapy center, a permanent sanctuary where anyone, regardless of income, can use creativity to heal. It\u2019s the full expression of the lessons she learned long ago in her Oakland home."

Her father wasn\u2019t performing; he was arguing with his saxophone, coaxing out mournful notes that filled their small Oakland home. It was the first time she saw how art could be a desperate conversation with oneself, a language for things too heavy for words. The sound was both beautiful and agonizing. In that moment, she didn\u2019t just love her father; she understood her calling\u2014to help others find their own non-verbal language.\n\n2.\nIt was her third year at the San Francisco non-profit, her late twenties. For weeks, the little boy had been silent, his trauma a locked box. Nia just sat with him, offering clay. One rainy Tuesday, his small hands finally sculpted a jagged, monstrous shape. He slid it across the table without a word, his eyes meeting hers for the first time. It was a confession, a release. The moment was a quiet thunderclap of validation, cementing her belief that healing could be shaped by hand.\n\n3.\nLate thirties. The first morning waking up alone in the small Inner Sunset apartment after the divorce felt terrifyingly vast. The silence was deafening. On instinct, she walked to the local nursery and bought a single, unruly monstera. Placing it in the empty corner, watching sunlight hit its leaves, wasn't just decorating. It was a promise to herself: she would not just survive here, she would anchor herself and grow. Her own practice, her own life, started with that one green leaf.\n\n4.\nJust last fall, after a harrowing session, her own emotions felt frayed. She went straight to Golden Gate Park, walking the familiar path towards the windmills. The scent of eucalyptus and damp earth was a balm. She stood watching the fog roll over the cypress trees, a silent, powerful presence. The city faded away, leaving only the quiet work of trees reaching for the sky. It wasn't an escape, but a reminder that healing, like nature, is a slow, persistent, quiet process.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, a man in palliative care, his hands trembling with age, painted a blurry watercolor of the ocean. \u201cI haven't held a brush since I was a boy,\u201d he\u2019d whispered, a tear tracing a path on his cheek. \u201cThank you for giving me this back.\u201d Seeing that flicker of reclaimed joy in his final days was a gut punch of purpose. Her dream of a community art center ceased to be an ambition; it became a non-negotiable legacy she had to build."
