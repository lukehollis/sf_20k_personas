He was adopted as an infant by the Wongs, a loving couple \u2013 Sarah, a high school English teacher, and David, an architect. Growing up, Ethan benefited from a stable, nurturing environment that emphasized intellectual curiosity and community involvement. While his parents encouraged him to embrace both his European heritage and his adopted Asian surname with pride, his upbringing was culturally American through and through.\n\nEthan\u2019s educational path was marked by a developing passion for civic engagement. He excelled in debate club throughout high school and spent his summers volunteering for local political campaigns. This interest solidified during his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley, where he double-majored in Political Science and Sociology. It was during a summer internship at City Hall in Berkeley that he first witnessed the tangible impact of local policy on residents' lives, sparking his desire for a career in public service. Following graduation, he pursued a Master's in Public Policy from Stanford University, focusing on urban planning and affordable housing.\n\nA significant turning point arrived during his final year at Stanford. A challenging but rewarding research project on San Francisco\u2019s housing crisis solidified his commitment to working within its complex political landscape. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted position as a Legislative Aide for a San Francisco supervisor. This role, while requiring long hours and navigating political nuances, provided Ethan with invaluable experience observing and contributing to policy formation from the inside.\n\nEthan\u2019s personal life is anchored by a close-knit group of friends from both Berkeley and Stanford, many of whom also gravitated towards the Bay Area. He\u2019s currently in a committed relationship with Maya, a fellow policy wonk he met through work. Their shared interest in public service often fuels lively, late-night discussions over takeout.\n\nHis daily routine is a testament to his commitment to both work and well-being. Ethan is a dedicated cyclist, enjoying the invigorating 3.1-mile ride from his shared apartment in the Richmond District to City Hall. The commute offers a daily connection to the city's energy and diverse neighborhoods. After work, he often attends community meetings, policy talks, or enjoys dinner with Maya or friends.\n\nEthan dreams of eventually leading a policy initiative that makes a tangible difference in the lives of San Franciscans, particularly in addressing the city's affordability challenges. He hopes to move beyond the aide role and potentially run for a local office himself one day. San Francisco, with its unique blend of progressive ideals and complex challenges, feels like the perfect place for him to dedicate his career and contribute to meaningful change. His connection to the Richmond District is deepening; he appreciates its diverse community and proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he often goes for weekend runs. Though not born and raised here, Ethan sees San Francisco as his home, the place where his aspirations are taking root."

The first time Ethan biked across the Golden Gate Bridge, wind whipping past and the city skyline shrinking behind him, he felt an overwhelming sense of freedom and belonging. It was early in his San Francisco life, a moment where the scale of possibilities in this new home became real.\n\n2.  Sitting in a crowded community meeting in the Tenderloin, listening to residents share their struggles with insecure housing, a knot formed in Ethan's stomach. This raw encounter solidified his academic interest into a burning personal mission to fight for affordable housing.\n\n3.  Sharing a late-night burrito with Maya on their shared living room floor, dissecting a complex piece of city legislation, Ethan realized the profound satisfaction of building a life and a partnership around shared values and intellectual passion.\n\n4.  Getting sworn in as a Legislative Aide at City Hall, the ornate building echoing with history, Ethan felt the weight and promise of public service settle upon his shoulders. This was the beginning of truly engaging with the city's political heart.\n\n5.  Jogging through Golden Gate Park during shelter-in-place, seeing neighbors supporting each other from a distance, Ethan felt a deeper connection to the resilience and quiet strength of the San Francisco community he was now a part of."
