Raised by a practical, middle-class family\u2014his father an accountant, his mother a high school administrator\u2014Liam was encouraged to find a stable, predictable path. He was a quiet child, more interested in the intricate rules of board games and the detailed maps of fantasy novels than sports.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's degree in History at the University of Illinois, fascinated by the logistics of ancient empires and the complex supply chains that fueled wars and built civilizations. After graduation, he followed a college girlfriend to San Francisco, a bold move driven more by love than a career plan. The city felt both overwhelmingly vibrant and deeply alienating. When the relationship dissolved a year later, Liam was left adrift, a history major in a city that only valued the future.\n\nThe turning point came from a temp agency that placed him in an entry-level operations role at a small hardware startup. It was supposed to be a placeholder job, but Liam discovered a surprising aptitude for it. Tracking components from Shenzhen to a warehouse in Oakland was no different than plotting the flow of grain to ancient Rome. He was methodical, detail-oriented, and saw patterns where others saw chaos. He excelled, moving from temp to a full-time Logistics Coordinator at a larger tech firm.\n\nNow 30, Liam\u2019s life is defined by his 0.0-mile commute. He works entirely from his meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His days are a ritual: coffee from the same local cafe, a midday walk through Patricia\u2019s Green to clear his head, and evenings spent either running or delving into a complex strategy video game. His social life is small but meaningful, centered around a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game with friends he met online. While he appreciates the city\u2019s beauty, he often feels more like a resident of his three-block radius than of San Francisco itself.\n\nLiam dreams of breaking his own optimized loops. He yearns to apply his logistical skills to something with tangible, human impact, like disaster relief or sustainable agriculture. He\u2019s quietly looking for a connection\u2014both to a person and to a purpose\u2014that will persuade him to finally leave the fortress of his apartment and truly inhabit the city he calls home."
