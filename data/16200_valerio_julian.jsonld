The son of a pragmatic Italian-American mechanic and a compassionate Filipina nurse, he grew up in Daly City, a place defined by its proximity to San Francisco but with a distinct, suburban rhythm. His childhood was a blend of loud, pasta-filled family dinners and the quiet diligence of his mother's culture. He learned early on about the intricate dance of public transportation, watching his parents navigate BART and SamTrans to get to their jobs, a daily reality that planted the seed for his future career.\n\nThis early fascination with the city's arteries propelled him through his studies, first at UC Davis for his undergraduate degree and then to UC Berkeley for a Master of Urban Planning. It was at Berkeley, surrounded by passionate idealists and grizzled city veterans, that his abstract interest sharpened into a focused mission: to make urban transit more equitable and efficient. Landing a position as a Transportation Planner for a major Bay Area agency felt like the culmination of his entire life\u2019s trajectory.\n\nNow 29, Julian lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant energy and complex social fabric he studies both professionally and personally. His 2.5-mile commute on the 14-Mission bus is his daily fieldwork; he observes passenger flow, timing delays, and the human element of the systems he designs on paper. His $125,000 salary affords him a comfortable, if not extravagant, lifestyle.\n\nHis life is anchored by routine and connection. Weekdays are for wrestling with bureaucratic red tape and analyzing traffic data. Evenings are often spent with his partner, Anya, an architect, their conversations frequently circling back to the built environment. Weekends are for biking through Golden Gate Park, exploring new taquerias, and meeting up with a close-knit circle of friends from his graduate program.\n\nJulian\u2019s ambition is not for power or wealth, but for tangible impact. He dreams of the day he can ride a new Bus Rapid Transit line he helped champion, seeing it filled with people whose lives are just a little bit easier because of his work. He is a quintessential modern San Franciscan: driven, hopeful, and deeply invested in shaping the future of a city he both loves and constantly hopes to improve."

He\u2019d press his face against the cold platform glass, waiting for his mom\u2019s train after her nursing shift. The screech of the approaching cars was a prelude to the rumble, and then, the sight of her tired but smiling face emerging from the doors. That feeling\u2014the massive, impersonal system delivering his entire world back to him safely\u2014was the first urban plan he ever understood. It wasn't about trains; it was about connection.\n\n<br>\n\n2.\nIt was a guest lecture at Berkeley, around age 23. A retired, cynical city planner slammed a wrinkled map of bus routes onto the projector. \"This map isn't about lines,\" he growled, \"it's about time. The time a single mother loses with her kids because her transfer is a 20-minute wait.\" In that instant, the theoretical challenge became a moral one. The data points Julian studied suddenly had heartbeats. He knew then his work had to be for them, the people losing time.\n\n<br>\n\n3.\nHe knew he loved Anya during a date when he was 26. Instead of a fancy dinner, they bought sidewalk chalk. At dusk, they walked Valencia Street, playfully sketching where a new protected bike lane could go. Laughing, they designed a better city for two, just for an hour. It wasn't just that she understood his work; she wanted to build it with him, even in the most temporary ways. He saw their entire future in those fleeting chalk lines on the pavement.\n\n<br>\n\n4.\nLast winter, age 28, on a packed 14-Mission in the pouring rain. He watched a woman trying to corral two kids and three bags of groceries as the bus lurched. He saw the bone-deep exhaustion in her face, a mirror of his own mother\u2019s after a long day. He had been analyzing bus bunching data that morning, but this woman wasn't a statistic. She was the reason he fought through bureaucratic inertia every single day. The work became less abstract and far more urgent.\n\n<br>\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after a grueling week, he biked to the top of Twin Peaks. The fog suddenly broke, revealing the city in sharp, crystalline detail. He saw the spine of Market Street, the slow procession of cars on the bridge, the arteries he studies daily. From that height, his professional frustrations felt small and the mission felt vast and beautiful again. It was a god's-eye view that reminded him why this impossible, infuriating city was worth every ounce of his effort."
