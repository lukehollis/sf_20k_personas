Born in 1986, she was six when her parents, a disillusioned engineer and a literature professor, used their meager savings to immigrate to the United States after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. They landed in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, drawn by the established Russian community. Anna\u2019s childhood was a dual existence: speaking Russian within the walls of their cramped apartment and meticulously learning English to navigate school and translate for her parents, who struggled to find work befitting their credentials.\n\nWitnessing her family\u2019s profound stress\u2014the silent grief for a lost home and the constant anxiety of navigating a new, often indifferent system\u2014ignited a quiet but fierce determination in Anna. This personal experience became the bedrock of her professional calling. She worked her way through San Francisco State University for her bachelor's, then earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Her turning point came during an internship at a community clinic, where she counseled a newly arrived family from Ukraine. In their exhaustion and fear, she saw her own parents, and knew she had found her life\u2019s work.\n\nNow 38, Anna is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) specializing in intergenerational trauma and immigrant mental health. Her commute is nonexistent; she runs a private telehealth practice from a meticulously organized office carved out of a spare room in her Inner Richmond apartment, just blocks from where she grew up. Her days are structured around virtual sessions with clients, helping them build bridges between their pasts and their American futures.\n\nHer life is deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Mornings often start with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by coffee from a cafe on Clement Street. Her social circle is small and loyal, comprised mostly of other first-generation professionals and a few old friends from childhood. Though her parents have since moved to a quieter suburb, she visits them weekly. Anna\u2019s dream isn\u2019t fame or wealth, but to one day expand her practice into a small, community-focused wellness center for \u00e9migr\u00e9 families. She finds purpose in helping others map their own complex stories onto a hopeful future, a cartographer of the soul in the city that has always been her anchor."
