The only child of two university professors, she was raised in a world of books and discipline, her childhood set against the backdrop of China\u2019s rapid, often brutal, industrialization. She remembers the perpetual haze that clung to the city, the acrid smell of coal smoke, and the murky waters of the Huangpu River. This sensory memory, more than any lecture, ignited her lifelong passion for the environment.\n\nHer parents, valuing escape through education, pushed her to excel. Jingfei delivered, earning a spot at a prestigious university in Beijing. But her ambition stretched across the Pacific. She arrived in the U.S. in her early twenties, enrolling at UC Berkeley to pursue a graduate degree in Environmental Policy and Management. The Bay Area was a revelation\u2014the crisp, clean air, the protected shorelines, the pervasive ethos of conservation. It felt like breathing for the first time.\n\nJingfei\u2019s career began at a large downtown consulting firm where she worked tirelessly, her sharp mind and bicultural perspective making her invaluable on projects involving international supply chains. A key turning point came a decade ago after an amicable but draining divorce. Seeking autonomy, she left the corporate world to establish her own independent consultancy. Her commute vanished, replaced by a disciplined routine in the quiet sanctuary of her Inner Sunset home office, overlooking a small garden she meticulously tends.\n\nToday, Jingfei\u2019s life is one of measured intention. Her days start with strong tea and a review of environmental impact reports, her expertise sought by corporations aiming to navigate California\u2019s complex regulations. She lives alone but not in isolation, maintaining a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow consultants and neighbors met during her cherished afternoon walks through Golden Gate Park. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees the city as a living ecosystem she is helping to protect. Now, her dream isn't about wealth, but legacy: she hopes to dedicate her final working years to a major pro-bono project, perhaps restoring a piece of the Bay's wetlands, a tangible gift to the city that gave her a new world."
