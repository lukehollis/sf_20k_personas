Born and raised in a working-class Sacramento suburb, his future once seemed to point toward a modest business degree from a state college. That path was cut short when his father, a lifelong mechanic, suffered a debilitating back injury. At 20, Mark dropped out of school to help support his family, trading textbooks for tool belts and discovering an innate talent for fixing things that were broken.\n\nHe drifted to San Francisco in his late twenties, not for the dot-com gold rush, but for the anonymity and energy of a real city. He found his footing in building maintenance, a world that valued tangible skills over degrees. His reliability and quiet competence saw him rise through the ranks. Fifteen years ago, he accepted the position of Facilities Manager for a new residential complex, a job that came with a small but clean one-bedroom apartment on the third floor. His commute became a 30-second elevator ride.\n\nNow 49, Mark\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of his building. His days start before sunrise with a walkthrough, checking the boiler rooms and rooftop HVAC units. He knows the building\u2019s groans and sighs better than any of its transient tech-worker tenants. His social life consists of polite nods in the lobby, a shared joke with the barista at the corner caf\u00e9, and a weekly beer with a small circle of old friends. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, strained by the reality that he could never truly leave work.\n\nMark feels a deep, complicated connection to a San Francisco that most of his residents never see. He loves the city from the roof at dawn, watching the fog burn off the Bay Bridge. He feels a quiet pride in providing a seamless, functional home for others. His dream isn't grand; it\u2019s a small house on the coast, perhaps near Pacifica, with a garage workshop where he can restore old furniture\u2014a place where the only thing he has to fix is for himself."
