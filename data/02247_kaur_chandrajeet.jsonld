Her family immigrated to Yuba City, California, when she was six, trading their farm for a new life built on the promise of hard work and education for their children. Chandrajeet, a quiet and observant child, absorbed her parents' resilience, but secretly harbored a love for stories that felt a world away from their practical, agricultural community.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. She dreamed of a life of academia or writing, lost in poetry and prose. However, upon graduation, family obligations and the stark reality of needing a stable income steered her toward a more pragmatic path. She took a temporary administrative assistant job at a small investment firm in San Francisco. To her own surprise, she had a natural talent for organization and for managing the chaotic energies of ambitious finance professionals. She was the calm at the center of the storm.\n\nHer career developed steadily. She moved from firm to firm, climbing the ladder not through aggression, but through competence and reliability. She became an indispensable Office Manager, the unseen linchpin holding entire departments together. Along the way, she married Harpreet, a software engineer, and they raised their son, Rohan, in their cozy Inner Richmond apartment. The key turning point was the pandemic-era shift to remote work. Her 0.0-mile commute became permanent, profoundly reshaping her life.\n\nNow, at 53, Chandrajeet\u2019s days are woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her morning begins with a walk through Golden Gate Park, coffee from a local cafe in hand, before settling into her meticulously organized home office. She manages schedules and coordinates global meetings from the same apartment where she watched her son grow up. The distance from the frenetic downtown office has given her space to breathe.\n\nThis newfound quiet has reawakened her dormant dream. In the evenings, after the final emails are sent, she isn't watching TV. She\u2019s writing\u2014not the great novel she once imagined, but personal essays about her family\u2019s journey, the taste of her mother's cooking, and the subtle poetry of being the quiet observer in a loud world. Her aspiration is no longer fame, but to capture these stories for her son, a tangible link between the fields of Punjab and the fog of San Francisco."
