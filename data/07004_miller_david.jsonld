His childhood was stable, filled with books and encouragement to follow his intellect. He pursued this path to UC Davis, graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History, fascinated by the patterns of the past. However, the post-dot-com-bust economy of the early 2000s had little use for a history major. Practicality won out over passion. David, who had always been the family\u2019s designated computer fixer, took an entry-level help desk job to pay the bills.\n\nHe discovered an unexpected aptitude for the work. The logic of troubleshooting mirrored the analytical skills he\u2019d honed studying historical events, and he had a patient, calming demeanor with frustrated users. He methodically worked his way up the ladder, and in 2008, a promising offer lured him to a mid-size tech firm in San Francisco. He traded suburban quiet for the dense fog and vibrant energy of the city.\n\nNow a Technical Support Lead, David\u2019s biggest career shift came with the pandemic: his role became permanently remote. His 0.0-mile commute redefined his relationship with San Francisco. He's not a downtown warrior anymore; he is a hyper-local resident of the Inner Richmond. His world is a ten-block radius. His daily routine is a well-worn path: a morning coffee from the same corner cafe, a lunchtime walk through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park, and an evening spent managing his team of support agents via Slack and Zoom from his tidy one-bedroom apartment.\n\nA long-term relationship ended amicably a few years ago, leaving him comfortably single. His social life is small but consistent, consisting of a weekly D&D game with a few trusted friends and nodding acquaintances with other neighborhood regulars. David feels like a tenured resident, not a transplant, having watched the city\u2019s skyline and culture shift from his foggy perch. His primary aspiration isn't a career leap, but to finally save enough for a down payment on a small condo in his neighborhood. He dreams of starting a local history blog, a project that would finally connect the history major he was with the San Franciscan he has become."
