Born in Daly City to Filipino immigrants, his upbringing was steeped in the values of hard work and quiet sacrifice. His father, Jose, worked as a hotel porter, and his mother, Maria, as a nurse\u2019s aide. They spoke of opportunity not in terms of grand ambition, but of steady paychecks and a roof that didn\u2019t leak. Rohan absorbed this lesson completely.\n\nForegoing the financial burden of a four-year university, he enrolled in City College of San Francisco\u2019s night program, earning an Associate's in Business Administration while working as a maintenance assistant at a downtown law firm. He was fascinated by the building itself\u2014the intricate systems of HVAC, security, and power that were the firm\u2019s invisible lifeblood. While others climbed corporate ladders, Rohan learned the building\u2019s blueprints. His career developed not through networking events, but through sheer competence. He rose from assistant to coordinator, and finally, to Facilities Operations Manager for a large scientific consulting firm in SoMa.\n\nA key turning point was the passing of his father a decade ago. Suddenly, he was the undisputed anchor for his mother and his own growing family. This cemented his focus on stability over risk. He met his wife, Elena, a public school teacher, through a mutual friend, and they bonded over their shared, practical outlook on life. They bought a modest row house in the Outer Richmond, a neighborhood whose quiet, family-oriented nature suited them perfectly.\n\nToday, Rohan\u2019s routine is a steady rhythm. He catches the 5R bus for his 6.1-mile commute, a daily ritual of observing the city\u2019s pulse. At work, he is the calm center of operational storms, the man who knows which vendor to call when the server room\u2019s AC fails. He is respected not for flashy innovation, but for unwavering reliability. His evenings are for his wife and their teenage daughter, Isabella. His greatest aspiration is simple: to pay off their mortgage before he retires and ensure Isabella can attend the university he never did, unburdened by debt. For Rohan, San Francisco isn't a city of gold rushes or tech IPOs; it's the place where his parents' sacrifices took root, a community he helps keep running, one solved problem at a time."

Under the single, dim light, he was meticulously polishing his scuffed work shoes. The rhythmic brushing was the sound of dignity. It wasn't about pride, but about simple readiness for the next day's labor. In that quiet moment, Rohan understood that true strength wasn't in grand gestures, but in the unwavering care you put into your responsibilities. It became the blueprint for his own life. This was when he was fourteen.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, working nights as a maintenance assistant at the law firm during a major storm. The power flickered, and panicked attorneys spilled from their offices. But Rohan felt a strange calm. He was mesmerized by the emergency lighting kicking on and the hum of the backup systems. While everyone else saw a crisis, he saw an intricate, logical sequence. That night, studying the building's electrical plans, he knew he\u2019d rather be the one who kept the lights on than the one working under them.\n\n3.\nTen years ago, a week after his father's funeral, he was helping his mother sort through a small wooden box. He found Jose\u2019s old hotel porter ID, the photo faded and the plastic worn smooth at the edges. Holding it, the abstract weight of his new role as the family\u2019s anchor became real and tangible. It was no longer just about a steady paycheck; it was about honoring a lifetime of quiet sacrifice. He put the ID in his own wallet, a silent promise.\n\n4.\nOn their third date, the faucet in Elena's Sunset apartment started dripping relentlessly. Instead of being flustered, she handed him a wrench. For an hour, they worked together under the sink, laughing as they fumbled with the fittings. There were no flowers or fancy dinners, just the shared satisfaction of a problem solved. In that moment, seeing her practicality and easy competence, Rohan knew he\u2019d found his partner. Love, for them, would be built on a foundation that didn\u2019t leak. This was twenty years ago.\n\n5.\nHe remembers walking into their kitchen a few years back to see Isabella, then about 14, completely absorbed in a complex physics problem. She was focused, a pencil tucked behind her ear, the light catching her face. He saw not just his daughter, but the culmination of generations. His parents' sacrifices had built this stability. His steady work kept it secure. And now, at this very table, she was free to build a world of her own, unburdened. That quiet moment was his ultimate IPO."
