Her worldview, however, was most profoundly shaped by her *obaasan* (grandmother), whose stories of community resilience in the face of historical injustice instilled in Anya a deep sense of social responsibility. This foundation guided her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Sociology, intent on understanding the systems that both support and fail communities.\n\nHer turning point came during a college internship at a family shelter in Oakland. The gap between academic theory and the raw, urgent needs of people facing homelessness was jarring. It solidified her path, stripping away any romanticism about social change and replacing it with a quiet, fierce determination. After graduating, she sought a role at the heart of the crisis, taking a position as a Social Work Assistant in a supportive housing facility in San Francisco's SoMa district.\n\nAnya\u2019s life is uniquely intertwined with her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this, as she lives in a small, subsidized staff apartment within the same building she serves. Her days are a blur of case management, connecting residents to medical care, navigating bureaucratic red tape for benefits, and offering a steady presence amidst the daily chaos of addiction and mental health struggles. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of colleagues who understand the immense pressure, and cherished weekend trips back across the bridge to her family feel like coming up for air.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco isn't found in its scenic vistas or culinary scene, but in the unvarnished reality of its most vulnerable corners. She knows her neighborhood by its faces and its struggles. Anya dreams of a future where she can complete her Master of Social work (MSW) and become a licensed clinical social worker, better equipped to enact meaningful change. For now, however, she is anchored in the present, driven by the small, crucial victories: a successful housing application, a resident\u2019s first week of sobriety, a moment of shared trust. She is exactly where she needs to be."
