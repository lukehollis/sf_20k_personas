Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants who prized stability and the tangible success of engineering, Priya was a thoughtful, observant child. She watched her parents navigate a new country with resilient pragmatism, but she was always more drawn to the unspoken emotions simmering beneath the surface\u2014the anxieties, the cultural dislocations, and the quiet joys.\n\nHer undergraduate years at UC Davis were a slow awakening. A volunteer position at a student-run crisis hotline became her turning point. For the first time, she felt her innate empathy was not just a personality trait, but a tool. This realization created a gentle rift with her family, who couldn't understand why she would pursue a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley instead of a more lucrative degree. The defining moment came when her beloved grandmother, her *Nani*, faced a terminal illness. Priya witnessed firsthand the healthcare system's failure to address the family's cultural and emotional needs, solidifying her mission.\n\nNow, at 45, Priya is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, specializing in palliative care and grief counseling for a major San Francisco hospital. The pandemic shifted her practice entirely online, shrinking her commute to the few steps between her kitchen and her small home office. Her apartment in the Inner Sunset is her sanctuary, a meticulously organized space filled with books and plants, overlooking the foggy canopy of Golden Gate Park.\n\nHer days are a structured rhythm of intense emotional labor. She guides families through impossible decisions and holds space for profound grief, all through a secure video link. After her last session, she deliberately unplugs, often taking long, meditative walks through the park, her constant companion. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, composed mostly of other healthcare professionals who understand the unique toll of their work.\n\nThough content, Priya dreams of opening a small private practice focused on serving the South Asian community, offering culturally competent therapy she wishes her own family had. She finds her connection to San Francisco not in its bustling nightlife or tech-fueled ambition, but in its quiet corners\u2014the misty trails of the park, the diverse faces at the local farmers' market, and the profound human stories that unfold, one session at a time, within the walls of her home."
