The son of Iranian immigrants who settled in San Jose in the early 1980s, Kian grew up hearing stories of a vibrant Tehran left behind for the promise of stability in Silicon Valley. His father, an engineer, and mother, a homemaker, instilled in him a quiet diligence and an appreciation for functional, well-ordered systems. He pursued a practical bachelor's degree in Business Administration from San Francisco State University, assuming his path led toward corporate finance.\n\nThe turning point came during a senior-year internship with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Tasked with analyzing farebox recovery ratios, Kian became fascinated not by the spreadsheets, but by the human stories behind the data. He saw how a delayed bus could cause someone to lose their job, and how a new light rail line could connect an isolated community to opportunity. The abstract world of business suddenly felt hollow compared to the tangible impact of public transit. After graduation, he took an entry-level job at the agency and methodically worked his way up, migrating from the finance side to the strategic heart of planning.\n\nNow 41, Kian is a Senior Transit Planner. He lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley with his partner of six years, Lena, a UX designer. His 1.5-mile commute on the 21-Hayes bus is a daily field study; he observes passenger flow, stop accessibility, and the rhythm of the city with a planner\u2019s critical eye. His life is deeply woven into the fabric of San Francisco. He and Lena eschew car ownership, preferring to explore the city by Muni, bike, and foot, making them regulars at local cafes and the farmers' market at UN Plaza.\n\nKian dreams of a future San Francisco with a world-class, seamlessly integrated transit system. His current ambition is to play a key role in developing the next major infrastructure project, perhaps a new subway line. On a personal level, he and Lena are debating the quintessential SF dilemma: whether they can afford to raise a family in the city they love. For Kian, the professional and personal are intertwined; creating a more livable, accessible city isn\u2019t just his job, it\u2019s his hope for his own future."

He spoke of clean lines diving under bustling streets, a vision of orderly, shared progress. Kian saw not just a transit system, but a ghost of a city his parents loved. That evening, he understood that the lines on a map were lifelines. It planted a seed of fascination not with engineering itself, but with the civic promise it held.\n\n2.\nAt 21, during his SFMTA internship, he was riding the 14-Mission to verify stop locations. He overheard a woman on the phone, her voice cracking as she explained she was late for a job interview because the previous bus had broken down. In that moment, the sterile data on his spreadsheet\u2014headway times, vehicle reliability\u2014became devastatingly human. His career path pivoted right there, on a crowded bus on Mission Street, from finance to the tangible fortunes of people a delayed bus could alter.\n\n3.\nThe day the Geary Rapid Project\u2019s first phase launched was grey and drizzly, but Kian felt nothing but light. He was 34, a junior planner who\u2019d spent two years on the traffic modeling. Standing anonymously in the crowd at the ribbon-cutting, he watched the first red articulated bus glide into its dedicated lane, full of passengers. It was the first time he saw his meticulous work become steel, glass, and speed, moving people more efficiently through the city. The pride was quiet but immense, solidifying his purpose.\n\n4.\nOn their third date, he and Lena decided to ride the N-Judah all the way to Ocean Beach just to see where it ended. They bought hot chocolates and walked along the cold, foggy shoreline, their conversation flowing as easily as the train that brought them there. He realized then that their shared willingness to embrace the city on its own terms, without a car, was a form of intimacy. The city wasn't just a backdrop for their love story; the Muni was the vessel carrying it forward.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, sitting with Lena on a bench in Patricia\u2019s Green, he watched a family laughing as their toddler chased pigeons. Lena squeezed his hand, a silent question in her touch about their own future. Kian looked past them, watching the 21-Hayes bus pull up to its stop. The professional and personal collided with a sudden, aching clarity. His ambition to build a better transit system was no longer just a career goal; it was a desperate hope to build a city where his own family could one day stay."
