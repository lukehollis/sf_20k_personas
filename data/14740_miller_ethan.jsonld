Raised in Cupertino by his Korean immigrant mother and American stepfather, Ethan grew up surrounded by the relentless pressure of Silicon Valley. His father, a stoic software engineer, preached a gospel of tangible success through STEM, a path Ethan initially tried to follow. However, he was more attuned to the silent anxieties of his overachieving peers, the unspoken stress fractures forming under the weight of parental ambition. The turning point came in high school when a close friend suffered a severe mental health crisis, leaving Ethan feeling profoundly helpless. It was then he knew his path wasn't in coding, but in decoding the human mind.\n\nHis decision to pursue psychology at UC Davis, and later a PsyD, was met with quiet disapproval from his family, who saw it as an impractical, low-status profession. This gentle friction only solidified his resolve. After completing his residency, Ethan moved to San Francisco, drawn to its acceptance of diverse paths. He opened his private practice in Hayes Valley, strategically focusing on the very demographic he grew up with: adolescents and young adults navigating academic pressure, cultural identity, and family expectations. His empathy, rooted in experience, made him exceptionally effective.\n\nNow, at 39, Ethan\u2019s life is one of intentional calm. His 0.8-mile walk to the office is a daily ritual, a moving meditation through the tidy streets of his neighborhood. He knows the baristas at his local coffee shop by name and enjoys the anonymity of the city, a stark contrast to the insular suburbs of his childhood. His evenings are spent with his long-term partner, Chloe, a graphic designer whose creative energy balances his analytical nature. While financially secure, his dream isn't expansion, but deepening his impact through free workshops for local schools. He aspires to one day travel extensively through South Korea, not as an obligation to his heritage, but as a personal journey to connect with a part of himself he chose to understand on his own terms."

He couldn\u2019t offer code or an equation, only a hollow, aching silence. The helplessness he felt was a physical weight, a sudden, cold certainty that the problems he wanted to solve weren't on a motherboard. That single moment of powerlessness ignited a quiet, lifelong mission to understand the circuitry of the human heart, not the computer. It was the night psychology chose him.\n\n2.\nAt 19, he told his parents over a dinner of his mother\u2019s *galbi-jjim*. His stepfather simply placed his fork down, a gesture of final, logical dismissal. His mother, however, just looked at him with a deep, weary sadness and asked, \u201cBut how will you have a good life?\u201d Ethan didn\u2019t feel anger, but a profound sense of separation. In her question, he heard the fear that had driven her across an ocean. He knew then that his definition of a \u201cgood life\u201d would have to be his own.\n\n3.\nThe first time he walked the 0.8 miles to his new Hayes Valley office, the key felt cold and heavy in his hand. He passed a bakery, a bookstore, and strangers who didn't know his family or his past. Unlocking the door to the small, empty suite, he breathed in the smell of fresh paint. It was the first space that was entirely his, built not on expectation but on quiet rebellion. It wasn\u2019t the thrill of achievement he felt, but a deep, settling calm. He was, finally, home. This day occurred at 31.\n\n4.\nA 16-year-old boy, the son of a tech CEO, sat rigidly in the chair opposite him. For weeks, they spoke of everything but the truth. Then, one Thursday, the boy\u2019s shoulders slumped and he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m just so tired of trying to be him.\u201d In that moment of raw vulnerability, Ethan felt a powerful, resonant empathy. This was it. This was the conversation he couldn\u2019t have with his friend all those years ago. It reaffirmed every seemingly impractical choice he had ever made. This breakthrough happened just last year, at 38.\n\n5.\nHe remembers an evening with Chloe, two years ago. They were trying a new Korean restaurant in the Mission, and she was clumsily trying to pick up a piece of kimchi with her chopsticks, laughing at herself. There was no pressure, no performance of heritage, no test to pass. It wasn't his mother\u2019s carefully prepared food, freighted with expectation, but a shared, joyful discovery. In her easy laughter, he felt the last bit of tension about his identity dissolve. It could be this simple. It could just be his."
