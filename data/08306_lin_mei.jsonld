She arrived in San Francisco from Guangzhou with parents who poured their life savings into a modest Richmond District grocery store. Their sacrifice was her fuel. While they worked 16-hour days, Mei excelled in school, her quiet determination a stark contrast to the boisterous city around her.\n\nHer path seemed set when she pursued Computer Science at UC Berkeley, but she found the rigid logic of coding unfulfilling. It was a graduate degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Stanford that became her true calling, bridging the gap between cold technology and the people it was meant to serve. This unique expertise made her a natural fit for tech consulting. She rose swiftly through the ranks, navigating the chaos of the dot-com boom and surviving its bust with her reputation for incisive, people-first strategy intact. A key turning point was a difficult divorce in her late thirties; the painful separation solidified her independence and channeled her entire focus into her career, making her a formidable force in the industry.\n\nToday, Mei\u2019s life is one of curated discipline. Her commute is a few steps from her bedroom to a home office with a commanding view of the Bay. Her days are a marathon of high-stakes video calls, advising CEOs and untangling complex organizational knots for tech giants.\n\nEvenings are her own. She sheds the persona of Senior Consultant to walk the steep hills, finding solace in the city's historic architecture and the cool kiss of the fog. She has a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of industry veterans and a single artist she met at a local gallery. Her connection to San Francisco is layered; she feels a nostalgic pang for the grittier city of her youth but has also masterfully carved out a life in its modern, gilded incarnation.\n\nNearing her third act, Mei aspires to pivot. The relentless pursuit of corporate efficiency is losing its luster. She dreams of leveraging her capital and expertise to mentor a new generation of female founders or consult for non-profits, trading boardrooms for community impact. She wants to build something that lasts longer than a quarterly report."
