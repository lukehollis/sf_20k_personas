Born in Sarajevo in 1989, his early childhood was erased by the Bosnian War. His family fled as refugees, eventually settling in a small, tight-knit Bosnian community in St. Louis. Growing up, Amer straddled two worlds: the stoic, traumatized world of his parents, who worked tirelessly at cleaning jobs, and the alien landscape of American high school. He felt permanently out of sync, and his academic performance suffered. He scraped by, earning a GED, the weight of his unspoken history a constant, heavy companion.\n\nHis early twenties were marked by anger and a sense of displacement. A series of dead-end jobs left him feeling hollow until a court-mandated counseling session, stemming from a minor public disturbance, became an unexpected turning point. The counselor, a veteran, recognized the deep-seated trauma beneath Amer\u2019s rebellious exterior. For the first time, Amer felt seen. This experience ignited a profound desire to do for others what that counselor had done for him. He pursued certification as a Peer Support Specialist, realizing his greatest wound could be his most powerful tool.\n\nDrawn to its robust social services and diverse communities, Amer moved to San Francisco seven years ago. He found a job at a non-profit in Hayes Valley that assists refugee and immigrant youth. His modest apartment in the Inner Richmond is his sanctuary. His daily 3.5-mile bicycle commute is a non-negotiable ritual, a time to process the emotionally taxing stories he hears at work.\n\nAmer\u2019s social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few fellow Balkan immigrants and colleagues who understand the demands of their work. He keeps in close contact with his parents, their bond forged in survival. His dream is simple: to save enough to one day visit Sarajevo, not as a fleeing child, but as a man who understands his own story. For Amer, San Francisco isn't a final destination but a proving ground, a city where he uses the fragments of his broken past to help others piece together their own futures."

He just listened to Amer\u2019s rage. After a long silence, he said, \"Sounds like you\u2019ve been carrying a war inside you for a long time.\" The words cracked something open. For the first time, Amer didn't feel judged, but understood. The anger didn't vanish, but it finally had a name. That moment, in a sterile St. Louis office twelve years ago, was his true beginning.\n\n2.\nHe remembers his first week in San Francisco, taking the N-Judah all the way to Ocean Beach. He\u2019d expected the Golden Gate Bridge to move him, but it was this\u2014the vast, roaring expanse of the Pacific. As a child, water meant crossing a river in darkness, a border to escape. Here, the ocean wasn't an obstacle, but an endless horizon. Standing on the cold sand seven years ago, the scale of it didn't make him feel small; it made him feel that a new story was finally possible.\n\n3.\nFour years ago, he was at his friend Sasha\u2019s apartment in the Mission. They were drinking thick Bosnian coffee and eating burek Sasha's mother had sent. For a few hours, the familiar cadence of their language filled the small kitchen, drowning out the city noise. No one had to explain the sadness behind a joke or the history in a sigh. Looking at his friends, Amer realized home wasn't just a place he'd fled. It was a feeling he could build, even here, thousands of miles away, one cup of coffee at a time.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a ride home two years ago, after a young Afghan boy described his family\u2019s escape. Pushing his bike up an incline on JFK Drive, the wind biting his face, he focused on the burn in his thighs, the rhythm of his breathing. With each pedal stroke, he pushed the boy's inherited trauma, and his own, out through his feet. By the time he saw the fog creeping over the Presidio, he felt lighter\u2014not empty, but cleansed. The ride had become more than a commute; it was his therapy.\n\n5.\nThere was a Somali girl at the center last year who hadn't spoken for weeks. He found her staring out a window in Hayes Valley. He didn't ask questions. He just sat nearby and said, \"Sometimes, the quiet is the loudest place, you know?\" She looked at him, a flicker of recognition in her eyes, and finally whispered about the boat. In that shared silence that followed, Amer felt the jagged pieces of his own past click into place. He wasn't just healing himself; he was becoming a place of healing."
