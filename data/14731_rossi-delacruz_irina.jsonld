The daughter of a union stonemason and a seamstress, she was raised with a profound sense of community obligation and an awareness of the systems that could either support or fail a family. This sensibility guided her to a state university, where she earned a Bachelor's in Social Work, determined to be a part of the support system she saw so many people needed.\n\nIn her early twenties, she felt the pull of San Francisco\u2019s progressive idealism and moved west. She began her career as a caseworker in the Mission District, navigating the complex tapestry of need in the community. It was there she met Mateo delacruz, a passionate community artist and teacher. Their marriage was a partnership of shared values, and they hyphenated their names as a symbol of their equal union. Her career blossomed as she moved from front-line work into administration, recognizing she could effect greater change by shaping programs rather than managing individual cases.\n\nThe defining turning point of her life was Mateo\u2019s sudden death from cancer fifteen years ago. The loss hollowed her out but also solidified her life\u2019s purpose. She poured her grief and energy into her work, eventually becoming a Program Director for a city-wide agency focusing on youth wellness and educational support.\n\nToday, Irina lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond District. Her mornings begin with strong coffee and the N-Judah Muni line, a 5.8-mile journey that gives her time to read or simply watch the city wake up. Her days are a whirlwind of grant-writing, staff management, and advocating for funding. She finds solace in her small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow non-profit veterans\u2014and in tending to the collection of succulents that thrive on her foggy windowsill. Her hope is not for wealth or recognition, but to ensure the programs she\u2019s built are sustainable long after she retires. She dreams of one day mentoring young social workers and perhaps, finally, taking a long trip to the Italian villages her grandparents spoke of."

Murals screamed with color, and snippets of Spanish and English danced around her. It was nothing like Providence. In that chaotic, beautiful moment, she didn\u2019t feel like an outsider. She felt she had found the place her work\u2014and her heart\u2014was meant to be. It was the first time San Francisco truly felt like home. This occurred in her early twenties.\n\n2.\nHe was on a ladder, guiding a young girl\u2019s hand as she painted a brilliant yellow sun on a community center wall. Mateo didn\u2019t just teach art; he taught ownership and pride. Irina, there for a client meeting, watched him, captivated by the gentle authority in his voice and the genuine joy on his face. She saw her own belief in community empowerment made visible and beautiful. In that moment, she knew she was looking at her future. This happened a year after she moved to the city.\n\n3.\nThey were planning their simple city hall wedding over coffee. \u201cRossi-delacruz,\u201d Mateo said, testing the sound. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not becoming mine, and I\u2019m not becoming yours. We\u2019re becoming *ours*.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a grand gesture, but a simple statement of fact. For Irina, whose parents had such traditional roles, that hyphen became the foundation of their partnership\u2014a symbol of the equity and shared purpose she strived for in every part of her life. This memory is from just before their wedding, over two decades ago.\n\n4.\nThe Richmond apartment felt cavernous in the months after Mateo was gone. The quiet was a physical weight. One Saturday, aimlessly wandering, she found herself in a nursery and bought a small, tough-looking succulent. It was something to water, something that needed her just a little bit. Tending to that one small plant in the foggy window was the first act of care she performed that wasn\u2019t just for survival. It was the first step in rebuilding a life for one. This occurred fifteen years ago.\n\n5.\nLast fall, an email arrived from a young woman who had been in one of her first pilot programs a decade ago. It was a short note: she had just graduated from a state university with her own social work degree. Irina read it twice, the bureaucratic frustrations of her day melting away. She wasn\u2019t a caseworker anymore, but she could see the ripple effects of her work. This was why she endured the endless grant cycles. This was Mateo\u2019s legacy and hers, intertwined. This happened just last year."
