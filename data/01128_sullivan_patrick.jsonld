The son of an Irish-American union plumber and a Filipina-American caregiver, he grew up in the Excelsior District, a neighborhood of modest homes and diverse families. His upbringing was a tapestry of cultures, defined more by the street he lived on than any single ethnic identity. He saw the city from the ground up, keenly aware of the invisible lines that separated wealth and struggle.\n\nAfter high school, Patrick drifted. He had no interest in college, feeling disconnected from academic pursuits that seemed worlds away from his reality. He worked as a bike messenger, a barista, and a line cook, absorbing the city\u2019s rhythms. The turning point came at 22, when a close friend\u2019s family was evicted from their Mission apartment after a no-fault eviction. Seeing their lives upended by forces they couldn\u2019t control lit a fire in him. He began volunteering for a local tenants' rights group, initially just to help his friend, but soon found his purpose in the fight for community stability.\n\nHis education wasn't from a university, but from late-night strategy sessions in community centers and long days doing outreach. His street smarts and genuine empathy made him a natural organizer. He learned grant writing, program management, and conflict resolution on the job, earning the trust of community elders who saw his raw dedication.\n\nNow 32, Patrick is the Program Manager for a community development nonprofit. His \u201ccommute\u201d is a five-minute walk from his rent-controlled apartment to his office, a storefront space buzzing with local activity. His days are a mix of managing budgets, mentoring youth, and walking the neighborhood, checking in with small business owners and families he\u2019s assisted. His social life is inseparable from his work; his friends are fellow activists, artists, and educators dedicated to preserving the city's soul.\n\nPatrick's dream isn't wealth or recognition. He aspires to build lasting structures of community power\u2014housing co-ops, worker-owned businesses, and youth leadership programs that give residents agency. He hopes to help forge a San Francisco that has a place for the families like the one he grew up in, ensuring the city's heart continues to beat for everyone."
