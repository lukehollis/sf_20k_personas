He spent his youth watching the urban rhythm from behind the counter, observing how zoning laws, fickle parking regulations, and the path of a single bus route could dictate the fortunes of a small immigrant family. He saw his parents\u2019 quiet resilience and frustration with a city that felt both immense and arbitrary. These early observations planted the seed of a lifelong mission: to understand the systems that govern a city and make them work for people, not against them.\n\nThis drive led him to UC Berkeley for a Master of Urban Planning, where the Bay Area\u2019s complex tapestry of staggering wealth, entrenched neighborhood activism, and pressing housing crises became his academic playground. After graduating, he eagerly accepted an entry-level position as a City Planner I for the City of San Francisco. It felt like the perfect place to apply his ideals.\n\nNow 32, Kevin lives a life deeply integrated with his work. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice; he lives in a modern Hayes Valley apartment, a short walk from City Hall for the days he needs to be in-office. His neighborhood, reborn from the removal of a freeway, is a living case study he analyzes on his daily walks. He mentally catalogs the new parklets, debates the merits of a proposed building\u2019s facade, and drinks his morning coffee at Ritual while observing pedestrian flow.\n\nHis days are a mix of digital paperwork and navigating the human element of city planning\u2014poring over permits for Accessory Dwelling Units and listening to passionate community feedback. His social life is a small, tight circle of grad school friends and a weekly co-ed soccer game in Golden Gate Park that serves as a necessary escape from policy debates. Kevin\u2019s ultimate dream is not grand or abstract. He hopes to one day walk through a part of San Francisco\u2014a new affordable housing complex, a safer street crossing, a revitalized public plaza\u2014and know he had a hand in making it a reality. He wants to leave a quiet, tangible legacy of equity and thoughtful design on the city he now calls home."

Kevin watched his dad accept the ticket with a quiet nod, the fine representing hours of pressing collars and cuffs. That silent, resigned frustration lodged in his chest\u2014a feeling that the city was a machine with no heart, a machine he one day had to learn how to fix.\n\n2.\nHe was 24, sitting in a Wurster Hall lecture at Berkeley. The professor showed a slide: the Octavia Boulevard ramp replacing the torn-down Central Freeway. \u201cA scar being surgically transformed into a neighborhood,\u201d she said. For Kevin, it was an epiphany. A city could consciously choose to heal itself, to prioritize people over cars. In that moment, San Francisco ceased being an academic case study; it became a calling. He knew exactly where he needed to live and work.\n\n3.\nAge 27. His first public meeting for a minor density exception in the Sunset. He\u2019d prepared charts and zoning codes, ready to explain the logic. Instead, he faced a room of raw, angry fear about parking and shadows. One woman, clutching a photo of her house, called him a bureaucrat destroying her home. He left feeling naive and hollow, realizing that a planner\u2019s real work wasn't with maps, but with the tangled emotions of people who felt unheard.\n\n4.\nAge 30. It wasn\u2019t a plaza or a housing complex, just a crosswalk. But it was a high-visibility, painted-ladder design with a curb bulb-out near a Richmond district elementary school. He fought for it for months. The first time he saw a mother and child use it without having to dart between cars, a quiet, profound warmth spread through him. This was it. This was the work. An invisible act of care, written in paint on asphalt.\n\n5.\nLast summer, during a weekly soccer game near the Conservatory of Flowers, he mis-kicked a pass. The ball rolled toward another group, and a stranger in a bright pink beanie expertly trapped it and passed it back with a grin. For a moment, there were no permits, no zoning debates, no angry emails. There was just grass, the setting sun, and the easy, unspoken language of a shared space. It was a reminder of the goal: not just to build a city, but to enable these simple, joyful collisions."
