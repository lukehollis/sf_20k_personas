            "value": "Liam Douglas Zhang is a product of the Bay Area suburbs, though his heart has always been in the city. Raised in Fremont by first-generation Shanghainese immigrant parents\u2014an engineer father and a lab technician mother\u2014he was given a distinctly Western name to, as they put it, \u201cease his path.\u201d They envisioned a stable, lucrative career for him in Silicon Valley, a future he courteously sidestepped.\n\nFrom a young age, Liam was more interested in the systems that governed people than the systems inside a computer. While his parents discussed stock options, he devoured books on urban planning and political history. This led him to UC Davis, where he majored in Political Science with a minor in Urban Studies. The true turning point was a grueling but thrilling internship at the State Capitol in Sacramento. There, amidst the chaos of legislative sessions, he discovered a passion for the unglamorous, essential work of policy-making.\n\nUpon graduation, he leveraged that experience to land his current role: a Legislative Aide for a San Francisco City Supervisor. At 25, his life is defined by his work. He lives in a clean, minimalist studio in Hayes Valley, a strategic choice that places him a literal stone's throw from the golden dome of City Hall, making his commute a 0.0-mile walk. His days are a dense weave of policy briefings, constituent phone calls, and late nights drafting resolutions. The city's immense challenges are not abstract news headlines to him; they are the substance of his 10-hour days.\n\nSocially, his circle is small, mostly consisting of other politically-engaged colleagues he joins for happy hour drinks to decompress, and a few college friends scattered across the city. He finds little time for serious dating. Liam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intense and deeply pragmatic. He sees the city not just as a place to live, but as a complex organism he is trying to help heal. His dream isn\u2019t to be the one giving speeches at a podium; it's to be the indispensable expert in the backroom who crafts the housing or transit policy that actually makes a tangible difference in someone\u2019s life."
