The only child of Korean immigrants, she was raised in Oakland, where her parents ran a small, beloved dry-cleaning business. From behind the counter, she watched the city\u2019s pulse, observing how city services, from bus schedules to business permits, directly impacted her family\u2019s livelihood and their neighbors' lives. This planted the seed for a career in public service, a desire to fix the systems she saw as both essential and often flawed.\n\nShe attended UC Berkeley, choosing Public Policy as a way to turn her observations into action. Upon graduating, she resisted the lure of more lucrative private-sector jobs, instead taking an entry-level analyst position at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). For over two decades, she has been a constant presence within the agency, meticulously working her way up. Her career turning point was managing a key phase of the T-Third Street light rail expansion, a complex project that required navigating community concerns and bureaucratic hurdles. Seeing the trains finally run through neighborhoods she\u2019d spent years studying remains her proudest professional moment.\n\nMichelle\u2019s personal life has been quieter. A marriage in her early thirties to a tech entrepreneur ended amicably but underscored their different values; he wanted to disrupt the world, while she wanted to serve it. Now single, her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow civic employees and a book club she\u2019s been in for fifteen years.\n\nToday, Michelle lives in a tidy one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. Her day begins with a walk to her local cafe and a 1.5-mile commute on the 21-Hayes bus, where she instinctively notes passenger flow and on-time performance. Her evenings are for reading, neighborhood walks, and simple meals. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of glamour but of stewardship. Her ultimate aspiration isn\u2019t a higher salary but a Director-level position where she can shape policy more broadly. Michelle Park dreams of a future where Muni is so reliable and equitable that it becomes the unquestioned choice for every resident, a circulatory system for the city she has quietly dedicated her life to improving."

She was ten, sitting behind the counter in her parents\u2019 Oakland shop, when Mrs. Gable, their kindest regular, burst in late again, breathless. \u201cThe 57 bus\u2026\u201d she\u2019d sighed, defeated. Michelle felt a hot surge of frustration, not at Mrs. Gable, but at the bus. At the system. It was the first time she understood that a late schedule wasn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it was a crack in the foundation of someone\u2019s life. That feeling never left her.\n\n2.\nHer first day at the SFMTA, fresh from Berkeley in her early twenties, felt like stepping into a vast, humming machine. The office was a sea of beige cubicles and the coffee was terrible. Her friends were taking high-paying tech jobs, and for a moment, she felt a pang of doubt. Then, her new manager handed her a stack of rider complaint logs for the 38-Geary line. Reading them, she didn\u2019t see data points; she saw Mrs. Gable. She knew, with absolute certainty, she was in the right place.\n\n3.\nIt was a dinner party during her marriage, sometime in her late thirties. Her husband was explaining his new app, his friends celebrating disruption. \u201cYou have to break things to build something new,\u201d he\u2019d declared. Michelle looked into her wine glass and pictured a broken-down bus, a stranded senior, a delayed commute. She realized then that their love was real, but their worlds were incompatible. He wanted to break things; she was born to put them back together and make them run on time. It was a profoundly lonely clarity.\n\n4.\nShe stood on a corner in the Bayview at dawn, more than a decade into her SFMTA career. The air was cold and grey. After years of budget fights, community meetings, and endless Gantt charts, the first T-Third train finally glided into public service. It wasn't loud or flashy, just a smooth, quiet hum. She watched a woman with a stroller get on, followed by a man in a construction vest. It was the proudest moment of her life\u2014not an achievement for her, but a promise fulfilled for them.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on her morning ride on the 21-Hayes, the bus was running a few minutes behind. An elderly woman using a walker was slowly approaching the stop. The driver saw her, waited without a word, and knelt the bus when she finally reached the door. Nobody complained. In that small, silent act of civic grace, Michelle saw the system she\u2019d spent her life working for. It was a fleeting glimpse of the city she knew was possible, fueling her for the work that still remained."
