Born and raised in the Outer Sunset, she is the daughter of an SFFD firefighter and a part-time bookkeeper. Her childhood was steeped in the city\u2019s pre-tech boom culture: chilly beach bonfires at Ocean Beach, cheering at Kezar Stadium, and Sunday dinners with a sprawling Irish-American family. School was never her passion; she was more interested in people and the intricate, unspoken rules of the city than in textbooks. After graduating from Lincoln High School, she bypassed college, feeling the pull of immediate independence.\n\nShe spent her twenties in a blur of service industry jobs\u2014slinging espresso in the Haight, waiting tables at a beloved diner in the Richmond, and pouring beers at a dive bar in the Tenderloin. She saw the city transform around her, feeling a growing sense of displacement as the familiar landscape was replaced by glass towers and juice bars. The turning point came a month after her 30th birthday. Her father, retired for five years, passed away from a sudden heart attack. Staring at his city pension documents, Megan craved the stability and sense of purpose his career had provided. She wanted a job that was *part* of San Francisco, not just *in* it. She applied to Muni.\n\nNow, nine years later, Megan operates the 38R-Geary Rapid line. Her days start before dawn in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond, a few blocks from where she grew up. Her 2.1-mile commute on the 1-California bus is a quiet ritual before her own shift begins. From her driver's seat, she has a front-row view of the city she loves and resents. She knows the regulars by their stops, offers a firm but fair presence amidst the daily chaos, and feels a quiet pride in being a steady hand in a city of constant flux.\n\nSingle after a long-term relationship ended a few years ago, her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of fellow operators and childhood friends. Megan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t extravagant. She hopes to one day save enough for a down payment on a small condo, a tangible piece of the city that increasingly feels like it's slipping away from people like her. Until then, she remains a constant, a gatekeeper and guide, navigating the arteries of San Francisco, a city that is written in her bones."

The fog was a cold, wet wall, but he\u2019d built a roaring fire that spat sparks into the dark. He smelled of salt and smoke. She felt an immense pride watching his capable hands, the same ones that steered a fire engine, tame the flames. That night, she didn\u2019t just love him; she understood that he was a part of the city\u2019s core, a protector against the cold, a feeling she would chase forever.\n\n2.\nMr. Chen, who\u2019d ordered the same beef with broccoli every Tuesday at the Richmond diner where she waited tables, told her he was leaving. \u201cThey doubled the rent, Meg. Moving to Sacramento.\u201d She just nodded, refilling his water, but a hot, helpless anger coiled in her gut. It was the first time the city's changes felt like a personal theft, a friend being stolen from her. It cemented a defensive instinct in her, a quiet resolve to hang on no matter what. This happened when she was twenty-six.\n\n3.\nA month after the funeral, she sat at the kitchen table with his city pension documents. The paper felt crisp, official. It wasn\u2019t a huge sum, but it represented a lifetime of service and a tangible stability. Staring at the seal of the City and County of San Francisco, a profound clarity cut through her grief. She didn\u2019t want another transient job; she wanted what this paper represented. It was the moment she decided to apply to Muni, to become an anchor, not a raft, in the city that took her father.\n\n4.\nHer first solo run on the 38R. Her hands were slick with sweat on the massive steering wheel. Pulling out of the depot before sunrise, the empty bus felt like a giant, hollow beast. Then she made her first stop on Geary, and the doors hissed open to the familiar faces of the city waking up. A wave of profound calm washed over her. This wasn't just a bus; it was *her* bus. For the first time since her dad died, she felt powerful and essential.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a regular\u2014a tired-looking nurse she picked up at UCSF\u2014left a sealed envelope on the seat. Inside was a thank you card and a twenty-dollar bill. The note simply said, \u201cThanks for always being on time. You make my day easier.\u201d Megan drove the rest of her shift with a lump in her throat. The note, now tucked in her wallet, is a constant reminder that her quiet, steady work matters. It\u2019s a shield against the resentment she sometimes feels for the city she serves."
