Growing up in a working-class Fresno family, her childhood was defined by the persistent wheeze of her younger brother\u2019s asthma. She became an early expert in navigating insurance paperwork and decoding doctors' jargon, witnessing firsthand how a compassionate social worker could be the lifeline that kept her family from drowning in stress and medical debt. That experience planted a seed: she wouldn\u2019t just help; she would advocate.\n\nHer educational path was a straight line toward that goal. After finishing her undergraduate degree at UC Davis, she moved to San Francisco for her Master of Social Work at SF State, drawn to the city's complex tapestry of need and innovation. Her first job at a bustling city hospital was a baptism by fire, exposing her to the raw, unfiltered crises of urban life. The turning point was the pandemic, which shifted her entire team to remote work. Chloe, unexpectedly, thrived. The shift allowed her to focus more deeply on her caseload without the constant sensory overload of the hospital ward.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s world operates within the walls of her Inner Richmond apartment, her commute a zero-mile journey from her bed to her desk. Her days are a marathon of telehealth calls: arranging in-home care for an elderly patient, fighting with an insurance company over a denied claim, or providing a calm voice for a family reeling from a new diagnosis. The work is emotionally taxing, and the lines between her living room and her office are permanently blurred. To decompress, she relies on a strict routine: a sunset run through Golden Gate Park, just blocks away, to physically shake off the day's vicarious trauma.\n\nHer social life consists of a small, fierce circle of friends\u2014mostly nurses and non-profit workers\u2014who understand the language of burnout and compassion fatigue. While she dreams of one day finding a healthier work-life balance, perhaps even starting a small private practice focused on patient advocacy, her immediate hope is simpler: to continue making a tangible difference from her quiet corner of the city. For Chloe, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's the community she serves, one patient, one phone call, one small victory at a time."
