The daughter of Iranian immigrants who settled in Cupertino, she was raised in the shadow of Silicon Valley, where success was measured in stock options and engineering degrees. Her parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist, encouraged a practical path, hoping she would find stability in the predictable world of tech or medicine. Yasmin, however, spent her childhood lost in the intricacies of Persian miniatures in her father\u2019s art books and the bold, political murals she\u2019d see on family trips to San Francisco.\n\nHer quiet rebellion began at UC Berkeley, where she switched her major from communications to art history after a revelatory class on conceptual art. This decision was a significant turning point, creating a rift with her parents that took years to mend. It was her acceptance into the California College of the Arts (CCA) for an MFA in Curatorial Practice that finally convinced them of her dedication. Moving to San Francisco felt like coming home.\n\nNow, at 29, Yasmin is the Exhibitions Manager for a mid-sized contemporary arts non-profit in SoMa. Her $78,000 salary affords her a small but beloved one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District, a life sustained by careful budgeting and a passion for her work. Her day begins with a 2.3-mile bicycle ride down Folsom Street\u2019s bike lane, a journey that clears her head. At the gallery, she is the logistical backbone, coordinating everything from international art shipments to lighting design and artist installations.\n\nHer social life is woven into the city\u2019s art scene\u2014a tight-knit circle of fellow curators, artists, and designers met during her MFA program. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or quiet wine bars discussing theory and funding challenges. Yasmin is deeply connected to the Mission; she finds inspiration in the vibrant chaos of Clarion Alley and the community at Dolores Park.\n\nWhile she excels at the managerial aspects of her job, Yasmin dreams of having more creative control. Her ultimate aspiration is to become a senior curator, championing emerging Middle Eastern and North African diaspora artists whose stories, like her own family\u2019s, are often overlooked. She seeks not just a career, but a platform to shape cultural conversations, proving that the value of art is a currency her parents can now proudly understand."

The professor explained it was Felix Gonzalez-Torres\u2019s portrait of his partner, its weight diminishing as visitors took a piece, mirroring his decay from AIDS. It wasn't just art; it was grief, communion, and politics made tangible. In that moment, a switch flipped. She walked out of that lecture hall at 19 knowing she couldn't spend her life doing anything else. It was the moment she chose her own path.\n\n2.\nHer parents stood stiffly at her CCA graduate show. Yasmin braced for polite dismissal. But she watched her father, the engineer, walk around the installation she\u2019d curated, not just looking, but *examining*. He pointed to a complex video projection sync and asked, \"How did you solve the latency on this?\" It wasn't a question about art, but about logistics. In his own language, he was telling her he saw her work, her skill. The relief felt like a dam breaking inside her at age 26.\n\n3.\nThe first weekend after moving for her MFA, she walked into Clarion Alley alone. The riot of color and layered paint felt electric. It wasn't a museum; it was a living, breathing conversation on the walls, echoing the political art she\u2019d loved on childhood trips to the city. She ran her hand over a stenciled Farsi phrase and felt a profound sense of place, a collapsing of her past and present. At 24, she knew this city was where the threads of her life finally came together.\n\n4.\nShe can still feel the ghost of a massive, fragile glass sculpture in her hands. It was her first major installation as manager, a piece shipped from Berlin that seemed impossibly delicate. The artist was nervous, the clock was ticking. For twelve straight hours, she was pure logistics and calm command. The moment the final light hit the sculpture perfectly, the silent gallery felt cavernous and sacred. It was then, at 27, she knew she didn't just love art; she was exceptionally good at stewarding it into existence.\n\n5.\nIt was at a crowded opening in a tiny Dogpatch gallery about a year ago. Tucked in a corner was a small painting by an unknown Iranian-American artist. It depicted a Cupertino streetscape, but rendered in the complex, jewel-toned style of a Persian miniature. The fusion of her two worlds\u2014the tech suburbs and her ancestral art\u2014was so precise, so personal, it took her breath away. That night, her vague ambition sharpened into a concrete mission: she had to create a platform for these powerful stories to be told."
