The only child of pragmatic immigrants from Guangzhou, she was raised in a home where success was measured in stability and security. Her parents, who ran a small, beloved herbal shop in Chinatown, envisioned a future for her in medicine or law\u2014a path paved with tangible achievements. Mei, however, was a quiet observer, more fascinated by the stories etched on people's faces and the unspoken histories of the city's architecture than by textbooks on biology or torts.\n\nHer first act of quiet rebellion was choosing to study Cultural Anthropology at UC Berkeley for her graduate degree. It was a compromise she made with herself\u2014a field academic enough to please her parents on paper, but intellectually freeing enough to let her explore her true passion: the intersection of people, place, and expression. It was during her thesis research on displacement narratives in the Mission District that she found her calling. The raw, narrative power of contemporary art created by those communities spoke to her more profoundly than any academic text.\n\nThe key turning point came after a five-year stint as an assistant curator at a major downtown museum. Frustrated by the commercial pressures and institutional bureaucracy that often sidelined challenging, local voices, she resigned. Using a modest inheritance from her grandparents, she secured a down payment on a live/work loft in SoMa, declaring her independence.\n\nNow, at 45, Mei\u2019s life is her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from her sleeping mezzanine to her expansive ground-floor gallery and office space. Her days are a disciplined blend of grant writing, research, and studio visits with emerging Bay Area artists. Her social circle is small and fiercely loyal, comprised mostly of the artists she champions and a few old friends who remember the girl from the Sunset. She curates pop-up shows in her own space and other unconventional venues, focusing on art that grapples with gentrification, identity, and the city\u2019s shifting soul.\n\nHer deepest aspiration is to secure funding for a permanent, non-profit arts foundation\u2014an archive and exhibition space dedicated to preserving the works of underrepresented Bay Area artists. For Mei, this isn't about prestige; it's an act of cultural preservation, a way to ensure the true, complex story of her San Francisco survives."
