This perspective was seeded in her childhood in Yuba City, where she watched her Punjabi immigrant parents transform a small patch of land into a thriving almond orchard through relentless work. They instilled in her a deep sense of *seva*, or selfless service, and a powerful work ethic. While they saw success in the soil, Harpreet saw her future in the systems that governed people's lives.\n\nHer path was solidified in her teens when her younger brother, bright but restless, fell in with the wrong crowd. Harpreet witnessed firsthand how a lack of community programs and positive outlets could derail a young life. It was then she decided she wouldn\u2019t just help individuals; she would help build the infrastructure that helps everyone. This drove her to earn a Master of Public Administration, focusing on urban policy and nonprofit management.\n\nStarting as a junior analyst for the city, Harpreet\u2019s sharp mind and genuine empathy saw her rise steadily. She wasn\u2019t a flashy politician but a pragmatic implementer, known for her ability to listen to community leaders and translate their needs into actionable policy. Her key turning point was spearheading the \"Legacy Business Preservation Fund,\" a project that saved dozens of beloved neighborhood businesses from closure, a victory she considers more valuable than any promotion.\n\nNow, at 45, her life is a study in focused intention. She lives in a modest but sunny apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrancy and resilience she fights to protect daily. Her 1.9-mile commute on the 14 Mission bus is her time to observe the city she serves. Divorced a decade ago from a partner who didn\u2019t share her commitment to public service, she finds fulfillment in a close circle of friends and a deep connection with her niece. Her dream is not just to become Director, but to pioneer a nationally recognized model for equitable urban development, ensuring that the soul of San Francisco\u2014its diverse, vibrant communities\u2014can thrive for generations to come."

He cradled a fragile almond sapling, his hands calloused and gentle. \"One tree is just wood,\" he said in Punjabi. \"But with water and patience, they become an orchard.\" In that moment, feeling the dry soil, she understood that her purpose wasn't just to help one person, but to cultivate the entire system. That sense of patient, thankless work, rooted in the earth, became the foundation of her character.\n\n2.\nShe was sixteen when she found her younger brother\u2019s sketchbook hidden under his bed. He once filled pages with intricate drawings, but now they were just angry slashes and empty space. The creative fire she admired had found no fuel, no outlet, and had simply gone out. A cold, heavy dread settled in her chest, hardening into resolve. It wasn't just his failure, but a community's. She wouldn\u2019t just rescue individuals; she would build the infrastructure that prevented them from getting lost.\n\n3.\nThe argument that ended her marriage wasn't loud, but quiet and final. \"You love this city more than you love me,\" he said, his voice flat. Standing in the doorway of their apartment, the city lights behind him, Harpreet felt a profound, sorrowful clarity. He wasn't wrong. She couldn't apologize for a commitment that was as essential to her as breathing. It was the moment she accepted that her path, though vital, might be one she walked alone, and she was finally at peace with it.\n\n4.\nA week after the Legacy Business Preservation Fund grants were announced, the owner of a small Mission District *panaderia* pressed a warm pastry box into her hands. The elderly woman\u2019s eyes welled with tears. \"You saved my family,\" she whispered. In the weight of that box and the smell of cinnamon, Harpreet felt a wave of overwhelming humility. This was the data that mattered. It was a victory more tangible and validating than any promotion she would ever receive, reaffirming her entire career.\n\n5.\nLast spring, she took her niece to a new arts center in Bayview that her department helped fund. She watched the girl\u2014her brother's daughter\u2014paint a brilliant yellow sun on a community mural. In her focused expression, Harpreet saw the same creative spark her brother once had, but this time, it was protected and celebrated. It felt like closing a wound in her own family history through her public work. This was the point: building a city where every child\u2019s light had a place to shine."
