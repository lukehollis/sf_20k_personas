Born and raised in Richmond, Sarah is a fourth-generation Japanese-American whose family history is steeped in the agricultural toil of the Central Valley. Her parents, a mechanic and a bookkeeper, preached the gospel of a steady paycheck over academic accolades. Sarah listened. School felt like a cage, so after a single, disillusioning semester at community college, she dove headfirst into the workforce.\n\nHer career began at 19, seating guests at a bustling chain restaurant. She wasn't just good at it; she was a natural. While others saw chaos, Sarah saw a complex dance of timing and temperament. She thrived, quickly climbing the rungs from hostess to server, then bartender to shift supervisor. Her real turning point came when a respected restaurateur, impressed by her grit and intuitive grasp of hospitality, offered her the manager position at his new venture, Marrow. It was the break she had earned through a decade of long nights and double shifts.\n\nSarah\u2019s personal life is woven into the fabric of her professional one. Her commute is nonexistent, as she lives in a small apartment directly above the restaurant\u2014a blessing for convenience, a curse for work-life balance. Most of her friends are current or former colleagues, and a past long-term relationship with a chef combusted under the pressure of sharing the same relentless workspace.\n\nNow 35, Sarah moves through her days with a practiced calm, orchestrating staff schedules, placating demanding patrons, and negotiating with vendors. Hayes Valley is her entire world; she knows the local bodega owner by name and gets her morning coffee from the barista who knows her order by heart. Her dream isn't fame or fortune, but ownership. She yearns to have her own name on the lease of a small, perfect restaurant, a place built not on a business degree, but on a lifetime of understanding what makes people feel welcomed and fed. It\u2019s a quiet, fierce ambition that fuels her through each demanding service, one step at a time."
