His upbringing in the San Fernando Valley was filled with both Hanukkah celebrations and his mother\u2019s attempts at making kimchi, creating a unique foundation for a life of quiet observation.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's degree in History, fascinated by the narratives of the past, but found himself drawn not to academia but to the practical, story-driven world of insurance. He began his career as a claims adjuster in L.A., finding a strange satisfaction in piecing together the narrative of an accident from police reports and witness statements. A promotion twenty years ago brought him to San Francisco, a city whose dense, foggy character felt more aligned with his own introspective nature.\n\nDavid\u2019s key turning point was a quiet one. His amicable divorce a decade ago, born from a gradual drifting apart rather than a singular conflict, left him with a profound sense of solitude. He never remarried, channeling his energy into his work and a few cherished friendships cultivated over a weekly poker game. The recent shift to permanent remote work has further shrunk his world into the few blocks of his Inner Richmond neighborhood.\n\nHis daily routine is methodical. A morning walk through the fog-laced Presidio, coffee in hand, followed by hours at his desk in a bay window overlooking Geary Boulevard. He processes claims\u2014a burst pipe in a Pacific Heights mansion, a fender bender on a steep Nob Hill street\u2014seeing the city through the lens of its everyday misfortunes. He knows the anatomy of urban life not by its triumphs, but by its small, insured disasters.\n\nHe loves his neighborhood for its unpretentious stability and its proximity to Golden Gate Park. At 53, David isn't aspiring to climb a corporate ladder. Instead, a new dream has taken root: a trip to South Korea. He has no desire to find his birth family, but rather to walk the streets of his birthplace, to connect with a history that is his yet remains completely unknown. For now, he remains a quiet steward of the city\u2019s mundane recoveries, a man who understands San Francisco one claim at a time."
