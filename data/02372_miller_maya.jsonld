Raised in the Sierra Nevada foothills by a botanist father and a sculptor mother, her childhood was a fusion of empirical science and expressive art. She spent her youth identifying native flora on hikes and helping her mother weld abstract forms from scrap metal. This unique upbringing instilled in her a belief that nature is the ultimate artistic medium.\n\nHer educational journey formalized this dual passion. After completing an undergraduate degree in Environmental Design, she pursued a Master of Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley, where she focused on ecological art and sustainable urbanism. Upon graduating, she accepted a lucrative but creatively stifling job at a large corporate firm, designing sterile, water-guzzling campuses for tech giants in Silicon Valley. The turning point came after three years, when she realized her work was actively contradicting her core values. She quit without a new job, a terrifying and liberating act that set her on her current path.\n\nToday, Maya runs a solo practice from her bright, airy live-work studio in Bernal Heights. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a seamless transition from life to work. She has carved a niche for herself as a landscape architect who treats each project as an art installation. Her clients\u2014galleries, private collectors, and progressive non-profits\u2014seek her out to create \"living sculptures\" and thoughtful urban oases. Her days begin with a walk up Bernal Hill, sketching ideas as the fog burns off the city, followed by hours of focused design work. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of other artists, architects, and writers, often gathering for potlucks in her small but meticulously designed backyard garden.\n\nMaya feels deeply connected to San Francisco's spirit of reinvention. Her past informs her present, but her gaze is fixed on the future. She dreams of securing a commission to transform a neglected public space\u2014a forgotten alleyway or an abandoned lot\u2014into a landmark piece of ecological art, a permanent gift to the city that allowed her to finally synthesize the two halves of her soul."
