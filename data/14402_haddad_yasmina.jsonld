The daughter of Lebanese immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, she grew up surrounded by the intricate web of a tight-knit community. Her father, a meticulous auto mechanic, and her mother, the unofficial heart of their social circle, taught her the value of both precision and empathy. She watched her parents navigate the delicate balance of preserving their heritage while embracing a new American identity, an early lesson in organizational culture.\n\nDrawn to understanding what motivated people, she pursued psychology at UC Berkeley. However, she found clinical work too focused on the individual. It was during a graduate program in Industrial-Organizational Psychology at SFSU that she found her calling: fixing the workplace itself. She saw corporate structures as living organisms, often suffering from poor communication and misaligned values. After a few years at a large consulting firm where she felt her methods were stifled, Yasmina took a calculated risk and launched her own boutique consultancy.\n\nThe turning point was a client, the CEO of a rapidly scaling tech company on the brink of cultural collapse. Over six months, Yasmina didn't just tweak policies; she re-engineered the company's leadership dynamics, teaching executives how to listen and lead with vulnerability. Witnessing that tangible, positive transformation solidified her purpose.\n\nNow 39, Yasmina lives a life of intentional design in a minimalist Nob Hill apartment with sweeping views of the bay. Her 1.2-mile walk to her FiDi office is a non-negotiable daily ritual. It\u2019s her time to observe the city\u2019s rhythm, a mental reset before diving into the high-stakes emotional labor of coaching C-suite clients. Her social life is small but deep, centered around a handful of trusted friends who value her for her warmth, not her professional acumen.\n\nYasmina feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s spirit of ambitious reinvention. Her dream is to distill her philosophy into a book on compassionate leadership, making her methods accessible beyond the exclusive world of executive coaching. She aspires not just to build a successful career, but to fundamentally prove that empathy isn't a soft skill\u2014it's the most powerful strategic asset of all."

Her father\u2019s hands, usually rough, moved with a surgeon\u2019s grace over a neighbor\u2019s sputtering engine. He wasn\u2019t just replacing parts; he was listening to the machine, understanding its broken inner relationships. The moment the engine purred back to life, a wave of awe washed over her. It was the first time she understood that complex systems weren't problems to be feared, but puzzles to be solved with care and empathy for how the parts work together.\n\n2.\nAt 23, in a quiet corner of the SFSU library, everything clicked. It was a case study about a company collapsing not from market forces, but from internal toxicity. The CEO\u2019s memos, the employee surveys\u2014it read like a dysfunctional family history. A jolt of clarity struck her, far more potent than any clinical diagnosis. She wasn\u2019t meant to fix one person at a time; she was meant to fix the entire organism. That night, she stopped mourning a career in clinical work and started building her future in organizational healing.\n\n3.\nShe was 29, staring at a spreadsheet at 10 PM in a sterile consulting office. The metrics were meant to quantify \"employee engagement,\" but they felt utterly soulless\u2014numbers divorced from the people they represented. A wave of profound alienation hit her. This wasn't fixing things; it was applying a corporate band-aid while ignoring the wound. That night, the simmering frustration hardened into resolve. She went home, sketched out a business plan on a napkin, and resigned the following week. It was the moment she chose her purpose over a paycheck.\n\n4.\nYasmina will never forget the silence that followed. She was 34, four months into her riskiest client engagement. The two VPs, who had been sabotaging each other for a year, had just finished a tense, vulnerable conversation she\u2019d facilitated. Then, one simply said, \"I didn't realize.\" It wasn't an apology, but it was an opening. In that instant, she felt the company's entire emotional architecture shift. It was the deepest professional satisfaction she had ever known, a feeling that cemented her purpose more than any contract ever could.\n\n5.\nOn a walk to her FiDi office last winter, the fog was so thick she couldn't see the top of the Salesforce Tower. The city felt hushed, intimate. As a cable car bell cut through the quiet, a feeling of profound rightness settled in her bones. This daily journey wasn't a commute, but an immersion\u2014a reminder that she was part of this ambitious, ever-changing system. In that quiet moment of belonging, the first chapter of her future book started writing itself in her head, clear and urgent."
