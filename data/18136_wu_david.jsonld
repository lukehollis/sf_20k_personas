Born and raised in the Sunset District to parents who emigrated from Hong Kong in the 1970s, his childhood was steeped in the rhythms of their small grocery store on Taraval Street. While his parents preached the value of hard work, their focus was on the family business, not academic accolades. David was a bright but restless student, more interested in taking apart a broken VCR than in conjugating verbs. He graduated from high school with a general diploma and little desire for college.\n\nHis turning point came in the mid-90s. While working a dead-end delivery job, he landed a position in the mailroom of a fledgling tech startup. It was the dawn of the dot-com boom, and the energy was infectious. David found himself drawn to the server room, a place of blinking lights and methodical order. He started helping the lone, overworked IT guy, learning everything he could by reading manuals and staying late. He had a natural talent for diagnosing problems and building systems.\n\nAs the dot-com gold rush exploded, David\u2019s practical, self-taught skills were more valuable than a degree. He built his career not in lecture halls, but in the server rooms of a half-dozen startups, each move bringing more responsibility and a better salary. He became an expert in infrastructure and operations, the quiet professional who kept the digital dream alive.\n\nNow at 50, David\u2019s life has found a comfortable equilibrium. He\u2019s an IT Operations Manager for a stable management firm, a role that values his experience over his credentials. He drives his sedan 6.5 miles from his renovated Sunset home, not far from where he grew up, to his SoMa office. He met his wife, Mei, an accountant, two decades ago, and their pride is their daughter, now studying at UC Davis. David\u2019s ambition is no longer for himself, but for her. His dream is to see her succeed and to one day retire, trading network diagrams for tinkering with vintage audio equipment in his garage. He is a bedrock resident, a man who built a successful life in the new San Francisco without ever forgetting the old one."

He watched his father\u2019s hands, calloused and quick, tallying receipts. It wasn\u2019t a sad memory, but one of profound order and quiet industry. It occurred in the early 1980s, teaching him that real work was something you could see and touch, a lesson that grounded him long after the store was gone.\n\n2.\nThe mailroom was chaos, but the server room was a sanctuary. Late one night in 1996, the overworked IT guy finally let him in. The controlled chill, the hypnotic hum of the fans, the precise blinking green lights\u2014it was a revelation. While the sales team shouted about IPOs outside, this room felt like the company\u2019s real heart, methodical and cool. In that moment, he knew he didn't belong with the mail cart; he belonged here, with the machines that made it all possible.\n\n3.\nIt was 3 AM in 1999, and the entire e-commerce site was down. The CEO, a kid fresh out of Stanford, was pale with panic. David, running on coffee and pure adrenaline, just methodically worked the problem. He remembers finding the single corrupted line on the load balancer's config file. The moment the system rebooted and the lights turned from red to green felt more victorious than any diploma. He wasn't just the IT guy anymore; he was the one who kept the digital dream alive.\n\n4.\nHe remembers holding his daughter for the first time at the hospital, almost two decades ago. All the frantic energy of server migrations and uptime percentages simply vanished. She was so small, her fist curled around his pinky finger. He looked at his wife, Mei, exhausted but beaming, and understood his purpose had fundamentally shifted. The climb wasn't for a bigger title anymore. It was to build a stable foundation for this tiny new life. His ambition had found its true north.\n\n5.\nLast year, driving his daughter to SFO for her first year at Davis, they took the 19th Avenue exit. He glanced toward Taraval Street, imagining the ghost of the old grocery store. He had built a life on circuits and fiber so she could build hers on books and lectures. The drive to her future was so much longer than his 6.5-mile commute. In that moment, watching her walk toward the terminal, he felt a quiet, profound sense of success. He wasn't reaching for anything more."
