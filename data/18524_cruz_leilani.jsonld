Growing up, her home was a mix of loud family gatherings overflowing with lumpia and quiet evenings watching her father meticulously restore classic cars. Her mother, a registered nurse, was the family\u2019s anchor, embodying a blend of compassion and resilience that Leilani deeply admired.\n\nHer path was set not in a classroom, but in the sterile, confusing hallways of a hospital during her mother\u2019s prolonged illness in Leilani\u2019s early twenties. While grappling with her mother\u2019s prognosis, Leilani was infuriated by the system itself: misplaced charts, redundant tests, and poor communication between departments. She saw how data, when mismanaged, could cause as much harm as a medical error.\n\nThis experience rerouted her from a potential nursing track to Health Informatics. She pursued her graduate degree at UCSF with a ferocious sense of purpose. She wasn't just studying data; she was building armor for other families. Leilani excelled, driven by a mission to untangle the digital knots that ensnared patients like her mother. After a decade of rising through the ranks as a systems analyst, she now manages the clinical informatics team for a large university health network, focusing on improving data flow between educational programs and patient care services.\n\nNow 44, Leilani lives a life of structured intention in the Inner Sunset. Her commute is a predictable ride on the N-Judah MUNI line, a moment of quiet reflection before a day of complex problem-solving. Evenings often involve a run through Golden Gate Park to decompress. Her social life is a curated circle of close friends, a mix from grad school and former colleagues. Following a difficult breakup five years ago, she has prioritized her career and personal peace, though she remains close to her now-retired father.\n\nLeilani\u2019s connection to San Francisco is professional and deeply personal. She sees the city not through its landmarks, but through its health data. Her aspiration is to mentor more women of color into her field and to build systems that are as compassionate as the caregivers they support\u2014a quiet, powerful legacy honoring the woman who inspired it all."

            "value": "1.\nAge 10, in her father\u2019s Daly City garage. The scent of motor oil and steel mixed with the aroma of her mother\u2019s adobo simmering in the kitchen. Her father\u2019s grease-stained hands patiently guided hers, showing her how a clean spark plug could bring an engine back to life. From the house, she could hear the boisterous laughter of her titas. That blend of meticulous mechanics and warm, chaotic family life taught her that complex systems, whether mechanical or human, could be understood, fixed, and made whole again.\n\n2.\nEarly 20s, in a hospital corridor outside her mother\u2019s room. She watched a kind but overwhelmed nurse frantically search for a misplaced lab result. In that moment, Leilani\u2019s grief morphed into a cold, clear anger\u2014not at the nurse, but at the broken, invisible system that caused such casual chaos. The frustration was a catalyst, hardening into a quiet vow. She wouldn\u2019t just fight for her mother; she would spend her life untangling the informational knots that ensnared families just like hers.\n\n3.\nMid-30s, in the clinical wing. Months after launching a new data-sharing protocol, she watched a medical resident pull up a new patient's entire history from an outside clinic with two clicks. The resident, unaware of Leilani\u2019s presence, simply nodded at the screen and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a first.\u201d For Leilani, that quiet, anonymous moment of efficiency was a profound victory. It was proof that her work was building the armor she had once so desperately wished her own family had.\n\n4.\nAge 39, the first run after her breakup. The damp fog of Golden Gate Park felt heavy, muffling the city sounds as she pushed herself up the hill near the de Young. The burn in her lungs felt real, a physical sensation that crowded out the ache in her chest. Reaching the top, breathless and alone, she didn\u2019t feel lonely, but sovereign. It was a silent declaration that her peace resided within her own disciplined care, not in anyone else\u2019s hands.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a mentorship call. A young Filipina intern nervously presented a new data workflow she\u2019d designed. As the woman spoke, Leilani saw past the technical details to the fierce compassion driving her\u2014the same protective instinct she remembered in her mother. A wave of profound pride washed over her. This was the real work: not just fixing code, but building a legacy of care by empowering the next generation of women to do the same."
