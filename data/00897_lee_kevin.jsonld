The only children of Taiwanese immigrants who valued inquiry over accreditation, Kevin grew up believing the world was the ultimate textbook. He devoured histories, biographies, and scientific journals, discussing them with the store\u2019s eclectic patrons. While his peers pursued college degrees, Kevin chose to learn from the city itself, working as a bike messenger, a barista in North Beach, and a gallery assistant in the Mission. These were his practical seminars in urban sociology, economics, and art.\n\nHis turning point came at 28 when, directionless but endlessly curious, he began volunteering at a museum dedicated to San Francisco history. His lack of a formal degree was irrelevant; his encyclopedic, self-taught knowledge of the city\u2019s forgotten corners and characters was invaluable. He could connect a 19th-century photograph to the modern street corner or explain the cultural impact of a Gold Rush-era artifact with a passion that resonated with visitors. He was hired part-time, then full-time, slowly crafting a unique role for himself as a museum educator.\n\nNow 51, Kevin is a cherished institution within his institution. His life is a testament to quiet devotion. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley, a mere three blocks from the museum, making his commute a short, meditative walk. He shares his life with his partner of fifteen years, an archivist named Clara, with whom he enjoys quiet evenings reading and debating local history. Their social life revolves around a small circle of academics, artists, and fellow \"keepers of the city's memory.\"\n\nKevin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees himself not just as a resident but as a steward of its narrative. His greatest fear is that the city\u2019s soul is being overwritten by waves of fleeting tech culture. His dream is to curate a major exhibit on the everyday lives of San Francisco's 20th-century working class, giving voice to the people who built the city but are often left out of official histories. He doesn't seek accolades, only to ensure the stories he guards continue to be told."
