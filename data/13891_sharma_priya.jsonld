Born in Pune, India, she immigrated with her family to Daly City at age eight. Her parents, a mechanic and a seamstress, instilled in her a formidable work ethic, dreaming she would achieve the stability they never had. Priya dutifully enrolled in Business Administration at San Francisco State University, but her path diverged when her father suffered a debilitating heart attack in her sophomore year. Prioritizing family, she dropped out to work full-time, shelving her own aspirations.\n\nHer entry into real estate was a fluke\u2014an administrative assistant role at a small brokerage. But Priya discovered a world that clicked. She had an innate knack for sales and an empathy that allowed her to truly understand a client's desires. She earned her license at 24 and spent the next decade navigating the volatile dot-com boom and bust, learning to thrive in chaos. The 2008 crash nearly wiped her out, but it was also her defining moment. While others fled, she doubled down, building a reputation for integrity and tenacity. This grit propelled her to become a Principal Agent, now leading her own successful team.\n\nPriya\u2019s personal life bears the scars of her ambition. A decade-long marriage to a software engineer ended amicably, a casualty of two demanding careers and diverging paths. Now an empty-nester with her son studying at UCLA, her life has found a new rhythm. She resides not in the city she sells, but across the Golden Gate in a serene Mill Valley home. Her 22-mile commute in her Mercedes is a cherished ritual\u2014a time to decompress with podcasts before plunging into the city's frenzy.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees herself as a gatekeeper to people's dreams, whether it's a tech founder\u2019s SoMa loft or a family\u2019s first home in the Sunset. Having sacrificed her own formal education, Priya\u2019s quiet dream is to create a mentorship program for young, first-generation women entering the industry, ensuring they have the support she never did. She\u2019s built a life of success, and now finds her greatest aspiration is to help others build theirs."

Her father\u2019s heart attack felt like a tectonic shift, cracking the foundation of her carefully planned life. She looked at her worn SFSU textbook, the words blurring. In that moment, holding her mother\u2019s trembling hand, she made an unspoken promise. Dropping out wasn't a failure, but a pivot toward duty. It was the first time she truly understood that resilience meant sacrificing your own path for the one your family needed.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe keys felt impossibly light in her hand. It was her first solo deal, a small starter condo in the Sunset for a young immigrant couple from Vietnam. As she handed them over, the wife began to cry, and Priya saw her own parents in their exhausted, hopeful faces. The commission check felt irrelevant. That feeling\u2014the profound privilege of being the gatekeeper to a family\u2019s first real home in America\u2014was the anchor that would hold her steady through every market boom and bust that followed. It defined her entire professional ethos.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was October 2008. The phones in the office were silent, the mood funereal. Her own savings were hemorrhaging. One afternoon, watching a rival agent pack up his desk for good, Priya felt a cold dread followed by a hot surge of defiance. While others saw a collapsing market, she saw people losing their homes\u2014a crisis of dreams. That day, she chose grit over fear, staying late to cold-call banks about short sales. It was the moment she stopped being a salesperson and became a fighter for her clients.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was the first drive home to Mill Valley after her husband had moved out. Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, the breathtaking view felt achingly lonely. The passenger seat was empty, the quiet in the car immense. She turned on a business podcast, just to fill the space. But as the familiar voice filled the cabin, she felt a shift. This commute wasn\u2019t just a drive; it was her time. It was the twenty-two miles where she could decompress, strategize, and just be Priya again. It became her cherished, daily ritual of renewal.\n\n***\n\n5.\nStanding on her front porch, she watched her son\u2019s car turn the corner, heading south for UCLA. The finality of it was a punch to the gut. The house behind her, usually buzzing with his energy, was suddenly cavernous and silent. For a week, the quiet felt like a loss. Then, it slowly began to feel like an opportunity. This new space in her life wasn't an emptiness to be filled, but a foundation on which to build her next chapter\u2014the one where she helps other young women build their own lives."
