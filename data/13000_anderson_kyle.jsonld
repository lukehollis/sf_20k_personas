Raised in Antioch, he was the son of a second-generation mechanic who could diagnose a bad alternator by sound alone. Kyle spent his youth under the hoods of late-model Fords and Hondas, his hands perpetually stained with grease, finding a deep satisfaction in the tangible click of a socket wrench and the roar of a resurrected engine. This path seemed preordained, so he enrolled in an automotive technology program at a community college, ready to take over the family business.\n\nBut the world was changing faster than the curriculum. The theory he was learning felt increasingly archaic. The future, he saw with a gnawing unease, was in code and sensors, not carburetors and gaskets. After three semesters, disillusioned and seeing the writing on the wall, Kyle dropped out. He took a series of dead-end jobs at chain garages, the work repetitive and soulless. The turning point came on a trip to San Francisco, where he saw a driverless car glide silently past him. It was an alien sight, both fascinating and threatening. A week later, he saw a job posting: Autonomous Vehicle Operator. The irony was thick, but the pay was better than anything he could find in Antioch.\n\nNow, at 32, Kyle pilots a future he once feared. He lives in a foggy Richmond District flat with two roommates, his 7.5-mile commute to the SOMA headquarters a daily ritual on the 38 Geary bus. His workday is a surreal blend of intense focus and profound boredom, his hands resting near a wheel he rarely touches, his eyes scanning pedestrian traffic and data logs. He is a safety driver, a human failsafe for an AI brain.\n\nKyle\u2019s connection to San Francisco is that of an observer. He provides a service for the tech world but doesn\u2019t feel part of it. His social life is spare, consisting of occasional beers with colleagues and weekly calls to his parents, who still don\u2019t quite understand his job. He\u2019s quietly nursing the wounds from a recent breakup with a woman who wanted more ambition than he felt he possessed. His dream, nurtured during long, silent hours cruising the city, is to save enough to escape it. He fantasizes about a small garage somewhere in Oregon, a place where he can work on classic, imperfect cars\u2014the kind with souls you can feel with your hands."

His father closed his eyes, listening to the wheezing crank. \"Hear that?\" he asked. \"Timing's off. Like a heart skipping a beat.\" Kyle didn't, not really. But when they adjusted the distributor and the engine roared to a perfect, steady rhythm, pride swelled in his chest. It felt like they\u2019d healed something alive. That feeling of tangible rightness became the foundation of who he was, a benchmark nothing since has ever met.\n\n2.\nThe community college classroom felt airless, the fluorescent lights humming over a diagram of a fuel injection system. The instructor droned on, but Kyle saw only an artifact. He thought of the quiet, electric hum of the Teslas he was starting to see, vehicles with no fuel to inject. A cold wave of dread washed over him. He closed his textbook, the soft thud sounding like a door shutting on his future. He knew then, with a certainty that made him sick, that he was learning a dead language.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon, a rare sunny day in the Mission. He was waiting for a burrito when it slid past him with an unnerving silence. A white Waymo, the sensor array on its roof spinning like a silent siren. His mechanic\u2019s mind screamed at the wrongness of it\u2014a multi-ton machine moving with no sound, no vibration, no soul. It looked less like a car and more like a ghost. At that moment, he felt the ground shift under his feet; his past was officially a relic, and this silent predator was its replacement.\n\n4.\nJust last winter, cruising down Fell Street, a pedestrian engrossed in his phone stepped off the curb without looking. The car\u2019s system registered the obstacle, but there was a millisecond of digital hesitation\u2014a calculation. Kyle\u2019s hands, acting on instinct forged over a thousand oil changes, had already grabbed the wheel and swerved. His heart hammered, not with fear, but a bitter surge of purpose. He was a human algorithm, a flesh-and-blood failsafe for a machine that could never feel the icy panic of consequence.\n\n5.\nThey were on the couch in his foggy Richmond flat when Sarah asked him what he *really* wanted. He described the garage in Oregon, the smell of grease, the satisfaction of turning a key in a restored ignition. She was quiet for a long time, then said, \"But it's so small, Kyle.\" The word hung in the air between them. Not \"unrealistic\" or \"difficult,\" but \"small.\" It was then he understood that his dream, the biggest thing he had, would never be enough for the world she lived in."
