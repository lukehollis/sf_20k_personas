The son of a Korean immigrant mother and a white, third-generation Californian father, he grew up in Alameda, a world away from the urban intensity of San Francisco. His childhood was a blend of his mother\u2019s meticulous home cooking and his father\u2019s passion for Giants baseball. This cultural duality became a source of strength, teaching him to listen and observe before acting.\n\nThe defining turning point of his life came at nineteen when his mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness. Brandon watched his educated, articulate mother become lost in a bureaucratic maze of insurance paperwork and specialist referrals, her accent a perceived barrier at every turn. That experience ignited a fire in him, shaping his educational path. He pursued a degree in public health, culminating in a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley, focusing on health equity for immigrant populations.\n\nHis career became his calling. Starting as an outreach coordinator for a local clinic, he methodically climbed the ladder, his quiet competence and deep empathy earning him respect. Now, at 35, he is a Program Manager for Community Health at a major SF-based healthcare system. Since the pandemic, his position has become fully remote, his commute a zero-mile walk from his bedroom to his desk in his Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nBrandon\u2019s days are structured. Mornings are for Zoom meetings and coordinating with multilingual health advocates. Afternoons are for analyzing data and writing grant proposals that could fund mobile clinics or translation services\u2014the very things his mother needed years ago. To break the monotony, he takes long, head-clearing runs through Golden Gate Park, a block from his home. He is a regular at the small cafes and dim sum spots along Clement Street, finding comfort in the neighborhood\u2019s quiet pulse. While his work is fulfilling, his social life is a smaller, tighter circle of old college friends. He hopes to one day scale his programs to a state-wide level, but his more immediate dream is simpler: to build a life and perhaps a partnership that is as deeply rooted and meaningful as the community he serves."
