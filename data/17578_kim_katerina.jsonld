The daughter of a pragmatic Korean-American engineer and a fiercely expressive mother from a family of Russian immigrants, she grew up in Daly City navigating a world of borscht and kimchi, of terse paternal advice and soaring maternal emotion. Her childhood was defined by translation\u2014not just of language, but of cultural expectations. She witnessed her mother\u2019s struggles with depression and isolation, becoming a young caretaker and a bridge to the outside world. This early, challenging exposure to the complexities of mental health and assimilation planted the seed for her future career.\n\nHer educational journey was a straight line toward her calling. After earning a sociology degree from UC Berkeley, she enrolled at San Francisco State University for her Master of Social Work. She threw herself into fieldwork, finding her footing in the chaotic, underfunded community clinics of the Mission District. It was grueling but clarifying work. After earning her LCSW license, Katerina\u2019s sharp organizational skills and deep empathy saw her rise from a front-line clinician to a leadership position. Today, she is the Program Director for a non-profit that provides counseling and educational support to immigrant and refugee youth, a role that feels like a direct honor to her own upbringing.\n\nNow 48, Katerina\u2019s life has settled into a quiet, purposeful rhythm. A few years ago, she went through an amicable divorce, a painful but necessary recalibration that deepened her friendships and her relationship with herself. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its diversity and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her daily commute is a 5.1-mile journey on the 38-Geary bus, a time she uses for reading or simply observing the city she serves.\n\nHer days are a torrent of meetings, grant proposals, and crisis management, yet she finds peace in her routine: long walks in the park after work, cooking simple, healthy meals, and a weekly ceramics class. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of a tourist or a tech transplant; she is bound to its complicated, resilient heart. Katerina\u2019s dream is not of wealth or fame, but to secure enough funding to expand her program\u2019s reach and to mentor the next generation of social workers who see the city not just for its beauty, but for the people who need its compassion the most."

Her mother, stalled in the cereal aisle, grew frantic, her Russian tumbling out in a torrent of frustration that no one understood. Katerina took her mother\u2019s hand, her own heart pounding with a strange mix of shame and fierce loyalty. In a small, clear voice, she translated the simple request for oatmeal. That day, she learned her purpose wasn't just to speak two languages, but to stand in the space between two worlds. This occurred when she was nine years old.\n\n2.\nIt was a stuffy, windowless room in a Mission District clinic. For six weeks, the teenage girl from Guatemala hadn't said a word. Then, one Tuesday, she looked at Katerina and quietly described the specific blue of the jacaranda trees outside her grandmother\u2019s house. It was a tiny crack of light in a wall of trauma. Katerina felt no urge to pry further, only a profound sense of privilege to be a witness. It was then she knew her life's work wasn't about fixing people, but about creating spaces safe enough for memory. This occurred during her graduate school fieldwork.\n\n3.\nThe day her ex-husband moved the last of his boxes out, the silence in their apartment was cavernous. Katerina stood in the empty living room, expecting to feel shattered. Instead, as the late afternoon sun streamed through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, a quiet calm settled over her. It wasn\u2019t a void, but a canvas. The painful recalibration of her marriage had ended, and in its place was a feeling of profound, solitary peace and the freedom to finally build a life just for herself. This occurred three years ago.\n\n4.\nIt happened late on a Wednesday, alone in her office. After weeks of writing and budget-wrangling, the grant confirmation email arrived. It wasn't for a huge sum, but it was enough to hire a Farsi-speaking counselor for their new Afghan arrivals. Leaning back in her squeaky chair, Katerina felt not triumph, but a deep, bone-weary satisfaction. This piece of paper, this string of text on a screen, would become a person\u2014a lifeline for kids worlds away from home. It was a tangible victory in a fight that often felt abstract. This occurred last year.\n\n5.\nOn the 38-Geary home, she looked up from her book as the bus rumbled past a Russian bakery in the Richmond. On the sidewalk, a group of elderly women, heads wrapped in scarves against the fog, were laughing, their animated conversation a familiar melody from her childhood. A wave of unexpected love for the city washed over her\u2014not for its landmarks, but for its pockets of lived-in history. It felt like a full circle, a quiet acknowledgment from her past, assuring her she was exactly where she was supposed to be. This happened just last month."
