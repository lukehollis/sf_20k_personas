Her story, however, began 9,000 miles away in the sun-drenched chaos of Mogadishu. The eldest of four, she was a studious girl who devoured Somali poetry and was enrolled in university, studying literature, when the civil war shattered her world. The family scattered, and Amina, then 22, began a harrowing journey that led her through a Kenyan refugee camp and eventually, through a resettlement program, to Oakland in the late 1990s.\n\nHer dreams of being a professor felt like a lifetime away. The immediate need was survival. Her university credits were meaningless, and her English was still developing. She found work cleaning, sending what little she could to her mother and a younger sister who had made it to Minneapolis. A friend suggested a CNA program\u2014it was a fast track to a stable, in-demand job. Amina discovered a deep, quiet empathy within herself, a satisfaction in providing comfort that formal education never could. It wasn't the life she chose, but it was a life of purpose.\n\nThe key turning point came seven years ago. After years of working in hectic nursing homes and commuting across the Bay, she answered an ad for a live-in caregiver. The position was for Mr. Dubois, an elderly, widowed architect whose world had shrunk to his stately home overlooking the bay. For Amina, it was a practical decision: a steady income with no rent in an impossible city.\n\nHer commute is now a walk down a carpeted hallway. Her days are a gentle, repeating rhythm: morning medications, preparing meals, reading French newspapers aloud to Mr. Dubois, and listening to his stories of a San Francisco that no longer exists. Her connections are few but deep: nightly calls with her sister, brief chats with the grocery delivery driver, and the profound, non-verbal bond she shares with her patient.\n\nAmina\u2019s hope is not for grandeur, but for quiet autonomy. She dreams of one day having a small apartment in the Sunset, a place filled with her own books and the smell of the Somali tea she loves. For now, she finds peace in the fog rolling over the Golden Gate Bridge from Mr. Dubois\u2019s window\u2014a silent observer in the city she serves, a custodian of another\u2019s life while holding her own history close."
