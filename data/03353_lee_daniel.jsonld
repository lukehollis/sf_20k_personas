To his clients, he is a calm, empathetic voice offering guidance through the digital ether. At 27, he is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major Bay Area healthcare provider, a career born from a quiet rebellion against his family\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who run a meticulous dry-cleaning business in the Sunset, Daniel grew up surrounded by the scent of steam and the pressure to become a doctor. His parents saw medicine as the pinnacle of success, a tangible way to heal. But Daniel witnessed a different kind of pain in his own home. He watched his younger sister, Grace, buckle under academic and cultural pressures, her quiet anxiety dismissed by their parents as simple teenage moodiness. It was Daniel who first researched therapy for her, who helped her find the words to ask for help, and who saw the profound impact it had. That was the turning point; he knew his calling was to heal the mind, not just the body.\n\nHis choice to pursue a Master of Social Work at SF State after his undergrad at UC Davis was met with loving disappointment from his parents. They\u2019ve since come to respect his work, though they don\u2019t fully understand it. His relationship with Grace, now a thriving graphic designer, is the cornerstone of his life.\n\nDaniel\u2019s 0.0-mile commute means his one-bedroom apartment is both sanctuary and office. His days are a disciplined rotation of telehealth sessions, careful note-taking, and mandatory breaks. To decompress, he walks. He\u2019ll stroll Clement Street for dim sum, lose himself in the green expanse of Golden Gate Park, or just sit at Ocean Beach, watching the fog roll in. His social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly fellow therapists who understand the emotional weight of their profession.\n\nHis dream is to one day open a small private practice in the city, specifically to serve the Asian-American community and help dismantle the cultural stigma around mental health that he saw firsthand. For now, he finds fulfillment one session at a time, a steady presence offering clarity through the screen, firmly rooted in the city that shaped him."

While his parents slept, he\u2019d typed \u201cwhy am I always so tired and sad\u201d into a search bar for her. The words \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d bloomed on the screen. Showing her the screen, he felt not a solution, but a beginning\u2014the first shared, solid name for the ghost in their house. That night, saving his sister felt more real than any A+ in chemistry ever had. It was the moment his path diverged.\n\n2.\nHe told his parents over Sunday dinner in their Sunset home, the air thick with the scent of kimchi-jjigae. He was twenty-two, SF State acceptance letter in his bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a social worker, not a doctor.\u201d He remembers the clink of his father\u2019s chopsticks against his bowl, the silence that followed. It wasn\u2019t anger, but a profound, loving disappointment that hurt more. In holding his ground, quietly and respectfully, he felt the first true, terrifying freedom of defining his own version of success and healing.\n\n3.\nThe face that first appeared on his laptop for his official, licensed telehealth session was a college student\u2019s, looking just as nervous as he felt. He was twenty-five, sitting in the same chair he sits in today. For five minutes, imposter syndrome screamed at him. Then, he took a breath, asked his first question, and listened. As the student\u2019s story unfolded, the theory he\u2019d learned became a tangible, human connection. In that hour, the weight of responsibility settled on him not as a burden, but as a privilege he had truly earned.\n\n4.\nAfter a particularly heavy session last winter, he walked to Ocean Beach without thinking. The fog was a thick, moving wall, erasing the line between sea and sky. He sat on the cold sand, feeling the immensity of it all. The fog didn\u2019t feel oppressive; it felt like a quiet absolution, a visual representation of the confusion he helps others navigate. He realized his connection to the city wasn\u2019t just living in it; it was using its moods to heal himself, so he could be present to heal others.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, buying pork buns on Clement Street, he saw an elderly Chinese man trying to explain his distress to his adult son in Cantonese, his hands gesturing with a frustration Daniel knew intimately. Their eyes met for a fleeting second, a silent acknowledgment across generations. In that glance, Daniel\u2019s abstract dream of a private practice became a visceral need. He wasn\u2019t just building a career; he was building a sanctuary he wished had existed for his own family, right here in the neighborhood that felt like home."
