Growing up in Fresno, the son of Pakistani immigrants, he watched his mother\u2019s world shrink to the size of their suburban block. His father worked long hours, and without a driver's license in a city built for cars, his mother was often isolated. Sameer\u2019s childhood memories are colored by the frustration of wanting to go somewhere\u2014anywhere\u2014without needing a ride. This early experience planted the seed of a core belief: that freedom of movement is a fundamental human right.\n\nThis conviction propelled him through his academic journey, first at UC Davis and then to a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, where he fell in love with the Bay Area's complex, chaotic, and vibrant transit systems. He began his career with a consulting firm before landing his dream job as a planner for the city of San Francisco. Now a Senior Transportation Planner, he feels a profound sense of purpose in his work, analyzing data and designing systems that might give another person the freedom his mother lacked. His work on expanding protected bike lanes and improving bus rapid transit headways feels like a personal victory.\n\nSameer lives in a rent-controlled apartment in NOPA (North of the Panhandle) with his partner, Elena, a landscape architect he met during a community design charrette. His daily 4.5-mile commute on the 5R-Fulton Rapid is not a chore but an ongoing field study. He observes passenger flow, notes service delays, and mentally redesigns intersections as he rolls past Alamo Square. Weekends are for exploring the city on foot, from the Saturday Farmers Market at the Ferry Building to uncovering hidden stairways in Bernal Heights.\n\nLooking ahead, Sameer dreams of leading a transformative project, perhaps a new light-rail line connecting underserved neighborhoods. He envisions a San Francisco where a car is an option, not a necessity. For him, every bus route optimized and every crosswalk made safer is more than just infrastructure; it's a thread in the fabric of a more equitable and connected city, a quiet tribute to the family he started with and the community he now serves."

The hum of passing cars was a constant taunt, a reminder of the single family vehicle, gone with his father until dark. Her quiet sigh was the sound of a cage. It wasn't just sadness he felt, but a hot, clarifying anger. That feeling of injustice became the blueprint for his entire career\u2014a vow to dismantle invisible walls, one bus route at a time. (Childhood, circa 1998)\n\n2.\nDuring his first semester at Berkeley, he took BART from the East Bay into the city alone. As the train plunged into the Transbay Tube, the deep rumble felt like a primal heartbeat. He emerged into the vibrant chaos of the Montgomery Street station, swept up in a flood of humanity moving with purpose. It was the absolute antithesis of Fresno\u2019s enforced stillness. In that moment, abstract urban planning theories became a living organism. He knew, with absolute certainty, he was home and had found his calling. (Graduate School, circa 2008)\n\n3.\nIt was at a stuffy community charrette for a streetscape project in the Mission. He was focused on optimizing curb management when Elena, then a stranger, captivated the room. She spoke not of traffic flow, but of how bioswales and native plants could manage rainwater and create a \"moment of pause.\" He saw the city through her eyes\u2014not just as a system of movement, but as a place of ecology and beauty. He introduced himself afterward, completely drawn to her passion. His map of San Francisco gained a vital new coordinate. (Early Career, circa 2017)\n\n4.\nOne Saturday, strolling down Valencia Street, he saw it: a father running alongside his young daughter as she wobbled on her bike, safely cocooned within the concrete-protected lane he had spent months planning and defending in contentious meetings. The girl\u2019s gleeful shout was a sound of pure liberty. The image hit him with unexpected force, a direct answer to the memory of his mother at the window. This wasn't just data or concrete; it was liberation. It was the single most satisfying moment of his professional life. (Recent Past, circa 2021)\n\n5.\nOn a rain-lashed Tuesday last winter, his 5R-Fulton bus was a warm, steamy ark packed with the city\u2019s entire spectrum: a cook from a Divisadero restaurant, USF students, an elderly woman clutching her groceries. The bus groaned up the hill, its wipers beating a steady rhythm against the dark. In that shared space, looking at the anonymous, connected lives, Sameer felt a profound sense of peace. He wasn't just a planner; he was a steward of this vessel, carrying people home through the storm. (Present Day)"
