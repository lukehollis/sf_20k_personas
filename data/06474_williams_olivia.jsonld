Raised in a suburban Modesto household, she was encouraged to follow a traditional path: get good grades, go to a UC school, and find a stable career. She complied, enrolling at UC Davis with a budding passion for Art History, imagining a future in museum curation.\n\nHer life pivoted sharply during her sophomore year when her mother was diagnosed with a serious illness. Olivia left school and returned home, taking a job at a local clothing boutique to help with bills. What was meant to be a temporary measure became a new path. The family crisis eventually subsided, but the momentum for college was lost. Olivia discovered she had a natural talent for retail\u2014an eye for merchandising, a calm demeanor with difficult customers, and a knack for managing inventory. She climbed the ranks from sales associate to assistant manager within two years.\n\nThe true turning point came when the boutique chain offered her a store manager position for their new flagship location in San Francisco. It was the city life she had once dreamed of, albeit through a different door. The job came with the ultimate San Franciscan perk: a small studio apartment located directly above the Hayes Valley shop. This explains her 0.0-mile commute, a blessing that also feels like a cage.\n\nToday, Olivia\u2019s life is the store. Her daily routine involves waking up, walking downstairs, and immersing herself in schedules, shipments, and sales reports until she locks up and walks back upstairs. Her social circle consists mainly of her employees and a few other local merchants. She loves the vibrancy of her neighborhood\u2014the proximity to the park, the avant-garde shops, the scent of waffles from the corner cafe\u2014but often feels like she\u2019s observing it through the plate-glass window of her job.\n\nAt 28, Olivia is proud of her resilience and professionally successful, yet she yearns to reconnect with the person she was before life intervened. She dreams of taking a ceramics class, of visiting the de Young Museum as a patron instead of just selling postcards of its art, and of building a life where \"home\" is more than an elevator ride away from \"work.\""
