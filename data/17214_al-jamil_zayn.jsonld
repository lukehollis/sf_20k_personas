Born in Daly City to Lebanese immigrants, his childhood was a vibrant mix of Arabic spoken at home and the fast-paced English of the Bay Area outside. His father, a gifted auto mechanic, and his mother, a talented cook who worked in catering, instilled in him a deep sense of community and obligation. From a young age, Zayn was the family\u2019s bridge to the American system, translating medical forms, navigating school enrollment, and explaining banking paperwork. He saw firsthand how kind, intelligent people could be marginalized by systems they didn\u2019t understand.\n\nThis experience became his calling. While friends chased tech or finance, Zayn enrolled in Social Work at San Francisco State University, feeling more at home helping others than chasing profit. He later earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on youth and families. A key turning point was an internship at a community clinic, where he helped a recently-arrived family secure housing assistance, seeing in their eyes the same mix of hope and fear he remembered from his own relatives.\n\nNow, Zayn lives in a shared three-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. His daily 1.8-mile commute on the MUNI J-Church line takes him to a public middle school where he works as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. His days are a whirlwind of counseling sessions with anxious students, meetings with concerned parents, and connecting families to city resources. His income allows for a modest but fulfilling life; he prioritizes experiences over possessions.\n\nHis social life is centered on a close-knit group of friends from his graduate program and weekly pickup soccer games at Dolores Park. On weekends, he often takes BART back to Daly City for his mother\u2019s Sunday dinners. Zayn\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in his work; he sees the city not through its skyline, but through the resilient families he serves. He dreams of one day opening a non-profit dedicated to providing wrap-around services for new immigrant families, creating the kind of comprehensive support system he wished his own family had."

His mother was describing a persistent ache in her back, her soft Arabic words filtering through him. He translated them into clipped, clinical English for the doctor, who nodded impatiently. Zayn felt a heavy, adult weight settle on his shoulders\u2014the responsibility not just for words, but for her well-being. That day, he understood that kindness wasn't enough; true help meant dismantling the barriers of language and bureaucracy that kept good people from being heard. It was the first time he felt called to his life's work.\n\n2.\nDuring his Master's internship, Zayn sat with a Yemeni family in a sterile government office, their toddler asleep on the father's shoulder. The housing assistance forms were a mountain of jargon. He walked them through it, line by line. When the final page was stamped\u2014APPROVED\u2014the mother looked at him, her eyes holding the same exhausted hope he\u2019d seen in his own relatives' faces for years. In her quiet, tearful \"thank you,\" he felt the profound, grounding click of purpose. This was it. This was the work that mattered more than anything.\n\n3.\nThe J-Church train was packed one rainy Tuesday morning, the windows fogged with breath. An elderly Cantonese woman was trying to ask the operator a question, her voice lost in the crowd's noise and the language barrier. Zayn watched passengers shift, annoyed. He gently intervened, translating her question about the 22nd Street stop. The relief that washed over her face was a small, quiet thing, but for Zayn, it was everything. It reinforced his place in the city's ecosystem\u2014not as a tourist or a techie, but as a necessary human connection.\n\n4.\nIt was the golden hour at Dolores Park. The weekly pickup soccer game had been intense, a beautiful mess of languages and skill levels. After scoring the winning goal, Zayn lay on the grass, breathless, sharing a bag of chips with his friends from grad school. For a moment, he wasn't a social worker or a son, just a guy laughing with his chosen family under a San Francisco sky. This simple joy, he realized, was the fuel. It was the peace he fought for his kids at school to have a chance to feel.\n\n5.\nLast month, during a Sunday dinner, his father was proudly showing a neighbor the finicky engine he\u2019d finally fixed. In the kitchen, his mother was pressing a container of extra tabbouleh into a cousin's hands. The house was humming with the effortless exchange of help, food, and laughter. Watching them, Zayn saw his life's blueprint. The non-profit he dreamed of wasn't just an idea; it had a feeling and a sound. It was the feeling of this room, a place of unconditional support he knew he had to build for other families."
