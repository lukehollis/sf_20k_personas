Raised by an engineer father and a real estate agent mother, Julian was the introspective son who was more interested in people's stories than in blueprints or property values. The turning point came in high school when he witnessed a close friend's devastating struggle with an undiagnosed mental illness, feeling powerless but ignited with a fierce desire to understand and help.\n\nThis drive led him to UC Santa Cruz for his undergraduate studies and later to San Francisco State for his Master of Social Work. He was drawn to the city's vibrant, chaotic energy and its inherent embrace of the unconventional. After earning his license, Julian dedicated his career to the city\u2019s youth, finding his calling as an LCSW embedded in the San Francisco Unified School District. He now works primarily with high-school students, navigating the complex intersection of academic pressure, family trauma, and the socioeconomic anxieties unique to the Bay Area.\n\nHis daily routine is a ritual of balance. He starts his mornings with a foggy walk in Golden Gate Park with his terrier mix, Buster, before catching the N Judah for the short commute to work. The emotional weight of his job\u2014counseling teens through crises ranging from housing insecurity to severe depression\u2014is immense, but the breakthroughs, however small, sustain him. He finds solace in his Inner Richmond home, a sanctuary he shares with his partner of twelve years, Marcus, a graphic designer whose creative, optimistic energy complements Julian\u2019s contemplative nature.\n\nEvenings are for decompression: cooking together, reading novels, or meeting friends for trivia at a local pub. At 44, Julian\u2019s ambitions are not professional climbs but deeper connections. He dreams of one day opening a small, part-time private practice focused on adolescent anxiety, giving him more control and a quieter pace. He remains tethered to San Francisco, frustrated by its flaws but deeply committed to the vulnerable communities he serves. His hope is simple: to be a steady, calming presence in the turbulent lives of the kids who need it most."

Julian just listened, his hands useless in his lap, feeling a profound, aching helplessness. He didn't have the words or tools to help her navigate the storm. That feeling of inadequacy was a cold stone in his gut, but it ignited a quiet, fierce resolve: he would spend his life learning how. This moment, at 17, wasn't a choice but a calling.\n\n2.\nTwo years into their relationship, Julian came home, hollowed out by a student's crisis. He found Marcus not waiting with questions, but with two canvases and cheap acrylic paints. \"No words, just colors,\" Marcus had said. For an hour, they just painted abstract shapes, side-by-side. The knot in Julian's chest slowly loosened. It was then, at 34, he knew this was home: a partner who didn\u2019t need to understand the details to know how to heal the hurt. It anchored him completely.\n\n3.\nHe can still picture the stale air of his small school office. A sophomore, withdrawn and silent for six straight sessions, finally looked up from her phone. \"My mom's landlord... he's watching us,\" she whispered. The words were a tiny crack in a massive wall of trauma. For Julian, it wasn't a victory, but a beginning. It was the day he truly understood his job wasn't to fix, but to create a space safe enough for the quietest voice to finally be heard.\n\n4.\nStuck on the N Judah at sunset, surrounded by the city's chaotic chorus, a wave of exhaustion hit him. Was he making any difference in this sprawling, broken, beautiful place? Then, he saw one of his former students get on, headphones in, looking confident. They shared a brief, knowing nod\u2014a silent acknowledgment across the crowded car. In that simple moment of connection, Julian felt his purpose renewed. This city, with all its flaws, was his fight. He was 41, and more committed than ever.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a particularly dense morning in Golden Gate Park, he watched Buster chase a leaf in the fog. The world was muffled, quiet, and slow; the frantic energy of his work felt a million miles away. In that quietude, the idea of a small private practice crystallized not as an ambition, but as a need\u2014a space where he could offer this same sense of calm, focused presence to one kid at a time. At 43, his future became about creating more of this peace."
