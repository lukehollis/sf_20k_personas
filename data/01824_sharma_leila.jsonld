The only daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised on a steady diet of high expectations and the unspoken understanding that she would become a doctor. For years, she followed the path, excelling in science at UCLA with a pre-med designation. The turning point came not in a lab, but in a cramped, underfunded free clinic where she volunteered. There, she saw that the deepest wounds weren't always physical; they were the systemic fractures of poverty, trauma, and language barriers that medicine alone couldn't heal. This realization was a quiet rebellion. She pivoted, applying not to medical schools, but to social work programs, ultimately earning her MSW from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer parents\u2019 initial disappointment eventually softened into a begrudging respect for her conviction. Leila dedicated her career to the very intersection of health and hardship she\u2019d witnessed. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she works within a large hospital network, though her office is a converted spare bedroom in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down the hall with a cup of tea. Through telehealth sessions, she is a vital lifeline for patients and their families, helping them navigate the bewildering emotional and logistical challenges that accompany serious diagnoses.\n\nLeila\u2019s life is structured and intentional. Mornings begin with a brisk walk through Golden Gate Park, a necessary ritual to separate home from work. Her days are a series of intensely focused video calls, followed by meticulous note-taking. Evenings are for reclaiming her space and her city. She finds community not in a large, sprawling circle, but in a tight-knit group of fellow therapists who meet for dinner bi-weekly, and in the familiar faces at the farmers' market on Clement Street. Contentedly single after a long-term relationship ended amicably in her late thirties, she finds fulfillment in her independence and deep friendships. Her dream is to one day launch a small, specialized practice focused on providing mental health support for healthcare workers, a way of caring for the caregivers. For Leila, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the place where she was able to redefine success on her own empathetic terms."
