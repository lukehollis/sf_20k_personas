He was born and raised in Bakersfield, a world away from San Francisco's coastal fog. His father, a car mechanic, taught him that anything could be fixed with the right tools and enough patience, while his mother worked double shifts at a diner. David absorbed his father\u2019s practical skills, finding more satisfaction in a well-tuned engine than in a textbook. After graduating from high school, he bypassed college and went straight to work, inheriting his family's blue-collar sense of duty.\n\nIn his late twenties, feeling the pull of a life beyond the Central Valley, he followed a friend to San Francisco. He drifted through construction and handyman jobs, his knack for fixing things his only real currency. A turning point came when he landed the job of live-in facilities manager. The position offered a small basement apartment and a steady paycheck in exchange for being on-call 24/7. Suddenly, his commute was zero miles, but his world had also shrunk to a single city block.\n\nNow 41, David is a quiet fixture in the lives of the building\u2019s tenants. He\u2019s the ghost in the machine who ensures their heat clicks on, their faucets don\u2019t drip, and the historic elevator rumbles smoothly. His days are a routine of preventative maintenance, punctuated by urgent calls for overflowing toilets or busted garbage disposals. His social life is sparse; he shares polite nods with residents in the lobby and occasionally has a beer with another building super at a nearby dive bar. He\u2019s divorced, a brief and painful chapter from his early thirties that solidified his preference for solitude.\n\nDavid feels a strange, proprietary connection to both the building and the city. He\u2019s an essential, unseen part of the San Francisco ecosystem. His dream isn\u2019t a tech startup or a fancy condo; it\u2019s quiet and practical. He hopes to one day save enough to buy a small plot of land in Sonoma County, build a workshop, and spend his days fixing things for himself, finally free from the constant demands of the city he keeps running."
