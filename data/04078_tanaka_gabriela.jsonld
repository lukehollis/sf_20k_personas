The daughter of a community health worker from Oaxaca and a third-generation Japanese American engineer from San Jose, Gaby\u2019s childhood was a vibrant mix of Dia de los Muertos altars and Obon festivals, of homemade mole and perfectly grilled teriyaki. She inherited her mother\u2019s deep-seated empathy and her father\u2019s meticulous, analytical mind, a combination that would define her future path.\n\nWhile pursuing her undergraduate degree at UC Davis, a volunteer stint at a free clinic in the Central Valley was her turning point. Witnessing the systemic barriers faced by migrant farmworkers convinced her that her passion lay not in treating individual patients, but in fixing the broken systems affecting their health. This led her to a Master of Public Health program at UC Berkeley, where she specialized in epidemiology.\n\nUpon graduating, she accepted a position as a Research Associate at a UCSF-affiliated institute in Mission Bay. Her work focuses on tracking health disparities in chronic disease among immigrant populations\u2014a direct echo of the community her mother served. At 30, Gaby is emerging from a long-term relationship, channeling her energy into her demanding career and rediscovering her own rhythm.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is a cherished luxury. Gaby lives and works in a modern studio in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to her lab, its creative-industrial vibe, and its waterfront parks. Her days are a structured blend of remote work\u2014analyzing data sets and co-authoring papers\u2014and quiet personal rituals. Mornings start with a walk along the Crane Cove Park with her rescue mutt, Mochi, followed by coffee from a local cafe. Evenings are for pottery classes, jogs by the bay, or exploring the city\u2019s culinary scene with a small group of close friends from grad school.\n\nGaby's dream is to one day lead her own research project, publishing findings that influence public health policy. She aspires to honor her dual heritage by finally taking a long trip to Japan, a journey she feels is essential to understanding a part of herself. For now, she finds contentment in her work\u2019s purpose and the life she is building, a quiet but determined force in the city she calls home."

She was seven, watching her Japanese grandmother fold a paper lantern, its creases sharp and perfect. Her mother arrived with a bundle of marigolds, the kind used for Dia de los Muertos, placing one by their family\u2019s memorial lantern. In that moment of blended reverence, Gaby felt no division, only a profound sense of wholeness. It was the first time she understood her two worlds were one home.\n\n2.\nIn the stuffy Central Valley clinic, she tried to explain insulin options to an elderly farmworker. It happened during her sophomore year at Davis. His hands, calloused and stained from the fields, reminded her of her T\u00edos in Oaxaca. He just nodded, his eyes filled with a weary resignation that had nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with the system. A quiet anger bloomed in her chest. That day, she stopped wanting to be a doctor and decided to fix the blueprints instead.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after he left, the silence in her Dogpatch studio was deafening. She forced herself and Mochi out the door, walking to Crane Cove Park as the sun burned off the fog. Mochi, oblivious, chased a tennis ball near the water\u2019s edge. Watching him, Gaby felt the knot in her stomach loosen. The quiet was no longer an absence, but an open space\u2014hers to fill. It was the beginning of finding her own rhythm again, alone but not lonely.\n\n4.\nIt was 2 AM, the glow of her monitor painting streaks across her studio. She was staring at a scatterplot showing chronic disease prevalence. Suddenly, a pattern emerged\u2014a stark, undeniable line separating one immigrant community from care. It felt less like a discovery and more like an uncovering of a hidden truth. In that flash of analytical clarity, she felt the perfect fusion of her parents: her father\u2019s precision serving her mother\u2019s empathy. Her work had a heartbeat.\n\n5.\nDuring a pottery class, her hands covered in wet clay, the instructor mentioned *kintsugi*, the Japanese art of mending broken ceramics with gold lacquer. The idea struck her with unexpected force, thinking of her own recently fractured life. This concept\u2014that an object could be more beautiful for having been broken\u2014ignited a deep need to understand its origins. Her dream of visiting Japan shifted from a vague wish to an essential pilgrimage, a journey to learn the art of beautiful repair."
