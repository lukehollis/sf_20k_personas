The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store, his childhood was a blend of American cartoons and the quiet, immense pressure to succeed. His parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in San Francisco, saw engineering as the ultimate security. Kevin, finding solace in the abstract logic of code, didn't fight them. He dutifully earned his B.S. in Computer Science from UC Davis, his path seemingly set.\n\nHis turning point came during a soul-crushing internship where he spent a summer optimizing a database for a product no one wanted. He realized technology without humanity was a hollow exercise. This revelation led him to pursue a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford, a decision that initially confused his parents but ultimately defined his career. He learned to build bridges between cold code and human needs, a skill that made him a natural leader.\n\nNow a Technical Lead, Kevin has spent the last decade navigating the city\u2019s tech scene, rising through the ranks from a diligent coder to a respected manager who champions user-centric design and a healthy team culture. He works from the spare bedroom of his Hayes Valley condo, his 0.0-mile commute a stark contrast to the city buzzing outside his window. His days are a disciplined rhythm of stand-up meetings via Zoom, code reviews, and one-on-one mentorship sessions.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is layered. He appreciates the ambition and innovation but finds refuge in its older soul\u2014the legacy of his parents' shop, the quiet trails of Golden Gate Park, and weekend trips to the coast with his long-term partner, a landscape architect. He\u2019s achieved the stability his parents dreamed of, but a quiet restlessness has set in. Kevin aspires to move beyond corporate metrics and lead a project with tangible social impact, perhaps in civic tech or education. He dreams of a day when his work is measured not in user engagement, but in community improvement."
