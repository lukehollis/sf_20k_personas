The only son of hardworking immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business, Wei grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of machinery and the expectation that he would pursue a practical, stable career. He was a dutiful son, but a dreamer at heart, often lost in books that had little to do with engineering or medicine.\n\nHis first act of quiet rebellion was choosing to major in Philosophy at UC Santa Cruz. His parents were baffled, seeing no clear path to financial security. For Wei, it was the first time he felt intellectually alive, grappling with ethics and logic. After graduation, reality hit hard. Armed with a degree in metaphysics, he drifted between barista jobs, feeling the weight of his parents\u2019 unspoken disappointment.\n\nThe turning point came from a friend who got him an entry-level customer support job at a burgeoning tech startup. Wei discovered an unexpected talent: he could patiently deconstruct a user\u2019s problem with the same logic he\u2019d applied to philosophical arguments. Seeing his knack for understanding user motivation, a manager encouraged him to move into marketing. He learned analytics on the fly, finding that understanding Aristotle was surprisingly good training for understanding consumer behavior.\n\nNow 29, Wei is a successful Marketing Analyst. His 0.0-mile commute is a journey from his bed to a standing desk in his tidy Hayes Valley apartment. He lives a life his parents would deem a success, yet feels a subtle dissonance. His days are spent in spreadsheets and A/B testing, but his evenings are for reading philosophy and wondering about the ethical implications of the very technology he helps promote.\n\nHe\u2019s deeply connected to San Francisco, having watched it transform from the city of his quiet childhood to the tech metropolis that provides his living. His dream is to eventually bridge his two worlds\u2014perhaps by founding a tech ethics consultancy or developing marketing tools that prioritize user privacy over profit. For now, he finds balance in weekend bike rides through Golden Gate Park and searching for the city\u2019s most authentic Szechuan food, a taste of the world he came from in the world he now helps build."
