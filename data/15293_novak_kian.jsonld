Born in Berkeley to an Iranian literature professor and a Czech immigrant engineer, his childhood home was a blend of poetic narrative and disciplined logic. He grew up between stacks of Hafez and schematics, learning early that every beautiful thing had an underlying system. While his peers in the 90s chased dreams of IPOs, Kian felt a pull toward a more enduring form of order. He pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, a decision his tech-focused friends found quaint, but Kian saw the future not in code alone, but in organizing the digital deluge it would create.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco just before the dot-com bust, a turning point that validated his entire career philosophy. As speculative ventures crumbled, companies realized they needed people who could make their chaotic websites and data intelligible. Kian\u2019s skills were suddenly in high demand. He wasn't just building sites; he was creating logical, human-centered systems. Over two decades, he evolved from a librarian of the web into a Principal Information Architect, a calm, methodical voice in the frenetic world of tech.\n\nNow 50, Kian lives a deliberately curated life in Hayes Valley with his partner of fifteen years, Marcus, an urban planner. His 1.4-mile walk to his SoMa office is a cherished ritual, a tangible connection to the city that grounds him before a day spent in the abstract. His mornings start with pour-over coffee and a physical book, his evenings with strolls to Patricia\u2019s Green or dinner at a favorite neighborhood bistro. He finds deep satisfaction in the human-scale design of his neighborhood, a stark contrast to the sprawling digital worlds he wrangles at work.\n\nHis aspirations have shifted from career advancement to legacy. He finds more joy in mentoring young designers than in corporate strategy meetings. Kian dreams of an extended sabbatical, not to travel the world, but to volunteer his expertise to a small, underfunded museum, helping them digitize their archives. For him, the ultimate goal is no longer about climbing higher, but about applying his life's work to preserve the very stories that first taught him the beauty of order."

Across the room, his mother\u2019s voice was a melodic current as she read Hafez. The clean lines of the diagram and the rhythmic structure of the poem suddenly clicked into one harmonious system. It wasn't logic versus art; it was the beauty of order, a revelation that would define his entire way of seeing the world.\n\n2.\nThe silence of SoMa in late 2000 felt like a physical presence. Walking past dot-com offices, seeing Aeron chairs gathering dust behind locked glass doors, he felt a quiet confirmation, not triumph. His friends had built rockets without navigation systems. He saw the digital ghost town not as a failure, but as a problem of organization\u2014of information lost in the collapse. This wasn't the end; it was the beginning of his real work, providing the map after the gold rush.\n\n3.\nOn their third date, walking through a still-redeveloping Hayes Valley, Marcus stopped mid-sentence. He traced the line of a new curb bulb-out with his hand, explaining how it sculpted pedestrian space from the street. In that moment, Kian saw his own philosophy reflected back at him\u2014not in pixels, but in concrete and nascent trees. Marcus didn't just see a street; he saw a user-centered design for living. Kian knew then that he had found the human, tangible counterpart to his own abstract world.\n\n4.\nHe was in his mid-forties, untangling a monstrously complex healthcare portal. After weeks of fierce debate, his simplified architecture was implemented. The victory felt abstract until a user feedback email was forwarded to him. An elderly woman wrote that for the first time, she could find her lab results by herself. In that single sentence, twenty years of structuring abstract data became concrete. He hadn\u2019t just organized a website; he had restored a small piece of someone\u2019s dignity and independence.\n\n5.\nIt was on a rainy Saturday last year at the SF Railway Museum. He watched the curator trying to organize a box of faded photographs using a clunky, outdated spreadsheet. The woman sighed about a lack of funding for proper archiving. Kian felt a powerful resonance\u2014the same beautiful complexity he\u2019d built a career on, but here it was fragile, physical, and at risk of being lost. It wasn't about corporate efficiency; it was about preservation. In that dusty room, his ambition for the next decade crystallized."
