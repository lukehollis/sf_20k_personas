Her parents, who spoke little English, poured their lives into a small laundromat on Geary Boulevard, instilling in Mei a profound sense of duty and the weight of their sacrifice.\n\nA bright student, she enrolled at City College with dreams of studying art history, finding beauty in the European paintings at the Legion of Honor. But her path veered sharply when her mother was diagnosed with a debilitating neurological condition. Family needs eclipsed personal ambition. To support her aging father and provide care, Mei dropped out of college and earned her Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification\u2014a practical, immediate path to employment. The decision was a quiet heartbreak, a dream folded and put away like clean laundry.\n\nNow at 47, Mei Lin\u2019s life is defined by service. She is a live-in CNA for an elderly woman in a quiet house in the Inner Sunset, making her commute non-existent. Her world is the three-bedroom home, her days a meticulous routine of administering medication, preparing meals, providing companionship, and performing the physically taxing work of patient mobility. Her key turning point wasn't a single event, but the slow, decade-long transition from caring for her own mother until her passing to professionally caring for others.\n\nHer social life is sparse. Her father still lives in the Richmond, and their one steadfast ritual is dim sum every other Sunday. These outings are her main connection to the world outside her work. Her connection to San Francisco is not the glittering skyline but the quiet, foggy streets of the Sunset, the #7-Haight/Noriega bus route, and the familiar faces at the neighborhood grocery store.\n\nMei dreams not of wealth, but of quiet autonomy. She hopes to one day have a small apartment of her own, perhaps in the same neighborhood, where she can finally unpack her old art history textbooks. Her greatest aspiration is the freedom to spend an entire afternoon at the Japanese Tea Garden or walk along Ocean Beach at her own pace, with no one\u2019s needs to attend to but her own."
