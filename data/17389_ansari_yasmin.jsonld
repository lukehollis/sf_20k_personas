They fled with a four-year-old Yasmin just after the 1979 revolution, settling in Berkeley. Her parents, a former university professor and a physician who had to restart their careers from scratch, instilled in her a profound appreciation for education and freedom of expression. This bicultural upbringing\u2014steeped in Persian tradition at home and immersed in the progressive energy of the Bay Area\u2014shaped her worldview.\n\nInitially, Yasmin dreamed of being an artist herself, earning a BA in Art History from UCLA. However, during a frustrating post-grad year trying to make ends meet, she realized her true talent lay not in creation, but in advocacy. This was her pivotal turning point. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master of Public Administration with a focus on nonprofit management. Her career began in the trenches of small arts organizations, writing the very grants she now oversees. Her combination of empathy for the struggling artist and a sharp understanding of civic bureaucracy made her a natural fit for city government.\n\nNow the Director of Grants for the Arts, Yasmin lives in a tastefully decorated Hayes Valley apartment, its walls adorned with paintings from artists she helped fund over the years. Her daily routine is a ritual of city life: a short walk to a caf\u00e9 for a strong tea, followed by a ride on the Muni N-Judah line to her office near City Hall. Her work life is a whirlwind of budget meetings, panel reviews, and attending the very gallery openings and performances her department supports.\n\nSocially, Yasmin\u2019s world is a curated circle of artists, fellow civil servants, and a few close friends from her university days. A long-term partnership ended amicably five years ago, leaving her comfortably independent and deeply connected to her community. Her weekends often involve visiting her aging parents in the East Bay or long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nHer greatest professional aspiration is to establish a permanent city fund dedicated to emerging BIPOC artists, creating a legacy that outlasts her tenure. Personally, she dreams of one day traveling to Isfahan to see the art that inspired her parents\u2019 stories, and finally connecting the two halves of her identity. For Yasmin, San Francisco is not just a home; it is the complex, vibrant, and ever-changing masterpiece she has dedicated her life to protecting."

Frustrated, she tossed the brush aside and picked up a grant application she was filling out for a small theater group. Suddenly, tracing the budgets and writing the mission statement felt more creative, more *true*, than mixing paint. It was a quiet, deflating, yet liberating moment. The realization settled not as a failure to create art, but as a calling to champion it. This was the pivot, where advocacy became her medium.\n\n2.\nOne of her most vivid childhood memories is from her father\u2019s Berkeley garden. She was seven, sitting on the grass as he recited a Hafez poem, his voice a low, melodic rhythm. The scent of her mother\u2019s jasmine mixed with the cool Bay fog rolling in. In that moment, the lyrical Farsi of her parents\u2019 lost world and the tangible reality of her American life weren\u2019t separate. They harmonized. It planted a seed of purpose: to find and protect that same beautiful, complicated synthesis in others.\n\n3.\nHer first major grant win wasn\u2019t for the city, but for a struggling dance collective in the Mission twenty years ago. She remembers the email\u2019s glow in her dark apartment, a validation that felt electric. Weeks later, watching the dancers move under the lights of a packed house, she felt a profound, vicarious thrill. The applause wasn't for her, but she knew her words\u2014her careful advocacy in the grant proposal\u2014had helped build that stage. It cemented her belief that her truest art was invisible infrastructure.\n\n4.\nFive years ago, just after her partnership ended, she took a solitary walk through the Japanese Tea Garden on a foggy Sunday. The world felt muted and uncertain. As she watched a gardener meticulously prune a maple tree, she didn\u2019t feel lonely, but centered. She recognized the same instinct in herself: the patient, quiet work of shaping and caring for something beautiful so it could flourish. It was then that her independence settled not as a loss, but as a calm, focused form of tending to her own life.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a crowded gallery opening, a young painter she\u2019d fought for in a contentious panel review found her. The artist, a queer Latina woman whose work was vibrantly defiant, just grabbed Yasmin\u2019s hand. With tears in her eyes, she said, \u201cNone of this happens without you.\u201d In that instant, the endless meetings and bureaucratic battles dissolved, leaving only the weight of that artist\u2019s hand and the bright, powerful paintings on the wall. This, she thought, is the legacy. This is the masterpiece."
