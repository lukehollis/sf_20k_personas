Adopted as an infant by a loving second-generation Chinese-American couple in the Sunset District, Cody grew up white in a household rich with Cantonese traditions. While his parents ran a bustling neighborhood grocery store, Cody found his sanctuary in their cluttered garage. His father, a patient tinkerer, taught him the logic and beauty of machinery, sparking a lifelong passion.\n\nSchool was a challenge for Cody; he was a kinetic learner, bored by textbooks but fascinated by diagrams of transmissions and engines. After high school, he enrolled in an Automotive Technology program at a local community college but found the pace too slow. His real education came from greasy hands and solved problems. A turning point arrived when the owner of a legendary SoMa motorcycle shop saw Cody\u2019s meticulous work on a vintage Triumph and offered him an apprenticeship on the spot. He dropped out of college the next day and never looked back.\n\nNow 33, Cody is the Lead Mechanic at that same shop, \"Moto Guild SF.\" He's the guy they trust with complex engine rebuilds and tricky electrical systems. His income affords him a modest, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission, a neighborhood he loves for its vibrant murals and late-night taquerias. His daily 1.8-mile commute is a quiet ride on his beat-up fixie bike, a stark contrast to the powerful machines he spends his days with. The motorcycle, a heavily modified Kawasaki he built himself, is reserved for weekend escapes\u2014carving through the coastal fog on Highway 1 or chasing the sun over the hills of Marin.\n\nCody's social life revolves around the tight-knit motorcycle community and the crew from the shop. He\u2019s respected for his skill and quiet confidence, though he remains somewhat reserved. His dream isn't wealth, but mastery. He aspires to one day open his own small, highly specialized shop focusing on custom builds\u2014a place where craftsmanship is king, a direct tribute to the lessons learned in his father's garage."

His dad held a dismantled lawnmower carburetor, its tiny brass jets gleaming in the dim light. \"See, Cody? It just breathes,\" he\u2019d said, showing how air and fuel mixed. In that moment, the noisy, confusing world fell away. There was only the logic of the machine and his father\u2019s steady hand. It wasn\u2019t about fixing a lawnmower; it was about understanding a secret language.\n\n2.\nThe first day of ninth grade, the history teacher called roll. \"Cody\u2026 Wong?\" He paused, scanning the sea of faces before his eyes landed on Cody. \"Are you sure you're in the right class?\" A few kids snickered. A hot flash of shame washed over him, but he just nodded, his gaze steady. That day, he learned to wear questions about his name like armor. It forged a quiet resolve in him, a comfortable solitude where his identity wasn't up for debate, it just *was*.\n\n3.\nHe was 19, working on a friend\u2019s leaky \u201868 Triumph on the sidewalk outside his apartment. An old man with grease-stained hands stopped, watching him meticulously set the timing. After a long silence, the man, Gus, just grunted. \"You got a feel for it. I need someone like you at my shop. Start Monday.\" That praise, so bluntly offered, was the most profound validation Cody had ever felt. It was permission to become the person he was always meant to be. He dropped out of college the next day.\n\n4.\nThe Kawasaki build took him a year of late nights at the shop. The first time he thumbed the ignition, the engine didn't just start; it exploded into a guttural roar that vibrated through his bones. He took it straight up to Hawk Hill, the setting sun glinting off the Marin Headlands. Looking back at the city, he felt a fierce, quiet pride. He hadn't just fixed a machine; he had created a piece of his own soul, something that could carry him away from everything.\n\n5.\nRiding his fixie home through Clarion Alley late one night, he stopped. The air smelled of tacos and cooling asphalt. A new mural covered a wall, dominated by a pair of massive, detailed hands\u2014calloused, holding a tool, creating. He stared for a long time, feeling a silent kinship with the anonymous artist. Here, in the vibrant chaos of the Mission, he felt seen. It was a testament to the simple, profound truth he learned in his father\u2019s garage: the most important things are built by hand."
