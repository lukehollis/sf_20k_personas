            "value": "David Cohen\u2019s name often prompts a question, one he\u2019s happy to answer. Born and raised in the Mission District, he is the son of a Jewish-American history professor and a first-generation Mexican-American artist. His childhood was a vibrant cultural medley of Passover seders, D\u00eda de los Muertos celebrations, and the constant, comforting scent of his mother\u2019s cooking blending with the intellectual curiosity of his father\u2019s study. This dual heritage formed the bedrock of his identity, teaching him to see the world through multiple lenses.\n\nThe turning point in David\u2019s life came in his late teens. He watched his beloved *abuela* struggle with complications from type 2 diabetes, her condition worsened by language barriers and a healthcare system that felt impersonal and culturally inept. He spent countless hours translating for her during doctor's visits, witnessing firsthand how easily people could fall through the cracks. This experience ignited a passion within him, steering him away from a general liberal arts path. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Public Health.\n\nNow 24, David works as a Health Educator for a city-funded non-profit. His 0.0-mile commute is a modern reality; he works remotely from his small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are a mix of Zoom workshops on nutrition for seniors, creating bilingual wellness pamphlets, and analyzing community health data. To combat the isolation of remote work, David\u2019s routine is sacred. Morning runs through Golden Gate Park clear his head, and he\u2019s on a first-name basis with the baristas at a local cafe on Clement Street.\n\nWhile he loves the peace of the Richmond, his heart remains tethered to the Mission, where he returns every Sunday for family dinner. His social life is a small but tight-knit group of college friends. David\u2019s dream is not of wealth, but of impact. He aspires to eventually manage a community clinic or develop a health navigation program specifically for San Francisco's Latino immigrants, ensuring no one else\u2019s grandmother has to face the system alone. He is a young man driven by a quiet, steady purpose: to build the bridges he once saw missing."
