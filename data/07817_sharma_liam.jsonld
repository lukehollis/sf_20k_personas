The son of Indian immigrants\u2014a pragmatic pharmacist and an optimistic software engineer\u2014Liam was raised on a balanced diet of academic discipline and the promise of the American dream. He was taught that systems, whether chemical compounds or lines of code, could be understood, optimized, and perfected. This worldview propelled him through an undergraduate degree in economics and then eastward to Washington, D.C.\n\nHis graduate degree, a Master\u2019s in Public Policy, was fueled by a fierce idealism. Liam wanted to be one of the architects of a fairer financial system. However, his post-grad years working for a D.C. think tank were a harsh lesson in the friction between theory and reality. A key turning point came when a piece of consumer protection policy he\u2019d spent a year developing was gutted in committee, a casualty of backroom deals and powerful lobbying. Disillusioned, he concluded that real power no longer resided in government halls, but in the private sector boardrooms that shaped them.\n\nThis realization prompted his move to San Francisco. He joined a major fintech firm as a Policy Analyst, a role that felt like working behind enemy lines, but with a better salary. His commute is a ten-step walk from his bed to his desk in his sleek Hayes Valley apartment. His days are a blur of regulatory analysis, data modeling, and video calls, his sharp intellect now used to navigate the very systems he once hoped to reform.\n\nThough he works remotely, Liam is deeply connected to his neighborhood. His routine is his anchor: a morning run through Duboce Park, strong coffee from a local roaster, a midday walk to grab a sandwich, and evenings spent at a climbing gym or in quiet concentration over a complex board game with a small circle of friends. His closest confidante remains his older sister, an environmental lawyer in Seattle, their weekly calls a vital link to his more idealistic self.\n\nLiam\u2019s ultimate dream is not to climb the corporate ladder, but to leverage it. He hopes to accumulate enough capital and influence to one day launch his own consultancy, advising startups on ethical financial innovation and helping to build the accessible, equitable products he once championed in D.C. For now, he learns the language of power, believing that to truly change the system, one must first become fluent in its complexities."
