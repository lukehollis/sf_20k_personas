Adopted at six months old by a warm, boisterous Irish-American couple\u2014a firefighter and a public school teacher\u2014he was raised on the fog-laced streets of San Francisco\u2019s Outer Sunset. Growing up, he was Liam, the kid who loved his dad\u2019s corned beef, looked nothing like his parents, and felt a quiet, constant pull to create order out of the beautiful confusion of his identity.\n\nThis innate need for structure defined his path. While his friends pursued arts or humanities, Liam was drawn to systems. He attended San Jose State University, earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Operations and Supply Chain Management. It was a perfect fit, translating his internal desire for predictability into a tangible skill set. He entered the Bay Area's tech industry not as a coder, but as a crucial problem-solver, the person who ensures the physical components of a digital world move seamlessly from factory to fulfillment center.\n\nA key turning point came at age 25 when he took a solo trip to Seoul. He didn\u2019t search for his birth family, but rather for a sense of connection. He walked the streets, ate the food, and felt profoundly\u2026 like a tourist. The trip cemented a crucial realization: his roots weren\u2019t in the soil of Korea, but in the chilly fog and supportive community of his San Francisco upbringing. He returned home more O\u2019Connell than ever before, fully at peace with his unique story.\n\nNow 30, Liam lives a life of quiet efficiency in a minimalist Dogpatch apartment, his zero-mile commute a testament to his profession. His days are structured: a morning run along the waterfront, focused remote work optimizing global logistics for a major tech firm, and evenings spent either with a tight-knit circle of friends or calling his parents, who still live in his childhood home. He is deeply connected to his neighborhood, appreciating its blend of industrial history and modern design.\n\nLiam\u2019s aspiration isn\u2019t a corner office but a state of perfected balance. He hopes to one day build a family of his own, creating a home that embodies the same unconditional love he received\u2014a carefully managed system of support, warmth, and accepted identity in the city that has always been his."
