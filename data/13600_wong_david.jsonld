Born to a young single mother in Marin, he was adopted as an infant by the Wongs, a second-generation Chinese-American couple in Daly City who had struggled for years to conceive. Raised as the cherished, and visibly different, son of an engineer and a schoolteacher, David grew up straddling two worlds. He spoke conversational Cantonese, celebrated Lunar New Year with red envelopes, and felt a deep, unwavering love for his family, while simultaneously navigating the constant questions his appearance prompted. This upbringing forged in him a quiet resilience and a profound empathy for anyone who felt like an outsider.\n\nHis calling to healthcare was intensely personal. During his teens, he watched his adoptive mother battle a prolonged illness, frustrated by the disjointed and inefficient flow of information between her doctors and specialists. He saw not a medical failure, but a systems failure. This ignited a passion to fix the underlying data infrastructure of medicine. After earning a BS from UC Davis, he pursued a Master's in Health Administration, focusing on informatics.\n\nDavid began his career building databases for a smaller Bay Area hospital network, quickly earning a reputation for his ability to translate the complex needs of clinicians into elegant, functional data systems. He was recruited by UCSF fifteen years ago, methodically working his way up to his current role as Director of Health Informatics.\n\nNow 48, David lives with his partner of twelve years, Alex, a landscape architect, in a cozy Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. Their life is a comfortable, cultivated routine. Each morning, David walks to the corner cafe before catching the N-Judah for the short ride to the Parnassus campus. His days are a whirlwind of high-level meetings, mentoring staff, and solving complex data-flow problems that directly impact patient care.\n\nHe feels deeply connected to San Francisco, a city that never blinked at a white man named Wong. His neighborhood, with its proximity to Golden Gate Park and Mount Sutro's foggy trails, offers a peaceful refuge. David\u2019s aspirations are no longer about climbing the career ladder. He dreams of pioneering a truly integrated patient data model at UCSF that could become a national standard. More personally, he hopes to spend more time traveling with Alex, exploring the world far from the structured logic of a hospital database."

A great-uncle he barely knew pointed at him and asked his father in Cantonese why the \u201cgwai lo\u201d was at their table. Before his dad could answer, his mother put her arm around David\u2019s shoulders, pulled him close, and said loudly, \u201cHe is here because he is my son.\u201d In that moment, shielded by her fierce love, he learned that family wasn't about blood or appearance, but about who claimed you without hesitation.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, he found his mother at the kitchen table, defeated not by her illness, but by a chaotic folder of medical records. Referral slips, duplicate lab results, and doctors\u2019 notes from different offices formed a paper labyrinth. He saw her frustration and realized the true sickness was the broken flow of information. It wasn't medicine that had failed her; it was the system. That quiet, infuriating moment set the entire course of his professional life, transforming data from an abstraction into a deeply personal mission.\n\n3.\nHe was 28, working late at his first hospital job. A veteran nurse, exhausted after a 12-hour shift, showed him how a flawed data entry form forced her to chart the same information three times. He didn't just fix the code; he sat with her, mapping her workflow on a napkin. When he deployed the streamlined version a week later, she simply caught his eye across the ward and nodded. That silent, single nod of gratitude felt more meaningful than any formal praise, cementing his purpose.\n\n4.\nHe met Alex in Golden Gate Park a few months after his 36th birthday. David was lost in thought, mentally debugging a server issue, when a man sketching on a bench looked up. \"You notice how the fog reveals the layers of the trees?\" he asked. The simple observation startled David out of his world of logic and into the present moment. That man was Alex, and their conversation about the landscape\u2019s hidden structures felt like discovering a beautiful, organic system he\u2019d never known existed.\n\n5.\nJust last week, standing on the crowded N-Judah as it climbed towards Parnassus, he looked out at the fog-draped bulk of Mount Sutro. The barista at his Cole Valley cafe had known his order, the train was on time, and he was heading to a job where he brought order to chaos.
