Raised in Portland, Oregon, she was the product of a pragmatic engineer father and a story-loving librarian mother. Her surname comes from a Lebanese grandfather who instilled in the family a deep respect for education and diligence. This unique blend of analytics and humanities defined her childhood, where she was equally comfortable coding a simple website and losing herself in novels.\n\nHer journey into journalism at the University of Oregon began conventionally, focused on long-form reporting. The turning point was a digital media class where a professor introduced data visualization. For Rachel, it was a revelation; she realized the most powerful stories of the modern era were hidden not in quotes, but in the patterns of raw information. She pivoted, mastering SQL and Python alongside AP style.\n\nAfter graduating, she cut her teeth at a Seattle-based online news outlet. Her portfolio of data-driven investigations into housing disparities and campaign finance caught the eye of a major San Francisco information-services company. The offer was her gateway to the city she\u2019d long admired from afar.\n\nNow, at 29, Rachel lives in a cozy, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. Her daily routine begins with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte before catching the J-Church MUNI line for her 2.5-mile commute to a sleek SoMa office. Her work is her passion\u2014transforming dense spreadsheets into compelling, visual narratives that expose systemic issues.\n\nEvenings are a deliberate escape from the screen. She might be found running through Dolores Park, working a lump of clay at a community pottery studio, or meeting her tight-knit group of friends for dinner. Her social circle is a mix of fellow transplants and a few native San Franciscans who keep her grounded.\n\nRachel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; she sees the city as the ultimate dataset\u2014complex, contradictory, and endlessly fascinating. Her dream is to one day lead an independent, data-driven news project focused on civic accountability. For now, she\u2019s content building her career, nurturing her friendships, and finding her own story within the vibrant, chaotic pulse of the city she calls home."

As the trolley crested the hill by Dolores Park, the downtown skyline unfurled itself, glinting in the afternoon sun. It wasn't just a beautiful view; it was a living scatter plot of lives, commute times, and rent prices. In that moment, the overwhelming city felt knowable, like a complex dataset she was born to solve. A profound sense of purpose washed over her; this was home.\n\n2.\nAt 27, she hit \u2018publish\u2019 on her investigation into eviction patterns. For weeks, the project had been a monster of spreadsheets and code. Seeing the interactive map she built shared across social media, with comments from displaced residents confirming her findings, was staggering. The cold data had sparked real human outrage and conversation. It was the first time she truly felt the weight and power of her work, transforming her ambition into a firm, unshakeable conviction.\n\n3.\nLast winter, her hands slick with slip, she finally felt it. After weeks of lopsided failures at the community pottery studio, a stubborn lump of clay yielded, rising into a perfect cylinder beneath her palms. There were no numbers, no code\u2014just pressure, breath, and focus. This quiet, tactile victory was a profound release from the digital exactitude of her job. It taught her that some of the most satisfying patterns weren\u2019t on a screen, but were felt by hand.\n\n4.\nShe remembers a lazy Saturday in Dolores Park two years ago, sprawled on a blanket with her friends. Her friend Matteo, a third-generation San Franciscan, pointed to the golden fire hydrant and casually recounted its role in saving the Mission during the 1906 earthquake fires. In that small, shared story, Rachel felt her connection to the city deepen exponentially. She wasn't just a transplant analyzing data anymore; she was a resident, woven into a history that was now becoming hers.\n\n5.\nOn the J-Church home a few months ago, a musician\u2019s violin case popped open, spilling sheet music everywhere. Before he could panic, three strangers knelt to help, their hands a flurry of shared, silent purpose. The moment was a fleeting, unrecorded data point of human kindness. It reminded Rachel that for all her spreadsheets on systemic issues, the city\u2019s truest story was told in these small, human-scale interactions. It was a humbling reminder to always look up from the data."
