Raised in a quiet, orderly suburb of Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a pragmatic accountant and a meticulous librarian. They were proud but perplexed when Sarah chose to major in Comparative Literature, a field they deemed beautifully impractical. Armed with her degree and romantic notions of the Beat Generation, she moved to San Francisco in her early twenties, convinced she would write the next great American novel.\n\nThe reality was less glamorous: part-time jobs in bookstores, cramped apartments, and a growing sense of disillusionment. The literary world felt abstract and isolating. The turning point came unexpectedly through a nanny gig to make rent. She found herself captivated not by dense theory, but by the unfiltered logic and boundless imagination of a four-year-old. The a-ha moment was profound: she didn\u2019t want to write *about* life; she wanted to be immersed in its foundational, messy beginnings.\n\nShe went back to school for her early childhood education credits and, after years of working in other centers, took the biggest risk of her life. She used her modest savings to convert the ground-floor of her own rented duplex into \u201cSunset Sprouts,\u201d a small, licensed home-based preschool.\n\nNow, at 44, Sarah\u2019s commute is the ten steps from her personal living space to the playroom. Her days are a whirlwind of finger-painting, story time, scraped knees, and navigating toddler politics. Her personal and professional lives are woven together, with her evenings spent tidying away miniature chairs to reclaim her living room. She is a beloved fixture in the neighborhood, on a first-name basis with the grocers on Irving Street and the parents who entrust her with their children. Her social life is a small, tight circle of friends, many of whom are former client-parents. She is single, having ended a long-term relationship years ago, and has found deep fulfillment in the community she has built. Her dream is no longer of literary fame, but of one day writing and illustrating a children's book\u2014a perfect marriage of the woman she thought she\u2019d be and the woman she happily became."
