He grew up the younger of two children in a loving but emotionally reserved household. While his parents provided stability, it was his observation of his older sister\u2019s intense struggle with social anxiety during high school that planted the seed for his career. He saw firsthand how unseen battles could shape a person\u2019s world and felt a profound pull to understand the mechanics of the mind.\n\nThis pull led him to Portland State for his undergraduate degree and then to the Bay Area for his Psy.D. at the Wright Institute in Berkeley. The move was a seismic shift from Portland\u2019s gentle pace to the Bay's dynamic energy. He interned at a community clinic in Oakland, an experience that cemented his desire to work not in a quiet private practice, but on the front lines of public mental health.\n\nNow 40, Caleb is a psychologist for a health network contracted with San Francisco's school district. His days are spent with adolescents navigating everything from learning disabilities to complex trauma. The work is emotionally taxing but deeply fulfilling. A key turning point was the end of a long-term relationship five years ago; his partner found Caleb\u2019s professional dedication all-consuming, a difficult truth he has since worked to balance.\n\nHe lives in a cozy, fog-prone apartment in Cole Valley, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its village-like feel. His daily 5.5-mile commute on the N Judah Muni line is a sacred ritual\u2014a time to listen to podcasts on history or neuroscience and mentally transition between his personal and professional worlds. His social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of friends who understand the importance of quiet nights and long weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nCaleb\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but impact. He aspires to one day write a practical guide for parents of anxious teens and perhaps open a small, specialized group practice. He hopes for a lasting partnership built on mutual understanding and shared values, having learned that true connection requires as much presence as passion."

It wasn't teenage drama; it was something deeper, an invisible cage he couldn't see but could feel in her ragged breathing. Her silent panic was the first psychological puzzle he felt compelled to solve. In that moment of shared helplessness, his vague desire to help people sharpened into a specific, urgent mission: to understand the architecture of fear. This memory occurred when he was 16.\n\n2.\nHis first week in Berkeley, he sat on a bench at the downtown BART station, overwhelmed. The sheer volume of life\u2014the shouting, the music, the scent of street food, the rush of the trains\u2014was a world away from Portland's polite quiet. For a moment, he felt a pang of homesickness, a desire to retreat. Then he saw the mosaic of faces passing by, each a universe of stories. A switch flipped inside him. This chaos wasn't a threat; it was the entire point. This memory occurred when he was 24.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the breakthrough with a nonverbal high school freshman, a boy shrouded in trauma. After months of patient silence, the boy finally picked up a pencil and drew a tiny, detailed map of a video game world. He then slid it across the table and pointed to a small house character he\u2019d labeled \"safe.\" In the quiet of that school office, the drawing felt more profound than any textbook. It affirmed Caleb\u2019s belief that healing wasn't about forcing words, but about creating safety. This memory occurred when he was 32.\n\n4.\nThe final conversation with his ex-partner wasn\u2019t a fight, but a sad resignation. \u201cYou give all your presence away at work,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice gentle but firm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left when you come home.\u201d The words landed with the devastating weight of truth. He saw his compassion not as a renewable resource, but as a finite supply he\u2019d been allocating completely to his students. The heartbreak was immense, but it was also the start of his most critical lesson: saving some of himself for himself. This memory occurred when he was 35.\n\n5.\nRiding the N Judah home last autumn, the train crested the hill above Cole Valley just as the fog began its evening descent. It poured over Twin Peaks like a slow-motion waterfall, swallowing the city in a soft, grey blanket. With a podcast on Roman history in his ears, he watched his neighborhood appear through the mist and felt a sense of profound rightness. It was a simple, quiet arrival, a feeling not of excitement, but of being exactly where he was supposed to be. This memory occurred when he was 39."
