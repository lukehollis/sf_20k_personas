Raised in Stockton by a pragmatic guidance counselor mother and a union electrician father, her upbringing was grounded in practicality and hard work. While she valued her roots, she felt an early pull toward a more expansive, progressive world.\n\nThat world opened up at UC Berkeley in the late 1980s. It was there, volunteering at a community health clinic during the height of the AIDS crisis, that she found her purpose. Witnessing the intersection of policy, fear, and human compassion galvanized her. She followed her bachelor's degree with a Master of Public Health, determined to work within the systems that so profoundly impacted people's lives.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s non-profit sector. For fifteen years, she fought for funding, managed outreach programs, and learned the city block by block. A difficult divorce in her early forties served as a major turning point, prompting her to seek a role with broader impact and more stability. She transitioned into her current position as a Director of Public Health Initiatives for a large healthcare provider, a move she initially worried was a betrayal of her grassroots origins. Instead, she found she could effect greater change by shaping policy from within.\n\nNow, at 52, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her quiet Inner Sunset apartment, which doubles as her office. Her zero-mile commute affords her a deliberate daily routine: a morning walk through Golden Gate Park, a strong coffee from her favorite local cafe, then a day of Zoom calls, data analysis, and strategic planning. Her social life is a small, cherished circle of friends from her non-profit days.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and nuanced. She\u2019s seen the city transform, and while she mourns some of what\u2019s been lost, she remains fiercely dedicated to its well-being. Her future aspirations are not about climbing higher, but about legacy\u2014ensuring the programs she\u2019s built are sustainable and truly serve the communities they\u2019re meant for. She dreams of one day consulting part-time, leaving more space for international travel and mentoring young women entering the public health field."
