Adopted as an infant by a Chinese-American family in Daly City, the pale, freckled boy with the Irish first name grew up proudly bearing the Wong surname. His childhood was a unique cultural fusion: celebrating Lunar New Year with red envelopes and sprawling family dinners, while simultaneously navigating the world in a body that didn't outwardly match his heritage. His parents, a pragmatic accountant and a warm-hearted nurse, instilled in him a powerful work ethic and a deep appreciation for community, even as he quietly wrestled with his own identity.\n\nSchool was never Liam\u2019s strong suit; he was a dreamer, more interested in the logistics of the school play than the lessons in his textbooks. After high school, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, pursuing an Associate's degree in Theater Arts Technology. It was there he found his calling, not in the spotlight, but in the intricate dance behind it. He discovered a profound satisfaction in turning artistic chaos into seamless execution. An internship with a scrappy Mission District theater company became his turning point. He wasn't the artist, but he was the one who made the art possible, a skill that felt both essential and deeply fulfilling.\n\nNow 30, Liam is a respected Production Supervisor, a master of budgets, schedules, and the delicate egos of the Bay Area arts scene. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his lifestyle; he lives in a converted live/work loft in SoMa, where his living space bleeds into his workspace. His days are a flurry of emails, video calls with designers, and site visits to galleries and black box theaters. His social circle is inextricably linked to his profession\u2014friends are the lighting designers, directors, and playwrights he works with daily. His connection to San Francisco is tactile; he feels its pulse not in the tourist landmarks, but in the graffiti-adorned alleyways behind performance venues and the pre-dawn energy of a load-in.\n\nLiam\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of personal fame but of creative empowerment. He aspires to launch his own small production house dedicated to supporting emerging, diverse artists who, like him, might not fit into a conventional box. He envisions a space that's part incubator, part production resource\u2014a testament to his belief that the most beautiful things are born from an unexpected blend of worlds."
