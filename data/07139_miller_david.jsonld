Raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, David was the pragmatic son of an accountant and a librarian. He developed a love for literature, earning a Bachelor's in English from Ohio State with vague dreams of becoming a writer or editor. In the late 90s, chasing a romantic notion of counter-culture and literary ghosts, he moved to San Francisco with two grad school friends.\n\nThe city, however, demanded a different kind of hustle. Rent was high, and editorial jobs were scarce. David fell into the dot-com boom by accident, landing a technical writing gig for a startup that desperately needed someone who could string a coherent sentence together. He discovered a knack for translating engineer-speak into plain English and, more importantly, for organizing the chaotic flow of information. This talent guided his career path away from prose and toward process. When the bubble burst, his adaptability and organizational skills allowed him to transition into project coordination, a role he found stable and satisfying. He was the human middleware, ensuring developers, designers, and stakeholders communicated effectively.\n\nThe key turning point was the pandemic-era shift to permanent remote work. His 0.0-mile commute solidified his life within the quiet confines of his Inner Sunset apartment. David\u2019s days are now a structured routine: a morning walk in the fog-dampened Golden Gate Park, coffee from the same local caf\u00e9, then hours spent coordinating timelines and deliverables over Slack and Zoom. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends from his early SF days, now scattered across the Bay Area, with whom he shares monthly dinners.\n\nAt 48, David feels a quiet sense of contentment mixed with a nagging \"what if.\" He loves the Inner Sunset's village-like feel and the easy access to the park, feeling more connected to his neighborhood than ever. His aspiration isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to finally connect back to his original dream. Tucked away on his hard drive is a half-finished novel, a contemporary story set in a city that has changed as much as he has. His deepest hope is to one day find the discipline to finish it, to finally bridge the gap between the project coordinator he is and the writer he once set out to be."
