Raised in a quiet New Jersey suburb by a pragmatic accountant father and a librarian mother, David was instilled with a love for literature and a deep-seated need for a predictable path. He pursued this love at Rutgers, earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature with ambitions of a life in publishing. He moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn not by the burgeoning dot-com boom, but by the city's legacy of beat poets and literary rebellion.\n\nReality, however, required a paycheck. David took a temporary job as a technical writer for a small software startup, intending it to be a brief detour. He discovered an unexpected talent for translating the chaotic language of developers into clear, structured documentation. When the dot-com bubble burst, his ability to organize and communicate became more valuable than ever. He transitioned from writing manuals to managing projects, finding a comfortable, if passionless, niche. He was the essential translator, the human interface between the code and the client.\n\nNow 45, David\u2019s life is anchored to his cozy condo in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute means his world has shrunk to the radius of a comfortable walk. His days are a rhythm of Slack notifications, Zoom meetings, and the hum of his espresso machine. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of divergent paths and the quiet attrition of his demanding job. His social life now consists of occasional beers with a few industry colleagues and friendly nods to the baristas at his local cafe.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. He knows the best trails in Golden Gate Park for a midday walk to clear his head and can tell you which bakery on Cole Street has the freshest bread. While he appreciates the financial security his career provides, the English major in him still yearns for something more. Late at night, after the final project status email is sent, he sometimes opens a blank document, dreaming of finally writing the novel he came to San Francisco for, wondering if it\u2019s too late to coordinate the most important project of all: his own unfulfilled passion."
