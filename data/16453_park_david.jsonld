The only son of Korean immigrants, he grew up surrounded by the chemical scent and steady hum of his parents\u2019 dry-cleaning business in Daly City. They envisioned a future for him in a prestigious office, a world away from their years of hard labor. David, dutiful but creatively inclined, pursued a Business Administration degree from San Francisco State University, a practical compromise.\n\nHis career began not in a corporate tower, but in the stockroom of a Union Square apparel store. During college, the part-time job was just for money, but he discovered an unexpected passion for the tactile world of fashion\u2014the merchandising, the textures, and the art of connecting a person with the perfect garment. He found his calling not in spreadsheets, but on the sales floor. He worked his way up diligently: from sales associate to assistant manager, eventually landing the General Manager position at a curated men's boutique in Hayes Valley.\n\nA key turning point came in his mid-thirties when a long-term relationship ended, largely due to diverging life paths. The heartbreak pushed him to double down on his career, finding solace and purpose in the store. It became his sanctuary, a place where he could exercise control and creativity.\n\nNow 42, David lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Lower Haight. His daily routine is a familiar comfort: a morning coffee from a local cafe, a 2.8-mile ride on the Muni N-Judah line, and a day spent managing inventory, staff, and the discerning clientele that defines Hayes Valley retail. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly met through the industry, with whom he shares dinners and occasional hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nWhile he\u2019s proud of his stability, a quiet dream burns within him: to open his own boutique. He envisions a small, meticulously curated space, perhaps in a less-saturated neighborhood like the Outer Richmond. It\u2019s more than a business plan; it\u2019s a desire to build something that is wholly his, a tribute to his parents' entrepreneurial spirit but manifested in a way that honors his own artistic sensibilities. For David, success isn't just a salary; it's the hope of one day turning the key to a door with his own name on it."

The hiss of the press and the scent of perchloroethylene was the atmosphere of her love. She\u2019d look at him and say, \u201cNot for you, David. Office for you.\u201d He\u2019d nod, feeling the weight of her dream, while secretly admiring the precise care she took with the fabric. That respect for tangible work, for doing something well with your own hands, never left him; it just waited for its own form.\n\n2.\nHe was twenty, a part-timer in Union Square. A kid, barely older than him, needed a suit for his first real interview and was drowning in self-doubt. David didn\u2019t just sell him a suit; he found the right one, adjusting the shoulders and showing him how it changed his whole posture. He watched the man\u2019s reflection change in the mirror\u2014a flicker of confidence replacing the fear. In that moment, the job ceased to be about money. It became about that transformation, a power he'd never find in a spreadsheet.\n\n3.\nHe was thirty-four. The silence in his Lower Haight apartment after she left was an accusation. Her final words about him \u201chiding in his little shop\u201d echoed in the empty space. Instead of breaking, he grabbed his keys and walked to the boutique. In the dim light, surrounded by the neat rows of denim and the scent of cedar, he felt a profound sense of order and purpose. Heartbreak didn't shatter him; it focused him, turning his solace into his ambition.\n\n4.\nThe first time he took a real hike in the Marin Headlands with friends, he was thirty-seven. Standing at the top, a bit breathless, he looked back at the city. It wasn't the Golden Gate Bridge or the skyline that held his gaze, but the way the individual neighborhoods fit together, distinct yet connected. It made him feel like a small, specific part of a much larger, beautiful design. For the first time, he felt truly rooted here, not just as a worker, but as a resident.\n\n5.\nIt happened last year on the N-Judah, the fog thick over the Outer Sunset. As the train rattled toward the ocean, he saw it: a small, dusty \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign on a corner storefront. It wasn't Hayes Valley, but it was honest. He could suddenly see it all\u2014the warm lighting, the hand-picked inventory, maybe his father helping him paint. The abstract dream he\u2019d carried for years suddenly had a potential street address. It felt less like a fantasy and more like a destination."
