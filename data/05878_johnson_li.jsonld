            "value": "Born Li Mei in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, she was the only child of Chinese immigrants who poured their life savings into a small neighborhood laundromat. Her upbringing was a tapestry of steam, folding tables, and the unspoken expectation that she would achieve a stability they never could. She was a diligent student, the first in her family to enroll in college, starting at San Francisco State University with a vague plan to study business. However, her father\u2019s sudden illness in her sophomore year forced her to drop out and find full-time work to support her mother.\n\nLi\u2019s entry into the professional world was through a side door. She took a job as an administrative assistant at a downtown financial firm, a role she landed due to her meticulous nature and quiet competence. It was there she proved indispensable. Over three decades, she navigated office politics and technological shifts, climbing the internal ladder not through ambition, but through sheer reliability. She became the go-to person for untangling complex travel schedules and coordinating multi-departmental projects, eventually earning the title of Logistics Coordinator.\n\nHer personal life followed a similar, practical path. In her late twenties, she married a kind engineer named David Johnson, taking his name and moving to a small house in the Sunset. They raised a son, Alex, who is now a graphic designer living in Oakland. The marriage was a gentle partnership that eventually ran its course, ending in an amicable divorce five years ago. This became a quiet turning point. With her son grown and her finances stable, Li sold the family home and bought a modern one-bedroom condo for herself in Duboce Triangle.\n\nToday, her life is one of controlled, peaceful routine. The 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins after a morning walk to a local cafe and ends promptly at five. She tends to her collection of orchids, takes online yoga classes, and maintains a close connection with Alex through daily texts and Sunday dinners. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or nightlife, but of the familiar faces at the farmers' market and the sound of the N-Judah streetcar. Her quiet dream is to finally finish her degree\u2014not in business, but in art history, a passion she has nurtured in private for years, purely for herself."
