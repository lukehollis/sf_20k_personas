His upbringing was steeped in the values of community and hard work, watching his parents extend credit to neighbors and always have a seat at the table for someone in need. The defining moment of his youth came not in a classroom, but amidst the rubble of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 13, he saw the raw, visceral power of neighbors helping neighbors, an experience that planted the seed for a life of service.\n\nHe chose to stay local for college, earning his Bachelor\u2019s in Social Work from San Francisco State University. While many of his peers were drawn to the burgeoning dot-com boom, Marco was drawn to the city's underbelly\u2014the communities left behind. He started as a caseworker in the Tenderloin, the grit and resilience of its residents steeling his resolve. Over two decades, he methodically worked his way up, his empathy matched by a surprising knack for navigating bureaucracy.\n\nNow 47 and divorced, Marco\u2019s personal life centers on his teenage daughter, Sofia. He lives in a modest Inner Richmond apartment, its rent a constant, manageable pressure on his $115,000 salary. His 2.8-mile MUNI ride to the Mission District offices where he directs a community health program is a daily barometer of the city\u2019s pulse\u2014a mix of languages, tech hoodies, and weary faces he feels compelled to serve.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago, which, while painful, refocused his energy squarely on his daughter and his work. His current life is a disciplined routine of early mornings, long days of grant writing and staff management, and evenings helping Sofia with homework. His dream isn\u2019t of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014for his programs to secure long-term funding and for his daughter to be able to afford a life in her hometown. He loves San Francisco with the fierce, complicated loyalty of a native son, seeing both its flaws and its enduring, beautiful soul."

Then, the rhythmic sound of his father\u2019s hand-crank slicer in the dark deli, cutting provolone and salami by candlelight. They handed out sandwiches to dazed neighbors and dusty firefighters, no money exchanged. At 13, he saw his family\u2019s currency wasn\u2019t cash, but care. That moment planted the seed: a community\u2019s true strength is measured by how it shows up when everything has fallen apart, a lesson that became his life\u2019s mission.\n\n2.\nHe was 24, a fresh-faced caseworker in the Tenderloin. He remembers visiting an elderly Vietnamese woman in her SRO. The room was barely big enough for her bed, but she insisted he sit, brewing him tea on a small hot plate. They shared no common language, only the quiet ritual. He felt the immense weight of her trust and dignity in that tiny, steaming cup. It burned away his naivete, replacing it with a steely resolve to be worthy of that silent offering of respect.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after the divorce, his new Inner Richmond apartment felt like a hollow cave. Sofia, then 12 and painfully quiet, explored the empty rooms. He saw her place a framed photo on the bare mantelpiece: a faded picture of him as a boy with his parents at the deli. \u201cSo it feels like home,\u201d she whispered. The grief of his marriage ending was eclipsed by a fierce, protective love. His world had shrunk to her, and his only mission became making sure her world felt safe.\n\n4.\nJust last week, on the rattling MUNI bus, he watched a young woman in a tech hoodie tap furiously on a laptop, while beside her, a day laborer in dusty boots slept against the vibrating glass. The city\u2019s stark contrasts were contained in that single bus seat. He felt a familiar ache\u2014a mix of frustration and fierce loyalty. It wasn\u2019t about choosing a side. It was about fighting for the space in between, for the city that could still hold them both. This was his daily fuel.\n\n5.\nHe remembers being about ten, stacking cans behind the deli counter. A regular, Mrs. Gannon, came up short for her groceries. His mother simply smiled, took out a small, worn notebook, and jotted down the amount. \u201cPay when you can, Maeve,\u201d she said softly, without a hint of judgment. There was no shame in the exchange, just a quiet understanding. That little notebook became his first textbook on social work: a ledger of trust, proving a neighborhood\u2019s wealth is measured by its generosity."
