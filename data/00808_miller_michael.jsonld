Born and raised in the Mission District, he is the son of Elena, a resilient immigrant from El Salvador, and a father he barely knew, an Anglo artist whose surname he inherited. Growing up, Michael\u2019s reality was the vibrant pulse of 24th Street and his mother\u2019s tireless work cleaning offices downtown. He was a bright, observant kid who preferred sketching in a notebook to schoolwork, a trait inherited from his absent father that his mother viewed with worried pragmatism.\n\nCollege was never a realistic conversation. After graduating from high school, Michael jumped into the workforce, taking on a string of physically demanding, inconsistent jobs to help his mother. The turning point came at 22, when a family friend told him about a custodian position with the school district. It offered stability, benefits, and a pension\u2014words that sounded like a foreign language but felt like a lifeline. He took the job and discovered a quiet satisfaction in the tangible results of his labor: gleaming hallways, tidy classrooms, and the faint smell of wax and disinfectant.\n\nFive years ago, a rare opportunity arose: the custodian\u2019s apartment at Evergreen Elementary in the an Outer Sunset became available. With a 0.0-mile commute, Michael moved into the small, on-site unit. His life became inextricably woven into the school\u2019s rhythm. He is a familiar, friendly ghost in the machine of public education, respected by staff for his diligence and liked by the kids who know him as \"Mr. Mike.\" He\u2019s closer to his mother than ever, though their relationship is now one of mutual support. Socially, he keeps to himself, his connections defined by his unique role as the silent guardian of their learning space.\n\nNow 30, Michael\u2019s dreams are quiet but persistent. In the evenings, when the school is empty and the fog rolls in from Ocean Beach, he pulls out his old sketchbook. He dreams of taking an art class at City College, of finding the confidence to show his drawings to someone\u2014perhaps the new, kind-faced art teacher. His aspiration isn\u2019t to leave his post, but to build a life within it that feels fully his own, adding color and creativity to the steady, ordered world he has so carefully built."
