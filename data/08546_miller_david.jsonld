            "value": "David Miller\u2019s empathy was forged in the quiet, carpeted rooms of his childhood home in suburban Cleveland, Ohio. The second of three children in a stable, middle-class family, his youth was defined by the slow, creeping progression of his mother\u2019s chronic illness. He spent his teenage years watching her navigate a bewildering healthcare system, becoming an ad-hoc advocate and a quiet shoulder to lean on. This experience overshadowed everything, planting a seed of purpose that would bloom later.\n\nHe initially fled this world, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in English from Ohio State with vague notions of becoming a writer. However, during a post-college year spent back home, his mother\u2019s condition worsened. He saw firsthand the immense value of a compassionate hospital social worker who guided his family through their most difficult decisions. This was his turning point. He realized his calling wasn\u2019t to write about life\u2019s dramas, but to help people through them. He applied to Master of Social Work programs on the West Coast, seeking a fresh start, and landed at UC Berkeley.\n\nAfter earning his MSW and completing the rigorous process to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), David took a position at a major San Francisco hospital. For nearly two decades, he has worked in palliative care, serving as a navigator and a shock absorber for patients and families facing terminal diagnoses.\n\nNow 44, David has built a life of intentional calm in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic gift; he conducts most of his telehealth sessions from a small, soundproofed office in his apartment, just a short walk from the hospital for necessary on-site work. His days are a procession of heavy conversations, so his evenings are fiercely protected. He lives with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Sam, and their shared routine is their anchor. They decompress by cooking together, walking their scruffy terrier through Golden Gate Park, or simply reading in comfortable silence.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its boisterous energy and more about its pockets of tranquility. He finds peace in the fog rolling over Sutro Tower and the familiar chime of the N Judah streetcar. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s to continue his work without burning out, to mentor new social workers, and to one day find the emotional distance to write about the profound, quiet moments of grace he witnesses every day."
