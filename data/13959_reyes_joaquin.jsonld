Raised in Daly City, he is the son of a pragmatic Filipino carpenter and a vibrant second-generation Spanish-American mother who filled their home with stories. From his father, Joaquin learned the language of wood, steel, and structure; from his mother, the art of narrative and emotion. This fusion of craft and drama led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Theater Design, finding his calling in the space where imagination becomes tangible.\n\nHis early career was a grind of painting sets for fringe festivals and building props for small, ambitious theater companies. The turning point came a decade ago with a daring production of a new play; the reviews lauded his set design as a character in its own right, a skeletal, multi-level testament to urban decay and hope. The success cemented his reputation and led to his current role as a Lead Scenic Designer for a prominent Bay Area theater.\n\nNow 44, Joaquin lives in a brightly lit apartment on the border of the Mission and Potrero Hill, a neighborhood whose creative energy and industrial bones resonate with his own artistic sensibilities. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute to the theater is a daily ritual, a moment to absorb the city\u2019s textures and steep hills. He shares his life with his partner, Leo, a pastry chef whose culinary creations provide a delicious, sensory counterpoint to Joaquin\u2019s world of sawdust and paint.\n\nJoaquin\u2019s income allows for a comfortable, if not extravagant, life defined by experience over possession. His social circle is a tight-knit web of actors, directors, and artists. He dreams of one day designing a set for a show that makes it to Broadway, a physical legacy that would honor his father's hands-on work. More quietly, he aspires to mentor young, underrepresented designers, ensuring that the magic of creating worlds on stage continues to be passed down."

His father\u2019s hands, calloused and sure, guided a piece of pine through the table saw. Later, his mother ran her hand along the finished bookshelf, not seeing shelves, but \u201ca home for dragon maps and forgotten histories.\u201d In that moment, watching them, Joaquin understood. A thing wasn't just what it was made of; it was the story it was waiting to hold. That fusion became his life\u2019s work.\n***\n2.\nIt was 3 a.m. under the single, lonely ghost light of a fringe theater. He was 25, exhausted, and a flat he\u2019d spent two days building had just split. Defeated, he smelled the cheap paint and stale air, questioning everything. He almost walked away. Instead, he thought of his father methodically fixing a warped joist, never complaining. Joaquin picked up his drill, his resolve hardening like lacquer. Talent was nothing without the grit to see the job through, especially when no one was watching.\n***\n3.\nOn the opening night of *Asphalt Bloom,* he stood at the back of the house. As the lights hit his multi-level cityscape of rust and rebar, a collective gasp rippled through the audience. It was a sound he\u2019d never forget. They weren't just seeing a set; they were looking at the play\u2019s broken heart, which he had built with his own hands. For the first time, he felt truly seen, his design a living, breathing character. That night, a decade ago, changed his entire career.\n***\n4.\nHe remembers coming home to their Potrero apartment after a grueling 14-hour tech rehearsal, his hands stained with cobalt blue paint and smelling of primer. Leo was at the counter, dusting powdered sugar over a row of impossibly perfect croissants. His partner wordlessly handed him one, still warm. The buttery, sweet scent was a glorious antidote to the day's chemical harshness. It was in these moments that Joaquin felt the perfect, delicious balance of their lives\u2014his structured worlds, and Leo\u2019s ephemeral art.\n***\n5.\nJust last spring, he\u2019d been biking up the steep grade of 20th Street when he saw a young SF State student\u2014he could just tell\u2014sketching the industrial landscape. The student was intensely focused, trying to capture the poetry of the warehouses and power lines. Joaquin saw his younger self in her, but also his father\u2019s legacy of building the city. The brief sight crystallized his quiet dream: to help other hands learn the language of story and structure, ensuring they too could build their own worlds."
