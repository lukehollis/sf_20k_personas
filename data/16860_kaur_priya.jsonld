The daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who ran a small farming supply store, she grew up in a world defined by community, hard work, and the tangible challenges of bridging two cultures. She watched her parents navigate a world that was increasingly moving online, often struggling with language and technology barriers to access basic services. This observation planted a seed that would later define her career.\n\nSeeking a different path, Priya moved to the Bay Area to attend UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Sociology. The city was a revelation, exposing her to a kaleidoscope of ideas and lifestyles that expanded her worldview far beyond her hometown. It was here she found her voice, volunteering at a community center in Oakland and realizing her passion lay in dismantling the systemic barriers she had witnessed her own family face.\n\nAfter graduation, she worked for several social advocacy groups before landing her current role as a Program Manager at a non-profit dedicated to digital equity. The COVID-19 pandemic was a major turning point, crystallizing the urgency of her mission as she saw seniors unable to book vaccine appointments and students from low-income families unable to attend remote classes. Her work became profoundly personal, a way to honor her parents' struggle.\n\nNow 38, Priya lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its diverse community and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her daily routine is grounded: a morning walk in the park with a thermos of homemade chai, followed by her 3.5-mile MUNI ride to her SOMA office, a commute she uses to listen to podcasts or simply observe the city. Her life is a blend of intense work and cherished connections. Evenings are for planning digital literacy workshops or hosting potlucks with her \"found family\"\u2014a tight-knit group of friends from various stages of her life. She maintains a close connection with her family, with non-negotiable Sunday video calls home.\n\nPriya aspires to one day become an Executive Director, scaling her work to have a statewide impact. While open to a partnership, her main dream is to build a life of purpose, ensuring that no one is left behind in a world that moves ever faster. San Francisco is not just her home; it's the arena where she fights for the equitable future she believes in."

The helplessness in his eyes as he finally asked her to translate the dense English felt like a physical weight. That quiet moment of paternal defeat wasn't just frustrating; it was formative. The digital divide became a wall inside her own home, and Priya knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she would one day tear down those walls.\n\n2.\nIt was her junior year at Cal, volunteering in an Oakland library. She helped a monolingual Spanish-speaking woman navigate an online job application, translating a process designed to exclude her. When the \"Application Submitted\" screen appeared, the woman grasped Priya's hand, her eyes brimming with a gratitude so profound it was humbling. In that handshake, Priya felt the abstract theories of her sociology classes become tangible. It was the first time she realized she didn't just want to study barriers; she wanted to dismantle them, one person at a time.\n\n3.\nMarch 2021, at the height of the pandemic. A senior named Mrs. Davis called the non-profit's hotline, her voice trembling because she couldn't book a vaccine appointment online and was terrified to leave her home. Priya spent 45 minutes walking her through the process, her own frustration mounting at the system's failure. Securing that appointment felt less like a professional win and more like a moral imperative. That single call crystallized the life-or-death urgency of her work, transforming her career into a non-negotiable crusade.\n\n4.\nHer first potluck in her Inner Richmond apartment, around age 32. Her \"found family\"\u2014a vibrant mix of friends from college, past jobs, and her yoga class\u2014filled her small living room with laughter and the aroma of a dozen different cuisines. Looking at the joyful chaos, she felt a profound sense of peace. This community wasn't one she was born into, but one she had carefully, lovingly built. It was a tangible creation of belonging, proving that home was something she could actively shape for herself.\n\n5.\nLast year, on one of her non-negotiable Sunday video calls. She patiently guided her dad, now in his late 60s, through setting up a new app to manage his prescriptions. When he successfully ordered his first refill by himself, a look of genuine pride and relief washed over his face. \"You make this world less scary, beta,\" he said. Hearing those words from him felt like the culmination of her life\u2019s purpose, a quiet, personal victory that meant more than any public accolade ever could."
