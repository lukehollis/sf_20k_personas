Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, he is the only child of a Chinese-American mother, a pragmatic restaurateur, and a Jewish-American father, a literature professor. His childhood was a blend of his mother\u2019s expectation of practical success and his father\u2019s encouragement of intellectual curiosity. He grew up balancing the boisterous energy of his family\u2019s dim sum restaurant with quiet evenings dissecting novels with his dad.\n\nTorn between these two worlds, Daniel chose a path of intellectual exploration, pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Philosophy at UC Santa Cruz. He thrived among the redwoods, debating ethics and metaphysics, feeling he was honoring his father\u2019s legacy. However, a turning point came during his senior year when his father suffered a severe stroke, creating immense financial and emotional strain on the family. The abstract world of philosophy suddenly felt like a luxury he could no longer afford. Driven by a newfound sense of responsibility, Daniel pivoted sharply, leveraging his analytical skills to land an entry-level position at a downtown financial firm.\n\nNow 30, Daniel is a successful Financial Advisor Associate. He works from his minimalist SoMa apartment, a world away from the Richmond\u2019s pastel-colored houses. His days are a disciplined routine of market analysis, client calls, and virtual meetings. His life is stable and secure, just as his mother always hoped. He has a small, tight-knit group of friends from college, but he often feels a disconnect between his current profession and his inner self.\n\nDaniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is twofold: the city of his past, filled with family and childhood memories in the west, and the city of his present, a landscape of glass towers and financial ambition. His deepest aspiration is to bridge this gap. He dreams of creating a financial advising practice focused on ethics and personal values, helping people align their money with their life\u2019s purpose\u2014a unique blend of finance and philosophy. He yearns to prove, mostly to himself, that the boy who loved ideas and the man who manages portfolios can, in fact, be the same person."

While he restocked chopsticks in his family\u2019s bustling restaurant, his father sat in booth four, oblivious to the chaos, lost in a thick Dostoevsky novel. His mother would sigh, but Daniel saw a superpower: the ability to build a quiet world anywhere. That image became his first philosophical puzzle\u2014the serene mind within the boisterous world. It was the blueprint for the two halves of his own life, a puzzle he\u2019s still trying to solve.\n\n2.\nHe was seventeen, the Richmond fog swallowing their small backyard. When he told his father he\u2019d chosen philosophy at Santa Cruz, his dad didn\u2019t talk about jobs. He just smiled, a slow, brilliant thing. \u201cThe unexamined life\u2026\u201d he\u2019d started to quote. In that moment of shared understanding, Daniel felt he had chosen correctly, not just a major, but a tribe. He was honoring a legacy of ideas, a choice that would later feel like an extravagant luxury he couldn\u2019t possibly afford.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-one, the UC Santa Cruz library faded, replaced by the antiseptic glare of a hospital waiting room. His father\u2019s hand was slack in his own, the brilliant mind behind it suddenly unreachable. He overheard his mother on the phone, her voice brittle with talk of costs and care. In that instant, every philosophical debate felt like a useless abstraction. Responsibility settled on him like a lead weight, cold and absolute. Ideas couldn\u2019t pay these bills. He knew his path had to change.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty-five, alone in his new, minimalist SoMa apartment. The confirmation email for his first real bonus lit up his screen. The number was impressive, a concrete symbol of the security he\u2019d promised his family and himself. He felt a surge of accomplishment, quickly followed by a profound emptiness. He had a number, a proof of success, but it felt like a transaction where he'd traded his younger, redwood-wandering self. The stability was real, but so was the widening disconnect.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a video call, an anxious, retired teacher was his client. Instead of just showing her charts, he heard himself ask, \u201cBeyond growth, what do you want this money to help you *do*?\u201d The woman paused, then talked about her grandchildren and her garden. For the first time, his job felt like applied ethics. He wasn't just managing money; he was helping steward a life. That single conversation planted the seed: he could bridge the two worlds. He could be whole."
