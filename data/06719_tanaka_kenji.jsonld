The son of Sansei (third-generation) Japanese American parents, he grew up in a Fremont home filled with love, but not with words for difficult feelings. His grandparents\u2019 experience in the internment camps was a silent, foundational stone of their family, shaping a culture of stoic resilience and a forward-focused pragmatism. His parents, an engineer and a dental hygienist, hoped he would pursue a similarly stable career.\n\nHe obliged at first, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Berkeley. But the rote memorization of biology felt hollow. It was a volunteer position at a community clinic in Oakland that changed his trajectory. There, he witnessed how poverty, trauma, and illness were woven together, and how a compassionate listener could offer more healing than a prescription alone. This realization was a turning point. He switched his focus, disappointing his parents by enrolling in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 40, Kenji is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a large San Francisco-based hospital system. He specializes in palliative care, counseling patients and families navigating chronic and terminal illnesses. Because his entire caseload is managed through telehealth, his commute is a zero-mile walk from his bedroom to his small home office. He lives in a cozy, fog-kissed apartment in the Inner Sunset with his partner of eight years, a landscape architect named David.\n\nKenji\u2019s days are structured and intense. He spends hours in virtual sessions, holding space for the fear, grief, and anger of others. To decompress, he and David take long walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace under the cypress trees. His connection to the city is intimate; he prefers the quiet hum of his neighborhood to the bustle of downtown. Kenji\u2019s work is more than a profession; it is his way of giving voice to the profound, difficult experiences his own family could never articulate. His dream is to one day develop a support program specifically for AAPI families dealing with elder care and end-of-life issues, finally creating a space for the conversations his younger self always yearned for."
