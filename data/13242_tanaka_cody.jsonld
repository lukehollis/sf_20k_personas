Raised in Fresno by his Caucasian father and third-generation Japanese American mother, Cody grew up navigating the quiet space between two cultures. His mother\u2019s family, while loving, rarely spoke of their history, particularly the painful legacy of internment. This familial silence created a curiosity in Cody, a desire to understand the unspoken traumas that shape people.\n\nHis path wasn\u2019t always clear. He started his undergraduate degree at UC Davis as an undeclared major, dabbling in psychology before a key turning point solidified his future. During his junior year, his aging grandfather suffered a stroke. In the aftermath, the once-stoic man began sharing fragmented, powerful stories of his childhood in the Tule Lake Segregation Center. For the first time, Cody witnessed the profound therapeutic power of being heard. This experience was his catalyst; he immediately realigned his studies and, after graduating, moved to San Francisco to pursue a Master of Social Work at SF State.\n\nNow, at 28, Cody is a clinical social worker for the San Francisco Unified School District, placed at a high school in the Mission District. His daily routine begins in his small Hayes Valley apartment, which he shares with a roommate. He takes the Muni 1.8 miles to work, a short journey that feels like crossing worlds\u2014from the upscale boutiques near his home to the vibrant, often struggling community he serves. He spends his days navigating the complex emotional landscapes of adolescents dealing with everything from academic pressure to family instability and identity issues.\n\nCody\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of purpose. He loves the city's progressive spirit but is acutely aware of the economic disparities his students face daily. He de-stresses by running through Golden Gate Park and on weekends, explores different neighborhoods with his long-term partner, Elara, a graphic designer. His dream is to eventually become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and perhaps open a small practice focused on multicultural youth. More than anything, he hopes to build a sustainable life in the city, proving that a person driven by service, not stock options, still has a place in San Francisco."

His grandfather, diminished by the stroke, stared past him. His voice, a dry rasp, spoke not of the present but of the dust at Tule Lake. He described the harsh winds tearing at the barracks, a fragment of memory Cody had never been allowed to touch. In that moment, Cody felt a profound, aching clarity. He wasn't just hearing a story; he was witnessing a soul unburdening itself. His future solidified right there.\n\n2.\nHis first day at the Mission high school, just after finishing his Master's at 26, was a sensory jolt. He\u2019d left his quiet Hayes Valley street and stepped into a world of vibrant murals, echoing Spanglish, and the palpable anxiety of youth. A freshman, head down, bumped into him in the crowded hallway and mumbled an apology without making eye contact. Cody saw a familiar quiet pain in the boy's posture. He felt a surge of purpose so strong it almost buckled his knees. This was real. This was where he belonged.\n\n3.\nJust last year, a perpetually silent sophomore named Marisol sat rigidly in the worn chair across from him. For weeks, she\u2019d offered only shrugs. Then, one Tuesday, she started talking. Her words about her family\u2019s eviction tumbled out, hesitant and then raw. Cody just listened, holding the space for her, feeling the immense trust of her confession settle in the small office. He felt less like a therapist and more like a keeper of sacred stories, an echo of what his grandfather had given him. It was a moment of deep professional grace.\n\n4.\nA few months ago, after a grueling week, he and Elara climbed the steps at Grandview Park. They sat on a bench, legs touching, and watched the fog consume the city below. They didn't speak. Her presence beside him was a quiet anchor in the chaotic emotional sea of his work. Looking at her profile against the fading light, he felt a surge of defiant hope. He knew a peaceful, beautiful life\u2014one built on service, not silicon\u2014was not just a dream but a possibility he was actively building, right here, with her.\n\n5.\nDuring a run in Golden Gate Park last spring, he stopped to catch his breath near the Japanese Tea Garden. He watched a family laugh by the gates and felt a familiar pang. He thought of his own family\u2019s silent legacy, a history buried like a stone. Then he thought of his students, whose traumas were so present, so vocal, demanding to be heard. The contrast settled in his chest not as a conflict, but as a calling. His life\u2019s work was to bridge those silences\u2014both for them, and for himself."
