Adopted from an orphanage in Busan, South Korea, at six months old, she was raised in Sacramento by a loving, boisterous Irish-American family. As the only Asian face in her predominantly white suburban neighborhood, she developed a keen sense of observation and a quiet resilience. Her intellectual curiosity was nurtured by her parents, a librarian mother and a civil engineer father. The definitive turning point in her life came at age fifteen when her father was diagnosed with a severe, debilitating autoimmune disease. Witnessing his struggle ignited a fierce, singular ambition within her: to understand the body's betrayals at a cellular level.\n\nThis ambition fueled her educational journey. She excelled at UC Davis before being accepted into a prestigious Ph.D. program in immunology at UCSF. In San Francisco, Sarah found her tribe, a community of brilliant, driven minds who shared her passion for solving complex biological puzzles. She eschewed a typical graduate school social life, preferring long hours in the lab to late nights at bars. Her dedication paid off, and she was recruited straight out of her program by a cutting-edge biotech firm.\n\nNow 41, Sarah\u2019s life is a monument to her work. She lives in a minimalist live-work loft in Mission Bay, overlooking the research campus where her company is located. Her 0.0-mile commute is by design, allowing for maximum immersion in her research on next-generation T-cell therapies. Her days are structured and intense: a 6 a.m. run along the Embarcadero, followed by twelve hours analyzing data, running experiments, and collaborating with her small, tight-knit team.\n\nHer social life is sparse but meaningful, consisting of a few close colleagues who understand the sacrifices her work demands. While she sometimes wonders about the life not lived\u2014of marriage, of children\u2014her focus remains unwavering. Her deepest hope is to see her research lead to a breakthrough, a treatment that could give other families more time than hers had. For Sarah, San Francisco isn't a city of iconic bridges or vibrant nightlife; it's an ecosystem of innovation, and she is at its very heart, tirelessly working to reprogram the future of medicine."
