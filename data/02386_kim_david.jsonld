Born in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District to first-generation Korean immigrants, David grew up behind the counter of his parents' dry-cleaning business. They preached stability and a respectable career, envisioning a future for him in an office, far from the grueling hours they endured.\n\nHe dutifully followed their path at first, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College. But the world of spreadsheets and ledgers felt gray and lifeless. The vibrant, chaotic energy of a kitchen was where he felt truly alive, a passion ignited by helping his mother prepare family meals. After graduation, he disappointed his parents by taking a job as a prep cook in a bustling Chinatown restaurant, trading a collared shirt for a stained apron. For fifteen years, he honed his craft in other people's kitchens, absorbing techniques from every culture that makes up the city\u2019s culinary soul.\n\nThe major turning point came at 38, with his father's sudden passing. The inheritance was modest, but it represented a choice: continue working for others or build something of his own. Combined with his savings, it was just enough. He purchased a small, neglected storefront in the Inner Richmond, with a small apartment upstairs. His marriage, already strained by the long hours of a chef's life, didn't survive the stress of opening a business.\n\nToday, at 51, David is the proud owner of \"Seoul Food,\" a small deli and retail shop specializing in Korean-Californian cuisine. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bed down a flight of stairs into his kitchen before the sun rises. His days are a rhythmic cycle of preparing his signature kimchi fried rice, stewing doenjang-jjigae, and chatting with regulars who have become his de facto family. His business degree, once a symbol of a life rejected, proved invaluable for managing inventory and finances.\n\nDavid's dream is no longer about expansion or fame. It is about perfecting his mother's recipes, seeing his shop become a beloved neighborhood institution, and finding peace in the simple, profound act of feeding people well. His connection to San Francisco is etched into every corner of his life\u2014a life built not on the future his parents planned, but on the one he painstakingly crafted for himself."
