Born in Port of Spain to a family of mixed African and Indo-Trinidadian heritage, his early life was a vibrant tapestry of Carnival, spicy food, and the constant hum of a close-knit community. His family immigrated to Daly City when he was 15, chasing better opportunities.\n\nFull of ambition, Kwame enrolled at City College of San Francisco to study engineering, fascinated by how things were built. However, his academic journey was cut short when his father, a mechanic, suffered a debilitating injury. Kwame dropped out to work full-time, taking a maintenance job at an apartment complex to help support his family. It was meant to be temporary, but he discovered a profound satisfaction in solving tangible problems. He had a gift for understanding the complex circulatory systems of buildings\u2014the plumbing, the wiring, the HVAC. He didn't find a career; a career found him.\n\nOver two decades, Kwame worked his way up, earning certifications and a reputation for being the man who could fix anything. The key turning point came ten years ago when he was offered the live-in Facilities Manager position at a grand, pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. His home and his work became one.\n\nToday, his life is the building. His commute is an elevator ride. His days are a mix of scheduled maintenance checks, fielding calls about leaky faucets, and troubleshooting the temperamental, century-old boiler he affectionately calls \u201cThe Baroness.\u201d He knows every resident, from the elderly woman on the third floor who shares her baking with him to the young couple in the penthouse. Kwame is the building\u2019s steady hand and confidant. His partner of fifteen years, a public school teacher named Marco, provides a welcome escape from the demands of the job.\n\nAt 50, Kwame doesn\u2019t dream of a different life, but of deepening the one he has. He hopes to one day take an extended trip back to Trinidad with Marco, to reconnect with family and the rhythms of his youth. More immediately, he aspires to mentor a young person in the trades, passing on the practical wisdom he learned not in a classroom, but in the humming, mechanical heart of San Francisco."
