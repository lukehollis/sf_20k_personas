Raised in suburban Sacramento by Indian immigrant parents\u2014an engineer and a pharmacist\u2014her childhood was a structured world of math tutors and science fairs. Her parents envisioned a stable, lucrative future for her in medicine or tech. But Priya lived a parallel life in the margins of her notebooks, sketching the world around her with a precision and passion that felt more native to her than any algebraic equation.\n\nHer turning point came during her sophomore year at UC Davis. While dutifully studying Communications, a path she'd negotiated with her parents as a \"practical\" compromise, she took a summer internship at a small contemporary art gallery in San Francisco. The experience was a revelation. The chaotic energy of coordinating with artists, the tangible satisfaction of hanging a finished show, and the vibrant discourse of the city\u2019s art scene resonated with her soul. Against her family's wishes, she didn't return to Davis. Instead, she moved into a cramped apartment in the Mission District, working two cafe jobs while volunteering at the gallery.\n\nPriya\u2019s formal education ended there, but her real-world training flourished. She absorbed everything, from lighting techniques and art handling to grant writing and artist relations. Her work ethic and keen eye didn\u2019t go unnoticed. The volunteer gig turned into a part-time assistant role, and eventually, she was hired as the full-time Exhibitions Coordinator. Now 28, she has become the organizational backbone of the gallery.\n\nHer life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission. Her 0.0-mile commute is a three-block walk past vibrant murals and the aroma of fresh pan dulce. Her days are a whirlwind of emails, logistics, and creative problem-solving. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or sharing cheap, delicious burritos with her close-knit circle of artists and fellow creatives. Her relationship with her parents remains loving but holds a gentle tension; they are proud, yet perpetually confused by her choice. Priya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t fame, but to one day become a head curator, giving a platform to the diverse, emerging voices she believes are the true heart of San Francisco\u2019s artistic future."
