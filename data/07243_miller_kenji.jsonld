Raised in the sun-baked suburbs of Sacramento, Kenji felt like a perpetual outsider, never quite fitting into either side of his heritage. He sought refuge in books, devouring stories that transported him far from the Central Valley's predictability. San Francisco was his inevitable escape. He arrived at SF State in the early 90s, a hopeful English Literature major dreaming of writing the next great novel about the city\u2019s vibrant counter-culture.\n\nReality, however, had more practical plans. Post-graduation, the romantic life of a writer quickly gave way to the pressing need to pay rent. A temp job as a leasing assistant for a small property firm was meant to be a stopgap. Instead, Kenji discovered an unexpected talent. His quiet, observant nature allowed him to read prospective tenants perfectly, and his structured upbringing made him a natural at managing maintenance schedules and complex paperwork. The dream of writing was shelved, replaced by a steady climb up the real estate ladder.\n\nNow 50, Kenji is the senior property manager for a portfolio of classic, pre-war buildings in Nob Hill. His 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; he lives in a corner unit of the very first building he was assigned to manage, a privilege of his long tenure. His life is a routine of early morning walks through Huntington Park, troubleshooting leaky faucets over the phone, and mediating disputes between tenants who have become familiar characters in his life\u2019s play.\n\nThough professionally successful, a quiet melancholy lingers. He never married, his long hours and the emotional armor required for his job having slowly eroded a significant relationship years ago. He is well-liked but not deeply known, a fixture in the neighborhood like the cable car lines. His great, unfulfilled dream is to finally write those stories, not of imagined bohemians, but of the real lives unfolding within the walls he so meticulously maintains\u2014a collection of interconnected tales about the lonely tech bro, the elderly woman who hasn't left her apartment in years, and the young couple fighting to make their mark. He is the keeper of their homes, and secretly, the archivist of their lives."
