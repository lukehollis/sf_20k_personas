Raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school principal and a librarian, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and steeped in a Midwestern appreciation for common sense. His one act of academic rebellion was pursuing a Bachelor's degree in History, a subject he loved for its grand narratives and human drama. However, upon graduating, the stark reality of the job market for historians led him to a soul-crushing data entry job at a local bank. It was there, unexpectedly, that he discovered a talent for seeing patterns in numbers, a knack for financial modeling that felt like a different kind of storytelling.\n\nHe parlayed this aptitude into a series of certifications, methodically building a new career. A decade ago, a lucrative offer from a major financial firm brought him to San Francisco, a city he initially saw only as a career stepping-stone. He chose a small apartment in the Inner Sunset, drawn to its foggy, residential calm and proximity to Golden Gate Park rather than the city\u2019s frantic energy.\n\nThe pandemic solidified his remote work status, shrinking his world to a few square blocks. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are governed by a well-worn routine: coffee from the same cafe on 9th Avenue where the barista knows his order, a day spent analyzing market trends from his spare bedroom office, and a mandatory 4 p.m. walk through the Botanical Garden to clear his head. This insular lifestyle contributed to the recent, amicable end of a long-term relationship; his partner had craved more spontaneity than his structured existence could offer.\n\nNow at 40, David feels a quiet restlessness. He is financially secure but socially adrift. His friendships are maintained mostly through weekly online games and occasional dinners. He dreams of breaking his own carefully constructed patterns, perhaps by volunteering at the de Young Museum to reconnect with his history-loving younger self, or finally taking a sailing class at the bay. His deepest aspiration is simple: to transform his life in San Francisco from a spreadsheet of routines into a story with an unwritten next chapter."
