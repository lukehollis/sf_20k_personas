The son of a quietly intense Korean ceramicist and a pragmatic second-generation American engineer, his Berkeley childhood was a fusion of two worlds. He spent Saturdays watching his mother shape clay on her wheel and Sundays tinkering with discarded electronics in his father\u2019s garage. This duality defined his path: he honored his father with an undergraduate engineering degree but answered his mother\u2019s artistic influence by pursuing a graduate degree in Industrial Design at California College of the Arts, the move that first brought him to San Francisco.\n\nHis career began with designing ergonomic tools for a local manufacturing firm. Jin excelled not just in aesthetics but in understanding the entire product lifecycle\u2014from concept to factory floor. A key turning point came during a high-stakes product launch when a critical flaw was discovered. Jin worked tirelessly, redesigning a key component overnight and coordinating with the overseas factory via video calls, saving the project and earning a reputation for being both a brilliant designer and a calm, effective leader. This success catapulted him up the ladder, eventually leading to his current role as Director of Product Development.\n\nNow 40, Jin lives in a minimalist condo in the Mission District. His days are a study in structured efficiency. Morning coffee is followed by his 3.5-mile e-bike commute to his Dogpatch office, a ride he treasures for its mental clarity. He loves the Mission\u2019s vibrant chaos, a stark contrast to his orderly professional life. His social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of old grad school friends and a few trusted colleagues.\n\nAfter years dedicated to his career, Jin longs for greater balance. He dreams of launching his own line of sustainable, beautifully designed home goods. More personally, he hopes to travel for pleasure, not business, and perhaps find a partner who appreciates both the artist and the engineer within him. He has built a successful life in San Francisco; now, he aspires to build a more fulfilling one."

He isn\u2019t watching her hands, but the way her shoulders settle as the clay finds its center on the wheel. It\u2019s a language of pressure and release he understands instinctively. That quiet, focused intensity a lump of mud becoming a vessel\u2014was his first lesson in how form could follow not just function, but feeling. It planted a seed of patience and a respect for the soul of an object.\n\n2.\nThe first late night in the CCA workshop, surrounded by the scent of sawdust and spray mount, felt like coming home. San Francisco\u2019s lights twinkled through the dusty glass as he sanded a prototype. A classmate, glancing over, admired not just the curve of the handle but the cleverness of the internal mechanism he\u2019d engineered. For the first time, someone saw both halves of him at once. The engineer and the artist weren't at odds; they were in sync. He felt a profound sense of belonging, a click of rightness.\n\n3.\nIt\u2019s 3 AM. The only lights are his monitor and the pixelated, weary faces of the factory team in Shenzhen. The adrenaline of the crisis has faded into a state of pure, electric focus. His hands fly between sketching and CAD modeling, redesigning the flawed component. In that moment, he isn\u2019t just a designer; he\u2019s a conduit, translating a solution across languages, time zones, and materials. The factory manager\u2019s eventual thumbs-up felt less like a victory and more like a deep, resonant hum of competence that would define his professional confidence for years.\n\n4.\nCresting Potrero Hill on his e-bike, the city unfolds below. The morning marine layer is pulling back from the downtown skyline like a curtain. The quiet whir of the motor is the only sound in his head, a welcome silence after the morning\u2019s emails. This daily ride, a 3.5-mile slice of solitude, isn\u2019t about exercise; it\u2019s a moving meditation. It\u2019s the moment his structured mind opens up, allowing the Mission\u2019s chaotic beauty to seep in before the orderly demands of his Dogpatch office take over.\n\n5.\nHe\u2019s at a friend's dinner party, holding a beautifully designed but poorly weighted serving bowl. He instinctively feels its imbalance, the way it strains the wrist\u2014a tiny, solvable flaw. In that moment, surrounded by conversation, his future flashes in his mind: a line of his own. Sustainable home goods with the warmth of his mother\u2019s ceramics and the unimpeachable logic of his father\u2019s engineering. The dream, once a vague notion, crystallized into a clear, tangible goal. It was a quiet promise he made to himself."
