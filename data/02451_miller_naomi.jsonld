Raised in Des Moines, Iowa, by a public health nurse and an accountant, she grew up with a dual understanding of the world: one of compassionate, hands-on care and one of meticulous, ordered numbers. This duality defined her path. While her peers pursued more traditional careers, Naomi was drawn to the intersection of these two worlds, seeing the immense, untapped potential in using data to solve human-scale problems.\n\nHer educational journey confirmed this. After an undergraduate degree in sociology, she pursued a Master of Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan. It was there she honed her ability to translate vast datasets into narratives about community health. A post-grad fellowship with the state health department felt meaningful but slow. The turning point came when a burgeoning San Francisco health-tech startup recruited her, promising the resources and speed to enact change at a scale she\u2019d only dreamed of.\n\nNow, at 31, Naomi lives in a bright, airy apartment in NOPA (North of the Panhandle), her zero-mile commute taking her from her bedroom to a standing desk in the living room. Her days begin not with traffic, but with a brisk run through the Panhandle to Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her mind before diving into work. As a Data Analyst for Community Health, she analyzes anonymized data from a wellness app, identifying trends in mental health, physical activity, and nutrition across different demographics. Her work directly informs the app\u2019s pro-bono programs for underserved communities.\n\nHer social life is a curated tapestry of close friendships, many forged not in corporate happy hours but within a weekend hiking group that explores the trails of Marin and the East Bay. These connections provide a necessary anchor against the tech industry\u2019s transient nature. Naomi\u2019s dream is to one day lead a project that uses predictive analytics to preemptively deliver mental health resources to at-risk populations. She came to San Francisco for the innovation, but she stays for the feeling that here, in her quiet apartment, she is using the city\u2019s most lauded tool\u2014technology\u2014to fulfill the simple, compassionate mission she inherited from her mother back in Iowa."
