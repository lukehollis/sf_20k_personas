Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she is the daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood dry-cleaning business. Her childhood was a quiet rhythm of school, helping at the shop, and listening to her parents' constant reminders about the importance of stability and a practical education. They envisioned a future for her as an accountant or an engineer.\n\nMei, however, possessed a keen eye for detail and a silent fascination with the way people express themselves through what they wear. Honoring her parents' wishes for a \"sensible\" path, she earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from UC Berkeley. Her first job out of college was as an analyst for a large downtown department store. It was there she found her calling, not in pure finance, but at the intersection of numbers and trends. She discovered the world of merchandise planning, a career that perfectly leveraged her analytical mind and her latent passion for style. She excelled at forecasting sales, managing inventory, and ensuring the right product was in the right place at the right time.\n\nThe turning point in her career, and life, was the city-wide shift to remote work. Her 0.0-mile commute became permanent, freeing her from the daily MUNI ride and anchoring her life to her Hayes Valley apartment. Her days are now a structured blend of Zoom calls and complex spreadsheets, punctuated by walks to her favorite local cafe for an oat milk latte and strolls through Patricia's Green.\n\nThough successful, Mei feels a gentle pull for something more. At 38, she has a tight-knit circle of friends, a complex appreciation for the ever-changing city of her birth, and a growing desire to build something of her own. Her quiet dream is to leave the corporate world behind and open a small, curated online boutique featuring independent Bay Area designers. It would be the ultimate synthesis of her story: the business acumen inherited from her parents, the analytical skills honed in her career, and the personal, creative expression she has long nurtured in private."
