The only son of a mechanic and a dental hygienist, he grew up in a home filled with love but shadowed by the financial strain of his father\u2019s struggling auto repair shop. While his dad worked on transmissions, Cody found his own refuge in assembling and disassembling budget gaming PCs. He was the neighborhood kid who could diagnose a blue screen of death or recover lost homework from a corrupted hard drive, treating a motherboard with the same careful precision his father applied to an engine block.\n\nCollege seemed like a distant, expensive dream he wasn't sure he wanted. After graduating high school, while his friends left for state schools, Cody felt adrift. The turning point came when his father\u2019s antiquated scheduling and billing computer finally crashed. Cody spent a weekend salvaging the data and setting up a new, more efficient system. Seeing the immediate relief on his parents' faces, he realized his hobby was more than a pastime; it was a marketable skill. He used his savings to earn his CompTIA A+ certification, a tangible first step toward a real career.\n\nDrawn by the magnetic pull of the tech industry, Cody took a leap of faith and moved to San Francisco two years ago, landing an entry-level IT support job. Today, his life is a predictable but satisfying rhythm. He shares a drafty three-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond with two roommates he met online. His 5.5-mile commute on the 38R Geary bus is a daily ritual, a time for podcasts and observing the city's diverse energy. His job involves a steady stream of support tickets\u2014password resets, software glitches, network issues\u2014and he derives genuine satisfaction from solving each small, tangible problem for the scientists and managers at his firm.\n\nSocially, Cody keeps his circle tight. It revolves around weekly Dungeons & Dragons sessions with coworkers and exploring the city\u2019s breweries with a couple of friends from his certification class. He feels a quiet pride in the life he\u2019s built. His aspiration isn\u2019t to found a startup, but to achieve mastery and security. He\u2019s studying for his Network+ certification, dreaming of becoming a network administrator and, one day, affording a one-bedroom apartment all his own. San Francisco, for him, isn't a place of glamour; it's the city that valued his practical skills and gave him a future far beyond the confines of his father\u2019s garage."

Cody, at his own small bench with a motherboard, saw the parallel. They were both mechanics, just for different machines. That shared, silent understanding of finding the one broken piece to make the whole thing work again taught him a patience his friends never had. It happened years before he left Modesto, but it was the foundation of everything.\n\n2.\nHis father\u2019s old billing computer finally died on a Friday. The panic in his parents\u2019 eyes was a physical weight in the house. Cody worked all weekend, meticulously recovering years of data from the failing hard drive. When he rebooted the new system he\u2019d built, the look of pure relief on his father\u2019s face was more valuable than any paycheck. For the first time, his hobby wasn\u2019t an escape; it was a lifeboat. That moment, just after high school, solidified his path.\n\n3.\nHis first night in the Inner Richmond was cold. The fog flowed right through the loose window frame, and the streetcar\u2019s groan felt like an invasion. Staring at his mattress on the floor of the tiny room, the cost of the security deposit sat like a stone in his gut. For a moment, doubt screamed. He\u2019d left home for this drafty, expensive box. But then the 38R rumbled past, full of people, and he felt a spark. He was a part of it now.\n\n4.\nAbout a year into his job, a lab\u2019s local server crashed, threatening a major project. While senior techs debated, Cody quietly traced the network logs, recognizing a familiar error from his hobbyist days. He suggested a fix\u2014a simple command line script. It worked. The lead scientist, a woman with three degrees, didn't cheer; she just gave him a single, appreciative nod. In that moment, surrounded by PhDs, Cody felt his own expertise become real. He wasn't just the password reset guy anymore.\n\n5.\nHe was hesitant when his coworker, Sarah, invited him to a Dungeons & Dragons game. But sitting in that cluttered living room, surrounded by the glow of a laptop screen and the sound of rolling dice, a knot in his chest loosened. They weren't just colleagues discussing support tickets; they were a party of adventurers. It was the first time San Francisco felt less like a city where he worked, and more like a place where he truly lived. It was the beginning of his found family."
