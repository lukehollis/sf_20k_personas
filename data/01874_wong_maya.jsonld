The daughter of immigrants from Hong Kong, she was raised behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Irving Street. They instilled in her a fierce work ethic and the expectation that she would pursue a lucrative career, a path she dutifully started at UC Berkeley as a business major.\n\nThe turning point came during a required volunteer placement at a center for children with developmental disabilities. The chaotic, challenging environment didn't deter her; it awakened something. She saw the profound impact of patient, dedicated guidance and changed her major to psychology. This decision caused a rift with her father, who saw it as a rejection of their sacrifice. Despite this, Maya enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master\u2019s in Special Education.\n\nFor nearly three decades, Maya has taught special education at a public elementary school in the Sunset. With a commute of zero miles, she lives in a modest apartment just three blocks from the school, making her a true fixture of the community. Her life is a tapestry of routine and purpose. Mornings are for lesson planning over coffee before her short walk to work, greeting familiar faces along the way. Her days are a demanding mix of individualized instruction, emotional support, and celebrating small, hard-won victories with her students\u2014a spoken word, a completed puzzle, a new friendship.\n\nNow 54, Maya\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She cares for her aging mother, who lives with her. Her social circle consists of a few fellow teachers and neighbors, with whom she shares dinners and foggy walks along the beach. Her father, who passed away ten years ago, eventually came to respect her chosen path after witnessing the devotion her students\u2019 parents had for her. Maya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or travel, but of legacy: to mentor the next generation of special education teachers and to know that the children she taught have found their own place of value and belonging in the world."
