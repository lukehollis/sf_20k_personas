Raised in Fresno by Punjabi immigrant parents who ran a successful agricultural supply business, Priya was expected to follow a practical path. Her name, meaning \"beloved,\" was a daily reminder of her family's hopes for her to become a doctor or an engineer. She dutifully enrolled as a biology major at UC Davis, but the sterile labs felt alien compared to the colorful, expressive world she yearned for. A single elective in modern art history changed everything. It was a language she understood instinctively. Against her family\u2019s wishes, she switched her major, a quiet rebellion that set the course for her life.\n\nAfter graduation, she moved to San Francisco, drawn by its legacy of counter-culture and artistic freedom. The initial years were a struggle of shared rooms and cafe jobs, a stark contrast to the comfortable life her parents had offered. Her turning point came when she began volunteering at a small, independent art gallery. She wasn't an artist herself, but she had a gift for seeing the narrative in a collection and a passion for making art accessible to everyone.\n\nNow, at 37, Priya is the indispensable Gallery Assistant and Arts Educator at that same gallery. Her 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life; she lives in a small loft apartment directly above the gallery space. Her days are a seamless blend of personal and professional. Mornings start with emailing artists and preparing catalogs, while afternoons are for arranging new exhibits. Her greatest joy comes in the evenings when she teaches community art classes, guiding aspiring artists and curious retirees alike. Her social life is woven from the fabric of this community\u2014the artists she champions, the patrons who have become friends, and the students who share her passion.\n\nPriya\u2019s dream is no longer to appease her parents, who now watch her career with a sort of puzzled pride. Instead, she aspires to one day take over the gallery herself, transforming it into a premier space for emerging Bay Area artists, especially women of color. Her San Francisco is not the Golden Gate Bridge or the clang of cable cars, but the smell of oil paint, the murmur of an evening gallery opening, and the profound satisfaction of nurturing creativity in her small, beloved corner of the city."
