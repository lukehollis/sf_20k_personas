Raised in a pragmatic, multicultural family that bridged different worlds, she learned early on to see the landscape as a complex system of trade-offs. Her childhood was spent observing how agricultural runoff altered the local creeks and how whispers of drought could dominate every conversation, planting the seeds of a career dedicated to finding balance.\n\nThis drive led her to UC Davis for a degree in Environmental Science, where theory finally gave language to her observations. Her first job out of college was with a large corporate consulting firm in Sacramento, a soul-crushing experience she now calls her \"greenwashing phase.\" She spent two years writing reports that felt more about legal compliance than genuine impact. The turning point came during a project where her recommendations for wetland restoration were stripped down to a bare-minimum, publicly-marketable version. She resigned a month later, selling her car and using her savings to move to San Francisco, determined to work for herself and for causes she believed in.\n\nNow, at 35, Sarah\u2019s life is headquartered in a small, book-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is a zero-mile journey from her coffee maker to her standing desk, where she consults for non-profits and small municipalities on urban watershed management and green infrastructure. Her days are a disciplined mix of data analysis, grant writing, and client calls, but she always breaks at 4 PM. This is when she puts on her running shoes and disappears into Golden Gate Park, her true office, finding clarity along its shaded trails and feeling the pulse of the city\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nSocially, she maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow policy wonks, rock climbers, and artists she\u2019s met through volunteer clean-up days at Ocean Beach. While she\u2019s focused on her work, she hopes for a partnership with someone who shares her passion for tangible change. Her ultimate dream isn't wealth, but legacy: to be a key architect in restoring one of San Francisco's buried creeks to the surface, a project that would physically and symbolically reconnect the city to its natural roots. For Sarah, San Francisco is not just a home; it's her living laboratory."
