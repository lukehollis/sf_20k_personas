Born in Fremont to an Iranian father\u2014an exacting software engineer who prized pragmatism\u2014and an Indian mother who volunteered extensively at her temple and local food banks, Rohan\u2019s upbringing was a blend of analytical thinking and community-minded compassion. While his father hoped he would pursue a lucrative career in medicine, Rohan was more drawn to his mother\u2019s world of service.\n\nThe turning point came during his teenage years when his maternal grandfather, a recent immigrant who spoke little English, struggled to navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system after a minor stroke. Rohan spent weeks acting as a translator and advocate, witnessing firsthand how cultural and language barriers could create chasms in care. This experience ignited a passion not for curing disease, but for dismantling the systemic obstacles that prevented people from accessing help. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, choosing a Bachelor's in Public Health over a pre-med track, a decision that initially disappointed his father.\n\nAfter graduating, Rohan worked his way up from an outreach worker to his current role as a Program Coordinator. He now designs and manages health literacy programs for immigrant and low-income high school students, a job that feels like the direct fulfillment of the promise he made to himself in that hospital waiting room years ago.\n\nHis life is a testament to living by one's values in an expensive city. Rohan resides in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with a roommate, a short 2.5-mile Muni ride from his office. His daily routine involves a morning run in Golden Gate Park, a packed lunch to save money, and evenings spent either decompressing with his long-term partner, Clara, a public school teacher, or volunteering at a community garden.\n\nRohan loves San Francisco for its vibrant, chaotic energy and the communities he serves. Yet, the financial pressure is ever-present. His dream isn\u2019t wealth, but security. He and Clara aspire to one day buy a small condo in the city, a goal that feels daunting on their combined salaries. His larger hope is to see his programs create lasting change, empowering a new generation to become advocates for their own families\u2019 health, ensuring no one feels as lost as his grandfather once did."

Rohan presented his plan for a health resource guide for non-English speakers, inspired by his grandfather. Afterwards, his exacting father didn't praise his compassion. Instead, he pointed to the flowchart Rohan had made and said, \"This is a logical system. You've identified a failure point and designed an efficient solution.\" That pragmatic approval, framing his service in the language of engineering, was the bridge Rohan never knew he needed. It was reconciliation, offered as a compliment on system design.\n\n2.\nHe remembers a drizzly Tuesday night on their lumpy couch in the Inner Richmond, scrolling through impossible condo listings with Clara. The weight of their finances felt crushing. Defeated, he put his phone down. Clara leaned her head on his shoulder. \"It\u2019s not the drywall I want,\" she said softly. \"It\u2019s just a permanent place to be tired with you.\" In that moment, the anxiety lifted. Their shared dream wasn't about property; it was about building a sanctuary together against the city's pressures.\n\n3.\nEarly last year, a former student from his program, a quiet Ethiopian girl named Hanna, emailed him. She attached a photo of her mom, smiling, outside a dental office. \"I translated everything for her,\" the email read. \"She wasn't scared.\" Rohan stared at the screen, the fatigue of grant-writing and budget-cuts melting away. He wasn't just pushing papers. He saw his grandfather's scared face in that hospital room, and in Hanna's simple, powerful act, he saw the promise he\u2019d made to himself being fulfilled by another generation.\n\n4.\nDuring a morning run in Golden Gate Park, a thick fog blanketed everything, muffling the city's noise. He felt overwhelmed by work and the constant financial calculus of his life. As he crested the hill by Stow Lake, the sun pierced through the fog, illuminating the Japanese Tea Garden's pagoda in a single, brilliant beam of light. The sudden, breathtaking beauty felt like a personal message. It was a reminder of why he stays\u2014for these moments of grace that break through the gray chaos.\n\n5.\nHe will never forget the day his grandfather, then about a year into his recovery, came back from the corner store alone. He was beaming, proudly holding a mango and the morning paper. In a mix of Farsi and broken English, he explained how he\u2019d pointed and used the phrases Rohan had drilled with him. \"This one. Thank you.\" Seeing that spark of reclaimed dignity and independence in his elder's eyes was more profound than any medical cure. It was the blueprint for his entire career."
