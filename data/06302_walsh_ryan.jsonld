Growing up in Modesto, he was the steady older brother to a sister, Lily, who struggled with a severe anxiety disorder that made school a daily battle. He watched his parents, a mechanic and a teacher\u2019s aide, navigate a public school system that was ill-equipped to help. The turning point came when a dedicated, tenacious school social worker finally connected Lily with the right resources, transforming her life. In that moment, Ryan\u2019s future clicked into place.\n\nHe attended Sacramento State for his undergraduate degree in psychology, driven by a singular focus. For his Master of Social Work, he was drawn to the complex, diverse, and often inequitable landscape of San Francisco, enrolling at SF State. Upon graduating, he landed a uniquely demanding and fortuitous position: residential social worker at a private K-12 academy in the Presidio. The role came with a small apartment in a converted carriage house on the sprawling, manicured campus, solving the city\u2019s impossible rent equation. His commute is a 30-second walk across a dewy lawn.\n\nRyan's life is a study in contrasts. He lives on one of the most beautiful pieces of land in the city, yet spends his days navigating the messy realities of adolescence: family crises, academic pressure, and the hidden struggles of even the most privileged children. His days are a blur of one-on-one sessions, parent meetings, and crisis interventions. The 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse; he is never truly off-duty. The emotional toll of the job recently contributed to the end of a relationship with someone who couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d answer a student\u2019s frantic text at 10 PM.\n\nHe finds his release in long, solitary runs through the Presidio trails and on weekends, forcing himself to leave campus to explore the cafes of the Inner Richmond or lose himself in the stacks at Green Apple Books. He dreams of eventually building a life with a partner and finding a community outside the school\u2019s gates. For now, though, he remains tethered to his purpose, finding meaning not in the grand vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge from his campus, but in the small, vital victories of the young people he serves."
