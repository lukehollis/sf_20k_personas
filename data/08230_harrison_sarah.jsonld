The only child of a high school principal and a librarian, her childhood was ordered and predictable. She absorbed her parents' appreciation for systems and knowledge but yearned for a world with a less rigid moral compass and more vibrant, messy humanity. This led her to pursue a Master of Public Administration, a degree she saw not as a path to power, but as a toolkit for enacting meaningful change from within bureaucratic structures.\n\nHer twenties were spent in a sterile government job in Washington D.C., where she felt the spark of her idealism dimming. The turning point came during a vacation to San Francisco. The city\u2019s unapologetic diversity and thriving non-profit ecosystem felt like a homecoming. Within a year, at age 30, she had liquidated her life back east and moved into a small apartment in Cole Valley, taking a significant pay cut to work for a community housing organization.\n\nNow, at 49, Sarah is the indispensable Grant Administrator for a prominent social services non-profit. From her rent-controlled apartment, where her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to the bay window overlooking Kezar Stadium, she is a master of logistics and language. She translates the raw, urgent needs of the city\u2019s most vulnerable into compelling narratives that unlock crucial funding. Her life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her days begin with a coffee from Reverie Cafe, include a midday walk through the Panhandle, and often end with a glass of wine and conversation with her small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family since a long-term relationship amicably ended a decade ago.\n\nSarah\u2019s dreams are no longer about escaping, but about deepening her roots. She aspires to see the youth mentorship program she currently funds become a self-sustaining city institution. Personally, she dreams of taking a sabbatical to finally walk the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage not of faith, but of quiet reflection on a life purposefully built, one grant application and one neighborhood walk at a time."
