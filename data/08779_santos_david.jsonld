The son of Filipino immigrants, he grew up in the fog-laced streets of Daly City, a world away from the gleaming San Francisco skyline he could see on clear days. His mother, a registered nurse at Seton Medical Center, brought home stories of physical ailments and recovery. It was his father, however, a stoic and hardworking man who lost his long-term shipping job during David\u2019s teens, who taught him about the wounds you couldn\u2019t see. Watching his father retreat into a silent depression, a struggle the family had no language for, became the formative experience of David's life.\n\nThis feeling of helplessness propelled him toward a path of understanding. After earning his Bachelor's at UC Davis, he returned to the Bay Area to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. He found his calling not in policy, but in direct clinical practice. Today, as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, David works within a major San Francisco healthcare system, though his commute is zero miles. From his small, meticulously organized home office in the Inner Richmond, he conducts telehealth sessions with patients grappling with the psychological fallout of chronic illness, new diagnoses, and end-of-life care. He has become the person he wished his family had all those years ago: a calm voice offering tools to navigate emotional chaos.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm of intense empathy and necessary detachment. After his last session, he shuts his laptop and steps out into the city\u2019s cool air. He might walk through Golden Gate Park to decompress or head to Mission Cliffs for the focused, physical problem-solving of rock climbing. His social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly fellow therapists who understand the weight of their work.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; he sees it not just as a hub of innovation, but as a dense ecosystem of human struggle and resilience. His dream is to eventually open a small private practice specializing in grief counseling for families. He hopes to one day build a partnership with someone who understands the balance between holding space for others' pain and carving out room for his own joy."
