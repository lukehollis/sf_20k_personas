            "value": "Alex Volkov lives and breathes his work, quite literally. His world is contained within the polished concrete walls of a spacious live-work loft in Dogpatch, where his bedroom overlooks a private, state-of-the-art biological laboratory. The 0.0-mile commute is a core feature of his existence.\n\nBorn to a dissident Russian geneticist and a free-spirited American poet, Alex\u2019s upbringing in a remote part of the Oregon coast was unconventional. He never attended a formal school. Instead, his education was a curated curriculum of his mother\u2019s dense scientific textbooks and his father\u2019s library of philosophy and world literature. He was a prodigy, fluent in coding and molecular biology before he was a teenager, a mind that saw systems and patterns in everything from cellular automata to cloud formations.\n\nThe turning point came at age 19. His brilliant mother was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of frontotemporal dementia. Alex watched helplessly as the most formidable intellect he knew unraveled, her memory and personality dissolving into a fog of confusion and fear. Her death a year later did not break him; it forged him. His scattered intellectual pursuits gained a terrible, singular focus: to understand and halt the mechanisms of neurodegeneration.\n\nLacking credentials, Alex bypassed academia. He funneled his grief into research, publishing his groundbreaking theoretical work on protein misfolding on open-source forums. It caught the attention of a reclusive San Francisco tech billionaire, who saw in Alex not a lack of education, but a mind untethered by dogma. He was offered a position that didn't exist in a company with no public name: a research scientist with unlimited funding and zero bureaucracy.\n\nNow 28, Alex\u2019s life is monastic. His days are a cycle of simulations, genetic sequencing, and quiet contemplation. He has no real friends, only a professional relationship with his benefactor and a few lab technicians who deliver supplies. He doesn't know his neighbors or the name of the acclaimed new restaurant down the street. For him, San Francisco is not a city of culture and landmarks; it's the global nexus of capital and technology he needs to wage his war. His dream isn\u2019t wealth or fame, but a future where no child has to watch their parent fade away. Every successful experiment, every small breakthrough, is a quiet victory in a deeply personal race against the ghost that haunts his sterile, perfect lab."
