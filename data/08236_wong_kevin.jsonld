The only child of immigrants who ran a small but beloved neighborhood grocery store, Kevin grew up amidst the scent of produce and the quiet diligence of hard work. His parents preached a simple gospel: education was the ladder out. Kevin absorbed this lesson completely, finding refuge and exhilaration in the clean, predictable logic of numbers.\n\nHe excelled, earning a place at UC Berkeley and then pursuing a doctorate in a field far from finance: theoretical astrophysics. For years, his universe was one of black holes and quantum mechanics, a purely intellectual pursuit of cosmic truths. But the realities of academic life\u2014scarce funding, brutal competition for tenure\u2014began to wear on him. The turning point came during a visit home, watching his aging parents still stocking shelves. The abstract beauty of the cosmos felt impossibly distant from their tangible struggles. He made a pragmatic pivot, realizing his complex modeling skills were highly sought after by hedge funds.\n\nNow, at 45, Kevin is a quant, his battlefield the volatile global market. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to the home office in his sleek Mission Bay condo. His day starts before dawn, tethered to the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. He lives in a world of algorithms and predictive models, a silent, high-stakes digital war waged from his ergonomic chair. His connection to San Francisco, the city of his birth, is often through the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bay Bridge.\n\nSocially, his life is sparse. The intensity of his work left a past long-term relationship fractured, and his friendships are mostly with a few old grad-school colleagues he sees sporadically. He occasionally misses the collaborative energy of the physics lab. His dream isn't for more wealth, but for something less quantifiable: simplicity. He fantasizes about funding a scholarship for young physicists at Berkeley or taking a sabbatical to simply read and hike. Kevin Wong has successfully climbed the ladder his parents envisioned, but now, from the top, he finds himself looking for a way back down to solid ground."
