As the eldest daughter of rice farmers, her role was defined early: duty over dreams. Her high school education was a point of pride for her family, but it was understood that her future was one of labor and support, not academia.\n\nAt 25, sponsored by a distant cousin, Mei arrived in San Francisco. The American dream she'd imagined was quickly replaced by the stark reality of 14-hour days in a Chinatown garment factory. The work was grueling, the pay minimal, but she was disciplined, meticulously saving every possible dollar to send home. A turning point came when her cousin\u2019s elderly father had a stroke. Mei, with her innate patience and steady hands, became his informal caregiver. She discovered a quiet purpose in the act of caring for another, a sense of value that sewing buttons could never provide. This experience motivated her to leave the factory, take English classes at a local community college, and earn her Home Health Aide certification.\n\nFor the past seven years, Mei\u2019s world has been contained within the walls of a rambling Edwardian house in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is the ten steps from her small basement room to the first floor, where she cares for Mrs. Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but physically frail 92-year-old. Mei\u2019s days are a structured routine of medications, meal preparation, physical assistance, and companionship. Their relationship has evolved from employer-employee to a complex, familial bond built on shared silence and Eleanor\u2019s stories of old San Francisco.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to the city exists in brief, cherished moments: a solitary walk through Golden Gate Park on her afternoon break, the familiar chatter of vendors at the Clement Street Farmers' Market, and monthly video calls with her family in China from a bench overlooking Mountain Lake. Her social life is sparse, limited to polite nods with neighbors and occasional conversations with Eleanor\u2019s few visitors.\n\nHer dream is not grand; it is specific and tangible. Mei squirrels away money, hoping one day to afford a down payment on a small condo in the Sunset\u2014a place that is truly hers. A home where her schedule isn't dictated by another's needs, and where she can finally unpack the life she has so carefully carried with her."
