At age six, she, her parents, and her older brother fled Saigon in a crowded fishing boat, a memory that exists for her now only in fragmented images of saltwater spray and her mother\u2019s tight grip. They landed in a refugee camp before being sponsored by a church in Sacramento. Her parents, a former teacher and a pharmacist, took on grueling jobs in restaurants and cleaning services to build a new life, instilling in Lien a profound understanding of sacrifice and the invisible scars of displacement.\n\nThis understanding became the bedrock of her educational journey. She attended UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree, feeling a pull toward public service. It was during an internship at a community center in Oakland\u2019s Little Saigon that her path crystallized. Seeing families navigate the same bewildering systems her own had faced, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning her Master of Social Work.\n\nLien\u2019s career has been an extension of her life\u2019s purpose. For over two decades as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she has been a steadying presence for immigrant and low-income families. Her turning point was leaving a hospital setting for a position as a school social worker. It was here, working directly with children wrestling with trauma, poverty, and identity, that she felt she could make the most profound impact\u2014planting seeds of resilience for the next generation.\n\nNow 53, Lien\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco's Richmond District. She lives in a modest rent-controlled apartment, just a 0.7-mile walk from the public school where she works. Her daily routine is a comforting ritual: a brisk walk through the fog-laced avenues, lunch from a Clement Street dim sum spot, and afternoons spent listening to the quiet confessions of children. She is divorced and her daughter, Maya, is now a junior at UC Davis, a source of immense pride.\n\nLien\u2019s hopes are grounded and selfless. She dreams of seeing her daughter thrive, and perhaps one day traveling back to a peaceful Vietnam, not to reclaim a lost past, but to understand its shape. Her primary aspiration is to mentor new social workers, ensuring the communities she serves will always have a compassionate advocate. Her connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t in its landmarks, but in the resilient, multicultural families she walks among and serves every day."

His hands, which she\u2019d later learn had once carefully dispensed medicine, were chapped and red from the industrial dishwasher at the restaurant. He never complained, but in the slump of his shoulders, she saw the ghost of another life. That image became her first tangible lesson in silent sacrifice, a weight she felt a calling to one day help others carry.\n\n2.\nDuring her Berkeley internship in Oakland, she sat with an elderly Vietnamese woman trying to fill out a housing form, its dense English a fortress. The woman looked at Lien with a mixture of hope and weary defeat that she recognized instantly from her own parents\u2019 eyes. In that moment, her vague desire to \u201chelp\u201d sharpened into a specific, urgent purpose. These were her people. This was her work, and she committed to it with her whole heart.\n\n3.\nA few months into her new job at the school, a seven-year-old boy from El Salvador, selectively mute since his family arrived, handed her a drawing. It was a bird, flying away from a cage. He pointed to it and whispered, \u201cYo.\u201d The single word felt like a thunderclap in the quiet of her office. It was then she knew she\u2019d made the right choice leaving the hospital. This wasn\u2019t just about treating trauma; it was about helping a child find their own sky.\n\n4.\nStanding in Maya\u2019s dorm room at UC Davis, surrounded by posters and unfolded laundry, was a moment of dizzying temporal whiplash. She saw her daughter\u2019s future, full of choices she never had, and she saw her parents\u2019 exhausted faces, their dreams for her blossoming in their granddaughter. The feeling wasn\u2019t just pride, but relief\u2014a quiet exhale carrying the gratitude of three generations. The sacrifice had been redeemed.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on a particularly foggy Tuesday, she stopped for her usual har gow on Clement Street. The woman behind the counter, who rarely spoke more than the price, caught her eye. She gave Lien an extra dumpling and a small, tired, knowing nod. There were no words, but Lien felt the entire conversation: *I see you. I know this hustle. We are still here.* It was a communion more profound than any landmark, a reminder that this city was her true home."
