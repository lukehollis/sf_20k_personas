Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents who saw success through the lens of medicine and engineering, Anya was a studious child who spent more time exploring the Coyote Hills than the code her father wrote for a living. The true turning point came during a family trip to India at sixteen. Witnessing the stark juxtaposition of booming tech hubs and rivers choked with industrial and electronic waste solidified a mission within her: to reconcile progress with preservation.\n\nHer choice to pursue Environmental Science at UC Davis initially disappointed her parents, but her focus was unwavering. She excelled, driven by a pragmatic idealism, and continued to earn a Master of Science in Environmental Management from UC Santa Barbara. Anya\u2019s first job was with a nonprofit, where she quickly grew frustrated by the slow pace of change. She realized the entities with the most power to cause\u2014and solve\u2014environmental problems were the very tech giants she grew up around. She pivoted, rebranding herself as an environmental consultant specializing in the tech sector.\n\nNow, at 34, Anya lives in a sunny, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday is a fluid blend of video calls with corporate clients, deep dives into sustainability reports, and data modeling. She helps companies measure and mitigate their carbon footprint, design greener supply chains, and navigate e-waste regulations. Her daily routine is anchored by ritual: a morning cup of chai overlooking the fog roll in, a midday walk through the botanical gardens in Golden Gate Park to clear her head, and evenings spent either cooking, at her yoga studio, or with a small circle of close friends.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She feels more a resident of the Inner Sunset than of the city at large, valuing the local bakeries and the easy access to nature over the downtown bustle. Anya\u2019s ultimate dream is to guide a major tech corporation to achieve a truly circular economy, proving that her life's work\u2014bridging the world of her parents with the world she wants to save\u2014is not just possible, but profitable and necessary."
