Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood was defined by the rhythm of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Clement Street. She was the quiet, responsible daughter who translated official mail, balanced the register after school, and put family needs before her own nascent dreams. This sense of duty guided her educational path; instead of a four-year university, she attended City College of San Francisco, earning a practical Associate's degree in Office Administration to quickly enter the workforce and support her aging parents.\n\nHer career began as it continues now: a steady, reliable presence in a support role. For over two decades, she has been an administrative assistant, currently for a financial advisor in the Financial District. Her marriage to Mark Thompson in her late twenties was a hopeful chapter, bringing her a new surname and a son, Leo. However, the pattern of her youth repeated itself; she was the steadfast anchor to her husband\u2019s soaring ambition, a role that he eventually outgrew. Their divorce ten years ago was a quiet heartbreak but also a profound turning point, forcing Sarah to be self-reliant in a way she had never been before.\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is one of settled routine. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent, post-pandemic development. She works from a small, neat desk in the second bedroom of the same house she grew up in, which she inherited from her parents\u2014the only way she could afford to remain in the city. Her days are marked by familiar comforts: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, the hum of her computer during work hours, and tending to her small, lovingly maintained backyard garden in the evenings. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or trendy restaurants, but of legacy and memory, etched into the very sidewalks she walks.\n\nWith her son Leo now finishing college at SF State, Sarah finds herself on the cusp of a new chapter. For the first time, her life isn\u2019t defined by caring for others. Her aspirations are not grand, but they are entirely her own. She dreams of taking a pottery class, traveling to see the national parks, and perhaps finding a quiet companionship built on mutual respect. At 52, Sarah Thompson is slowly, thoughtfully, beginning to live for herself."
