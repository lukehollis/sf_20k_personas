The only son of Filipino immigrants\u2014a pragmatic nurse and an indefatigable HVAC technician\u2014Matthew grew up in a home where hard work was the highest virtue. His calling, however, was shaped by a profound sense of loss. He spent his teenage years witnessing the slow, heart-wrenching decline of his *lola* (grandmother) from a chronic illness, feeling helpless against the sterile, often impersonal nature of her care. While his parents provided practical support, Matthew saw the gaping need for emotional and systemic advocacy.\n\nThis experience became his compass. He attended San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree, drawn to the city's vibrant, chaotic energy. It was during his Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley that he found his focus. An internship at a palliative care unit solidified his mission: to serve those navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system at their most vulnerable. He saw his work not just as a job, but as an act of bearing witness, of restoring dignity where it was often stripped away.\n\nNow, at 35, Matthew\u2019s life and work are inextricably linked. The 0.0-mile commute is no error; he lives in a small staff apartment on the top floor of the supportive housing facility he helps manage in the Inner Richmond. His days are a blur of patient advocacy, crisis intervention, and navigating insurance bureaucracy. His morning routine involves a walk to a bustling cafe on Clement Street for a potent Vietnamese iced coffee before descending into the quiet, urgent needs of his residents.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. Evenings are for decompression, often spent on long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace under the cypress trees. His social circle is small but fiercely loyal, mostly consisting of colleagues who understand the emotional toll of their work. Matthew dreams not of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014for his residents and himself. He aspires to develop a community arts program within the facility and, one day, to find a partner who understands the porous, demanding boundary between his life and his calling."
