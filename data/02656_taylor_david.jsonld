            "value": "David Taylor was not born into the world of white walls and hushed art-speak he now commands. His story began in a factory town in the Midwest, where art was a framed print from a department store and success was a steady paycheck. Growing up, books and magazines were his escape, offering glimpses into a world of design, architecture, and creativity that felt a universe away. Eschewing a formal education that seemed disconnected from this vibrant, visual world, he left home at nineteen with little more than a keen eye and a restless ambition.\n\nHe landed in San Francisco in the early 1990s, drawn by its reputation for reinvention. David learned the art business from the ground up, not in a lecture hall but in the storerooms and loading docks of various galleries. He worked as a preparator and art handler, absorbing conversations about composition, market trends, and the delicate dance between artist and collector. His turning point came when he championed a young, unknown street artist from the Mission District, convincing his then-boss to risk a solo show. The exhibition was a critical and commercial smash, cementing David\u2019s reputation as a curator with an instinct for the cutting edge.\n\nNow, at fifty, David is the director and owner of a respected contemporary gallery in SoMa. His life is a closed loop, contained entirely within the concrete-and-glass walls of his live/work loft; his commute is a short walk down a steel staircase. His mornings are for quiet contemplation in the empty gallery, coffee in hand, before the day\u2019s chaos of artist meetings, client calls, and logistical planning begins. Romantic partners have come and gone, often finding themselves in second place to a new exhibition. His most enduring relationships are with his artists, for whom he is a fierce advocate, critic, and mentor.\n\nHaving achieved the success he once only dreamed of, David\u2019s aspirations have shifted. He\u2019s less concerned with discovering the *next* big thing and more focused on building a lasting legacy. He dreams of creating an endowment to support emerging local artists, ensuring a new generation has the opportunities he had to fight for. More privately, he hopes to find a successor who shares his vision, someone to carry the gallery's spirit forward long after he\u2019s gone."
