Born to first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, her upbringing was a study in contrasts. Her parents ran a bustling, no-frills grocery store in the same neighborhood, instilling in their daughter a formidable work ethic and the expectation that she would pursue a stable, respectable career. Sarah dutifully enrolled at San Francisco State University, majoring in business, but her heart was never in it.\n\nThe turning point was meeting Mark Miller, a charismatic but perpetually broke ceramicist. He saw a creative spirit in her that she had long suppressed. Falling in love was an act of rebellion. She dropped out of college, married Mark, and adopted his very American surname, creating a gentle distance from her parents\u2019 disappointment. Together, they poured their life savings into opening The Albatross, a space for Mark\u2019s art and Sarah\u2019s keen eye for curation. For ten years, it was their shared dream.\n\nFifteen years ago, Mark died suddenly from a heart attack, leaving Sarah a widow at 34. The store became her anchor and her sanctuary. Managing it wasn\u2019t a job; it was an act of devotion to his memory and her own survival. Her daily routine is a quiet rhythm: waking to the sound of the N-Judah streetcar, tidying the shop, chatting with her regulars\u2014the elderly neighbors, young professionals, and fellow merchants who have become her de facto family. Her commute is a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nNow, at 49, Sarah feels a gentle stirring of restlessness. The shop, once a symbol of love and shared ambition, sometimes feels like a beautiful cage. Her quiet hope is not for wealth or expansion, but for a life beyond the store\u2019s four walls. She dreams of finally taking a pottery class herself, of traveling to see the coastal villages of Italy that Mark always talked about. Her aspiration is simple: to honor the past while finally carving out a small, sunlit corner of the future just for herself."
