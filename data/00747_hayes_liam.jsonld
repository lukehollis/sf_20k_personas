Raised in the manicured suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, he was the son of a pragmatic accountant father who preached stability and a mother who quietly filled sketchbooks with charcoal landscapes she never showed anyone. Liam followed the expected path, earning a business degree and landing a marketing job by 23. The fluorescent lights and corporate jargon felt like a slow death, a betrayal of the artistic spark his mother had covertly nurtured in him.\n\nThe turning point came at 28. After a particularly soul-crushing week creating a campaign for a new brand of yogurt, he quit. He sold his car, packed two bags, and moved to San Francisco to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in Sculpture, a field his father deemed \u201ca voluntary vow of poverty.\u201d In the fog-drenched, creatively charged atmosphere of the city, Liam finally felt at home. He fell in love with the process, the materials, and a fellow artist he would later marry and, amicably, divorce, both casualties of the financial strain of being creators in a city hostile to them.\n\nRealizing the near impossibility of supporting himself through his large-scale metalwork, Liam pivoted. He found his true calling not in creating his own art, but in creating opportunities for others. As an Arts Program Coordinator for a scrappy non-profit, he became a shepherd for the city\u2019s creative flock, writing grants, securing gallery space, and mentoring emerging artists.\n\nNow 48, Liam lives and works from his SOMA live/work loft, which explains his zero-mile commute. His space is a chaotic but comforting blend of office and studio; grant proposals share desk space with welding tools and half-finished sculptures that serve as relics of a past ambition. His daily routine involves a walk to a local cafe, hours of emails and Zoom calls, and evenings spent attending small gallery openings or offering feedback in a friend's studio. He dreams of establishing a permanent, affordable arts cooperative, a sanctuary against the relentless tide of gentrification. Liam is a fixture of his neighborhood, a man who traded personal acclaim for community preservation, finding fulfillment in keeping San Francisco\u2019s artistic heart beating."
