The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up to the rhythmic hum of dryers in her parents\u2019 small laundromat on Taraval Street. Their life was one of relentless work, and they instilled in Mei Lin a deep appreciation for stability. Her path, they insisted, should be straight and secure.\n\nHeeding their advice, Mei Lin bypassed the uncertainty of a four-year university. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It was a practical choice that led directly to a job. For over two decades, she has been a Quality Control Technician, a meticulous digital gatekeeper. From her quiet apartment, where her commute is a few steps from her bedroom to her desk, she spends her days hunting for bugs and imperfections in software builds, ensuring every product is flawless before it reaches the consumer. Her work is precise, logical, and solitary, mirroring the life she was taught to value.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with the passing of her father. Sorting through his few possessions, she realized his entire life had been about providing, with little room for personal joy. The realization settled uncomfortably within her. Was her own life, a fortress of stability, also a cage?\n\nThis question sparked a quiet rebellion. Mei Lin bought a secondhand pottery wheel. In the evenings, after logging off from a world of code and circuits, she immerses herself in the tactile messiness of clay. The irony isn't lost on her: her days are spent finding flaws, while her nights are spent creating imperfect, handmade things. Her small circle of friends, mostly old neighborhood acquaintances, are the only ones who know about her hidden passion.\n\nToday, Mei Lin\u2019s life remains outwardly unchanged. She walks to the local market, cares for her aging mother, and finds comfort in the familiar Pacific fog. But inwardly, a new dream is taking shape. She hopes to one day rent a small studio space, to move from critiquing the creations of others to confidently sharing her own. Her greatest aspiration is no longer just stability, but to see one of her own beautifully imperfect ceramic bowls for sale at a local craft fair."
