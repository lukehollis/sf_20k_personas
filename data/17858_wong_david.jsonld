            "value": "David Wong\u2019s name has always been a conversation starter. The pale skin and blue eyes that stared back from his reflection never matched the surname given to him by the loving couple who adopted him as an infant. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset, David grew up in a traditional Chinese-American household. His parents, a seamstress and a Muni bus driver, instilled in him a profound respect for hard work and tangible skills. While his cousins were pushed toward universities, David was drawn to his father\u2019s garage, fascinated by the mechanics of how things were built and repaired.\n\nHe bypassed a four-year degree, seeing a more direct path at City College of San Francisco. His Associate's in Manufacturing Technology felt practical and honest. He started as a machinist in the late 1980s, his hands shaping metal in one of the city\u2019s few remaining industrial pockets in Dogpatch. Over three decades, he witnessed the industry shrink as the digital age boomed, but David adapted, mastering the complex programming of CNC machines and eventually earning his position as a shop supervisor.\n\nA brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably, leaving him with a cherished but distant relationship with his daughter, now a graphic designer in Portland. That turning point solidified his quiet, self-reliant nature. His life is a study in routine. Before dawn, he\u2019s in his Ford Ranger, driving the 8.7 miles from his small Sunset home, listening to classic rock radio as the city awakens. His work provides a deep sense of satisfaction\u2014creating physical components in a city increasingly obsessed with the virtual.\n\nEvenings are spent tinkering with a half-restored motorcycle in his garage or grabbing a beer at a no-frills neighborhood bar. David is a remnant of an older San Francisco, a man who values precision and reliability over disruption and hype. His main aspiration isn't a lucrative exit, but to train a new generation of machinists, to ensure the craft of making things with your hands doesn't completely vanish from the city that shaped him. He dreams of a simple retirement, smelling of sea salt and motor oil, not knowing or caring about the next big app."

Instead, he placed a small, heavy wrench in David\u2019s hand. \"This has a job,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"It fits. It works. You, David Wong, you fit here. You are my son.\" The cold weight of the steel felt more real than any schoolyard taunt. It was the first time he understood belonging wasn't about blood, but about function, fit, and love.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, a family dinner buzzed with talk of SAT scores and UC applications. David felt a gulf opening between him and his cousins. He looked at his father\u2019s grease-stained fingernails and felt a surge of pride, not shame. Later that night, he walked into the garage, the smell of gasoline a comfort, and declared he was enrolling at CCSF for machining. In his father\u2019s quiet nod, he found the only acceptance he needed. It was a choice for a tangible world he could hold.\n\n3.\nThe silence after his wife and daughter left was the loudest thing he\u2019d ever heard. The house, in his mid-thirties, felt hollowed out and impossibly large. He stood in the driveway until the evening fog rolled in, damp and familiar. He didn\u2019t feel anger, just a profound quietness settling into his bones. He retreated to the garage, flipped on a single bulb, and began methodically disassembling a carburetor. The intricate work filled the void. It was then he learned to rely solely on himself.\n\n4.\nThe first CNC machine arrived in the mid-90s, a beige behemoth that terrified the older machinists. They saw it as an ending. David, then in his late twenties, saw something else. He watched the lines of G-code scroll on the tiny green screen and felt a familiar curiosity. It was a new language for shaping metal, a puzzle of ultimate precision. While others resisted, he stayed late with the manuals. That quiet decision to adapt, not complain, is the reason his craft survived the digital wave.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young apprentice mangled a thousand-dollar piece of aluminum. The kid\u2019s face was pale with panic. The old David would have been furious. Instead, he just switched off the machine, its hum dying into silence. \"Show me what you were trying to do,\" he said, his voice calm. In that moment, seeing the kid's genuine desire to learn, his purpose shifted. The future wasn't just his own retirement; it was ensuring the hands of the next generation still knew what to do."
