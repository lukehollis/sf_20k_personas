Raised in a quiet, rain-soaked town outside Portland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and a high school history teacher father, he was brought up on stories of the past. It was no surprise when he enrolled at the University of Oregon to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History, dreaming of a life in academia. However, graduation in the late 2010s presented a harsh reality: a mountain of student debt and a barren job market for historians.\n\nThe key turning point came during a six-month stint back in his childhood bedroom. Faced with financial pressure, Liam took an entry-level data processing job at a small investment firm in Portland. To his own surprise, he excelled. The same mind that could trace the complex lineages of European monarchs found a similar satisfaction in tracking market trends and financial data. He was analytical, meticulous, and disciplined. He secured a promotion, then another, recasting himself as a financial analyst. He moved to San Francisco for a better opportunity, drawn by the city\u2019s vibrant energy and professional drive.\n\nNow 31, Liam\u2019s life is anchored in his Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as his office. The 0.0-mile commute offers a regimented freedom. His days begin with grinding local coffee beans and analyzing international markets before the sun crests Twin Peaks. Midday, he breaks for a walk to a neighborhood cafe or a stroll through Patricia\u2019s Green, a necessary reset from the endless spreadsheets. His social circle is small but tight-knit, consisting of friends made before his company went fully remote.\n\nWhile he is grateful for the stability his career provides, a quiet yearning remains. Liam\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder but to save enough to exit finance entirely. He fantasizes about opening a specialized bookstore or writing a non-fiction book on a niche historical event. For Liam, San Francisco is not an end but a means\u2014a city of immense opportunity that funds the quiet, scholarly life he once thought he\u2019d left behind."
