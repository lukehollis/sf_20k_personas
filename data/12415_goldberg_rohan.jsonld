The son of a literature professor from Mumbai and a social justice lawyer from New York, Rohan grew up navigating a rich, complex identity. His childhood was a blend of Diwali celebrations and Hanukkah nights, a dual heritage that fostered a deep curiosity about how people construct their sense of self.\n\nThis curiosity steered him away from the law and literature of his parents and toward the human mind. After earning a B.A. from UCLA, he pursued a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, driven by a turning point in his late teens. During a difficult period of wrestling with cultural expectations and adolescent anxiety, a compassionate school psychologist helped him find his footing. The experience was formative, igniting a desire to provide that same anchor for others. Today, Rohan works in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, providing mental health services to adolescents and young adults through a community health initiative. He finds immense purpose in helping youth, particularly those from immigrant or mixed-heritage families, navigate the pressures he knows so well.\n\nRohan\u2019s life is one of intentional moderation. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in NOPA, a neighborhood he loves for its blend of green space and local businesses. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute is a daily ritual, a meditative ride through the Panhandle that helps him transition between his personal and professional worlds. Evenings are often quiet, spent with a book, a close friend, or experimenting with the complex recipes from his parents.\n\nAt 40, Rohan feels a sense of settled purpose but not complacency. He is thoughtfully single after a long-term relationship ended two years prior, and he is content with his own company while remaining open to connection. His primary aspiration is to expand his impact, perhaps by developing a mentorship program that connects multicultural youth with professionals who share their backgrounds. For Rohan, San Francisco is not just a city; it\u2019s a living reflection of his own identity\u2014diverse, complicated, and always striving to create a space where everyone can belong."

            "value": "1. He remembers the worn armchair in Dr. Sharma\u2019s office at seventeen, the scent of her Earl Grey tea. He\u2019d just stammered through his anxieties\u2014the feeling of being two halves of a person, neither one whole. She didn\u2019t offer easy answers. She just listened, then said, \"You don't have to choose a side, Rohan. You get to build the bridge.\" It wasn\u2019t a solution; it was permission. A profound relief that made him feel truly seen for the first time, igniting the desire to offer that same anchor to others.\n\n2. When he was nine, Hanukkah and Diwali nearly overlapped. He remembers standing in the living room, the flickering light from his father\u2019s menorah mingling with the steady glow of his mother\u2019s clay diyas lining the windowsill. The air was a mix of frying latkes and cardamom. It wasn't confusing; it was magical. In that shared light, he felt his two worlds weren\u2019t in opposition, but were creating something uniquely, beautifully his own. The memory became a cornerstone of his identity: a space where everything could belong together.\n\n3. One foggy Tuesday in his mid-thirties, cycling through the Panhandle. The eucalyptus scent was thick, muffling the city's noise into a gentle hum. As he coasted, another cyclist gave him a small, knowing nod. In that simple, shared moment\u2014two strangers moving through the same quiet beauty\u2014San Francisco clicked into place. It wasn't about the grand landmarks, but this. This meditative, green corridor to his life's work. It cemented his love for the city, a feeling of being exactly where he was supposed to be.\n\n4. A year after his long-term relationship ended, he spent a Saturday night alone, determined to perfect his mother\u2019s chana masala. As the scents of cumin and coriander filled his quiet NOPA apartment, he wasn\u2019t lonely. He felt a profound sense of continuity, of being a link in a chain. The ritual connected him not to a lost partner, but to his heritage and to himself. It marked the moment he realized his contentment wasn't a placeholder, but a quiet, solid foundation he had built for himself.\n\n5. A few months ago, a 16-year-old client in his Mission office finally gave words to her turmoil, calling herself a \u201cbad translation\u201d of her parents\u2019 cultures. Rohan saw his younger self in her eyes. He gently shared that he once felt like a bridge still under construction. The girl\u2019s shoulders relaxed, a flicker of recognition replacing her despair. In her relief, Rohan felt a powerful, visceral sense of purpose. This was the work. His past wasn\u2019t just a memory; it was the key to unlocking someone else\u2019s future."
