The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, she grew up amidst the clatter of her parents\u2019 small neighborhood grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition at home and the burgeoning multiculturalism of the city streets. While her parents preached pragmatism and hard work, Mei was drawn to the beauty and history she discovered in books, a secret passion that led her to pursue an Art History degree at San Francisco State University.\n\nHer plan was to work in a museum, perhaps the de Young just a short bus ride away. To support herself through college, she took a part-time job at a small, independent boutique selling artisan home goods and gifts. She had a natural talent for it\u2014an eye for display, a calm demeanor with customers, and a sharp mind for inventory. The turning point came during her senior year when her father had a major heart attack. The stability of her retail job, with its steady paycheck, became a lifeline for her family. The uncertain path of an art curator felt like an impossible luxury. After graduation, she stayed on, was promoted to assistant manager, and eventually took over the store when the original owner retired.\n\nNow 51, Mei lives in the apartment directly above the shop, her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. Her life moves to the rhythm of the neighborhood. Her mornings start with a green tea from the cafe next door, where the barista knows her order by heart. Her days are spent managing staff, curating new products, and chatting with regulars who have become friends. She lives with her partner of fifteen years, Alex, a quiet graphic designer who shares her love for foggy evenings and exploring the city\u2019s hidden stairways. Every Sunday, she takes the bus to the Sunset to have dim sum with her aging mother.\n\nThough content, Mei never fully abandoned her first love. Her small apartment is filled with art books, and she dreams of one day taking a long trip to Italy to see the masterpieces she only studied in textbooks. She doesn\u2019t aspire to leave her life behind, but to enrich it\u2014to finally see the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, knowing her well-run shop and her well-loved city will be waiting for her when she returns."
