The daughter of an engineer and a dietician who emigrated from Uttar Pradesh, India, she was raised in a home that prized both academic excellence and community well-being. From a young age, she observed the subtle disparities in her diverse community\u2014how access to good food, preventative care, and even safe parks seemed to vary block by block. While her parents encouraged a secure path in medicine, Aanya was more interested in the systems that kept people healthy, or made them sick, in the first place.\n\nThis conviction led her to UC Davis for sociology and then to the East Coast for a Master's in Public Health. The experience away from California solidified her mission: she would return to the Bay Area and dedicate her career to bridging its glaring health equity gaps. Her early years were spent in the trenches, working for a nonprofit in the Mission District, creating bilingual health workshops for recent immigrants. It was here she saw the \"revolving door\" of emergency rooms for conditions that were entirely preventable, a turning point that fueled her ambition to work on a larger scale.\n\nNow 40, Aanya is the Director of Community Health Programs for a major healthcare system. She traded front-line advocacy for a bird's-eye view, her days spent in her quiet Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a routine she cherishes: a morning run through the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe, and then hours of analyzing data, designing outreach initiatives, and securing funding. Her work is her deepest connection to San Francisco\u2014she fights the city\u2019s inequalities from within its own institutions.\n\nThough professionally driven, her life is full. She maintains a close circle of friends, a mix of college pals and former colleagues. A long-term relationship ended amicably years ago, leaving her comfortably independent. Her dream is to launch a landmark program that measurably reduces maternal mortality rates among Black and Latina women in the city. For Aanya, success isn\u2019t just personal achievement; it\u2019s building a San Francisco that lives up to its progressive ideals, ensuring the health of one neighborhood isn't determined by its zip code."

Her friend, whose lunch was often just a bag of chips, stared with wide eyes. Aanya offered to share, but saw the flicker of shame and refusal in her friend's face. It was a silent, confusing lesson. That moment planted a question in her mind about fairness\u2014not just in lunchboxes, but in the invisible systems that filled them.\n\n2.\nYears later, working at the Mission District nonprofit, she saw Maria for the third time in two months. A young mother with unmanaged diabetes, her health instructions lost in a maze of poverty and language barriers. Seeing the weariness in Maria\u2019s eyes, Aanya felt a hot surge of anger\u2014not at the woman, but at the revolving door she was trapped in. It was then, around age 28, that she knew pamphlets weren't enough. The real work was in dismantling the door itself.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after her long-term partner had moved out, the quiet of her Hayes Valley apartment felt vast and heavy. She forced herself on her usual Panhandle run, expecting the loneliness to chase her. Instead, as the sun broke through the fog, a profound sense of peace washed over her. It wasn\u2019t loneliness; it was solitude. She felt the strength in her own legs carrying her forward, realizing her life, just like her home, was something she had built to stand on its own.\n\n4.\nHer first day as Director was just a day in her apartment, around age 38. The change was marked only by the silence. No clients in the waiting room, no ringing phones from the clinic floor\u2014just the hum of her laptop. Looking out her window at the city, she felt a pang of loss for the front lines. But then she saw the map on her screen not as streets, but as arteries connecting thousands of lives. The scale of the responsibility was terrifying, and utterly galvanizing.\n\n5.\nIt was a single line on a spreadsheet, viewed late one rainy Tuesday night last year. The maternal mortality rate for Black women in a single San Francisco zip code was six times the city average. The number wasn't data; it was a scream. All her ambition, her training, and her frustration focused into a single, sharp point of purpose. She pushed away from her desk, her heart pounding with a cold, clear anger. This was it. This was the fight she was uniquely positioned to lead."
