The daughter of an engineer and a dietician who emigrated from Uttar Pradesh, India, she was raised in a home that prized both academic excellence and community well-being. From a young age, she observed the subtle disparities in her diverse community\u2014how access to good food, preventative care, and even safe parks seemed to vary block by block. While her parents encouraged a secure path in medicine, Aanya was more interested in the systems that kept people healthy, or made them sick, in the first place.\n\nThis conviction led her to UC Davis for sociology and then to the East Coast for a Master's in Public Health. The experience away from California solidified her mission: she would return to the Bay Area and dedicate her career to bridging its glaring health equity gaps. Her early years were spent in the trenches, working for a nonprofit in the Mission District, creating bilingual health workshops for recent immigrants. It was here she saw the \"revolving door\" of emergency rooms for conditions that were entirely preventable, a turning point that fueled her ambition to work on a larger scale.\n\nNow 40, Aanya is the Director of Community Health Programs for a major healthcare system. She traded front-line advocacy for a bird's-eye view, her days spent in her quiet Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a routine she cherishes: a morning run through the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe, and then hours of analyzing data, designing outreach initiatives, and securing funding. Her work is her deepest connection to San Francisco\u2014she fights the city\u2019s inequalities from within its own institutions.\n\nThough professionally driven, her life is full. She maintains a close circle of friends, a mix of college pals and former colleagues. A long-term relationship ended amicably years ago, leaving her comfortably independent. Her dream is to launch a landmark program that measurably reduces maternal mortality rates among Black and Latina women in the city. For Aanya, success isn\u2019t just personal achievement; it\u2019s building a San Francisco that lives up to its progressive ideals, ensuring the health of one neighborhood isn't determined by its zip code."
