This duality shaped her worldview: a deep appreciation for empirical data balanced by a holistic understanding of natural systems. Growing up surrounded by redwood activism and eco-consciousness, a career in environmentalism felt less like a choice and more like a calling.\n\nHer educational path was linear and focused. She earned her bachelor's degree from UC Santa Cruz, where she spent weekends restoring coastal habitats. She then pursued a Master\u2019s in Environmental Management from Duke, eager to bridge the gap between policy and practice. Her early career at a large consulting firm in downtown San Francisco was successful but spiritually draining. The corporate bureaucracy felt antithetical to the very world she was trying to save.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. Following an amicable divorce and feeling burnt out, Sarah quit her job and took a formidable leap: she established her own independent consultancy. This risk redefined her life. Now, her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her light-filled home office in the Inner Sunset. Her clients are Bay Area tech companies and municipalities seeking to green their operations, and she thrives on the autonomy and direct impact of her work.\n\nHer days follow a comfortable rhythm. Mornings begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, her sanctuary just steps from her door. Work is a meticulous balance of data analysis, remote client meetings, and policy writing. Evenings are for herself: tending to her collection of succulents, perfecting her technique at a local ceramics studio\u2014a nod to her mother\u2019s influence\u2014or meeting her small, tight-knit circle of friends at a low-key wine bar on Irving Street.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She loves the city for its proximity to wildness, the ability to be immersed in nature and urban energy in the same hour. Her aspiration is to eventually buy a small plot of land in Sonoma, a personal project where she can implement the sustainable land management strategies she has spent her life advocating for."
