Raised by a stoic engineer father and a reserved schoolteacher mother, his childhood was stable but emotionally muted. The family\u2019s inability to navigate his younger sister's severe battle with depression and an eating disorder became the defining event of his youth. Watching her struggle, feeling powerless and frustrated by the lack of understanding around him, ignited a quiet resolve in David to dedicate his life to bridging such emotional chasms.\n\nThis newfound purpose guided his educational journey. He pursued a Bachelor's in psychology and then left the Midwest for a Master of Social Work (MSW) at UC Berkeley, drawn to the Bay Area's progressive approach to mental health. After graduating, he obtained his clinical license and accepted a position with a major San Francisco healthcare provider.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s commute is zero miles. His modest one-bedroom apartment doubles as his office, where he conducts telehealth therapy sessions with a diverse patient load, ranging from anxious tech workers to elderly patients grappling with chronic illness. His days are a structured rhythm of intense listening and meticulous note-taking. To decompress, he runs the winding trails of Golden Gate Park, a necessary ritual to shed the weight of his work before it seeps into his personal space. His social circle is small but deep, consisting mostly of other healthcare professionals who understand the unique pressures of the field.\n\nDavid finds profound meaning in his career, but the emotional cost is high, leaving little energy for romantic relationships. His dream isn't one of wealth, but of impact; he aspires to one day open a small, specialized practice for families supporting teens in crisis, creating the resource his own family never had. He remains in San Francisco not for its glamour, but for its need\u2014a quiet caregiver in a city that is constantly, restlessly, seeking to be understood."
