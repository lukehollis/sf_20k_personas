From her small live/work studio in the Mission District, she creates pastries that are as much miniature sculptures as they are desserts. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the life she has carefully built for herself, far from the one her parents envisioned.\n\nThe daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont, Priya grew up surrounded by the ambitions of Silicon Valley. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a project manager, expected her to follow a similar path: a STEM degree from a UC and a stable tech career. Priya tried, enrolling in community college with the intention to transfer, but her heart wasn't in coding; it was in the kitchen. She found solace in recreating the intricate sweets her grandmother taught her to make during visits to India, a comfort her parents dismissed as a hobby.\n\nThe turning point came at 20. Instead of applying to UC Berkeley for computer science, she secretly applied to City College of San Francisco\u2019s Culinary Arts program. The ensuing confrontation with her family was painful but liberating. She moved into her tiny SF studio, supporting herself with waitressing jobs while earning her Associate\u2019s degree.\n\nNow 27, Priya is a niche artist. Under the handle \"Sugar & Pigment,\" she has cultivated an Instagram following for her bespoke pastry creations. Her clients range from art gallery openings wanting desserts that mimic the exhibited works to tech companies seeking elaborate, branded cakes. Her days are a blur of early morning baking, meticulous decorating, and managing client communications. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of fellow creatives\u2014a muralist and a freelance photographer\u2014who understand the hustle.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is baked into her work. She finds inspiration in the vibrant murals of Clarion Alley and the delicate architecture of the Palace of Fine Arts. Her dream is to one day open a small patisserie, a gallery where every piece is edible. She hopes to fuse French technique with the bold flavors and intricate designs of her Indian heritage, finally proving to her family, and herself, that art can be a viable and beautiful way of life."
