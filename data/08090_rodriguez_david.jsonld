Born and raised in the Mission District, he was the son of Salvadoran immigrants who taught him the value of tangible work. While his friends chased tech dreams, David found his calling in his father\u2019s garage, fascinated by how things were made. He saw a nobility in skilled labor that others overlooked.\n\nAfter high school, he bypassed the traditional four-year university path for an Associate's degree in Industrial Technology from City College of San Francisco. It felt practical, real. He landed an entry-level job at a high-end metal fabrication workshop in Dogpatch that crafted custom architectural fixtures. For fifteen years, he honed his skills on the floor, learning every machine, every process, and every material. His turning point came not from a single event, but from a decade of quiet competence. When his supervisor retired, David was the undeniable successor.\n\nNow 45, his life is uniquely integrated with his work. A few years after a quiet divorce, he moved into a converted loft apartment directly above the workshop, reducing his commute to a single flight of stairs. His day starts before the city wakes, with a coffee on his balcony overlooking the industrial waterfront, the scent of ozone and cooling metal already faint in the air. His social life revolves around his crew\u2014a dozen skilled workers he mentors with a firm but paternal hand. He\u2019ll share beers with them at a nearby pub on Fridays, the conversations always circling back to work.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of scenic overlooks or trendy restaurants, but of the pre-dawn glow on the Bayview shipyards and the satisfaction of shipping a perfectly crafted product. His quiet aspiration isn\u2019t a grand exit but deeper ownership. He hopes to one day buy a small stake in the company, cementing his legacy not in code or capital, but in the enduring, tangible things he helps create."
