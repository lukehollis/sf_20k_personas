Growing up in a quiet, predictable suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, she was the daughter of a pragmatic accountant and a history teacher. While her parents valued spreadsheets and timelines, Sarah found her joy in meticulously arranging her bedroom, creating elaborate dioramas, and spending hours curating the perfect bookshelf. Her childhood was a quiet rebellion of aesthetics against practicality.\n\nHer journey west began at Ohio State University, where she majored in Communications with a minor in Art History. The true turning point was a semester abroad in Florence, Italy. Amidst the masterworks of the Renaissance, she was most captivated by the city\u2019s shop windows\u2014each a miniature art installation designed to tell a story and evoke desire. It was there she realized her calling: the intersection of commerce and art.\n\nAfter graduation, the Midwest felt too confining. Sarah packed her car and drove to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation for creativity and independent spirit. She started on the sales floor of a large department store, but quickly distinguished herself with her natural talent for creating eye-catching displays. Within two years, she was recruited by a high-end independent boutique in Hayes Valley to be their Visual Merchandising Manager.\n\nNow 27, Sarah\u2019s world is a curated one-block radius. She lives in a small studio apartment directly above the boutique she manages, making her commute a single flight of stairs. Her days begin with an espresso from a local cafe and a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green before she descends into the store, transforming it with fabrics, light, and form. Her social life is woven into the neighborhood fabric, consisting of dinners with other local creatives and quiet evenings sketching designs in her apartment overlooking the bustling street.\n\nSan Francisco, specifically Hayes Valley, is not just where Sarah lives; it\u2019s the canvas for her life\u2019s work. Her dream is to one day open her own concept store\u2014a space filled with locally sourced goods and vintage finds. Every perfectly draped mannequin and artfully arranged shelf is a step toward that future, a testament to the girl from Ohio who is building her own beautiful world, one display at a time."
