Born in a modest apartment in Nanjing, China, he was the only child of two factory administrators who pinned their hopes on his education. While they envisioned a future for him in engineering, Wei was a dreamer, losing himself in pirated translations of Western novels. This passion led him to pursue a surprising Bachelor's degree in English Literature, a choice that bewildered his practical-minded parents.\n\nThe siren song of the first dot-com boom pulled him across the Pacific in 1998. San Francisco felt like the center of the world, a chaotic and thrilling frontier. His English degree, once a point of family contention, was his entry ticket, allowing him to navigate the new culture. However, when the bubble burst, he found his literary skills were no match for a collapsing market. Facing the harsh reality of needing stable work, Wei pivoted. He enrolled in a community college IT certification program, discovering a methodical patience within himself for untangling digital knots. He traded prose for Python scripts and found his footing in IT support, a field of concrete problems and solvable solutions.\n\nA key turning point was his marriage in his early thirties and the subsequent birth of his daughter, Maya. The relationship eventually frayed, strained by his introversion and the relentless pace of Bay Area life, ending in an amicable divorce a decade ago. Now, his life is defined by a comfortable, solitary rhythm. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to a desk in the corner of his living room in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHis days are a predictable loop: a morning walk in the damp quiet of Golden Gate Park, followed by eight hours of troubleshooting for unseen colleagues across the country. He is a digital ghost, the calm voice that restores a lost connection or fixes a software bug. Evenings are for simple, home-cooked meals and video calls with Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA. His connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal; it's the specific aroma of the bakery on Clement Street, the familiar call of the N-Judah, and the cool embrace of the fog rolling in. Wei\u2019s grand dreams have been replaced by a focused aspiration: to see Maya thrive, unburdened. Perhaps, one day, he\u2019ll have the quiet space to finally write the stories he once only consumed."
