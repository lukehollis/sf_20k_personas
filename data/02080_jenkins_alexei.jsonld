The son of a pragmatic Russian immigrant mother, a literature professor, and a third-generation Welsh-American father, a small-town lawyer, Alexei grew up in a household that valued intellectual rigor and quiet stability. His name was a compromise, a bridge between two worlds. He was pushed towards a pre-law track in college, a path that felt logical but hollow. The turning point came during a volunteer stint at a legal aid clinic, where he spent more time connecting with clients about their housing and health crises than he did on their paperwork. He realized he wasn't interested in arguing cases; he was driven to mend the systemic cracks people fell through.\n\nThis epiphany led him to abandon law for social work. He pursued a Master of Social Work (MSW) at the University of Michigan, focusing on healthcare. San Francisco, with its progressive reputation and complex public health challenges, was a natural next step. He was drawn to the city's promise of acceptance and its fierce commitment to social services. After a grueling internship and two years of supervised practice, he earned his LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) credentials.\n\nNow at 35, Alexei lives and works from his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, his commute a 0.0-mile shuffle from his bedroom to his desk. As a telehealth social worker for a major hospital, he is a lifeline for patients navigating daunting diagnoses, Byzantine insurance systems, and the emotional fallout of illness. His days are a cascade of video calls, resource coordination, and writing meticulously detailed case notes.\n\nTo decompress from the constant exposure to trauma, Alexei finds sanctuary in routine. He starts each day with a walk to a small bakery on Clement Street for coffee and ends it with a run through the Presidio, letting the Pacific wind scour his thoughts. His social circle is small but fiercely loyal, comprised of friends who understand the need for both deep conversation and comfortable silence. While he hopes for a lasting romantic partnership, the emotional armor his job requires is difficult to shed. Alexei's dream is to eventually move from crisis intervention to policy advocacy, working to fix the broken systems he guides his patients through every day. He came to San Francisco seeking purpose, and while he found it, he now aspires to find a sustainable peace within it."
