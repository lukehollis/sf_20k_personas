Raised by a high school history teacher father and a librarian mother, his childhood was a stable world of books, civic discourse at the dinner table, and an ingrained respect for public institutions. He was a thoughtful, observant kid who was more interested in the \"why\" behind societal rules than in breaking them.\n\nThe turning point came during his senior year of high school when a contentious rezoning proposal for a low-income housing project divided his community. Ethan attended the fiery city council meetings, witnessing firsthand how data, emotion, and political power collided. He saw how well-researched arguments could be drowned out by fear-mongering, and it ignited a passion within him. He no longer wanted to just study history; he wanted to shape it, one meticulously researched brief at a time.\n\nThis new purpose drove him through his undergraduate studies at UC Davis and eventually to a Master of Public Policy program at UC Berkeley. Moving to the Bay Area was an intellectual and cultural awakening. He thrived on the energy and the complex, pressing challenges the region faced. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted role as a Policy Analyst for a city government department in San Francisco.\n\nNow 26, Ethan lives a life defined by quiet focus. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to the desk in the corner of his living room in his Inner Sunset apartment, which he shares with two other graduate school alumni. His days are a disciplined routine: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, deep dives into housing data and transportation reports, and a late afternoon walk to a local cafe to break the monotony of his apartment. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle, centered on intellectual debates with his roommates and weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nHe feels a profound connection to San Francisco, not through its nightlife or landmarks, but through its problems. He sees the city as a complex puzzle he is helping to solve. His dream is to eventually lead a major policy initiative\u2014something tangible, like a transportation overhaul or a new homelessness prevention program\u2014and leave a lasting, positive mark on the city he analyzes from his window each day."
