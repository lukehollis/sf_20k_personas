Her parents, both academics from St. Petersburg, left the crumbling Soviet Union in the early 90s, trading cultural richness for the promise of stability in the Bay Area. Raised in a home where intellectual rigor was the highest virtue, Anastasia absorbed their quiet determination. She excelled, channeling her aptitude for logic into a mathematics undergrad degree, followed by a demanding Master's in Financial Engineering from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career unfolded as planned at a major downtown bank. She mastered the work but chafed at the performative culture. The true turning point came not from a career move, but from a confluence of personal and global events. The end of a serious long-term relationship in late 2019 left her feeling adrift, and the subsequent pandemic lockdown provided an unexpected refuge. Working from home, she discovered a profound sense of focus and peace away from the office floor. When her boutique investment firm made remote work permanent, she embraced it completely.\n\nNow, Anastasia\u2019s world is contained within her elegant NOPA apartment, her commute a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to the bay-windowed desk overlooking a quiet street. Her days are built on a disciplined routine: a morning run through the Panhandle, hours of deep focus analyzing market volatility, a home-prepped lunch, and an afternoon walk to a local cafe for a change of scenery. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few trusted friends from her graduate program and her younger brother, a software engineer in the East Bay.\n\nHaving achieved the financial security her parents sacrificed everything for, a new question quietly asserts itself. She finds herself scrolling through volunteering opportunities and reading about social impact investing. The precise, logical mind that built her career is now contemplating a different kind of return. Anastasia dreams of redirecting her skills toward building something more meaningful than wealth, hoping to find a new variable to solve for in the equation of her life."
