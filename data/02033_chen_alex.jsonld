The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store in the Richmond District, his childhood was a landscape of foggy avenues, the clang of the N Judah streetcar, and the unwavering belief that hard work was the only true currency. His parents, pragmatic and risk-averse, hoped he would pursue a stable profession like medicine or law.\n\nAlex, however, was fascinated by systems. He saw the city not as a collection of buildings, but as a living organism of movement, commerce, and human interaction. This passion led him to a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. His dream was to work for the city, shaping the physical environment for the better. But graduating in the early 2000s, he found public sector opportunities scarce and slow-moving. Simultaneously, a different kind of city was being built online.\n\nA friend convinced him his skills in analyzing systems and user behavior were perfect for the burgeoning tech industry. Alex made the pivot, a decision that always felt like a pragmatic betrayal of his original dream. He excelled, his unique perspective allowing him to design digital products that felt intuitive and human-centric. His career flourished as he climbed the ranks of major tech firms, culminating in his current role as a senior consultant.\n\nThis success, however, came at a personal cost. A decade-long marriage, strained by his intense focus on work, ended amicably three years ago. This was a critical turning point, leading Alex to buy his current condo in Mission Bay. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, his home a meticulously controlled environment. His days are a disciplined routine of video calls with global clients, deep-work sessions fueled by third-wave coffee, and solitary runs along the Embarcadero.\n\nNow 46, Alex looks out from his floor-to-ceiling windows at the Bay Bridge, a monument of engineering he once studied. He feels a quiet pride in his success but also a persistent ache\u2014a sense that he\u2019s building digital worlds while the physical one he loves grapples with the very changes his industry fuels. His future aspiration is to finally bridge that gap: to launch or fund a civic tech startup that applies his product expertise to solve tangible urban problems like housing or transit, finally aligning the planner with the technologist."
