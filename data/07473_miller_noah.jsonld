Raised in Madison, Wisconsin, by a history teacher father and a librarian mother, Noah\u2019s childhood was filled with books, thoughtful debate, and the belief that understanding the past was the key to navigating the future. He followed this path logically, earning a Bachelor of Arts in History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, envisioning a life in academia.\n\nThe turning point came during a post-graduation slump. Faced with limited job prospects, Noah felt adrift, his deep knowledge of the Peloponnesian War suddenly feeling useless. On a whim, after a friend suggested it, he enrolled in an intensive online data analytics bootcamp. He discovered that the same skills he used to find patterns in historical texts\u2014identifying trends, connecting disparate events, and building a narrative from raw information\u2014applied perfectly to data sets. He had found a modern application for his classical mind. Two years ago, he took a leap, moving to San Francisco for a junior analyst role at a mid-sized tech company.\n\nToday, Noah lives and works in a small, meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured by routine. He starts with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, then spends hours immersed in spreadsheets and data visualization tools, finding stories within numbers. His social life is small but meaningful, revolving around a weekly trivia night with a few colleagues and weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nWhile he appreciates the city's dynamic energy and the career opportunities it provides, he sometimes feels a cultural disconnect from his Midwestern roots. His dream is to eventually bridge his two worlds, aspiring to a senior data role at a museum or a non-profit focused on historical preservation. For Noah, the ultimate goal isn't just to analyze data, but to use it to connect the present to the past, finally making his father proud in a way neither of them ever expected."
