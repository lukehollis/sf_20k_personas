Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, she is the only child of a pragmatic seamstress from Guangzhou and a poetic Irish-American bartender from Boston. Her name itself was a compromise, a blend of heritages that defined her childhood. Her father\u2019s lyrical stories of County Cork mingled with her mother\u2019s quiet diligence at the sewing machine, all set against the backdrop of fog rolling down Clement Street. The family wasn\u2019t wealthy, but their small apartment was rich with the scent of her mother\u2019s cooking and the sound of her father\u2019s laughter.\n\nHer formal educational journey was brief. After high school, Mei enrolled at City College with vague notions of studying art history, but she left after two semesters to help care for her father, whose health had begun to fail. This sacrifice marked a turning point, steering her toward the workforce. She found a natural home in retail, working in a dusty bookstore and later a chic Hayes Valley boutique. Without a degree, she learned through observation, developing an intuitive sense for curation, display, and, most importantly, people. She understood that selling an object was really about connecting with the story a customer was telling themselves.\n\nThe pivotal moment of her life came fifteen years ago when the elderly owner of \"The Gilded Page,\" a specialty shop selling artisanal paper, vintage books, and unique stationery where she worked as a manager, decided to retire. Using a small inheritance from her mother and a modest business loan, Mei bought the store. She renamed it \"Fenestra\"\u2014Latin for window\u2014and moved into the small apartment above it. Her commute became a single flight of stairs. The shop is her sanctuary and her life's work, a reflection of her own identity: a carefully curated collection of disparate, beautiful things that somehow belong together.\n\nNow at 48, Mei\u2019s life is one of quiet rhythm. Her days are structured around opening the shop, chatting with regulars who have become friends, and sourcing new items from local artists. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a weekly dinner with another local shop owner and holiday gatherings with her suppliers. She has no grand dreams of expansion or franchising. Her aspiration is to see Fenestra remain a beloved neighborhood institution, a quiet anchor in an ever-changing city. It is her connection to her past, a tribute to her parents' blended legacy, and her own small, beautiful mark on the San Francisco that raised her."

Her father\u2019s deep voice rolled through a Yeats poem while, across the room, the only sound from her mother was the quiet, rhythmic slip of a needle through denim. The scent of steamed rice mingled with the rainy petrichor clinging to her father\u2019s coat. It wasn't a contradiction, but a harmony. In that moment, she first understood that beautiful things didn\u2019t have to match; they just had to exist together with love. It became the guiding principle for her entire life.\n\n2.\nThe receiver of the City College payphone felt cold against her ear. On her lap was a heavy art history book, open to a chapter on Renaissance frescoes. But all she could hear was the new hesitation in her father's voice, a fragility that cut through the lyrical Boston Irish accent. There was no dramatic decision. In that instant, the vibrant colors on the page faded to monochrome. Her path was no longer theoretical. Love, she realized, was a practical, hands-on thing. It was about showing up, even if it meant leaving a dream behind.\n\n3.\nHer first night as the owner, she stood alone inside the dusty, silent shop. It still smelled of its former owner\u2014of violet candies and old paper. The small inheritance from her mother, folded into a bank check, felt impossibly heavy in her pocket. A wave of terror and exhilarating possibility washed over her. It was a space built on her mother\u2019s pragmatism and her father\u2019s love for beautiful stories. Looking at the grimy front window, she whispered its new name, Fenestra, into the dark. It was a promise to them both.\n\n4.\nA young man, his shoulders tight with unspoken grief, lingered by the journals. He wanted something to write down memories of his grandmother. Mei didn\u2019t speak, but watched his hands hover. She quietly placed a small, soft leather journal on the counter, its paper thick and creamy. \"This one holds ink well,\" she said softly, \"It won\u2019t let the words fade.\" He met her eyes, and the gratitude in them was a quiet affirmation. This was why she was here: not just to sell objects, but to offer vessels for human stories.\n\n5.\nJust last week, she woke before dawn and looked out her apartment window. A thick, silent fog had rolled in from the ocean, erasing the sharp edges of Hayes Valley and muffling the world. Below, she could hear the gentle hum of the shop\u2019s refrigerator, its motor like a steady heartbeat. She felt no loneliness, only a profound sense of placement. This small square of San Francisco\u2014this shop, this apartment, this view\u2014was the life she had built. It was more than enough. It was everything."
