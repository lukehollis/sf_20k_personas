The daughter of an Oaxacan immigrant mother and an African American architect father, she grew up in Hayward, a world away from the postcard San Francisco she now calls home. Her childhood was a blend of her mother\u2019s vibrant cooking and stories of a tight-knit community, and her father\u2019s blueprints and quiet passion for the structure of urban life. This dual heritage instilled in her a deep appreciation for both the soul and the skeleton of a city.\n\nHer path was focused. After an undergraduate degree at UC Davis, she pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, determined to influence the public spaces that shape lives. She saw city planning not as an abstract exercise but as a tool for social equity. Landing a junior planner position with the City of San Francisco was a dream realized. Over the past decade, she has diligently worked her way up, becoming a respected Program Manager known for her meticulous work on pedestrian safety and public space revitalization projects.\n\nA key turning point was managing the approval and implementation of a new cultural district in the Mission, a project that felt deeply personal. It forced her to navigate the delicate balance between preservation and development, a conflict she sees as the city\u2019s defining struggle.\n\nNow 35, Aisha lives a life of intentional proximity. Her modern Hayes Valley condo is a short walk from City Hall, rendering her commute non-existent. Mornings begin with a run past the opera house, followed by coffee from a local cafe before settling into a day of virtual meetings and policy analysis. Her social life is a small, close circle of friends, a mix of colleagues and old university pals. Recently single after a long-term relationship ended, she is rediscovering her own rhythm.\n\nAisha\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and profound. She doesn't just live in the city; she studies its patterns, mourns its losses, and champions its potential. Her dream is to lead a major housing initiative, creating tangible solutions to the affordability crisis that threatens the diverse fabric she so cherishes. She aspires to build a future for San Francisco that is as inclusive and resilient as her own mixed heritage."
