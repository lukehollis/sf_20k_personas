The only child of a UC Berkeley political science professor and a corporate lawyer, his childhood in the Berkeley hills was one of dinner-table debates and an expectation of rigorous thought. He dutifully followed the prescribed path, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from UCLA before heading east for a Master of Public Policy from Georgetown, drawn to the heart of American power.\n\nHis early career was a blur of ambition in Washington D.C., first as a legislative aide and then as an analyst for a federal agency. It was there he met and married his ex-wife, another driven policy wonk. For a decade, their lives were a tandem sprint of long hours, networking events, and career advancement. The turning point was less a dramatic explosion than a slow erosion. The demanding pace that fueled their careers starved their marriage, and an amicable but painful divorce at 40 served as a stark catalyst for change. Burnt out on the D.C. machine, Alex accepted a lucrative offer from a San Francisco-based consultancy, seizing the chance to return to the Bay Area on his own terms.\n\nNow, Alexander\u2019s world is contained within a few square miles of his Cole Valley Victorian. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to the standing desk in his bay-windowed home office. His days are a disciplined routine: an early morning run through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park, coffee from his favorite local cafe, then hours spent dissecting policy documents and building data models for corporate and municipal clients. His professional life is conducted entirely through encrypted video calls and secure servers.\n\nSocially, his circle has shrunk to a comfortable core\u2014a few old friends and his aging parents, whom he visits in Berkeley on weekends. He loves the city not for its nightlife but for its proximity to nature and its quiet, neighborhood-centric corners. At 47, professional achievement feels solid but incomplete. He finds himself dreaming less of career milestones and more of personal connection, wondering if he could apply his analytical skills to a local housing non-profit, or simply find a partner with whom to share the quiet rhythm of his meticulously curated life."
