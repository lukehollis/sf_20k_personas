They envisioned a traditional path: a prestigious university degree followed by a career as a doctor or engineer. Siddharth obliged at first, enrolling in a biology program at a Texas university. He was diligent but uninspired, finding more joy in the logic of video games and the patterns in vast datasets he explored as a hobby than in his organic chemistry textbook.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. He realized he was pursuing a dream that wasn't his own. Over his parents\u2019 anxious objections, he finished his biology degree to honor their sacrifice but immediately enrolled in an intensive six-month data science bootcamp. It was a gamble, trading a secure path for an uncertain one. The bootcamp was grueling but exhilarating; for the first time, his work felt intuitive and deeply engaging.\n\nUpon graduating, he landed a remote position as a Data Analyst for a fledgling tech company. This job was his ticket to San Francisco, a city he\u2019d only seen in movies but felt drawn to for its reputation of rewarding ambition over pedigree. He found a small but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose quiet residential streets and proximity to Golden Gate Park offered a welcome contrast to the city's chaotic energy.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured around his standing desk in the corner of his living room. Mornings consist of coffee from a local roaster and virtual team meetings. He breaks up his afternoons with a run through the park, the fog rolling over the avenues feeling like a daily reset. Though a homebody by professional necessity, he\u2019s built a community through a weekly rock-climbing group and trivia nights at a pub on Clement Street. He\u2019s navigating the complexities of modern dating, but his focus remains on his craft.\n\nSiddharth aspires to eventually use his skills for a cause, perhaps analyzing climate data for a nonprofit. For now, he\u2019s focused on proving that his unconventional path was the right one \u2013 for himself, and for the parents he hopes to make proud. San Francisco, to him, isn't just a location; it's the landscape where he is building a life of his own design."
