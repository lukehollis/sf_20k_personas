His commute is zero miles; he lives in the residence where he works as a live-in Licensed Vocational Nurse. At 50, his daily rhythm is not his own, but that of Eleanor Vance, the 92-year-old widow he cares for in her stately Victorian.\n\nBorn in Daly City to a Filipino-American father who served in the Navy and a white mother from a small town in Oregon, Michael always felt like he was navigating two different worlds. He was a quiet, artistic kid who found solace in sketching the city skyline. In the 90s, he earned an Associate's degree in graphic design from an East Bay community college, dreaming of a creative career. For a decade, he drifted through freelance gigs and restaurant jobs, a familiar face in the Lower Haight\u2019s arts scene but never quite finding stable ground.\n\nThe turn came in his late thirties. His father\u2019s health declined rapidly from a stroke, and Michael moved back home to become his primary caregiver. The work was grueling but unexpectedly fulfilling. He discovered a deep-seated patience and competence in attending to another's needs, a purpose that his art had never quite provided. After his father passed, Michael, then 40, enrolled at the City College of San Francisco and earned his LVN certification.\n\nHis life now is one of quiet service. Mornings are for medications and helping Eleanor with breakfast; afternoons for quiet companionship, reading aloud, or managing doctor's appointments. His social connections are few but valued: a weekly video call with his sister in Portland and brief, friendly exchanges with the staff at the Japanese market on Geary where he buys specialty items for Eleanor. He feels like a ghost in the city's vibrant machine, his existence tethered to a single address.\n\nMichael\u2019s dream is simple. He is diligently saving his income, hoping to one day afford a small, quiet condo of his own, perhaps in the Outer Sunset. There, he imagines a life where his time is his own again\u2014a life with space for a canvas, the smell of oil paints, and the freedom to watch the sun set over Ocean Beach."

Lola was stirring a huge pot of adobo, its sharp vinegar scent filling the air, while his mom quietly arranged a Jell-O salad on the counter. He sat at the small table, sketching on a napkin, listening to the mix of Tagalog and his mother\u2019s soft Oregon accent. He felt like a quiet junction point between two worlds that loved each other but didn't quite overlap. It was the first time he understood his place was often in-between.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998, at a crowded group show in a Lower Haight cafe. A small red dot appeared next to his charcoal sketch of the Bay Bridge at dawn. For one electric moment, seeing that dot, he felt seen\u2014a real artist. The feeling was intoxicating, a promise of a creative life. But it was fleeting. The memory now feels like a ghost limb, a reminder of a path he almost took, a hunger that was validated for a single night before fading back into the city\u2019s noise.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the weight of the razor in his hand, his father\u2019s chin tilted up in the bathroom light. His dad, once so strong, was frustrated by the tremor in his own hand. Michael gently guided the blade, their eyes meeting in the mirror. In that silent, shared vulnerability, he felt a profound click of purpose he\u2019d never found in a sketchbook. It wasn't about creating something new, but about preserving someone precious. That single moment reoriented his entire life, setting him on the path to becoming a nurse.\n\n4.\nJust last winter, he stood at Eleanor\u2019s bay window, watching a young couple in hoodies share headphones on the sidewalk below, laughing into the fog. They looked like the kids he knew in the Haight, full of unwritten futures. He was invisible to them, a shadow behind ornate glass. The moment crystallized his feeling of being a ghost in his own city\u2014present, breathing the same air, but tethered to another\u2019s life, observing a world that moved on without him. It made his dream feel less like a want and more like a need.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, on a rare afternoon off, he took the N-Judah all the way to Ocean Beach. Huddled in his jacket on the cold sand, he watched the sun bleed into the Pacific. The sheer, empty expanse of it all felt like a promise of peace. On his walk back, he saw a small, sand-blasted condo with a \"For Sale\" sign. It wasn't a palace, but it was a possibility. The abstract dream of \"someday\" sharpened into a clear, tangible goal: that view, that quiet, that freedom. It gave his saving a purpose."
