Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she was the dutiful daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small corner grocery. Her parents, pragmatic and hardworking, envisioned a stable future for her in medicine or law. Sarah, however, spent her childhood filling sketchbooks with drawings of the city\u2019s crooked rooftops and colorful characters, a passion she kept largely to herself.\n\nTo appease her family, she pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Sociology at San Francisco State University, a compromise that allowed her to study people and culture while avoiding the perceived instability of an art degree. After graduation, she spent five miserable years in a corporate human resources role, the sterile office environment draining the life from her. The turning point came during a company-wide volunteer day at a struggling community center in the Mission District. Surrounded by the raw, vibrant energy of local artists and activists, Sarah felt an awakening. Within six months, she had quit her corporate job and accepted a part-time administrative position at that very center.\n\nNow, at 45, Sarah is the Arts Coordinator, a role she has molded over fifteen years. Her 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; she lives in a small apartment directly above the community center, its rhythms dictating her own. Her days are a blur of grant writing, organizing pottery classes for seniors, curating gallery shows for emerging local artists, and mediating disputes over mural wall space. Her social life is indistinct from her work; her closest friends are the retired painter who teaches watercolor and the teenage spoken-word poet she mentors.\n\nDeeply connected to the Mission, Sarah knows every taqueria owner and shopkeeper by name. Her dream isn\u2019t for personal wealth, but to secure a legacy grant that would renovate the center\u2019s aging theater and ensure its future. In quiet moments, after the center has gone dark, she sometimes pulls out her old sketchbook, aspiring to one day create a body of work that tells not just the story of her city, but her own."
