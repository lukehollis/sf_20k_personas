Raised in Fresno, he was the son of Mexican immigrants who instilled in him a profound work ethic; his father\u2019s hands were calloused from decades in the fields, his mother\u2019s from the canneries. They saw education as the key to a different life, and David, a voracious reader, obliged them by earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature from Fresno State.\n\nHis dream of a life in letters collided with the harsh reality of the post-dot-com bust job market in the early 2000s. Moving to San Francisco, he found that an English degree paid for coffee but not rent. This became his crucial turning point. Pragmatism eclipsing passion, David enrolled in night classes at City College, discovering an unexpected aptitude for network systems. He taught himself coding languages, earning certifications one by one, and methodically built a new career from the ground up as an IT Specialist.\n\nNow 43, David lives and works in a restored Edwardian flat in the Mission District, his commute a zero-mile walk from his bedroom to his home office. The choice of neighborhood was intentional\u2014a connection to the Latino culture of his youth, though he feels the growing tension as tech money reshapes the vibrant streets. His daily routine is a quiet rhythm: a morning coffee from a local panaderia, hours spent troubleshooting for a downtown tech firm via Slack and Zoom, and an afternoon walk through Dolores Park to clear his head.\n\nSocially, David is reserved. He maintains a small circle of long-time friends, mostly non-tech people he met in his earlier, scrappier days. He\u2019s a familiar, quiet face at local restaurants and bookstores, preferring the steady comfort of community over the networking events of his industry. His hope for the future is to find a better synthesis between the two halves of his life. He daydreams of finally writing that novel he outlined in college, perhaps a story about the changing face of California, a story he feels he is living every day."
