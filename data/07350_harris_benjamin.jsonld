Raised in a sleepy Portland suburb, his childhood was colored by the subtle weight of his mother's untreated depression. While his father provided stability, Ben became the family\u2019s emotional barometer, learning to read moods and de-escalate tensions before they began. This innate sensitivity initially led him to study psychology as an undergraduate, but he found academic theory emotionally detached from the messy reality he knew.\n\nA severe depressive episode his mother experienced during his junior year became his turning point. Witnessing the helplessness of his family and the profound impact of a single, compassionate social worker who helped them navigate the healthcare system, Ben found his calling. He enrolled at UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work, drawn to the Bay Area\u2019s progressive ethos and professional opportunities.\n\nUpon becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Ben took a demanding job within a large San Francisco hospital system. For over a decade, he worked with patients and families reeling from traumatic accidents and chronic illness diagnoses, a role that was both draining and deeply fulfilling. The pandemic shifted his entire department to telehealth, a change Ben unexpectedly embraced.\n\nNow, at 39, Ben is the architect of his own quiet life in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his coffee maker to a small home office in his apartment. His days are a succession of video calls, holding space for the fear and grief of strangers across the city. To decompress, he relies on a strict routine: long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park, rain or fog, and quiet evenings with his rescue mutt, Gus. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other healthcare workers who understand the need for gallows humor and unconditional support.\n\nBen\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its landmarks and more about its human tapestry. He feels the city\u2019s pulse in the stories his patients share. His dream isn't grand; it's to eventually develop a specialized support program for the families of chronically ill patients, turning the lessons of his own childhood into a structured, healing force for others."
