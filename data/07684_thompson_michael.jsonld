            "value": "Michael Thompson was given a name meant to open doors in America, a name his Hong Kong immigrant parents chose with hopeful deliberation. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset, his childhood was scored by the hum of the family laundromat and the unspoken pressure to outpace his parents\u2019 sacrifices. He wasn't a stellar student, but he was steady, graduating from high school with a vague notion of attending City College for business.\n\nThat future evaporated the summer he turned nineteen. His father was diagnosed with a fast-moving cancer, and Michael\u2019s life pivoted from school applications to working two jobs\u2014stocking shelves at a grocery store and washing dishes\u2014to help cover the family\u2019s mounting bills. His father\u2019s passing two years later left behind a void of grief and insurmountable medical debt. The family lost their cramped apartment, and with his mother moving in with relatives in Sacramento, Michael was suddenly adrift.\n\nHe found a foothold in the gig economy, first with ride-shares, then transitioning to a full-time delivery driver for a logistics company in the Bayview. The work was constant, and for a while, he managed a room in a shared house in Daly City. But as rents climbed relentlessly, his margin for survival shrank to nothing. Three years ago, he made a hard choice: he discreetly moved his life into his cargo van. His 0.0-mile commute is a technicality; his depot is his starting line, and his home is whichever industrial street is quietest for the night.\n\nMichael\u2019s San Francisco is not one of picturesque skylines but of loading docks, traffic-choked arteries, and the anonymous faces behind Ring doorbells. His days are a cartography of drop-offs, from Pacific Heights mansions to SROs in the Tenderloin. He knows the city\u2019s rhythm intimately, yet feels utterly disconnected from it. His primary social interactions are fleeting exchanges with warehouse dispatchers and a warm, daily chat with an elderly woman in Nob Hill to whom he delivers groceries, a brief interaction that reminds him of his mother.\n\nHis dream isn\u2019t wealth, but stability: a small studio apartment, the luxury of a real mattress, and the quiet dignity of a front door. He clings to the hope of one day having enough security to reconnect with his estranged sister, who sees his life as a failure. Until then, Michael Thompson remains one of San Francisco's invisible engines, a man who knows every street but has no place to call his own."
