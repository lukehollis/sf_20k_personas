            "value": "Elijah Miller was raised in the quiet, academic embrace of Eugene, Oregon, the only child of a history professor and a university librarian. His childhood was a peaceful landscape of rustling pages, the scent of old paper, and hushed conversations about the importance of preserving the past. This upbringing instilled in him a meticulous nature and a deep reverence for history, which he carried with him to Reed College, where he pursued a degree in Art History.\n\nIt was during a seminar on ephemeral art that Elijah found his calling. The idea that entire artistic movements could vanish with a corrupted hard drive or an obsolete platform filled him with a profound sense of urgency. This led him to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science with a focus on digital curation. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted position as a Digital Archivist for SFMOMA, a job that prompted his move to San Francisco.\n\nNow 31, Elijah lives a deliberate, contained life in a small but immaculately organized apartment in the Inner Richmond. Thanks to a permanent remote work arrangement, his commute is a ten-step journey from his bed to his desk. His days are spent in the digital ether, meticulously tagging metadata, managing server migrations, and preserving the fragile legacies of digital artists. His world is one of screens and code, a stark contrast to the fog-laced streets outside his window.\n\nElijah's connection to San Francisco is hyper-local. He knows the owner of his corner bakery by name and has a favorite bench in Golden Gate Park, his primary escape from the digital glow. His social life is small and intentional, anchored by a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, Clara, whom he met in grad school. Their connection thrives on scheduled video calls and planned weekend trips. His ultimate dream isn't fame or fortune, but to curate a definitive digital exhibition on Post-Internet Art, ensuring the works he so carefully preserves find a permanent, accessible home, safe from the digital decay he works tirelessly to prevent."
