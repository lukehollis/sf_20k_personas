As second-generation Chinese-Americans, they envisioned a straightforward path for their son: good grades, a practical degree, and a stable, prestigious career in medicine. Liam, dutiful and bright, followed the map they drew for him, enrolling at UC Davis with a pre-med track.\n\nHis turning point wasn't a dramatic rebellion but a quiet discovery in the hushed, sterile environment of an undergraduate research lab. While his peers memorized anatomy for the MCAT, Liam was captivated by the elegant, intricate dance of neurons under a microscope. He found more beauty in understanding the cellular cascade of Parkinson's disease than in the prospect of treating its symptoms. The decision to forgo medical school applications for a research position was met not with anger from his parents, but a quiet, worried confusion. It was the first time he had truly diverged from their path.\n\nNow, at 28, his world is confined to a few square miles. He lives in a small in-law apartment in the Inner Sunset, the fog rolling in most evenings as he walks home from his job at a UCSF lab on Parnassus Heights. His days are a disciplined cycle of precision and patience: preparing cell cultures, running assays, and analyzing data. His commute is a brisk, ten-minute walk up the hill.\n\nLife is spartan but focused. Socializing happens over cheap beer with fellow lab techs, dissecting complex-sounding papers and complaining about finicky equipment. Weekends are for clearing his head on long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park or tackling a new route at the Dogpatch climbing gym. He\u2019s connected to San Francisco not through its vibrant nightlife, but through its intellectual engine and the natural beauty that offers him respite. Liam\u2019s ambition isn't for wealth, but for acceptance into a Ph.D. program. He dreams of a future spent chasing a breakthrough, a small but significant contribution to understanding the diseases that unravel the mind\u2014a path entirely his own."
