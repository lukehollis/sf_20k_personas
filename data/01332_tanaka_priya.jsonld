Born to a second-generation Japanese-American father and an Indian immigrant mother who met at SF State in the early 70s, Priya grew up in a Sunset District home where the scent of Japanese dashi mingled with Indian spices. She never felt wholly one or the other, a nuance that shaped her identity. Instead of choosing a side, she learned to embrace the space in between, feeling most herself amidst the city's multicultural fabric.\n\nHer passion for the environment was born not in a classroom, but on foggy hikes through the Presidio and tide-pooling trips to Ocean Beach. Foregoing a traditional university path, Priya\u2019s education was a patchwork of community college courses in botany, volunteer work for the Sierra Club, and a low-level administrative job with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. It was here, buried in environmental impact reports, that she found her calling. She learned the language of policy and the science of conservation from the ground up, earning a reputation for meticulous research and unwavering integrity.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. Tired of bureaucratic red tape, she took a leap and founded her own environmental consulting firm from her apartment. This move defined her life, granting her the autonomy to choose projects that aligned with her values. She now operates from a bright, airy flat in Cole Valley, making her commute exactly zero miles.\n\nAt 50, Priya\u2019s life is one of quiet intention. Her days begin with a walk to Tank Hill to watch the fog burn off the city, followed by hours spent advising on wetland restoration or green building compliance. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few old friends, fellow activists, and the merchants at the Cole Street market who know her by name. She is single, having had a significant long-term partnership in her past, and now cherishes her independence.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her soul. She sees the city not just as a place, but as a complex ecosystem she is dedicated to protecting. Her future aspirations are not for wealth or recognition, but to mentor a new generation of environmental advocates and to ensure the city that forged her unique identity remains a vibrant, sustainable home for all."
