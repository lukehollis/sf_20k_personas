The daughter of a pragmatic auto mechanic and a fiercely dedicated community librarian, Sarah spent her childhood watching businesses shutter and public spaces crumble. While her peers dreamed of escape, Sarah spent her afternoons in her mother\u2019s library, devouring books not on fantasy, but on urban design, sociology, and architectural history. She saw her town not as a failure, but as a puzzle with missing pieces.\n\nInstead of pursuing a traditional college degree, Sarah embarked on a self-directed education. For a decade, she worked odd jobs to fund methodical travels, living for months at a time in cities like Portland, Montreal, and Chicago. She didn\u2019t see the tourist sights; she studied transit systems, walked forgotten neighborhoods, and filled notebooks with sketches of public plazas and observations on human flow. Her \u201cdegree\u201d was earned on sidewalks and in community meetings, her expertise stamped in the concrete of small, successful projects she consulted on for free along the way.\n\nDrawn by its complex urban fabric and history of community activism, Sarah moved to San Francisco fifteen years ago. She found her niche not in the sterile offices of City Hall, but as a freelance consultant for neighborhood associations and small businesses. Her lack of formal credentials was her greatest asset; she spoke the language of residents, not bureaucrats. Her turning point was a pro-bono project to redesign a neglected alley in the Mission into a vibrant public space, a success that built her reputation as a planner who listened.\n\nToday, Sarah lives and works from her well-organized loft in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her desk, surrounded by maps and blueprints. Her days are a blend of digital design work and analog research: long walks through the city, conversations with shop owners, and hours spent simply observing how people use their environment. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of artists, activists, and small business owners who value her tangible vision. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to build skyscrapers, but to empower communities to reclaim their own spaces, one parklet, mural, or well-placed bench at a time. San Francisco is not just her home; it is her life\u2019s work, a dynamic canvas she hopes to make more human, block by block."
