A second-generation Chinese-American, he was born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District. His parents, who ran a small neighborhood grocery store, poured their life savings and hopes into their son, envisioning a future for him in a stable, high-paying tech career. Kyle followed the script, enrolling in the Computer Science program at UC Davis, but the abstract world of coding felt distant and hollow compared to the tangible reality of his family\u2019s store.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year when his father had a major health scare. Kyle left school without a second thought to help his mother run the business. For a year, he stocked shelves, managed inventory, and chatted with the elderly neighbors who had watched him grow up. In that time, he realized he valued community and tangible work over the promise of a Silicon Valley salary.\n\nAfter his father recovered and his parents sold the store to retire, Kyle didn't return to college. The pressure was gone, but so was the path. Needing income and flexibility, he began working as a delivery driver. Now 27, his car is his office, and his commute is the distance from his Outer Sunset in-law apartment to his first pickup. His life is dictated by the city\u2019s rhythms\u2014the frantic lunch rushes in SoMa, the lazy afternoon drop-offs in Noe Valley, and the late-night dinner surge in the Mission.\n\nKyle\u2019s social life consists of a tight-knit group of high school friends and the fleeting, friendly interactions with restaurant staff across the city. He\u2019s a quiet observer, a ghost in the machine of the gig economy. Yet, he carries a dream. During lulls, he sketches out business plans on a notepad. He wants to leverage his street-level expertise and his brief exposure to tech to create a hyper-local delivery co-op, one that offers fair rates to the small, family-owned businesses just like the one he grew up in. His ultimate hope is to build something that doesn't just deliver food, but sustains the very soul of the city he calls home."
