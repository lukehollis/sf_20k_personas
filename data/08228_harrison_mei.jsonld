            "value": "Mei Lin Harrison is a name of two worlds, a synthesis she has embodied her entire life. Raised in the East Bay by her pragmatic American father, a civil engineer, and her resilient Cantonese mother from Guangzhou, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of LEGOs and mahjong, model trains and dim sum. Her father\u2019s love for systems and infrastructure sparked her analytical curiosity, while her mother\u2019s stories of dense, vibrant city life instilled in her a deep appreciation for community. This duality naturally guided her toward a career in shaping the spaces where people connect.\n\nHer educational journey began at UC Davis, where she studied environmental policy. A pivotal internship with a small town's public works department became her turning point. She saw firsthand how a poorly planned bus route could isolate an entire neighborhood of seniors, transforming her academic interest into a tangible passion for equitable access. This solidified her resolve to pursue a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA, focusing her studies on sustainable transportation systems.\n\nUpon graduating, Mei landed her dream job as a Transportation Planner for a San Francisco public agency. For the first few years, she commuted daily, experiencing the city\u2019s transit triumphs and failures herself. The pandemic, however, shifted her role to fully remote, collapsing her commute to zero and profoundly changing her relationship with the city.\n\nNow, at 31, Mei\u2019s life is deeply rooted in her Inner Richmond neighborhood. Her mornings start not with a crowded MUNI bus but with a walk to a Clement Street cafe for a strong coffee. Her workday is a flurry of GIS mapping, data analysis, and virtual meetings from her bay window, where she designs bike lanes and bus rapid transit routes for neighborhoods across the city. Her small, close circle of friends, mostly fellow urbanists and policy wonks, are her chosen family.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. She sees the city as a complex, living organism that she has the privilege to study and improve. Her greatest aspiration is to lead the design of a transformative project\u2014a new light rail line or a pedestrian-first corridor\u2014that will outlast her and serve generations. For Mei Lin Harrison, planning the future of San Francisco isn't just a job; it's the ultimate expression of who she is."
