The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, practical grocery store in the Richmond District, Mei was raised on the tenets of hard work and pragmatism. Her parents envisioned a secure future for her in finance or law, but Mei was a dreamer, captivated by the city's vibrant murals and the quiet dignity of the de Young Museum.\n\nQuietly rebelling, she pursued a degree in Art History at San Francisco State University, drawn to the stories told by silent objects. After graduation, however, the academic world felt sterile. She drifted, taking odd jobs and feeling disconnected from her passion. The turning point came during a period of introspection: she realized the kitchen, a space of comfort learned at her grandmother's side, was also a canvas. The balance of flavors, the color of ingredients, the architecture of a plated dish\u2014it was all art.\n\nMei then dedicated herself to the culinary world, working her way up through some of the city\u2019s most demanding kitchens. She saved every dollar until, in her late thirties, she combined her life\u2019s two loves. She purchased a narrow, neglected building in Hayes Valley and transformed it into \"Jing,\" a restaurant that is also a rotating gallery for emerging Bay Area artists.\n\nNow, at 52, her life is a seamless loop contained within that single address. She lives in the light-filled apartment above the restaurant, her commute a simple walk downstairs. Her days begin with trips to the Ferry Building Farmer's Market and end in conversation with regulars who have become friends. Her staff is her chosen family, and the artists she features are her collaborators.\n\nWhile proud of Jing's quiet acclaim, Mei\u2019s dream is no longer about expansion. She hopes to mentor a promising young chef to eventually take her place, ensuring her vision of merging food and art endures. For Mei, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the partner that allowed her to build a life where her work, her art, and her community all share the same table."
