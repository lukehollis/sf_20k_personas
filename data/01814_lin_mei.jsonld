The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, practical grocery store in the Richmond District, Mei was raised on the tenets of hard work and pragmatism. Her parents envisioned a secure future for her in finance or law, but Mei was a dreamer, captivated by the city's vibrant murals and the quiet dignity of the de Young Museum.\n\nQuietly rebelling, she pursued a degree in Art History at San Francisco State University, drawn to the stories told by silent objects. After graduation, however, the academic world felt sterile. She drifted, taking odd jobs and feeling disconnected from her passion. The turning point came during a period of introspection: she realized the kitchen, a space of comfort learned at her grandmother's side, was also a canvas. The balance of flavors, the color of ingredients, the architecture of a plated dish\u2014it was all art.\n\nMei then dedicated herself to the culinary world, working her way up through some of the city\u2019s most demanding kitchens. She saved every dollar until, in her late thirties, she combined her life\u2019s two loves. She purchased a narrow, neglected building in Hayes Valley and transformed it into \"Jing,\" a restaurant that is also a rotating gallery for emerging Bay Area artists.\n\nNow, at 52, her life is a seamless loop contained within that single address. She lives in the light-filled apartment above the restaurant, her commute a simple walk downstairs. Her days begin with trips to the Ferry Building Farmer's Market and end in conversation with regulars who have become friends. Her staff is her chosen family, and the artists she features are her collaborators.\n\nWhile proud of Jing's quiet acclaim, Mei\u2019s dream is no longer about expansion. She hopes to mentor a promising young chef to eventually take her place, ensuring her vision of merging food and art endures. For Mei, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the partner that allowed her to build a life where her work, her art, and her community all share the same table."

With a stubby pencil, she wasn\u2019t doing homework, but sketching the gnarled hands of the elderly woman who sold them oranges. It was a secret act of defiance against the world of ledgers and receipts. That moment taught her that art wasn't a luxury for a museum; it was a way of seeing the quiet dignity hidden within the everyday.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-four, adrift after college, she stood alone inside Coit Tower on a cold, foggy afternoon. She\u2019d studied the murals for an art history paper, but now, jobless and lost, she saw them differently. She saw the weary, determined faces of the workers and felt a profound kinship. It was a humbling moment that stripped away academic pretension. Art wasn\u2019t an abstract concept; it was about labor, community, and survival. It planted the seed that her own work needed to have that same vital, human connection.\n\n3.\nThe epiphany came in her cramped Sunset apartment kitchen when she was twenty-seven. She was trying to recreate her grandmother\u2019s steamed fish, her hands automatically arranging scallions and ginger in a delicate pattern. Suddenly, she saw not just a meal, but a composition\u2014color, texture, form. Her grandmother\u2019s hands guiding hers across time. In that flash, the sterile world of art history and the comforting world of food fused. The kitchen wasn\u2019t an escape; it was her true canvas. It gave her passion a purpose and a path.\n\n4.\nIt was the night before Jing opened. She was thirty-nine. The space was silent, the new paintings casting long shadows on the bare tables. She ran one hand over the cold, stainless-steel pass and the other over the rough canvas of a seascape. A wave of gut-wrenching terror and pure, unadulterated joy washed over her. In that quiet moment, all the disparate parts of her life\u2014her parents' pragmatism, her artistic soul, the grueling kitchen work\u2014finally clicked into place. She hadn't just built a restaurant; she had built a home for herself.\n\n5.\nJust last year, standing near the kitchen door during a busy service, she watched a young regular talking animatedly with the artist of the month. The diner, a tech worker, was connecting the plating of his scallop crudo to the brushstrokes in the painting behind him. Mei felt a quiet, profound sense of peace. Her dream was no longer just hers; it was living and breathing in the conversations of others. It affirmed her legacy wasn't about growth, but about fostering moments where art and life could nourish each other."
