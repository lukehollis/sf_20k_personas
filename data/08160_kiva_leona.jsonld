Born to a Hopi father from the mesas of Arizona and a fiercely independent non-native mother who was an ethnobotanist, Leona\u2019s childhood was a blend of ancient tradition and scientific inquiry. She spent summers on the reservation, learning the rhythms of the earth from her grandmother, and school years in Flagstaff, absorbing the clinical language of her mother\u2019s research. This duality defined her, creating a deep-seated need to bridge the perceived gap between spiritual reverence for nature and the data-driven policies meant to protect it.\n\nHer path was forged during a fight against a proposed mining operation that threatened sacred tribal lands. Witnessing the community\u2019s elders speak with a wisdom that dwarfed corporate legal teams, Leona realized her calling. She pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science at Northern Arizona University, then moved to the Bay Area for a Master's in Environmental Policy at UC Berkeley. The program\u2019s focus on law and economics gave her the tools to translate her inherent respect for the land into the language of boardrooms and city halls.\n\nNow 47, Leona is a respected environmental consultant working remotely from her Inner Sunset apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute allows her a disciplined routine: a pre-dawn walk through the fog-drenched greenery of Golden Gate Park, followed by hours of intense work\u2014analyzing impact reports, drafting mitigation strategies, and navigating complex regulations for her clients. Her apartment is a reflection of her identity: sleek monitors and ergonomic chairs share space with hand-woven textiles and Pueblo pottery.\n\nThough an amicable divorce a decade ago left her single, she is far from lonely. Her life is enriched by a tight-knit circle of friends and a deep connection to her neighborhood. Leona\u2019s ultimate dream is to move beyond consulting. She aspires to launch a non-profit dedicated to integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into mainstream climate adaptation strategies. For Leona, San Francisco is not just a home; it is the ideal crucible, a place of innovation and progressive thought where she believes she can build a modern kiva\u2014a space for dialogue where ancient wisdom can guide and heal a modern world."
