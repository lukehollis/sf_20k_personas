Given by a beloved grandmother who passed shortly after his birth, his parents kept the traditionally female Sikh name out of respect, setting him on a path of quiet distinction. Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Fremont, Deepak was the son of pragmatic Punjabi immigrants who equated success with engineering or medicine. His father, a taciturn software architect, saw life as a series of logical problems to be solved, a worldview Deepak could never quite adopt.\n\nHis quiet rebellion was academic. He fled to UC Santa Cruz, losing himself not in code, but in the sprawling narratives of English Literature. For four years, he lived in a world of metaphor and meaning, far from the expectations of his family. After graduating, however, the reality of the Bay Area job market hit hard. Under pressure to find stable work, he took a \"temporary\" position as a data entry specialist for a rising FinTech firm in San Francisco. That was six years ago.\n\nThe key turning point was imperceptible, a slow erosion of spirit rather than a single event. The pandemic solidified his work-from-home status, and his world shrank to the size of his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his connection to the bustling financial world is entirely through a VPN and the steady click-clack of his keyboard. His days are a disciplined routine: coffee, login, process transactions, lunch, process more, logout. He knows the city through his window\u2014the fog rolling down Clement Street, the distant chime of a cable car\u2014but feels like an observer, not a participant. His social connections are mostly digital, with occasional meetups with a couple of old college friends that feel more nostalgic than current.\n\nDeepak\u2019s dream, however, hasn't died; it has simply gone underground. After his monitor goes dark for the day, another screen lights up. He is secretly, painstakingly, writing a novel\u2014a sprawling family saga inspired by the very immigrant experience he once sought to escape. His greatest hope is to one day trade the rigid cells of his spreadsheets for the boundless paragraphs of his manuscript. He aspires to write his own story, finally making the name Deepak Kaur synonymous not with data, but with the art he truly loves."
