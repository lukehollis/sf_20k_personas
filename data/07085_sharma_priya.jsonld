The daughter of Indian immigrants who ran a modest corner store in Daly City, Priya grew up stocking shelves and making change, the scent of cardamom and cleaning solution a permanent fixture of her childhood. Her parents harbored dreams of her becoming an engineer, a path she began dutifully pursuing at San Francisco State University.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year when her father suffered a severe heart attack. Priya left school to run the family store, assuring everyone it was temporary. But in the daily rhythm of managing suppliers, chatting with regulars, and balancing the books, she found a sense of purpose that had eluded her in lecture halls. The \"temporary\" break became a permanent career. She discovered she didn't just have a mind for business; she had a heart for it.\n\nAfter her parents sold their store and retired, Priya leveraged her decade of experience into a manager position at \"The Nob Hill Larder,\" a curated market catering to the neighborhood\u2019s mix of legacy residents and young professionals. For the past eight years, she has lived in the designated manager's apartment directly above the shop. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days are a blur of unlocking the doors at dawn, orchestrating deliveries, and acting as the unofficial confidante for half the block. She knows who's just had a baby, whose cat is missing, and which customer needs their favorite olive oil set aside.\n\nAt 39, her social life is woven into her work; her closest friends are her assistant manager and a few loyal customers she shares a glass of wine with after closing. While past relationships have fizzled, unable to compete with her dedication, Priya dreams not of escape, but of ownership. Her quiet, driving ambition is to save enough to buy The Larder when the current owner retires. She envisions it as Sharma\u2019s Market\u2014a testament to her parents' legacy and a permanent anchor in the city that became her entire world."
