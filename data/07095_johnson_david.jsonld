Raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by an engineer father and a librarian mother, his upbringing was one of pragmatism and order. Art was a private escape, a world he explored in books and on a transformative high school trip to the Art Institute of Chicago. While he dutifully earned a business degree from Ohio State to appease his parents, his heart was already elsewhere.\n\nThe turning point came at 22. Instead of pursuing an MBA, he shocked his family by enrolling in a Master\u2019s program for Art History and Museum Studies at Boston University. This deliberate pivot defined his path. He thrived in the academic world, finding his niche not as an artist, but as a facilitator of art. His career began with an internship in New York, followed by a junior registrar position in Philadelphia. He arrived in San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by the vibrant, risk-taking energy of the city's contemporary art scene. He quickly made a name for himself as the calm, logistical genius who could make impossible installations a reality.\n\nHis current life is a testament to his devotion. David lives in a minimalist SoMa high-rise, his window offering a direct view of the museum where he works as Exhibitions Manager. The 0.0-mile commute is no accident; his life and work are seamlessly integrated. His mornings start with black coffee on his balcony, mentally storyboarding the day\u2019s installation challenges before walking across the plaza to his office. His marriage ended amicably over a decade ago, a casualty of his all-consuming career. His social life exists within the art world\u2014donor galas, gallery openings, and quiet dinners with artists and curators.\n\nAt 54, David is at the peak of his profession, but a quiet yearning has begun to surface. He dreams not of bigger titles, but of legacy: mentoring the next generation of museum professionals. Privately, he fantasizes about a simpler future, perhaps retiring to a small coastal town to consult on a local gallery, finally allowing his personal life to take center stage. For now, though, he remains the indispensable man behind the curtain, ensuring the art of San Francisco always has a perfect place to be seen."
