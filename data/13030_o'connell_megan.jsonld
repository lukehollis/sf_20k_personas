            "value": "Megan O'Connell is a San Francisco native, a distinction she wears with a quiet, stubborn pride. Raised in the Outer Sunset by a Muni bus driver and a public-school secretary, her childhood was scored by the clang of the L Taraval and the salty bite of ocean fog. She witnessed firsthand the city\u2019s working-class families, like her own, fighting to hold on amidst rising costs. This reality wasn't a political talking point; it was the conversation at her family\u2019s dinner table.\n\nThis upbringing fueled her decision to study Public Policy at UC Davis. While her peers chased tech internships, Megan interned for a state assemblymember, fascinated by the intricate, often frustrating, mechanics of change. After graduation, she returned to San Francisco, taking a junior role in a city department before landing her current position as a Legislative Aide at City Hall. For over a decade, she has been the invisible engine behind a progressive Supervisor, drafting policy on housing affordability, public transit improvements, and small business support. She is the architect of initiatives that her boss champions in the press.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago when her long-term partner moved to Portland, seeking a more affordable and less demanding life. Megan couldn\u2019t leave. Her commitment to San Francisco was absolute, a bond forged in childhood that felt more like a duty than a choice. Now single, her life is a well-worn groove of purpose. Her day begins with a coffee from a local cafe in her Inner Richmond neighborhood and a ride on the 5-Fulton bus to City Hall. Evenings are for policy briefs and community meetings, and weekends are for long walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nAt 42, Megan feels a growing restlessness. She\u2019s respected for her expertise, but she\u2019s always in the background. Her dream is simple yet profound: to ensure a new generation of families like hers can lay down roots in the city. The question she mulls over on her evening commute is whether she\u2019s content shaping the city from the shadows, or if it's finally her turn to step into the light and run for office herself."

He pointed out the regulars, the night-shift nurses and line cooks, calling them by name. It wasn't just a job; he was a custodian of a tiny, moving community. She felt an immense pride, understanding then that the city was more than landmarks; it was the people who kept it moving. That night, public service became a tangible, honorable thing.\n\n2.\nIt was a small-print ordinance to protect tenants from illegal pass-through costs, one of her first solo drafts as a young aide. She was 28, hunched in the back during a Board of Supervisors meeting. When the final vote passed, a wave of electric relief washed over her. No one knew her name, but she saw an elderly woman in the audience weep with joy. That quiet, anonymous victory was intoxicating. It confirmed her purpose: the tedious work of policy could be a profound act of care.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, on their Inner Richmond porch, the fog felt like a shroud. \"It doesn't have to be this hard, Meg,\" her partner had pleaded, talking about Portland's ease. She looked past him, toward the city's silhouette, and felt a grief so sharp it stole her breath. But leaving felt like a betrayal of her own DNA, a desertion. The heartbreak was immense, but so was the clarity. She was irrevocably tied to San Francisco's fight. It was a choice that felt like destiny.\n\n4.\nA couple of years back, she was reading a news profile of her Supervisor, praising him for the \"Legacy Business\" fund she had spent a year painstakingly architecting. She felt a familiar flash of pride seeing a beloved Mission bakery listed as a recipient. But it was followed by a hollow ache. The words on the page were her research, the plan her design, but her name was nowhere. It was the first time the satisfaction of being effective felt incomplete, overshadowed by her own invisibility.\n\n5.\nJust last weekend, walking near Spreckels Lake, she saw a young family wrestling a stroller and laughing. The dad wore a Muni jacket. The scene was a perfect echo of her own past, a fragile glimpse of the future she fights for from her desk. A fierce, protective feeling surged through her, so powerful it was almost painful. It wasn't enough to write the policies anymore. In that moment, watching them, her quiet question\u2014*should I run?*\u2014stopped feeling like a fantasy and started to feel like a responsibility."
