The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong who arrived in the late 1960s, she grew up amidst the scent of medicinal herbs from her father's shop and the constant clatter of the 38 Geary bus. Her parents instilled in her a profound sense of duty and an uncompromising work ethic, values she absorbed as she helped them translate bills and navigate American bureaucracy from a young age.\n\nA dreamer at heart, Meilin pursued a Bachelor's in English Literature at SF State, losing herself in Victorian novels and poetry. She envisioned a quiet life in academia, but her father\u2019s sudden illness in her early twenties forced a pragmatic pivot. The family needed a steady, reliable income. Trading prose for legal precedence, she earned a paralegal certificate and quickly found work at a downtown law firm.\n\nHer career became her anchor. Meilin discovered a quiet satisfaction in the meticulous, detail-oriented world of legal work. She was precise, dependable, and fiercely intelligent, rising to the rank of Senior Paralegal specializing in complex corporate litigation. The dot-com boom and bust, the rise of Big Tech\u2014she witnessed it all from the 35th floor of a Financial District tower, a silent observer of the city\u2019s frenetic evolution.\n\nNow 52, Meilin's life has settled into a comfortable rhythm. Her seniority affords her the luxury of working from a home office in the same Richmond District duplex where she grew up, now caring for her elderly mother. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her kitchen to her desk. A long-term relationship ended amicably a decade ago, leaving her contentedly single. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of old friends who meet for dim sum and walks through Golden Gate Park. She never lost her love for the arts, filling her weekends with visits to the de Young Museum and tending to her collection of orchids.\n\nMeilin\u2019s aspirations are no longer grand, but personal. She dreams of one day taking a month-long trip to Italy to see the art she once only studied in books. More than anything, she hopes to maintain her quiet, ordered life, a testament to the resilience and pragmatism that has defined her existence in the city that is, and always will be, her home."
