The son of Punjabi immigrants who cultivated almonds in the sun-baked fields of the Central Valley, Brandon\u2019s upbringing was a study in pragmatism and hard work. His parents, wanting a life for him free from the uncertainties of agriculture, pushed him toward the promise of a stable, white-collar career.\n\nHe obliged, but on his own terms. At UC Davis, he eschewed engineering for a Bachelor's in Film Studies, a creative rebellion his parents quietly tolerated. After graduating, the romance of filmmaking quickly collided with the reality of San Francisco rent. A few lean years waiting tables and working retail led him to a pivotal compromise: a six-month IT certification course. It was practical, it was in-demand, and it was his ticket to stability. He landed a job as an IT Support Specialist, and the steady paycheck felt like both a victory and a surrender.\n\nNow at 33, Brandon\u2019s days are governed by the digital chime of support tickets. His apartment, once a sanctuary, now doubles as his office, its quiet broken by the frantic clicks of his keyboard as he remotely solves problems for unseen colleagues. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; he knows every stall at the Clement Street Farmers' Market and the best walking paths through Golden Gate Park, his main escape from the digital fortress of his home. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends, a mix of college buddies and former co-workers, with whom he shares weekly trivia nights at a local pub.\n\nThough his career is in technology, his dreams remain stubbornly analog. Tucked away on his hard drive are three meticulously outlined screenplays. Brandon\u2019s ultimate hope is not to climb the corporate ladder, but to use the financial security his IT job provides to fund his own short film\u2014a story about a family not unlike his own, caught between the soil of their past and the silicon of their future."
