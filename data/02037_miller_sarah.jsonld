Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a high school English teacher and an accountant, her upbringing was a blend of creative encouragement and fiscal responsibility. She spent weekends in museums and summers at art camps, developing a keen eye for aesthetics, which led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in the early 2000s, drawn by the city\u2019s bohemian legacy. Her initial dream was to work in curation, but the reality of low-paid gallery work and the exclusive nature of the high-art world left her disillusioned. The true turning point came as she watched her friends\u2014painters, sculptors, and musicians\u2014get systematically priced out of their SOMA and Mission District live/work lofts during the first dot-com boom. She saw a gap between the city\u2019s creative soul and the spaces it needed to survive.\n\nA spark of practical rebellion ignited. Sarah got her real estate license, not to chase Pacific Heights commissions, but to carve out a niche. She became the \"Real Estate Agent in Arts,\" specializing in sourcing and selling properties for creative use: warehouse studios with perfect northern light, industrial spaces with ventilation for welders, and lofts with zoning that protected artists.\n\nNow at 43, Sarah lives the life she helps create. Her home and office are one and the same: a stunning, light-filled Dogpatch loft that serves as a testament to her vision. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk from her bedroom to her desk, overlooking the city\u2019s industrial waterfront. Her days are a blur of client calls, property tours on her Vespa, and coffee meetings with artists to understand their unique spatial needs. Her social life is inextricably linked to her work; she\u2019s a fixture at gallery openings and open studios, not just for networking, but out of genuine support for the community she serves.\n\nHer greatest aspiration is to establish a land trust that can purchase properties and hold them as permanent, affordable creative spaces, insulating them from the volatile market. For Sarah, a sale isn't just a commission; it's a small victory in the ongoing battle for San Francisco\u2019s cultural soul."
