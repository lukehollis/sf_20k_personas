            "value": "Corey Harris is a San Francisco native, born and raised in the fog-drenched avenues of the Excelsior District. The only child of Filipino immigrants, his father worked as a union janitor and his mother as an in-home caregiver. They instilled in him a quiet diligence and a deep sense of responsibility. In his youth, Corey\u2019s passion was illustration; his notebooks from Balboa High School were filled not with lecture notes, but with detailed cityscapes and character designs, dreaming of a life in comics or graphic design.\n\nHis path diverged sharply after graduation. Just as he was exploring art programs at City College, his mother\u2019s health declined rapidly, requiring expensive care not fully covered by insurance. Deferring his dreams, Corey took the first full-time job he could find: a retail associate position at Clement Supply, a legacy hardware and home goods store in the Inner Richmond. The job, meant to be temporary, came with a crucial benefit: a small, rent-stabilized studio apartment above the shop.\n\nThat was nineteen years ago. Today, at 37, Corey\u2019s commute remains zero miles. His life is a routine forged by loyalty and circumstance. He opens the store for Mr. and Mrs. Lee, the elderly owners who have become his surrogate family. His world is contained within a few city blocks; he knows the names of the regulars, the delivery drivers, and the families who have shopped there for generations. He is a quiet, reliable fixture in the neighborhood\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nCorey\u2019s social life is modest, revolving around the Lees and occasional conversations with customers. While he feels a pang of loneliness watching his old high school friends post photos of their families and careers, he isn't bitter. During slow afternoons, he still pulls out a sketchbook kept under the counter, his artistic talent a private memory of a different life. His dream is no longer grand; he simply hopes to one day save enough to take over the store from the Lees when they retire, preserving a piece of the old San Francisco he knows so intimately, ensuring his small world remains intact."
