The only child of Filipino immigrants, his father worked as a union janitor and his mother as an in-home caregiver. They instilled in him a quiet diligence and a deep sense of responsibility. In his youth, Corey\u2019s passion was illustration; his notebooks from Balboa High School were filled not with lecture notes, but with detailed cityscapes and character designs, dreaming of a life in comics or graphic design.\n\nHis path diverged sharply after graduation. Just as he was exploring art programs at City College, his mother\u2019s health declined rapidly, requiring expensive care not fully covered by insurance. Deferring his dreams, Corey took the first full-time job he could find: a retail associate position at Clement Supply, a legacy hardware and home goods store in the Inner Richmond. The job, meant to be temporary, came with a crucial benefit: a small, rent-stabilized studio apartment above the shop.\n\nThat was nineteen years ago. Today, at 37, Corey\u2019s commute remains zero miles. His life is a routine forged by loyalty and circumstance. He opens the store for Mr. and Mrs. Lee, the elderly owners who have become his surrogate family. His world is contained within a few city blocks; he knows the names of the regulars, the delivery drivers, and the families who have shopped there for generations. He is a quiet, reliable fixture in the neighborhood\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nCorey\u2019s social life is modest, revolving around the Lees and occasional conversations with customers. While he feels a pang of loneliness watching his old high school friends post photos of their families and careers, he isn't bitter. During slow afternoons, he still pulls out a sketchbook kept under the counter, his artistic talent a private memory of a different life. His dream is no longer grand; he simply hopes to one day save enough to take over the store from the Lees when they retire, preserving a piece of the old San Francisco he knows so intimately, ensuring his small world remains intact."

His father, silent, just stirred his coffee. Corey looked from the intricate illustrations of the graphic design program to the stark, unforgiving numbers on the bill. In that moment, the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifice settled on him not as a burden, but as a responsibility. He quietly closed the catalog, the dream inside deflating with a soft, final sigh. It was a silent promise to protect them.\n\n2.\nIt was his third year at the store, during Lunar New Year. He\u2019d planned on just eating instant pancit canton in his studio. But Mrs. Lee had knocked on his upstairs door, holding a plate heavy with braised pork belly and longevity noodles. Her calloused hand pressed a red envelope into his palm, her eyes crinkling. \"For family,\" she'd said simply. It was the first time his small apartment felt less like a room and more like a home. It cemented a loyalty stronger than any paycheck, a bond forged in quiet kindness.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the smell of lemon-scented floor wax and the hum of the buffer. He was twelve, \"helping\" his father on a late-night janitorial shift in a downtown office building. His dad showed him how to work the heavy machine, his voice soft but firm. \"Do it right so you only do it once, *anak*,\" he'd said, pointing out a missed scuff mark. That memory is the bedrock of his diligence. It taught him there is an inherent dignity in making something clean, orderly, and right, whether it\u2019s a floor or a hardware aisle.\n\n4.\nA foggy Tuesday afternoon in his late twenties. The light from the large front window hit the rows of brass fittings, making the motes of dust dance like tiny stars. It was so quiet he could hear the old clock tick. Instead of sketching superheroes, he found himself drawing the tiered shelves of screws, the texture of the old wooden floorboards, the slant of the light. His art was no longer about escaping his world; it became about capturing it. He was finding the beauty not in what could be, but in what was.\n\n5.\nIt was last winter. Mr. Lee, his hands trembling slightly from the cold, fumbled with a heavy box of sealant. Corey took it from him without a word, easily hoisting it onto the shelf. He saw the flicker of worry, then relief, in Mrs. Lee\u2019s eyes as she watched from the counter. In that instant, his vague sense of duty crystallized into a clear purpose. He didn't just work here; he belonged here. The dream wasn\u2019t to leave, but to stay\u2014to be the one strong enough to hold the box."
