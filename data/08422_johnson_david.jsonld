            "value": "David Samuel Johnson\u2019s life is a quiet study in intentional living, conducted from the bay window of his Inner Sunset home office. He identifies his ethnicity as \u201cOther,\u201d a label that hints at a story he enjoys sharing: he is Sephardic Jewish, with grandparents who spoke Turkish Ladino and immigrated from Istanbul to New Jersey after WWII. Raised in a household filled with the aroma of spices and the weight of history, David developed a profound empathy from a young age, particularly after witnessing an older sibling\u2019s struggle with severe depression.\n\nThis formative experience steered him away from his family\u2019s small textile business and toward the human condition. He pursued a Master of Social Work, driven by a desire to understand the mechanics of healing. In the late 1990s, drawn by San Francisco's reputation for social progress and cultural acceptance, he moved west. His early career was spent in the demanding environment of SF General Hospital, working with individuals grappling with trauma, addiction, and homelessness. It was here he earned his clinical license and honed his skills on the front lines of urban mental health.\n\nThe key turning point was the pandemic. Forced into telehealth, David discovered a new, more focused way to connect with clients. The frantic pace of the hospital gave way to the controlled quiet of his home. In 2021, at age 49, he took a leap of faith, leaving the hospital system to open a private practice entirely from his home office, hence the zero-mile commute.\n\nHis days are now structured and serene. Mornings are for telehealth sessions, his calm voice a steady presence for clients across the city. Afternoons are for walks in Golden Gate Park with his partner of fifteen years, a landscape architect, or for quiet reflection at the local cafes on Irving Street. He feels deeply rooted in the Inner Sunset, appreciating its foggy, village-like atmosphere away from the city's frantic core. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to climb a career ladder but to deepen his impact. He dreams of mentoring new LCSWs and perhaps writing a book synthesizing his decades of clinical experience with the wisdom inherited from his culturally rich, resilient family."
