Born in the Sunset District to first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood was scented with the salty air and the simmering anxieties of her parents\u2019 small grocery store. They spoke of success in terms of security and sacrifice, values that Mei-ling absorbed like the persistent coastal damp. She was a quiet, observant child, often acting as the silent emotional translator between her traditionally-minded parents and her more Americanized older brother.\n\nThe turning point of her life came at seventeen when her brother\u2019s undeclared battle with depression and addiction erupted, shattering the family\u2019s carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade. Mei-ling watched, helpless, as her parents navigated the crisis with a painful mix of shame and confusion, ill-equipped to understand the mental health storm in their home. In that moment of family crisis, Mei-ling found her calling: she would learn the language of healing they all lacked.\n\nThis new resolve fueled her educational journey, first to UC Berkeley for psychology and then to San Francisco State for her Master of Social Work. She interned at community clinics in the Mission and Chinatown, finding her purpose in providing culturally competent care for families wrestling with the same silent struggles she knew so well.\n\nNow, at fifty, Mei-ling runs a successful private practice from a converted office on the ground floor of her Inner Richmond Edwardian flat. Her commute is a ten-step walk down the hall. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, providing a calm, non-judgmental space for her clients. Divorced for nearly a decade, she finds companionship in a small circle of dear friends and solace in the tangible work of cultivating a vibrant garden in her small backyard.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is etched into her soul\u2014from her morning walks in Golden Gate Park to her weekly visits to the family grocery, now run by her recovering brother. Mei-ling\u2019s dream is no longer about grand achievement, but quiet continuation: to mentor young therapists of color and to one day visit her parents\u2019 home village in Guangdong, not as a tourist, but as a daughter who finally understands the full circle of her family's story."
