Growing up in the blue-collar suburbs of Sacramento, his father, a meticulous carpenter, taught him that precision was a form of respect. While his peers were chasing grades, David found his peace in the high school woodshop, his hands steady and his mind focused. He saw a future in tangible things, a stark contrast to the abstract ambitions of others. San Francisco, with its bohemian allure, called to him not for its rebellion, but for its promise of craft and community.\n\nHe earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Fine Woodworking from a Bay Area community college, a practical education that valued skill over theory. His entry into the art world was unprestigious: a part-time job hauling crates for a small gallery in the late 90s. But his quiet competence and engineer-like precision in hanging a show did not go unnoticed. He moved from gallery to museum, becoming the trusted technician who could build a complex armature, stretch a massive canvas, or light a sculpture to reveal its soul. His career turning point came when a major museum offered him a permanent position and, more importantly, stewardship of a coveted, rent-controlled live/work studio in a converted warehouse in SoMa. This secured his place in the city and explains his 0.0-mile commute; his life and work have been housed under one roof for nearly two decades.\n\nDavid\u2019s world is small but deep. His primary relationships are the quiet, professional friendships he holds with a handful of curators and artists who respect his indispensable, behind-the-scenes role. He is a solitary figure, but not a lonely one, finding solace in the hum of his tools and the company of his own thoughts. His days are a routine of coffee, sawdust, and problem-solving\u2014ensuring the perfect, seamless presentation of someone else\u2019s vision.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not in its skyline or tech booms, but in the texture of its old industrial buildings and the quiet hum of its cultural engines. He's watched the city contort around him, a silent observer of its frantic evolution. David\u2019s dream is not of fame or fortune, but of continuity: the hope that he can continue his craft in his small corner of SoMa, a quiet anchor in the city's ever-shifting tides, until his hands can no longer do the work."

His dad didn\u2019t yell; he just picked up a fresh block of oak and set it on the bench. \"The wood knows,\" he said gruffly. \"So does the person who'll live with it. Respect both.\" In that moment, David understood that his work wasn't just construction; it was a quiet covenant, a promise of care that he carried from his father\u2019s garage to every museum wall he touched.\n\n2.\nHis first week in the city, late 90s, he didn\u2019t see the Golden Gate Bridge. He wandered into a small Mission District gallery and saw a bench. Just a simple bench, but the joinery was flawless, the grain respected, the finish like water. He ran his hand over the polished wood and felt a jolt of recognition. This was the city\u2019s true language for him\u2014not in manifestos or tech IPOs, but in things made with intention and care. He knew then he could speak it, too.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't a champagne pop but the solid, metallic click of a key in an old warehouse lock in 2004. Standing in the cavernous SoMa studio, dust motes dancing in the light, he felt a profound sense of stillness. It wasn't just a space; it was an exhale after years of holding his breath. This was it. The place where the line between life and work would dissolve, where he could finally anchor himself against the city's pull. He had found his harbor, and the rent was controlled.\n\n4.\nThe sculpture was a chaotic tangle of forged steel, impossibly fragile and heavy. The artist was frantic, the curator pale. For two days, David built a complex, nearly invisible armature, calculating stress points and balance. When it was finally hoisted, it floated an inch off the pedestal, as if by magic. The artist wept with relief. David just nodded, feeling the quiet, clean satisfaction of a perfectly solved problem. That was his art: making the impossible appear effortless and secure, a silent collaboration he cherished.\n\n5.\nHe marks time by the ghosts of buildings. The biggest loss was the machine shop across the alley, torn down in 2017 for glass-walled condos. He'd known the hum of their lathes his whole time in the studio; it was part of his own workshop\u2019s soundtrack. One morning, the wrecking ball hit, and the silence that followed was louder than the crash. Watching the new building rise, he felt not anger, but a grim resolve. He was a remnant of an older city, and his continuity was a form of defiance."
