Adopted at two by a loving Caucasian couple from Sacramento, he became Robert, a boy who grew up with a profound but unspoken sense of being an outsider. His parents, the Jenkins, were kind and supportive, but in the predominantly white suburbs of the 1970s, his face in the mirror and in family photos was a constant reminder of a history he couldn\u2019t access. This fostered a quiet, observant nature and a deep-seated independence.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Robert felt no pull toward college. He craved the anonymity and tangible energy of a big city, a place where he could define himself. Just after his 20th birthday, he moved to San Francisco with a few hundred dollars and found work as a busboy in a bustling Union Square restaurant. The chaotic, structured world of the service industry became his university. He learned everything on the floor: timing, customer psychology, inventory management, and the camaraderie of a stressed kitchen crew. He worked his way up relentlessly\u2014from server, to bartender, to assistant manager over two decades.\n\nThe key turning point in Robert\u2019s life was a long-term relationship that ended in his late thirties, leaving him emotionally adrift. In the aftermath, he doubled down on his career, accepting a management position at a sleek caf\u00e9 inside a large downtown department store. The job came with an unusual perk: a small, subsidized staff apartment in the same building. He took it, and his world shrank to a one-block radius. His 0.0-mile commute became a lifestyle choice, a retreat into a world he could control.\n\nNow, at 53, Robert\u2019s life is a pattern of quiet rituals. He wakes to the faint hum of the city, takes the staff elevator down to the caf\u00e9, and orchestrates the daily ballet of coffee, lunch, and closing. His social connections are the baristas he mentors, the security guards he greets by name, and the familiar faces of regular shoppers. His San Francisco isn't the Golden Gate Bridge; it's the rhythm of delivery trucks on Stockton Street and the afternoon light hitting the glass storefronts. His dream is to save enough money to finally visit Busan, not to search for family, but simply to stand on the soil where his story began and feel, for the first time, a sense of wholeness."
