Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, her childhood was a symphony of beeping delivery trucks and the crinkle of paper bags at her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Clement Street. The eldest daughter of immigrants from Hong Kong, Jessica learned the language of inventory and customer service before she mastered algebra. Her path was tacitly understood: she would help the family.\n\nWhile her friends dreamed of UC schools, Jessica enrolled at City College of San Francisco. An Associate's degree in Business Administration felt practical, a tool to better manage the family enterprise. For years, she was the steady hand behind the counter, her life measured in produce orders and holiday rushes.\n\nThe turning point came at 29, when her parents finally decided to retire and sell the store. The sale was a seismic shift, leaving Jessica both unmoored and unexpectedly free. For the first time, her future wasn't stocked on a shelf. Leveraging her immense retail experience, she applied for a manager position at a curated home goods and gift boutique just a few blocks away. She got the job, and with it, a rare San Francisco unicorn: the apartment above the shop was part of her compensation. Her commute became a single flight of stairs.\n\nNow 35, Jessica\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her days begin with a walk in Golden Gate Park and a coffee from the cafe owner who knows her order. She orchestrates the rhythm of her store with quiet confidence, building relationships with regulars and artists whose work she stocks. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of high school friends, now scattered across the Bay Area, with whom she shares dinners and laments about the city\u2019s changes.\n\nSingle and fiercely independent, Jessica nurtures a quiet dream. She envisions her own shop one day, a space filled not with her parents\u2019 legacy, but with her own distinct taste. It would be a testament to her journey\u2014a life built in the same few square miles, but entirely on her own terms."
