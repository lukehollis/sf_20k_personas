Her father, a charismatic musician from Trinidad with a laugh that could fill any room, met her mother, a reserved poet and political refugee from Iran, in a crowded London caf\u00e9 in the 1980s. They settled in Sacramento, creating a home filled with the aromas of both curry goat and saffron rice, the sounds of calypso and Farsi poetry. Growing up, Aisha became the family's natural cultural translator, an emotional cartographer mapping the territory between her parents' vastly different worlds. This early role planted the seed for her future career.\n\nDrawn to the human mind, she pursued a psychology degree at UC Davis but found the academic world too detached. It was the messy, beautiful reality of human connection that fascinated her. She moved to San Francisco for her Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy, attracted by the city's promise of radical acceptance for every kind of identity. The initial years were a grind of internships, licensure hours, and navigating the city\u2019s high cost of living. A painful breakup in her late twenties became a turning point, forcing her to apply the therapeutic tools she was learning to her own grief. The experience solidified her empathy and resolve, transforming her from a student of therapy into a true practitioner.\n\nNow at 35, Aisha runs her own private practice from a calm, sunlit office in her Noe Valley apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a seamless transition from her personal to professional life. Mornings are for client sessions, held both virtually and in-person, where she specializes in cross-cultural couples counseling. Afternoons are for decompression: long, meditative walks through the quiet streets, a coffee from a familiar local cafe, or a challenging hike up to Twin Peaks to watch the fog roll in. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of other healers and creatives. Her dream is to write a book and develop workshops on navigating love across cultural divides, using her own story as a quiet foundation. For Aisha, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's a city that mirrors her own identity\u2014a vibrant, complex fusion of disparate parts, creating something uniquely beautiful."
