Raised in a tight-knit Punjabi community near Fresno, he was the son of proud almond farmers who saw their children\u2019s futures in medicine or engineering\u2014stable, prestigious professions. Harjit, however, was drawn to the unspoken struggles he witnessed. He watched an uncle battle depression and alcoholism in stoic silence, the family treating it with prayer and shame rather than professional help. This formative experience became the cornerstone of his ambition.\n\nRejecting the pre-written script, Harjit pursued a B.A. in Psychology at UC Davis and then a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University. The move to the city was a profound liberation. Here, conversations about mental health were not whispered secrets but open dialogues. He specialized in clinical work within healthcare, driven to be the resource his own family never had. He found his calling working with patients and families navigating the emotional and logistical trauma of chronic illness and end-of-life care.\n\nToday, Harjit lives and works in a quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The COVID-19 pandemic permanently shifted his practice to telehealth, reducing his commute to the ten steps from his kitchen to his desk. His days follow a deliberate rhythm: morning meditation, a pot of strong masala chai, followed by hours of video calls, conducting what feels like emotional triage through a screen. His lunch breaks are sacred, spent on long, winding walks through Golden Gate Park, a necessary reset from the immense empathy his job requires.\n\nThough deeply fulfilled by his work, his remote life can be isolating. He maintains close ties with a small group of friends from grad school and has weekly calls with his parents, who are immensely proud but still don't fully grasp what a \u201csocial worker\u201d does. Harjit\u2019s dream is to one day open a small, private practice focused on providing culturally competent therapy for the South Asian community. He hopes to find a partner who understands his quiet intensity and, most importantly, to continue building bridges between the world he came from and the one he has built for himself in the heart of San Francisco."
