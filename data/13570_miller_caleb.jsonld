Raised in a quiet, manicured suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, his parents\u2014a dentist and a high school librarian\u2014instilled in him a sense of order and practicality. Yet, Caleb was always drawn to the systems humming just beneath the surface of daily life. While his friends were obsessed with cars, he was fascinated by the colored lines of the RTA Rapid Transit map on a rare family trip downtown, wondering how thousands of people moved in concert.\n\nThis fascination became a calling during a semester abroad in Copenhagen while studying Political Science at Ohio State. He was captivated by the city\u2019s seamless integration of cycling, walking, and public transit. It was a revelation: urban design wasn\u2019t just about aesthetics; it was a framework for community, equity, and sustainability. This turning point led him to pursue a Master of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, with a laser focus on urban transportation. He wrote his thesis on the challenges of optimizing legacy transit systems for modern needs.\n\nLanding a policy analyst position at the SFMTA was the culmination of his life\u2019s focus. It felt less like a job and more like a purpose. He intentionally chose an apartment in Hayes Valley, a mere ten-minute walk from his office at 1 South Van Ness, effectively making his commute 0.0 miles. This choice allows him to live his principles, observing firsthand the bus lines, bike lanes, and pedestrian flows he analyzes on spreadsheets.\n\nHis days are structured. A morning coffee from a local cafe, the walk to work observing morning transit patterns, and hours spent deep in data analysis. His social circle is small and tight-knit, composed mostly of fellow policy wonks and friends from his Berkeley cohort who share his passion for civic life. He isn't dating anyone seriously; his work consumes most of his intellectual and emotional energy.\n\nCaleb\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder but to see his work made manifest on the streets of San Francisco. He aspires to be a key architect of a future project\u2014a new light rail extension or a truly protected bike lane network\u2014that makes the city more livable. For Caleb, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's a complex, beautiful machine he is dedicated to helping run better."
