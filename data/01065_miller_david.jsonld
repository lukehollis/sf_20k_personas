Raised in a working-class family in Fresno, his upbringing was defined by pragmatism, not prestige. His parents, who ran a small auto repair shop, instilled in him a powerful work ethic and a knack for fixing things\u2014not just cars, but broken processes and chaotic situations. College was a distant, unaffordable dream, so after high school, David worked a series of dead-end jobs, feeling the pull of a world beyond the Central Valley.\n\nAt 22, he moved to San Francisco with a few hundred dollars and a friend\u2019s couch to sleep on in the Outer Sunset. His turning point came not from a university, but from a temp agency that placed him in a stockroom role at a fledgling hardware startup. Surrounded by ambitious engineers and chaotic product launches, David found his calling. He began creating his own systems for tracking inventory and deliveries, untangling logistical knots that baffled the formally educated team. A perceptive manager noticed his innate talent for organization and offered him a junior coordinator role.\n\nLacking a degree, David built his education himself through late nights studying project management methodologies online and earning certifications in Scrum and Agile. He climbed the ladder through sheer competence, moving from coordinator to a full-fledged Project Manager. His career is a testament to his practical intelligence and ability to command respect through results, not credentials.\n\nNow 37, David lives a deliberately grounded life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured around his home and neighborhood. He starts with a coffee from a local cafe, works diligently from his small home office, and takes afternoon walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends who have seen his entire journey. He\u2019s content with the success he\u2019s built, but now dreams of something more personal: mentoring young people from backgrounds like his, proving that a different path to success in San Francisco is still possible."
