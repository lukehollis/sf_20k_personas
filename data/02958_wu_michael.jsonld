He was born in the Sunset District, the only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, perpetually busy laundromat on Irving Street. His childhood was a soundtrack of humming dryers and his parents\u2019 mantra: study hard, find a stable job, and don\u2019t rely on your hands the way we do. Michael absorbed this lesson, trading the foggy avenues of his youth for the sunnier, more prestigious halls of UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's degree in Information Management and Systems.\n\nHe entered the tech world just before the dot-com bubble, surviving its burst through a combination of caution and competence. While more flamboyant colleagues flamed out, Michael steadily climbed the corporate ladder at a large, established software company. Now a Regional Manager, he oversees teams across the West Coast from the quiet of his gleaming SoMa high-rise. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his success, but also a source of deep isolation.\n\nHis life\u2019s turning point wasn\u2019t a career triumph, but the quiet dissolution of his marriage five years ago. His ex-wife claimed he managed his family like he managed his teams\u2014efficiently, but without passion. The accusation stung because it felt true. His primary connection now is to his daughter, a sophomore at Stanford, their weekly video calls a cherished, if sometimes stilted, ritual.\n\nMichael\u2019s days are a structured blur of Zoom calls and performance reviews, his skyline view a backdrop to digital abstractions. To counter this, he has found solace in the tactile. Three nights a week, he attends a pottery class in the Mission, finding immense satisfaction in shaping wet clay into something solid and real. His hands, which his parents hoped he\u2019d never have to use for labor, are now his primary source of joy.\n\nA lifelong San Franciscan, Michael has witnessed the city\u2019s soul morph around him. He feels like a bridge between its past and present. His aspiration is no longer to climb higher up the corporate ladder, but to find a way off it. He dreams of a future where he spends more time mentoring young engineers and even more time at the potter\u2019s wheel, finally creating something tangible that is entirely his own."

He watched his mother\u2019s hands, chapped and red, expertly folding a stranger\u2019s warm shirts. She never looked up, her focus absolute. It wasn't sadness he felt, but a fierce, binding resolve. Her manual labor became his motivation, cementing a promise that his own hands would only ever touch keyboards and signing pens. This moment laid the foundation for his entire career.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe dot-com bust, 2001. His office floor was starkly quiet after the final round of layoffs. He watched a flamboyant programmer he\u2019d always envied pack a cardboard box, placing a ridiculous plush startup-mascot on top. Michael felt no victory, just the cold validation of his own timid strategy. That day, his natural caution hardened into a core principle\u2014a shield of stability that would define his steady, passionless ascent up the corporate ladder for the next twenty years.\n\n***\n\n3.\nFive years ago. For their anniversary, he had created a detailed spreadsheet to optimize their trip to Maui\u2014flights, dinner reservations, scheduled downtime. His wife simply looked at it, then at him, her eyes tired. \"This isn't a project to be managed, Michael,\" she said softly. The words didn't feel like an attack, but like a quiet, irrefutable diagnosis of his life. It was the moment he realized the fortress of efficiency he\u2019d built for his family had become his own isolation chamber.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe remembers his daughter, Maya, age seven, sitting at their kitchen table. She was supposed to be painting a flower, but was instead joyfully smearing blue paint across the page. He started to correct her, to explain the \u201cright\u201d way, but she just laughed and planted a small, sticky blue handprint on his cheek. The shock of it, the simple, chaotic love, is a feeling he now aches for during their structured weekly video calls, a ghost of a connection he\u2019s desperate to reclaim.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast winter, at the Mission pottery studio. After weeks of lopsided, collapsing failures, a lump of wet clay suddenly gave way. It wasn\u2019t a thought, but a feeling that shot up his arms\u2014the spinning earth surrendering to his palms, finding its perfect center. A profound, silent equilibrium. In that moment, creating something tangible and real, he felt a joy so clean and absolute it eclipsed every promotion he'd ever earned, planting the seed for his escape."
