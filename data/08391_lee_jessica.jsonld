Raised in Hayward as the only daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business, Jessica grew up with the implicit understanding that her success would be their ultimate reward. The path was clear: excel in school, attend a good university, and secure a prestigious, recession-proof career.\n\nFollowing this script, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially declaring a pre-pharmacy major to appease her parents. However, the relentless pressure and a profound lack of passion for the sciences led to a quiet burnout. After two years, when a sudden family financial strain made tuition a burden, Jessica saw an out. She dropped out, framing it as a noble sacrifice to help her family, though secretly relieved to escape a future she never wanted. She found work quickly, landing an Administrative Assistant position at a downtown finance firm.\n\nNow 24, Jessica\u2019s world has shrunk to the size of her Hayes Valley studio apartment. The 0.0-mile commute is a double-edged sword; the work-from-home arrangement provides security and saves her a costly BART ride, but it has deepened her isolation. Her days are a meticulous routine of scheduling meetings for executives, managing expense reports, and answering emails, her laptop perched on the same small table where she eats her meals. Her main social interactions are weekly phone calls with her parents and occasional dinners with her one close friend from college.\n\nShe lives in a neighborhood buzzing with life she feels detached from. On her daily walks, she passes boutique shops, artisanal coffee houses, and the lively park, feeling more like an observer than a participant. Her connection to San Francisco is aspirational; she\u2019s here, but not yet *living*.\n\nJessica\u2019s dream is to reclaim the part of herself she suppressed. Late at night, after the work laptop is closed, she opens her personal tablet and sketches, a forgotten talent from high school. She fantasizes about re-enrolling in online classes, not for pharmacy, but for graphic design. Her ultimate goal is to fuse her pragmatic, organized nature with her dormant creativity, hoping to one day build a life in San Francisco that feels truly her own."
