Raised in the sun-drenched suburbs of the East Bay, she was the daughter of a public-school teacher and a union electrician who valued security and hard work. Sarah, however, dreamed of art museums and university libraries. In her late teens, she moved across the bay to attend San Francisco State University, enrolling as an Art History major, intoxicated by the city\u2019s creative energy and bohemian history.\n\nHer academic journey was cut short during her sophomore year. A sudden and serious illness befell her mother, pulling Sarah back to the East Bay to become a part-time caregiver. School became an impossible luxury. She took on a series of administrative temp jobs to help with bills, discovering a knack for organization and navigating complex bureaucracies. What began as a temporary measure slowly became a career. After her mother stabilized, the dream of returning to her art studies felt distant and impractical. Instead, she sought the security her parents had always championed, landing a permanent position as an Administrative Assistant for a city department in San Francisco.\n\nNow, at 38, Sarah\u2019s life is anchored in her small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. The pandemic shifted her job to a permanent remote position, shrinking her world to the blocks around her home. Her 0.0-mile commute means her mornings are spent not on a crowded bus, but with a coffee pot and her cat, a fluffy rescue named Clementine. Her work life consists of emails, digital calendars, and Zoom calls, a steady rhythm that pays the bills and provides excellent health benefits\u2014a priority she never takes for granted.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. She doesn't frequent the trendy downtown bars but is a regular at the corner bakery and knows the names of the librarians at her local branch. Her social life is a small, tight circle of friends, most of whom understand lives rerouted by circumstance. While the Art History degree was abandoned, her love for creation has not died. Her hope for the future isn't a promotion, but to save enough to travel to Spain and see Picasso\u2019s Guernica in person. For now, she finds contentment in her evening walks through Golden Gate Park and has recently signed up for a pottery class, finally making space for the art she once only studied."
