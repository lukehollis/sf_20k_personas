The daughter of a pragmatic Indian engineer and a free-spirited Californian artist, Rebecca grew up in the quiet suburbs of Sacramento, a place she found deeply uninspiring. Her mixed heritage gave her a unique perspective but also a feeling of never quite fitting in.\n\nHer educational journey was brief and decisive. After a year and a half of studying business administration at a state college, she found the curriculum sterile and disconnected from the real world. A summer job waiting tables in San Francisco was the turning point. She fell in love with the controlled chaos of the restaurant floor\u2014the immediate feedback, the tangible results, and the found family of the staff. She never returned for her sophomore year, instead dedicating herself to the industry.\n\nRebecca worked her way up with fierce determination: from host to server, then bartender to assistant manager. Five years ago, the owner of Bocce, a gruff but fair mentor, recognized her knack for calm leadership and offered her the manager position. Her life has since become intertwined with the restaurant. Her daily routine begins with the scent of brewing espresso from downstairs and ends long after the last table has paid, with her meticulously checking inventory and payroll.\n\nHer social life primarily consists of her staff, a tight-knit but transient crew she fiercely protects. A recent relationship crumbled under the weight of her demanding schedule; she was always on the clock, even when upstairs in her apartment. Though she loves the energy of San Francisco and the vibrant pulse of her neighborhood, she sometimes feels trapped by her responsibilities.\n\nRebecca\u2019s dream is to break free from managing someone else\u2019s vision. She is secretly saving every dollar she can to one day open her own place: a small, intimate wine bar in a quieter neighborhood like the Inner Sunset. It would be a space that reflects her own taste\u2014cozy, curated, and calm. A place where she could finally be the host of her own life, not just the manager of it."
