Raised in a middle-class Portland, Oregon, family, his childhood was spent in his father\u2019s meticulously organized garage. While his mother, a high school librarian, fostered a love for books, it was his father, a union machinist, who taught him the profound satisfaction of making something work with his own hands. This practical upbringing led him straight to Oregon State University for a degree in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom. His first job was a trial by fire at a hardware startup that burned bright and fast, ultimately imploding but teaching him invaluable lessons about rapid iteration and resilience. The long hours also cost him his first marriage, a painful turning point that solidified his resolve to find more balance in his life. Scott methodically rebuilt his career, earning a reputation not as a flashy visionary, but as the indispensable engineer who could turn ambitious concepts into functional, elegant prototypes. This reputation carried him up the ladder to his current Director role.\n\nToday, Scott lives in a quiet Potrero Hill apartment with views of the downtown skyline he helps shape. His daily 3.5-mile bike commute to his SoMa lab is a non-negotiable ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s physical mechanics. He\u2019s in a committed relationship with Chloe, an urban planner whose work complements his own fascination with how physical spaces function.\n\nWhile he enjoys his professional success, Scott feels a pull back to his roots. His dream isn\u2019t a C-suite position but a smaller, independent workshop. He envisions a future where he can step away from managing PowerPoints and return to the hum of a lathe, building bespoke furniture or consulting for smaller creators. He wants to end his career as he started it: with grease on his hands and the quiet pride of having built something real and lasting."

They were fixing his bike, and his father let him use the wrench to tighten the final bolt on the wheel hub. He remembers the specific feeling\u2014the slight give, then the firm resistance\u2014as the metal seated. It wasn\u2019t just a repaired bike; it was an ordered system he had helped create. That quiet, profound satisfaction of making something *work* became the core principle he would chase for the rest of his life.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 2001. Scott stood alone in the cavernous, empty office of the failed startup. The frantic energy was gone, replaced by an echoing silence and the ghost of stale pizza. His wife had left him a month prior, citing the 90-hour weeks he\u2019d poured into this now-hollow space. He touched the silent, useless server rack he\u2019d so carefully built. The loss felt tangible, a physical weight in his chest. In that moment, he learned the bitter math of sacrifice and swore to find a more sustainable equation for his life.\n\n***\n\n3.\nSometime around 2008, a \"visionary\" product manager handed him an \"impossible\" design for a sleek new device. For two weeks, Scott lived in the machine shop. Late one night, covered in aluminum shavings, he finally slid the two halves of the casing together. They met with a perfect, seamless *click*. He held the cool, solid prototype in his hands, an elegant physical object born from a chaotic concept. This was his superpower: not dreaming, but *making*. That feeling of quiet competence cemented his reputation and his path forward.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOn his bike commute last fall, he stopped atop Potrero Hill to watch the fog pour over the downtown skyline he'd helped shape. He didn't focus on the glass towers, but on the tireless cantilever arms of the construction cranes. He felt a sudden, deep kinship with the unseen operators, the ironworkers, the people bolting the city together. He realized he felt more connected to the city\u2019s physical mechanics than its digital ambitions. It was a moment of clarity, affirming his identity as a builder at heart.\n\n***\n\n5.\nA few months ago, he and Chloe were assembling a flat-pack bookcase in their apartment. As she read the confusing instructions, he tossed them aside, instinctively understanding how the pieces should fit. He drilled new holes, reinforced a wobbly joint, and made it sturdier than designed. Chloe watched him, then said, \"You\u2019re happiest when you\u2019re fixing something real, aren't you?\" The simple observation resonated deeper than any performance review. In her eyes, he saw his dream of a workshop not as an escape, but as a return to himself."
