            "value": "Naomi Weiss\u2019s path to becoming a healer was paved in the quiet, book-lined halls of her childhood home in Berkeley. Raised by two UC Berkeley professors\u2014a father in history, a mother in comparative literature\u2014her upbringing was one of intellectual rigor but emotional austerity. Love was expressed through shared reading lists and Socratic debate, not overt affection. This emotional vacuum sparked in Naomi a deep curiosity about the unspoken feelings that governed people\u2019s lives, a desire to mend the very fractures she felt but couldn't name in her own family.\n\nShe naturally followed her parents' path to Cal, but diverged into the study of people, earning her Master of Social Work. Naomi threw herself into the demanding world of hospital social work at UCSF Medical Center, navigating the raw, unfiltered crises of illness, trauma, and loss. For over a decade, she was a rock for families on their worst days. The work was fulfilling but corrosive, and the relentless pace led to profound burnout. The pandemic was the final push. Witnessing the immense collective trauma, she realized she could no longer sustain herself in that environment.\n\nThis turning point led her to establish a private telehealth practice from her Inner Sunset apartment. Her commute is now a ten-foot walk from her kitchen to a bay window overlooking the fog-laced streets, a space that serves as both her sanctuary and, at times, her cage. This self-imposed solitude was compounded by the recent, amicable end of a long-term relationship, leaving her in a quietude that often feels deafening.\n\nHer days are structured by virtual client sessions, helping others navigate their anxiety and grief. In between, she seeks solace in long, winding walks through Golden Gate Park, finding a strange comfort in the cool, damp air. San Francisco isn't just a city to her; it's a moody, introspective companion. Having mastered the art of caring for others, Naomi\u2019s current aspiration is quieter and more personal: to learn how to fully care for herself. She dreams of reclaiming a part of her identity separate from her role as a therapist\u2014perhaps by finally learning to paint again, a passion she abandoned in college, or simply by learning to sit in silence without the urge to fix it."

Instead, he pulled a worn paperback from the shelf. \u201cRead this,\u201d he said, his voice gentle but distant. \u201cIt will give you perspective.\u201d In that moment, holding the book instead of her father\u2019s hand, Naomi felt a profound loneliness. It wasn't cruelty, but a language of love she couldn't feel. It was then she decided she would learn to speak the language of the heart, the one her brilliant parents couldn't teach her.\n\n2.\nIt was after a 14-hour shift at UCSF, sitting in her car in the Parnassus garage. The face of a grieving widow she\u2019d just counseled was imprinted on her mind. Naomi realized she had absorbed the woman\u2019s despair so completely, she couldn't remember her own feelings. For the first time, her role as the unshakeable rock felt like a lead weight pulling her under. The work wasn't just demanding; it was devouring her piece by piece. This was the moment the corrosion became undeniable, years before her burnout.\n\n3.\nIn April 2020, she sat at her makeshift desk, listening to a client\u2019s panic attack over the wail of a distant siren. Naomi murmured calming words she didn't believe herself, intensely aware of her own trapped feeling within the same four walls. The flimsy boundary between her professional calm and personal terror dissolved. She was holding space for a collective trauma she was also drowning in. She knew then she couldn't continue to bail out a sinking ship from within the floodwaters.\n\n4.\nThe first morning after he left, she woke to a silence that buzzed with absence. She walked to the kitchen to make coffee for one, her bare feet on the cool floor echoing in a way they never had before. Her gaze fell upon the empty space on the bookshelf where his things used to be. The quiet wasn't peace; it was a cavernous space she now had to fill, or learn to inhabit, all by herself. Her sanctuary had officially become her cage.\n\n5.\nLast month, walking near Stow Lake, a heavy fog rolled in, blurring the familiar shapes into soft, watercolor impressions. Her therapist brain instantly tried to diagnose the melancholy beauty of the scene. But then she stopped. She just watched the mist curl around a cypress tree, feeling the damp chill on her skin. For a full minute, she didn't try to fix the feeling or understand it; she just allowed it to be. It was the first, quiet step towards caring for herself."
