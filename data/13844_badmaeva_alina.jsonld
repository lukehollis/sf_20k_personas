Born to Kalmyk parents who practiced a quiet form of Tibetan Buddhism, her early childhood was steeped in tales of their nomadic Mongol ancestors. When she was seven, her family immigrated to the United States, settling in a small but vibrant Kalmyk community in New Jersey. This pivotal move shaped Alina\u2019s identity, caught between her parents' deep-rooted traditions and the fast-paced American suburban life she had to navigate.\n\nThis cultural duality fueled a fascination with social structures and how people find their place within them. She pursued a Bachelor's in Sociology at a state university, but it was the progressive, multicultural allure of the West Coast that called to her for graduate school. She moved to the Bay Area to earn her Master of Social Work, specializing in child and family services. It was here, interning at a family resource center in the Mission District, that she found her calling. Witnessing the immense, often invisible struggles of immigrant families solidified her resolve to work within systems that could provide early, meaningful support.\n\nNow 45, Alina is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for the San Francisco Unified School District. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond to the elementary school she serves. Her days are a whirlwind of counseling sessions with students, parent-teacher conferences, and connecting families with housing and food security resources. A key turning point in her career was helping a non-verbal kindergartener, recently arrived from Central America, find his voice through art therapy\u2014a success that affirmed her belief in patient, culturally-aware intervention.\n\nAlina's personal life is a reflection of her professional one: intentionally built and deeply valued. After a tumultuous relationship in her thirties taught her the importance of boundaries, she has cultivated a tight-knit \"chosen family\" of friends and colleagues. Her evenings are for unwinding with a book, cooking, or walking through Golden Gate Park. Her dream is two-fold: to develop a district-wide mentorship program pairing older immigrant students with younger ones, and one day, to make a pilgrimage back to Kalmykia, reconnecting the beginning of her story with the life she has so carefully built."
