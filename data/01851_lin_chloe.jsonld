Raised in Daly City, just south of the San Francisco border, she was the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who poured their life savings and endless hours into a small grocery store. They preached the gospel of stability, envisioning a future for Chloe in medicine or engineering\u2014a secure path far from the uncertainties they had known.\n\nIn a quiet act of rebellion, Chloe enrolled at San Francisco State University and declared her major in English Literature. She fell in love with narrative structures and the power of language, a world away from the balance sheets her parents revered. Graduation, however, brought a harsh reality check. Her degree felt more like a romantic memento than a career key. After months of fruitless job searching, she accepted a position as an administrative assistant for a downtown finance firm, a practical concession to the city's high cost of living.\n\nNow 27, Chloe\u2019s world is largely confined to the four walls of her cozy Inner Sunset apartment. The 0.0-mile commute of her remote work has shrunk her universe. Her days are a cycle of scheduling meetings for executives she\u2019s never met and organizing digital files, a life of structured order that provides security but little fulfillment. Her connection to San Francisco is not forged in a bustling commute but in deliberate, small acts: a midday walk to a Tartine for coffee, a weekend stroll through the nearby Golden Gate Park, or a bus ride to browse the shelves at Green Apple Books. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of college friends, a bulwark against the isolation of remote work.\n\nChloe\u2019s greatest hope is the one she nurtures in secret. After logging off from her finance job at 5 p.m., she opens a different document\u2014the manuscript of her novel. It\u2019s a contemporary story set in the very San Francisco neighborhoods she observes with a writer\u2019s eye. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to one day see her own name on a book spine, to finally prove that her impractical, passionate choice was the most practical one of all."
