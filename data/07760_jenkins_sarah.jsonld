Her early life was structured and safe, and she followed a prescribed path to Ohio State, initially majoring in business. Her life's trajectory, however, was rerouted not by a career plan, but by a family crisis: her younger brother\u2019s harrowing battle with opioid addiction. Feeling powerless and watching her pragmatic family struggle to comprehend the illness, Sarah found her calling.\n\nShe abandoned her business degree, moved west, and earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. The Bay Area, with its embrace of complexity and non-traditional paths, felt like a breath of fresh air. She began her career in the trenches of San Francisco's public healthcare system, working with patients facing a daunting combination of illness, poverty, and mental health crises. The work was grueling but affirmed her purpose.\n\nNow at 40, Sarah\u2019s life has found a new rhythm. The pandemic shifted her work to a telehealth model, and her commute is now a ten-step walk to a home office in her quiet Inner Richmond apartment. Her proximity to Golden Gate Park is intentional; its foggy trails are her sanctuary where she processes the weight of her clients' stories. Her personal life is intimate and curated\u2014a small circle of friends, many also in healing professions, who understand the need for quiet decompression. A long-term relationship ended amicably two years ago, teaching her as much about healthy endings as it did about love.\n\nSarah dreams of eventually opening a small, specialized private practice focused on supporting the families of addicts, offering the kind of guidance her own family desperately needed. She is a woman forged by crisis, who came to San Francisco to reinvent herself and found her purpose not in solving problems with clean equations, but in sitting with people in their messy, unresolved pain."
