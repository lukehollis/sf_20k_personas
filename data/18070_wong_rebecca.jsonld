Adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese American family in the Sunset District, Rebecca grew up as a Caucasian girl deeply immersed in Cantonese culture. Her childhood was a happy whirlwind of dim sum on weekends, navigating the N Judah streetcar, and feeling a unique sense of belonging in a city that celebrated her blended identity. This bicultural upbringing gave her a profound, early understanding that family was about love and commitment, not just biology.\n\nHer personal history with the foster and adoption system was the primary catalyst for her career. After earning her bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley, she pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. Her path was clear: she wanted to work with at-risk youth and build the kind of support systems that had allowed her to thrive. Rebecca began her career as a case manager for a non-profit in the Mission District, her measured empathy and tireless advocacy making her a standout.\n\nA key turning point came in her early thirties when she connected with her birth mother. The meeting was brief and emotionally complex, reinforcing that her true home and identity were with the Wongs. This closure solidified her professional resolve. She steadily climbed the ranks, eventually becoming the Program Director for a multi-service agency. Now, she oversees educational and health initiatives for underserved families, shaping policy and mentoring a new generation of social workers.\n\nRebecca lives in a cozy Noe Valley apartment, a 1.5-mile Muni ride from her office. Her daily routine is grounded: a morning coffee from a local cafe, a full day of meetings and strategic planning, and evenings spent either with a close circle of friends\u2014many from her grad school cohort\u2014or enjoying the quiet of her home. Her connection to San Francisco is bone-deep; she sees her own story reflected in the city's diverse and interwoven communities. Her future aspirations aren't grandiose. She hopes to secure a major grant to expand her program\u2019s reach and dreams of one day having enough time to hike every trail in the Marin Headlands, a life built not on the family she was born into, but on the one she chose and the community she serves."

She remembers the heat in her cheeks, but her father just squeezed her hand and said, \u201cFamily is who shows up.\u201d The simple certainty in his voice became her armor. That moment didn\u2019t erase her difference; it defined her belonging. It was the first time she understood that love, not likeness, was the foundation of her world, a truth she would carry into her life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-five, in the cramped office of the Mission non-profit, she read her first official case file. The clinical language\u2014\"at-risk,\" \"adverse childhood experiences\"\u2014couldn't hide the story of the 15-year-old girl inside. The weight of that manila folder was immense, a terrifying and sacred trust. In that moment, her academic goals ignited into a fierce, protective purpose. This wasn't a career anymore; it was a calling to stand in the gap for children who needed someone to show up for them, just as the Wongs had for her.\n\n3.\nThe walk to the Muni stop after meeting her birth mother felt strangely light. The meeting itself had been a quiet murmur of what-ifs and polite distance. But as she saw the familiar orange logo of the bus approaching, a profound sense of release settled over her. There was no grief, only clarity. Her story wasn't about a beginning she\u2019d lost, but a life she\u2019d been given. That afternoon, in her early thirties, she went home not to an apartment, but to the unshakeable certainty of who she was: Rebecca Wong.\n\n4.\nHer first day as Program Director, she stood looking out her office window. She could see the rooftops of the neighborhoods she\u2019d dedicated her career to serving. A single case file was one life, but from this vantage point, she could see the whole ecosystem\u2014the schools, the clinics, the web of a community. It was a humbling, terrifying, and deeply gratifying shift. The feeling wasn't of power, but of expanded responsibility, a chance to nurture the city that had so thoroughly nurtured her. This happened when she was thirty-eight.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a rare clear afternoon, she reached a peak in the Marin Headlands. Panting, she looked back across the bay. There was the city: the Sutro Tower poking through the fog above the Sunset, the downtown skyline, the expanse of homes. It wasn\u2019t just a view; it was her life\u2019s map. A wave of bone-deep gratitude washed over her\u2014for her family, her work, her chosen home. She felt an overwhelming peace, a quiet joy in knowing her small, dedicated life was woven into that magnificent, complicated tapestry."
