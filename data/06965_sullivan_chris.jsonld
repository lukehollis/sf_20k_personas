            "value": "Chris Sullivan has lived his entire life within a 20-mile radius, yet he often feels like a stranger in his own city. Born and raised in the fog-belt of the Outer Sunset, his childhood was defined by the drone of the N Judah streetcar and the responsibility of being the eldest sibling. While his friends planned for college, Chris\u2019s path was diverted when his mother\u2019s chronic illness worsened. He graduated high school and immediately found a steady, if uninspiring, job in the mailroom of a downtown financial firm to help support his family.\n\nThe mailroom eventually led to a data entry position. What was meant to be a stopgap became a career built on speed, accuracy, and quiet reliability. For over a decade, Chris was a fixture in his cubicle, a familiar face who rarely spoke. The pandemic was the key turning point. His role shifted to permanent remote work, dissolving his commute but trapping him inside the four walls of his small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Now, at 36, the click of the keyboard is the primary soundtrack to his days.\n\nHis social connections have withered. Old high school friends moved away or got lost in their own demanding lives. His relationships are now transactional: a polite nod to his neighbor, a brief exchange with the cashier at the corner market. His daily routine is a closed loop of logging on, processing endless streams of numbers, and logging off. To break the monotony, he takes long, late-night walks, observing the city he grew up in as it transforms under the glow of new money and tech.\n\nBuried in a closet is an old 35mm camera, a relic from a teenage passion for photography. His dream isn't grand; it's simply to start shooting again. He aspires to capture the parts of San Francisco that are disappearing\u2014the fading storefronts, the quiet neighborhood corners, the faces of people like him who feel left behind. Chris Sullivan\u2019s hope is to find a way to see his world, and himself, as something more than just another line of data."
