Born to a Filipino immigrant father who worked as a union cook and a second-generation Mexican-American mother who was a teacher\u2019s aide, Isla\u2019s childhood was a vibrant tapestry of culture, activism, and community. She grew up in the loud, colorful, politically charged atmosphere of 1970s and \u201880s San Francisco, her identity shaped by the murals on Balmy Alley and the dual languages spoken at her dinner table.\n\nWitnessing the devastation of the AIDS epidemic tear through her community was the crucible that forged her path. She saw friends and neighbors suffer not just from the disease, but from systemic neglect. This galvanized her. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning both her bachelor's and master's degrees in Social Work, determined to build the support systems her community desperately needed.\n\nHer career began on the front lines as a caseworker in the very neighborhoods she grew up in. Over two decades, her fierce advocacy and profound empathy saw her rise through the ranks. A key turning point was a difficult but necessary divorce in her early forties from a partner whose idealism had soured into cynicism. The split refocused Isla, leading her tochannel her energy wholly into her work, eventually earning her the role of Program Director.\n\nToday, Isla\u2019s life is one of disciplined purpose. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Bernal Heights, just a 1.8-mile bike ride from her clinic. Her days start with tending to her balcony garden and end with a book club, a community board meeting, or a quiet dinner with her \u2018chosen family\u2019 of close friends. She is a beloved fixture in her neighborhood, fiercely protective of its character against the relentless waves of gentrification.\n\nHer deepest aspiration is to secure permanent funding for a new youth mental health initiative at her clinic, creating a legacy of care for the next generation. Personally, she dreams of one day taking an extended trip to both the Philippines and Mexico, to finally walk the lands of the ancestors whose stories have fueled her lifelong fight for others."

The air was thick with the dueling scents of frying pork and her mother\u2019s fresh tomatillo salsa simmering on the stove. It wasn\u2019t just a meal; it was her whole world in one room. In that moment, she learned that two different histories could create something whole and powerful. That lesson became the bedrock of her belief in community, a fusion stronger than its individual parts.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she saw Manny, the artist from two doors down who painted saints on denim jackets, looking fragile on his stoop. The vibrant life in his eyes was gone, replaced by a fear she had never seen before. It was 1987, and the word \"AIDS\" was a constant, terrified whisper. That visceral image of a neighbor fading in plain sight, abandoned by the system, ignited a cold, hard anger in her. It was the moment abstract activism became a personal, non-negotiable mission: she would build the lifeboats herself.\n\n3.\nFresh out of grad school and drowning in caseloads, she fought a slumlord for weeks to keep a family in their home. She remembers the final, exhausted phone call confirming they could stay. Standing in their cramped kitchen, the mother wordlessly gripped Isla\u2019s hands, tears streaming down her face. In that bone-tired moment of victory, Isla felt not like a social worker, but a shield. It solidified her purpose, proving that her fierce empathy was not a weakness, but her most effective tool.\n\n4.\nThe quiet in her apartment after the divorce was finalized felt like a physical presence. She was forty-two, her partner\u2019s cynicism having finally extinguished their shared flame. Staring at an old photo of her parents at a union rally, a single, clear thought cut through her grief: *My work is not a compromise.* It wasn\u2019t a moment of joy, but of painful, liberating clarity. She was reclaiming her own fire, redirecting all her energy back to the fight that had always been truly hers.\n\n5.\nJust last week, tending the tomato vines on her Bernal Heights balcony, she looked out over the city towards the Mission. She felt a familiar pang of fierce protectiveness, the same she felt for the new youth program she was fighting for. Her garden, her neighborhood, her clients\u2014they all required patient, daily work to thrive against encroaching threats. In the quiet morning sun, she realized this was the essence of her life: not one grand victory, but a thousand small, sustained acts of nurturing."
