Born and raised in the Mission District, he is the son of an Ecuadorian immigrant father who ran a small corner store and a second-generation Chinese-American mother who worked as a seamstress. His childhood was a rich cacophony of Spanish, English, and his grandmother\u2019s Cantonese, set against the colorful backdrop of murals and the scent of pupusas and panaderias. He was a bright, observant kid, more comfortable listening to the stories of neighborhood elders than focusing on his own schoolwork.\n\nHis educational journey was pragmatic. After graduating from a local high school, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco with a vague idea of studying business, believing it was the path to stability. The turning point came when his abuela fell ill. Andre became her de facto translator and advocate, navigating the sterile, confusing maze of healthcare. He witnessed firsthand how language barriers and cultural misunderstandings could lead to poor outcomes and deep frustration. The experience ignited a passion that his business classes could not. He dropped out of college, realizing his true calling was not in spreadsheets, but in people.\n\nHe quickly earned a certificate to become a Community Health Worker. Now, at 31, his life and work are seamlessly intertwined. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in the same subsidized apartment complex in the Mission where his non-profit\u2019s office is based. His days are a fluid mix of home visits to elderly residents, translating for families at Zuckerberg SF General, and running workshops on tenants' rights.\n\nHis social life is an extension of his work. Friends are neighbors, and weekend barbecues in a shared courtyard often turn into informal check-ins. Andre\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; he wants to build a small team to ensure no one in his community feels as lost as his abuela once did. He is deeply rooted in his corner of San Francisco, a human bridge connecting its diverse residents to the care they deserve, his life a testament to the power of community."
