Raised in a farming family, she witnessed firsthand the double-edged sword of the Green Revolution. While it brought bountiful harvests, she also saw the soil tire under the strain of chemical fertilizers and the water table recede. This early education, steeped in the practical wisdom of seasons and soil, formed the bedrock of her life\u2019s work. She pursued a degree in botany at a university in Chandigarh, driven by a desire to understand the science behind the traditions she knew.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in her late twenties, following her husband\u2019s career in the burgeoning tech industry. The foggy, compact city was a world away from the expansive fields of her youth. Initially, Jaspreet felt adrift. Her Indian degree wasn't easily recognized, and professional doors seemed closed. Instead of giving up, she got her hands dirty, volunteering at a community garden in the Mission District. It was there her profound knowledge of plant life, soil health, and sustainable practices began to shine. Fellow gardeners, then non-profit managers, started seeking her advice.\n\nThis was the turning point. Realizing her expertise had immense value, Jaspreet began consulting on a small scale. Her key insight was blending traditional, organic agricultural knowledge with modern urban environmental challenges. She built a reputation for designing resilient green spaces, from corporate rooftop gardens to native plant restoration projects in city parks. Now 52, she runs a successful one-woman consultancy from her home office in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute gives her more time for her true passions: her own meticulously-tended garden filled with herbs and Punjabi vegetables, and early morning walks in Golden Gate Park.\n\nJaspreet\u2019s life is a quiet tapestry of work, family, and community. She is deeply connected to the local Sikh gurdwara and has a close circle of friends. Her dream is not expansion but legacy: to mentor young women of color entering the environmental sciences, ensuring their voices and unique perspectives help shape a more sustainable future for the city she now calls home."

He let a handful of soil, pale and fine, run through his fingers. \"It gives us so much,\" he\u2019d said in Punjabi, his brow furrowed, \"but it is getting tired.\" She felt not just the heat of the sun, but the weight of his words. It was a child\u2019s first, unsettling glimpse into the fragile contract between humans and the earth. That moment planted a seed of quiet responsibility in her that would define her life's work.\n\n2.\nThe first year in San Francisco was the color of fog. At 28, she would stand at her apartment window, staring at the damp, unfamiliar landscape, feeling a profound sense of uselessness. The smell of wet concrete was an alien substitute for the scent of monsoon rain on parched soil. This deep loneliness wasn't just homesickness; it was a feeling of being uprooted, her skills and knowledge invisible. The ache of that time forged a fierce determination to put her hands back in the dirt and find herself again.\n\n3.\nAt the Mission community garden, an older gardener despaired over her limp tomato plants. Jaspreet, then 31, knelt, smelled the soil, and instinctively knew it was too acidic. \"Try crushed eggshells,\" she suggested, echoing her grandmother\u2019s wisdom. A week later, the woman embraced her, pointing to the recovering plants. In that moment, Jaspreet felt a jolt of recognition. Her knowledge wasn't obsolete; it was essential. That simple, shared success was the first brick in the foundation of her new life in America.\n\n4.\nShe was 42 the first time she stood on the finished SoMa rooftop garden she had designed. Below, the city hummed with traffic, but up there, bees buzzed around lavender and office workers snipped mint for their tea. It was a small, quiet oasis she had willed into existence. A profound sense of pride washed over her\u2014not just for the successful project, but for proving she could bring a piece of Punjab's life-giving green to the heart of this concrete city.\n\n5.\nLast year, a young mentee, a brilliant environmental science graduate from Oakland, confessed her fear of not being taken seriously. Jaspreet saw her own 28-year-old self in the young woman\u2019s eyes. She shared her own story of an unrecognized degree and volunteering just to feel the soil again. Seeing the hope spark in her mentee\u2019s face felt more significant than landing any high-paying contract. It was then she knew her true legacy wasn't just building gardens, but helping others grow."
