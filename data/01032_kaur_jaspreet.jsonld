Raised in a farming family, she witnessed firsthand the double-edged sword of the Green Revolution. While it brought bountiful harvests, she also saw the soil tire under the strain of chemical fertilizers and the water table recede. This early education, steeped in the practical wisdom of seasons and soil, formed the bedrock of her life\u2019s work. She pursued a degree in botany at a university in Chandigarh, driven by a desire to understand the science behind the traditions she knew.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in her late twenties, following her husband\u2019s career in the burgeoning tech industry. The foggy, compact city was a world away from the expansive fields of her youth. Initially, Jaspreet felt adrift. Her Indian degree wasn't easily recognized, and professional doors seemed closed. Instead of giving up, she got her hands dirty, volunteering at a community garden in the Mission District. It was there her profound knowledge of plant life, soil health, and sustainable practices began to shine. Fellow gardeners, then non-profit managers, started seeking her advice.\n\nThis was the turning point. Realizing her expertise had immense value, Jaspreet began consulting on a small scale. Her key insight was blending traditional, organic agricultural knowledge with modern urban environmental challenges. She built a reputation for designing resilient green spaces, from corporate rooftop gardens to native plant restoration projects in city parks. Now 52, she runs a successful one-woman consultancy from her home office in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute gives her more time for her true passions: her own meticulously-tended garden filled with herbs and Punjabi vegetables, and early morning walks in Golden Gate Park.\n\nJaspreet\u2019s life is a quiet tapestry of work, family, and community. She is deeply connected to the local Sikh gurdwara and has a close circle of friends. Her dream is not expansion but legacy: to mentor young women of color entering the environmental sciences, ensuring their voices and unique perspectives help shape a more sustainable future for the city she now calls home."
