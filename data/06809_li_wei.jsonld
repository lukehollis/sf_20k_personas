The 0.0-mile commute is a recent, jarring development in a life built on relentless forward motion.\n\nBorn in Guangzhou, Wei immigrated to San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District with his parents at age eight. He spent his youth translating for them at their small grocery store, the scent of dried mushrooms and the murmur of Cantonese a constant backdrop. They preached the gospel of American success: education and a professional career. Wei delivered. He excelled, earning a spot at UC Berkeley, but his heart was in the city itself. He pursued a Master's in Urban Planning, fascinated by how transit, housing, and public space could shape human lives.\n\nHowever, pragmatism\u2014and the desire to give his parents a comfortable retirement\u2014won out. He pivoted, earning an MBA and landing a coveted job at a top-tier management consulting firm. For nearly two decades, his life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and hotel suites. He became an expert at optimizing corporate supply chains, a skill that paid handsomely but felt worlds away from designing community parks. The lifestyle cost him his marriage, a quiet casualty of missed anniversaries and conversations held across continents.\n\nThe pandemic grounded him permanently. Now 46, Wei is a ghost in his own home, his days a metronome of Zoom calls from a desk overlooking the Bay Bridge. The city he once analyzed academically is now just a view. His routine is rigid: a 5 AM workout, coffee, and then a marathon of digital meetings. His primary social connection is a weekly phone call with his retired parents, now living comfortably in a home he bought for them.\n\nLately, however, a new ritual has emerged. Each day at noon, he walks to the Ferry Building, not to buy artisanal cheese, but to simply watch the city breathe. He observes the flow of people, the streetcars, the new construction. That old Urban Planning student is reawakening. Wei has the financial security his parents dreamed of, but he now aspires to something more: to leverage his analytical mind not for corporate profit, but for the public good. He\u2019s quietly exploring pro-bono work for urban non-profits, hoping to finally build a piece of the city he has always loved from a distance."
