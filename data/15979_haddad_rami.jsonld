The son of a pragmatic Lebanese engineer and a thoughtful Ohio-born librarian, he grew up in a quiet Michigan suburb that felt a world away from the vibrant Beirut his father described. His childhood was a cultural mosaic: summers spent shucking corn with his midwestern grandparents, and school nights filled with the scent of za'atar and his father's stories of the old country. This duality made him a natural observer, always trying to understand how different people could find common ground.\n\nHe found his calling not in creating art, but in creating the space for it. Resisting both the pure engineering of his father and the abstract world of art history, he chose Arts Administration at Indiana University\u2014a perfect synthesis of his practical and passionate sides. After graduating, he cut his teeth in Chicago\u2019s gallery scene, learning that his true talent lay in choreographing the intricate dance of human interaction within a cultural space. He wasn\u2019t just managing exhibits; he was shaping experiences.\n\nA key turning point came when he was recruited by a major San Francisco science museum to lead its Visitor Experience department. The move to SF was a deliberate choice. He found a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Mission District, drawn to its vibrant murals and chaotic energy, a stark but welcome contrast to his sleek, modern workplace on the Embarcadero.\n\nHis daily routine is a dialogue with the city. It begins with a cortado from a local cafe, followed by a 2.5-mile bike ride that takes him from the gritty heart of the Mission to the polished waterfront. At work, he orchestrates everything from digital wayfinding to staff training, obsessed with making science and culture feel accessible to everyone. Evenings are often spent with his partner, Chloe, an urban planner, or with a tight-knit circle of friends, debating city politics over Mission-style burritos.\n\nAt 36, Rami feels settled yet ambitious. His income affords him a comfortable life, but his dream isn't about wealth. He envisions one day consulting for smaller, community-focused institutions, helping them build programs that bridge cultural divides. For Rami, who spent his life translating one world to another, his ultimate goal is to design spaces where no one ever feels like an outsider."

As his father sprinkled za\u2019atar on flatbread, Chris wrinkled his nose and asked why their kitchen smelled \u201clike grass.\u201d Rami felt a hot prickle of shame, followed by a fierce, protective love for the scent, for his father\u2019s world. He spent the rest of the evening trying to explain the taste of a place Chris had never been. It was the first time he consciously tried to build a bridge between his two worlds, a blueprint for his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt a chaotic gallery opening in Chicago, he watched a family hesitate by the door, intimidated. On impulse, Rami left the VIPs and approached them. He didn\u2019t talk about the artist\u2019s theory; he talked about the colors, the feeling, and asked the kids what they saw. He watched bewilderment melt into wonder on their faces. In that moment, he felt a profound click of purpose. He wasn't just managing a space; he was opening a door for people who thought it was locked. This was his art.\n\n3.\nHis first weekend in San Francisco, jet-lagged and overwhelmed, he walked into Clarion Alley. The sheer density of paint and politics, anger and beauty, hit him like a physical force. He saw a stylized cedar tree on one wall, a symbol of Lebanon, defiant amidst the chaos. It felt like a sign. The city wasn't just a new address; it was a place that already held a piece of his story. He felt, with a sudden, grounding certainty, that he was home.\n\n4.\nOn his third date with Chloe, they sat in Dolores Park with burritos, watching the city unfold. She started pointing out sightlines and traffic flows, then pulled out a napkin and sketched a better design for a pedestrian crossing nearby. Rami joined in, excitedly adding ideas for public art to slow drivers. The burrito grew cold as they animatedly debated accessibility and aesthetics. He knew then, in that shared language of building a better space for people, that he was falling in love.\n\n5.\nLast fall, he stood back and watched a tour group from a Bayview high school interact with the museum's new tidepool exhibit. He had fought hard for the tactile elements and multilingual digital tags. He overheard one student telling her friend, \u201cI thought this stuff wasn\u2019t for us, you know?\u201d She touched a screen, and her face lit up. That quiet moment of inclusion, of a barrier dissolving, felt more validating than any promotion. It was the feeling he wanted to replicate for the rest of his career."
