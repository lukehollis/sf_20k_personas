Born to a Soviet dissident father who found asylum in the 1970s and a second-generation Chinese-American mother from the Richmond District, his childhood was a fusion of borscht and bao, of Dostoevsky on the shelf next to scrolls of calligraphy. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond, Boris was a quiet, observant boy, more interested in the architectural details of the neighborhood\u2019s modest homes than in playground games. This quiet passion led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Art History at San Francisco State University, where he fell in love with the study of form, value, and historical context.\n\nThe romanticism of academia, however, clashed with the pragmatism instilled by his immigrant parents. After graduation, facing a tough job market for art historians, Boris made a pivotal decision. He took a course in real estate appraisal, discovering that the same skills he used to analyze a Renaissance painting\u2014attention to detail, historical context, and an understanding of value\u2014could be applied to commercial buildings. He found an unexpected satisfaction in the concrete, data-driven world of finance. He built a successful career, becoming a trusted appraiser known for his meticulous reports and deep understanding of the city\u2019s ever-shifting landscape.\n\nNow 45, Boris lives a life of comfortable routine in a meticulously restored Noe Valley Edwardian. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen coffee maker to a sleek home office overlooking his quiet street. His partner of ten years, a landscape architect named Clara, shares his appreciation for aesthetics and quiet spaces. His days consist of analyzing data, conducting virtual property tours, and writing complex valuation reports. Evenings are for walks with Clara through the neighborhood, discussing architectural styles, or enjoying quiet dinners with a small circle of old university friends, most of whom are not in finance.\n\nBoris feels an intimate, almost proprietary connection to San Francisco. He has charted its financial booms and busts not just in headlines, but in square footage and property values. His dream, however, is to eventually pivot back to his first love. He secretly fantasizes about leaving the world of spreadsheets to write a definitive book on San Francisco's forgotten architectural gems\u2014the humble masterpieces he sees every day, their stories and true value known only to him."
