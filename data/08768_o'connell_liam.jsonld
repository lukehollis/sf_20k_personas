His father, a union carpenter, and his mother, a school administrator, provided a stable, secure home, but emotional conversations were a foreign language. Feelings were problems to be solved quietly and individually, a stoicism Liam inherited but never felt comfortable with. He pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology, fascinated by the unspoken rules that governed his own family system.\n\nThe turning point came at 22 when his stoic father had a major heart attack. The family\u2019s inability to process the fear and communicate their grief left a profound mark on Liam. Watching his relatives flounder in emotional silence, he felt a calling not just to understand these dynamics, but to help others navigate them. He broke from the East Coast tradition of staying close to home and moved to San Francisco, enrolling in a Master\u2019s program for Marriage and Family Therapy.\n\nNow 34, Liam runs a successful private practice from a dedicated room in his Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his kitchen to his home office, a space intentionally filled with calm, neutral colors. His days are a series of telehealth sessions, guiding individuals and couples through infidelity, loss, and the quiet anxieties of modern life. He is a professional shepherd of feelings, a role he finds deeply fulfilling.\n\nTo decompress from the emotional weight of his work, Liam relies on the tangible geography of his neighborhood. He takes long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park, buys his produce at the local market on Clement Street, and maintains a small circle of close friends he meets for weekly pub trivia. Professionally, he guides people toward connection, yet he finds dating in the city a complex dance of vulnerability and self-protection.\n\nLiam\u2019s deepest aspiration is to build the kind of family he never had\u2014one where emotional honesty is the foundation. He sees San Francisco not just as the city where he built his career, but as the place where he learned a new language for himself, one he hopes to one day teach his own children."
