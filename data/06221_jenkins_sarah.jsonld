Raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by a practical accountant father and a high school teacher mother, her choice to major in English Literature at the University of Michigan was seen as a romantic, if slightly aimless, indulgence. Post-graduation, she moved to Chicago, finding work as a copyeditor for a small marketing firm, a role that honed her knack for clarifying complex ideas.\n\nThe real turning point came in the early 2000s. Lured by the siren song of the burgeoning tech industry and a promising job offer, she moved west. Sarah discovered her humanities degree was an unexpected asset in a world of engineers. She excelled at translating technical jargon into human language, naturally bridging the gap between development teams and clients. This skill paved her path from technical writer to her current role as a Senior Project Manager, where she orchestrates product launches with a calm authority that belies the chaos.\n\nHer personal life has been shaped by the city's rhythms. She was married for seven years to an ambitious software engineer she met at a startup, a relationship that eventually buckled under the weight of 80-hour work weeks and divergent priorities. The amicable divorce in her late 30s was a reset, prompting her to buy her own condo in Cole Valley.\n\nNow 43, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by a hard-won balance. Her commute is a zero-mile journey from her bedroom to the standing desk in her living room. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls and Jira tickets, but she starts each morning with a walk with her rescue terrier, Buster, in Golden Gate Park, and ends most evenings by closing her laptop and walking to a local restaurant to meet her tight-knit group of friends. San Francisco is no longer a career stepping stone but her home. Her ambitions have shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to finding a role at a mission-driven company. She dreams of a future with more travel and less screen time, a life where her projects have a tangible, positive impact beyond the digital realm."
