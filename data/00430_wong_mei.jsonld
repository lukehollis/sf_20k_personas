The first was her parents\u2019 Chinatown, a world of bustling markets and the scent of roast duck, where they ran a small grocery store after emigrating from Hong Kong. They instilled in her the values of diligence and stability, hoping she\u2019d pursue medicine or law. But Mei Ling was drawn not to arguments or ailments, but to the quiet, elegant logic of systems. While her parents saw it as a gentle act of rebellion, she enrolled in a Master of Library and Information Science program, finding profound beauty in the art of classification.\n\nHer career began in the hushed halls of a university library, but the digital boom of the early 2000s presented a new, chaotic frontier. Mei Ling saw the sprawling, messy data sets of tech companies not as noise, but as a library waiting to be built. She made the pivotal leap into the tech sector, rebranding her classical skills for the modern age. As a Senior Data Librarian, she doesn\u2019t manage books, but the digital DNA of her company, imposing a graceful order on chaotic data lakes and ensuring information is both accessible and meaningful.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute to her home office in the Inner Sunset suits her deliberate nature perfectly. Days begin not with a frantic rush, but with oolong tea and the quiet observation of the fog rolling over the avenues. Her work is a state of deep focus, a silent dialogue with databases and taxonomies. Social life is curated and valued: weekly dim sum with her aging aunt in Clement Street, a virtual book club with friends from grad school, and quiet, insightful conversations with colleagues over Slack.\n\nAt 48, Mei Ling finds herself a content archivist of both her professional and personal worlds. Her deepest aspiration isn't a C-suite title, but a personal project: to meticulously digitize and catalog her own family\u2019s history\u2014the fading photos, her mother\u2019s handwritten recipes, her father\u2019s ledgers. It is a final act of love, her unique way of ensuring her two San Franciscos, the old and the new, are never lost."
