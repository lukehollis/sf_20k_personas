Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, his childhood was defined by the rhythm of his parents\u2019 small Cantonese restaurant. He was their only son, the one they hoped would escape the grueling 16-hour days of the service industry. They pushed him toward a \"real\" career, envisioning him with a stable office job and a clean suit.\n\nTo appease them, Daniel enrolled at City College of San Francisco, initially pursuing an Associate's degree in Business Administration. He found the classes sterile, the concepts detached from the tangible world of texture, heat, and flavor he secretly loved. The turning point came during a sweltering summer spent helping his ailing father in the family kitchen. He realized the choreography of the line, the alchemy of simple ingredients, was where he belonged. Against his parents' wishes, he switched his major, earning his Associate's in Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management.\n\nHis ambition burned hotter than any stovetop. He aggressively sought out apprenticeships beyond his family\u2019s traditional fare, landing a coveted, low-paying stage position at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Hayes Valley. There, he absorbed French technique with a ferocious dedication, working his way up from peeling potatoes to commanding the grill station. Now, at 28, he is the Sous Chef, the Chef de Cuisine\u2019s indispensable second-in-command.\n\nHis life is a testament to his ambition. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small studio apartment directly above the restaurant. His daily routine consists of descending into the kitchen before noon for prep and not returning until well after midnight. His social circle is his kitchen brigade\u2014a found family forged in the heat of service. Relationships outside of this bubble are nearly impossible to maintain.\n\nDaniel's dream is to open his own place, a small, intimate restaurant that fuses the soulful Cantonese cooking of his youth with the precise, modern techniques he has mastered. It\u2019s more than a career goal; it\u2019s his way of honoring his heritage while carving his own legacy, proving to his parents, and himself, that the kitchen was never an escape, but a destination."
