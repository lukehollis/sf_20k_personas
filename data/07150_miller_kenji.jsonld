            "value": "Kenji Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s blended cultures. The son of a meticulous Japanese carpenter from Osaka and a pragmatic American schoolteacher from Ohio, Kenji grew up in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District. His childhood was a study in contrasts: the meditative precision of his father\u2019s woodworking in the garage workshop versus the boisterous, open-ended discussions at the family dinner table. He learned early to appreciate both the beauty of a perfectly joined corner and the power of a well-articulated idea.\n\nThis duality guided his education. After an undergraduate degree in fine arts, he felt a pull towards a more structured discipline, leading him to a Master of Architecture from UC Berkeley. His initial years post-graduation at a large downtown firm were disillusioning. He spent his days drafting schematics for soulless glass towers, feeling disconnected from the tangible craft he\u2019d admired in his father\u2019s work. The turning point came during a solo trip to Japan. Standing amidst the serene rock gardens and wooden temples of Kyoto, he realized his purpose wasn\u2019t to build bigger, but to build with intention.\n\nUpon his return, Kenji quit his corporate job and used a small inheritance to set up a studio in a Dogpatch live-work loft. His 0.0-mile commute now consists of walking from his small kitchen, pour-over coffee in hand, to his drafting table overlooking a quiet street. He specializes in projects that value artistry over scale: residential interiors that play with light and natural materials, sculptural installations for local galleries, and boutique retail spaces.\n\nAt 30, his life is a curated discipline. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow creatives\u2014a ceramicist, a graphic designer, a chef\u2014who share his appreciation for craft. While deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s landscape, he mourns the erosion of its artistic soul. His ultimate dream is not to design a skyscraper, but to create a small, public space\u2014a park pavilion or a community library\u2014that offers a moment of quiet reflection, a testament to his belief that architecture, at its best, is a form of public art."
