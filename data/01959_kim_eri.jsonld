Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her small bedroom to a meticulously organized workbench in the corner of her Inner Richmond apartment. Here, surrounded by oscilloscopes, spools of wire, and magnifying lamps, she builds the future, one tiny circuit board at a time.\n\nBorn in Daly City to first-generation Korean immigrants, Eri grew up absorbing her parents\u2019 ethos of relentless hard work. Her father, an auto mechanic, could diagnose an engine by sound alone, and Eri spent weekends in his garage, fascinated by the intricate systems hidden beneath hoods. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a prestigious four-year degree, Eri felt disconnected from abstract classroom learning. The tangible satisfaction of fixing or building something was what truly moved her.\n\nThis led to her quiet rebellion: enrolling at City College of San Francisco for an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It was a practical, hands-on choice that felt true to her roots. She excelled, her steady hands and patient mind perfectly suited for the delicate work. After graduating, she found a unique role as a Production Technician for a hardware R&D startup. The company sends her schematics and components for proprietary sensor prototypes, which she assembles and tests from her home lab.\n\nHer days are a quiet rhythm of intense focus and neighborhood calm. Work involves hours of silent concentration, broken up by walks through Golden Gate Park or a quick trip to a favorite bakery on Clement Street for a pork bun. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from her CCSF program who share her passion for making things. They meet for hot pot or spend evenings geeking out over new microcontrollers.\n\nEri\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn't about the frantic downtown hustle but the creative undercurrents in its quieter neighborhoods. She feels a kinship with the city's makers and artisans. Her dream isn't to become a tech CEO, but to one day open her own small workshop, creating bespoke audio equipment or interactive electronic art. For now, each carefully assembled prototype on her workbench is a step toward that future, a testament to her belief that true value is built by hand."
