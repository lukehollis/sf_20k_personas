Growing up in a quiet Portland suburb, she was the daughter of an pragmatic engineer and a nurturing elementary school teacher. Her world was stable until her father's Type 2 diabetes diagnosis. She spent her teenage years watching him navigate a labyrinth of insurance paperwork, specialist appointments, and confusing dietary advice. It wasn\u2019t the illness that shaped her, but the systemic brokenness she witnessed. She realized she didn\u2019t want to be a doctor; she wanted to fix the system itself.\n\nThis conviction led her to pursue a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, which brought her to the Bay Area. Upon graduating, she landed a coveted role as a Health Program Manager for a major healthcare provider. Now, from her apartment in the Inner Richmond, Sarah designs and implements preventative care programs\u2014the very kind of support her father so desperately needed. Her 0.0-mile commute means her professional and personal worlds are contained within a few square blocks.\n\nHer days begin not with a commute, but with a ritual. She grabs an oat milk latte from a small cafe on Clement Street before a foggy morning run through Golden Gate Park, her sanctuary for untangling complex project logistics in her mind. The rest of her day is a blur of Zoom calls, data analysis, and coordinating with clinical teams across the state. Recently single after a long-term relationship ended amicably, her social life is a tight-knit circle of grad school friends and colleagues. She's found solace in a weekly ceramics class, loving the tangible feeling of creating something with her hands after a day of managing abstract systems.\n\nSarah feels a deep, quiet connection to San Francisco. It isn't a city she just works in; it's the community she has intentionally built. She dreams of launching a program that demonstrably reduces chronic disease incidents in low-income communities. Personally, she hopes to find a partnership built on mutual ambition and quiet understanding, eventually saving enough to buy a small condo in the neighborhood she now truly calls home."
