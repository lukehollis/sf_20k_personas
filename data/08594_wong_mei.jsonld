Born to hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, her childhood was a symphony of clattering woks, the sharp scent of ginger, and the low hum of conversation from the family restaurant, \u201cJade Phoenix,\u201d which occupied the ground floor. Her parents poured their soul into the business, seeing it as the only path to stability. They dreamed of Mei Lin becoming a doctor or lawyer, something with more prestige than running a kitchen.\n\nFollowing their wishes, Mei Lin enrolled at San Francisco State University, tentatively exploring a degree in business. For two years, she savored a taste of independence, discovering a world beyond inventory and reservations. But a turning point arrived when her father suffered a heart attack. Her mother, overwhelmed, could not manage the restaurant alone. The choice was unspoken but understood. Mei Lin dropped out of college, trading her textbooks for vendor ledgers and her campus life for the familiar confines of home.\n\nOver the next two decades, she became the restaurant's anchor. After her father\u2019s passing and her mother\u2019s retirement, management fell entirely to her. She is a quiet authority, respected by her staff and cherished by the regulars who have watched her grow up. Her life is one of disciplined routine: up at 5 a.m. to check produce deliveries, a full day managing staff and finances, and locking up late at night before climbing the stairs to her apartment, just above the dining room. Her commute is zero miles, but her world often feels just as small. A long-term relationship in her thirties fizzled out, unable to compete with the relentless demands of the Jade Phoenix.\n\nNow at 51, Mei Lin feels a gentle restlessness. The restaurant is stable, but it still feels like her parents\u2019 legacy, not hers. Her dream isn\u2019t to escape, but to transform. She hopes to slowly renovate the dining room, introducing a modern flair to the traditional decor and adding a carefully curated wine list. Her deepest aspiration is to finally make the Jade Phoenix a reflection of herself\u2014a place that honors its past while embracing a future of her own design."
