The son of Gujarati immigrants who ran a small motel in Fremont, he was raised on the principles of hard work and fiscal prudence. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable profession like medicine, David felt drawn to the humanities, earning a Bachelor's in History from UC Davis in the early 90s. He had no grand plan, only a vague desire to understand the systems that shape society.\n\nHis entry into technology was almost accidental. In 1996, needing a job, he took a position as an office manager for a pre-IPO startup in SoMa. Surrounded by ambitious coders and visionary founders, David discovered his talent was not in creating the product, but in creating the environment for it to thrive. He was organized, unflappable, and good with people\u2014the perfect triad for operations. He weathered the dot-com bust by being indispensable, the one person who knew how to keep the lights on. This crucible forged his career path; he became the indispensable \u201cfixer,\u201d moving between companies to build and scale the internal processes that fueled their growth.\n\nA key turning point was meeting his wife, Sarah, a UX designer, at a company offsite in 1999. They married just before the bubble burst, grounding him during a tumultuous professional period. They raised their daughter, Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA, in their cozy Edwardian home in the Inner Sunset.\n\nNow 51 and fully remote, David\u2019s world has shrunk to the blocks around his house. His commute is a walk to his home office, a converted guest room overlooking a small garden. His days are a sequence of video calls, managing teams across time zones, and untangling logistical knots. He knows the baristas at the local coffee shop on Irving Street by name and enjoys weekend walks through Golden Gate Park with Sarah. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from his early tech days.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He aspires to an early retirement within the next five years, hoping to travel extensively with Sarah and finally build the woodworking workshop he\u2019s always wanted in his garage. He yearns to create tangible things with his hands, a stark contrast to a career spent managing the invisible infrastructure of the digital world."
