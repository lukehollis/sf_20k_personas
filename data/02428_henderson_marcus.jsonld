            "value": "Marcus Henderson was a product of the misty, bookish culture of Portland, Oregon. Raised by a librarian mother and a civil engineer father, his childhood was a balanced diet of literary romanticism and pragmatic reality. He devoured novels, believing life\u2019s truths were hidden in prose, which led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature at the University of Oregon. He had vague, lofty dreams of becoming an editor or perhaps even writing the great American novel himself.\n\nHis life\u2019s trajectory shifted dramatically in his early twenties. He followed a serious college girlfriend to San Francisco during the tail-end of the first dot-com boom. While her graphic design career flourished, Marcus struggled to find a footing for his literary skills. Needing to pay the exorbitant rent, he took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a chaotic, fledgling startup. The relationship eventually faded, but the job, unexpectedly, stuck. Marcus discovered a hidden talent for bringing order to the creative chaos of tech. He was the calm, organized center in a storm of brilliant, scatter-brained engineers.\n\nNow 42, Marcus is the seasoned Office Manager for a mid-size tech firm. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern work-from-home era; his office is a designated corner of his meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment. His days are a blur of Zoom calls, digital paperwork, and virtual event planning. He is respected and financially secure, but a quiet melancholy sometimes settles in.\n\nTo combat the isolation, Marcus has cultivated a deep connection to his neighborhood. His routine includes a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and an evening ritual of reading in Patricia's Green, watching the city life unfold. His social circle is small but loyal, a mix of old friends from his early SF days and a few colleagues. His dream of writing a novel hasn't died, but it has downsized. He now hopes to simply find the time and inspiration to write short stories, to reconnect with the young man who once believed a well-crafted sentence could change the world. He's a man who built a successful life by accident, and is now thoughtfully trying to design a purposeful future."
