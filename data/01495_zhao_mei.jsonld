Born in Guangzhou to parents who were academics, she was raised with the expectation that she would follow a similar path of intellectual achievement. She excelled, earning a degree in International Business from a respected university, her future seemingly bright and borderless. At 23, she immigrated with her parents, settling in the familiar embrace of San Francisco's Richmond District, where the fog felt like a promise of a new, cooler start.\n\nThe reality, however, was a harsh adjustment. Her degree, a source of pride back home, didn't translate directly in the competitive Bay Area job market. Her English was good but not yet seamless. The turning point came swiftly and cruelly: her father was diagnosed with a chronic illness that required extensive care and drained the family\u2019s savings. Mei\u2019s dreams of a high-powered business career were shelved. She took a job as a logistics coordinator for an import-export company\u2014practical work that leveraged her bilingualism and organizational skills. It paid the bills and, crucially, allowed her to work from home to be near her father.\n\nAfter her father's passing five years ago, Mei continued in the same role, now as the sole provider for her and her aging mother. Her life is contained within the walls of their modest apartment in the Outer Richmond. Her commute is the ten steps from her bed to her desk. Her daily routine is a quiet symphony of keyboards, conference calls coordinating shipments across the Pacific, and brewing her mother\u2019s favorite oolong tea. Her social connections are few but deep: a standing weekend dim sum with two friends and a deep, unspoken bond with her mother.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not the glittering skyline of downtown, but the misty trails of Lands End and the salty air at Ocean Beach, where she walks to unravel the day's complexities. Her aspiration is no longer a corner office but a small, defiant dream she nurtures in her off-hours: creating her own artisanal tea importing business. It\u2019s a quiet hope that one day, the logistics she manages will be her own, shipping not just goods, but her own passion, from her small corner of the city out into the world."
