The son of third-generation Japanese-American parents, he grew up in the quiet suburbs of Sacramento, where love was expressed through perfectly sliced fruit after dinner and a meticulously maintained home, not words. His father, a civil engineer, and his mother, a pharmacist, valued pragmatism and stability. Kenji, a quiet and observant child, always felt the weight of things left unsaid, an emotional landscape he couldn't navigate.\n\nThis silent struggle became his calling. While his parents hoped for a career in tech or engineering, Kenji pursued a bachelor's in psychology at UC Davis. It was his first act of gentle rebellion, a search for the language his family lacked. The true turning point came during an internship at a university counseling center, where he saw firsthand how unpacking generational trauma could liberate a person. He knew he had found his path. He moved to San Francisco to earn his Master of Science in Counseling Psychology from San Francisco State University, drawn to the city's mosaic of cultures and accepted eccentricities.\n\nNow 31, Kenji is a licensed clinical therapist for a large healthcare provider, conducting all his sessions via telehealth from a tidy spare room in his apartment. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen. His days are a structured rhythm of back-to-back video calls, helping others voice their deepest anxieties. In between, he recharges with walks through Golden Gate Park or by grabbing dim sum from a favorite neighborhood spot.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few close friends from grad school. He finds a deep, unspoken comfort in his neighborhood, where the familiar sights and sounds of the Asian-American community mirror a part of his own identity. Kenji\u2019s dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on serving the AAPI community, helping others build the bridges of communication he spent his youth trying to find. He hopes, too, to build a personal relationship as honest and vulnerable as the ones he helps his clients foster every day."
