Raised in a quiet, master-planned suburb of Sacramento by a CPA father and a librarian mother, his childhood was a map of tidy grids and predictable schedules. While other kids played sports, David built elaborate Lego cities, obsessed with traffic flow and the logic of their design. This fascination with how places and people move was a thread that would weave through his entire life.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree in geography at UC Davis before being drawn to the beautiful, chaotic mess of the Bay Area for his Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. It was here he found his calling. San Francisco wasn't a neat grid; it was a complex organism of hills, microclimates, and competing transit needs, a puzzle he was desperate to solve. After graduating, he secured a position with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, a perfect fit for his analytical mind.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s life is a study in quiet intention. The pandemic shifted his role to permanently remote, resulting in a 0.0-mile commute from his home office in the Inner Richmond. His days are spent analyzing traffic data and modeling the impact of new bike lanes or bus-only corridors. He is deeply invested in his work, believing that equitable transportation is a cornerstone of a just city.\n\nHis partner of ten years, Sarah, a compassionate elementary school teacher, provides a crucial balance to his data-driven world. Their evenings are spent cooking together, taking long walks through Golden Gate Park, or enjoying a beer at their local pub. David isn't a native, but his connection to San Francisco is profound. He sees the city not just as a resident, but as a caretaker. His ultimate dream is to one day ride a seamless Muni line or protected bikeway that he helped champion from a concept into concrete reality, leaving a small, orderly mark on the city he loves."

His father knelt beside him, and David, with grave seriousness, explained why the plastic bus stop couldn't be moved\u2014it would disrupt the entire commuter flow to the downtown fire station. He expected a pat on the head, but saw genuine interest in his dad's eyes. It was the first time someone saw the logic, not just the toy. That quiet moment of validation gave him permission to care so deeply about how things fit together.\n\n2.\nHe remembers that first ride on the N Judah as a Berkeley grad student. The train, packed with a cross-section of the city, plunged into the Duboce tunnel. The sudden shift from foggy avenues to the dark, roaring underground felt like a transition into the city\u2019s very bloodstream. It wasn\u2019t a problem to be solved, but a living organism to understand and nurture. In that moment of awe, his academic fascination became a deep, personal calling to serve the beautiful, chaotic system he was now a part of.\n\n3.\nHe was in his late twenties, presenting his first major bike lane proposal at a community meeting. He came armed with traffic flow models and safety statistics. He was met with pure, unadulterated rage from shop owners and elderly residents. His data meant nothing against their fear of losing parking and security. He went home humbled, realizing a planner\u2019s real job isn\u2019t just to design a grid, but to listen to the messy, human heart of a street. It was a painful lesson in empathy.\n\n4.\nAbout five years ago, walking with Sarah near the Conservatory of Flowers, he was venting about a stalled JFK Drive initiative. Sarah stopped him, pointing to a kid wobbling on a training-wheel bike on a smooth, car-free stretch of pavement. \u201cThat\u2019s your data point,\u201d she said softly. The abstract frustration of his work dissolved, replaced by the profound, simple reality of a child\u2019s freedom. It reminded him that every line on his map was a potential pathway for someone\u2019s joy.\n\n5.\nDuring the strange quiet of the 2020 pandemic, he went for a bike ride through his own neighborhood in the Inner Richmond. He turned a corner onto a newly designated \u201cSlow Street\u201d\u2014a project whose data he had helped model from his home office just weeks before. Seeing families strolling down the center line and kids drawing with chalk where cars used to dominate, he felt a profound sense of purpose. It was a temporary change, but a powerful glimpse of the more humane city he was working to build."
