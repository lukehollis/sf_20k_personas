Growing up in the misty suburbs of Portland, Oregon, her younger brother Leo struggled with a developmental disorder that left him largely non-verbal. While others grew frustrated, Sarah discovered she could connect with him through sketchpads and colored pencils. Art became their shared language, a bridge across the silence, planting the seed for her life\u2019s work.\n\nShe pursued an undergraduate degree in Fine Arts, but found the solitary studio life unfulfilling. The turning point came during a volunteer stint at a children's hospital, where she saw the profound impact creative expression had on anxious and ailing kids. This clarified her purpose, leading her to San Francisco for a graduate program in Art Therapy & Counseling Psychology. She fell in love with the city's vibrant, accepting culture and never left.\n\nFor over a decade, Sarah has worked for a non-profit that partners with San Francisco\u2019s schools and community health centers. Her days are a mosaic of human experience: helping a withdrawn teenager articulate trauma through clay sculptures, guiding a family in creating a collaborative mural to heal conflict, or using watercolors with a child in palliative care.\n\nNow 40, Sarah lives a deliberately grounded life in the Inner Richmond. Her 2.8-mile bicycle commute, often looping through Golden Gate Park, is a meditative daily ritual that bookends her emotionally demanding work. Mornings start with strong coffee from a local cafe, and evenings are often spent cooking with her partner of six years, Marco, a landscape architect who shares her appreciation for form and nature. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow therapists, artists, and old friends from grad school.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to open her own community-based healing arts studio in the city, a welcoming space offering accessible art therapy for all ages. She envisions a place where, just as she did for her brother years ago, she can help others find their voice, one brushstroke at a time."

After an hour of shared silence, her brother picked up a brilliant yellow crayon and, with intense, focused effort, drew a lopsided sun over the house she had sketched. He looked up at her and gave a small, rare smile. It wasn't just a drawing; it was the first time she understood that art could be a language, a bridge over silence. This moment became the foundational blueprint for her life.\n\n2.\nAt 21, volunteering at the children's hospital felt more real than any solo studio critique. She remembers a small girl named Maya, who was terrified before a procedure. Sarah gave her paper and markers. Maya drew a giant, fuzzy \u201cworry monster.\u201d Then, she giggled and gave it a tiny party hat. That small act of transforming fear into something manageable was a thunderclap of clarity for Sarah. It was the moment she knew her art wasn't meant for quiet galleries but for messy, courageous human hands.\n\n3.\nHer first semester of grad school in San Francisco was lonely and overwhelming. One afternoon, she impulsively got off the bus in the Mission District. The vibrant, chaotic murals covering the alley walls felt like a revelation. She saw stories of ancestors, struggles, and celebrations exploding with color. It was the city's heart, raw and public. Standing there, surrounded by the art of the people, she felt a profound sense of belonging. She knew then that she wasn't just studying in a city; she had found her home.\n\n4.\nShe recalls a teenage client who, for months, would only knead a lump of grey clay into a tight, impenetrable fist. Sarah simply sat with him in that quiet resistance, session after session. Then one Tuesday, he slowly, deliberately, opened the clay fist. Nestled inside was a tiny, fragile bird. He never said a word, but his eyes met hers with a flicker of trust. That quiet breakthrough taught her the deepest lesson of her career: to honor the pace of healing and trust the power of the process.\n\n5.\nOn an early date six years ago, she and Marco walked through the Fern Dell in Golden Gate Park. She mentioned how the negative space between the fronds was as important as the leaves themselves. Marco stopped, his face lit with recognition, and began talking about \"designing the void\" in his landscapes. In that moment, she felt seen in a way that startled her. It wasn't just a shared interest; it was a shared way of seeing the world, cementing a partnership grounded in a mutual respect for form and nature."
