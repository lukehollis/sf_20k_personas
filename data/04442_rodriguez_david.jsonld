The only son of a construction foreman and a school administrator, David learned early on the difference between a house and a home, a street and a community. While his father built the physical structures of the Central Valley, David became fascinated by the invisible architecture that shaped people's lives: the lack of parks, the dominance of highways, the clear lines of economic segregation. This fascination fueled his educational journey, leading him from Cal Poly to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, an idealist drawn to the city's progressive reputation and unique geography. He joined the city\u2019s planning department, eager to make his mark. Now, as a City Planner III, the idealism has been weathered into a resilient pragmatism. He has spent two decades navigating the labyrinth of public feedback, political maneuvering, and budgetary constraints. His greatest professional pride is a hard-won affordable housing development in the Mission, a project that took nearly a decade of battling to bring to fruition. It serves as his proof that the slow, frustrating work can yield tangible good.\n\nAt 48, David\u2019s life is ordered and solitary. A demanding career contributed to a quiet divorce years ago, and his social life is now a small circle of colleagues and a couple of old friends. Since the pandemic, his commute is zero. He plans the bustling metropolis from a quiet, book-lined home office in his Cole Valley apartment. His daily routine is a paradox: he spends eight hours manipulating the city on-screen, then spends his evenings walking through Golden Gate Park, reconnecting with the tangible world of fog, trees, and the diverse residents he serves.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is now less a passionate love affair and more a long-term, committed marriage. He sees its flaws with painful clarity but remains dedicated to its potential. David no longer dreams of utopian transformations. His aspiration is simpler, more profound: to leave behind a city that is incrementally better, more equitable, and more humane because of his patient, unseen work within the system."

The wind was sharp, but the view... it wasn't just buildings, it was a living system laid out before him. From the geometric grid of the Sunset to the chaotic tangle downtown, he saw a beautiful, complicated puzzle. He felt a profound sense of purpose crystallize in his chest. This was the place. This was the work. It was the purest version of his hope, a feeling he would chase for the next two decades.\n\n2.\nA community meeting in the Outer Richmond, maybe 2003. He presented a modest parklet plan, full of optimistic renderings. He expected gratitude. Instead, he got vitriol\u2014over parking spaces, shadows, \"the wrong kind of people.\" He drove home that night feeling hollowed out, the simplicity of his blueprints shattered by the messy reality of human lives. Idealism died a little that night, replaced by the grim understanding that progress would be a street fight, not a polite discussion.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't the ribbon-cutting for the Mission housing project in 2015. It was a Tuesday evening months later. He walked by and saw a family on their new balcony, a little girl watering a pot of marigolds. No one knew who he was. In that anonymous moment, the ten years of brutal meetings and political fights dissolved into a quiet, bone-deep satisfaction. It wasn\u2019t a victory; it was a home. This was the tangible good he could hold onto.\n\n4.\nShortly after the divorce was final, around 2018, he found himself at the Dutch Windmill at dusk. The tourists were gone. It was just him, the fog, and the sound of the ocean. His apartment felt impossibly empty then, but the city didn't. He realized his marriage to San Francisco was the one that had endured. It was a cold comfort, but a comfort nonetheless. The city was a flawed but constant companion, demanding everything and, in its own way, holding him up.\n\n5.\nEarly in the 2020 lockdown, he was redrawing zoning maps for SOMA on his monitor. He looked out his Cole Valley window at the unnervingly silent street below. The paradox was staggering: he was manipulating the lifeblood of a metropolis from one quiet room, while the city itself held its breath. It was a moment of profound disconnection and responsibility. The city wasn't just concrete and code; it was a fragile ecosystem he had to help nurture back to life from a distance."
