Raised in a quiet Portland suburb by an engineer father and a librarian mother, her childhood was filled with books and a deep appreciation for structured beauty. This led her not to code, but to art, culminating in a Master of Fine Arts in Museum Studies. Her dream was to curate exhibits at a world-class institution, a dream that brought her to San Francisco in the late 1990s with aspirations of working at the de Young or SFMOMA.\n\nThe reality of a competitive, low-paying arts scene was a harsh turning point. Facing student loans, she took a \"temporary\" job at a fledgling e-commerce startup, organizing product listings. It was there she had her epiphany: a digital storefront was just a different kind of gallery, and user experience was a form of storytelling. She applied her academic principles of curation and narrative to the burgeoning tech world, and her career took off. She navigated the dot-com bust, proved her value, and steadily climbed the ladder, her unique background making her a sought-after leader in a field dominated by MBAs.\n\nNow 46, Sarah lives a deliberately grounded life in a meticulously kept Cole Valley apartment that doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a routine she treasures: a morning coffee from Reverie Cafe, a walk up to Tank Hill to watch the fog burn off the city, followed by a day of back-to-back video calls. Her home is her sanctuary, filled with art from local makers and an impressive collection of houseplants. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a handful of friends\u2014a mix of tech veterans and artists\u2014with whom she shares dinners and hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nHaving achieved professional success, Sarah\u2019s aspirations have shifted. She feels the pull of her original passion and dreams of a future where she can bridge her two worlds\u2014perhaps consulting for museums on digital strategy or mentoring young women from arts backgrounds to find their place in tech. She loves the city that forged her career but remains deeply connected to the version of San Francisco that exists beyond the screen, in the quiet streets of her neighborhood and the wild nature just over the bridge."
