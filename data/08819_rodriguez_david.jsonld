The only son of Mexican immigrants who poured their life savings into a beloved Fresno taqueria, David grew up witnessing the sharp-edged realities of community struggle. He saw how local water rights policies could threaten a neighbor's farm and how zoning laws could stifle small businesses like his parents\u2019. While his parents measured success in satisfied customers and balanced books, David began to see a larger system at play, a machine of policy and power he was determined to understand.\n\nDriven by this nascent purpose, he became the first in his family to attend a four-year university, enrolling at UC Davis. It was there his vague interest in \"helping people\" crystallized into a passion for public policy. His turning point came during a summer internship with a local assembly member, where he helped draft a proposal for small business grants. Seeing his research translate into potential aid for families like his own was electrifying. He went on to earn a Master of Public Policy from UC Berkeley, graduating with a clear goal: to work within the government he once viewed from the outside.\n\nNow, at 33, David is a Senior Policy Analyst for the City and County of San Francisco. He lives in a clean, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a stone's throw from the grandeur of City Hall. His 0.0-mile commute is a product of a hybrid work schedule; he spends his days drafting briefs on housing affordability and homeless services, his evenings often poring over data for the next day's committee meeting.\n\nHis life is an intricate dance of progress and gridlock. He socializes with a tight-knit group of fellow policy wonks and old college friends, debating city politics over craft beer in the Mission or catching shows at the SFJAZZ Center. He is deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014both its vibrant, progressive ideals and its frustrating, complex problems are the central focus of his life. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. He hopes to one day lead a major city department or even run for a seat on the Board of Supervisors, finally gaining the leverage to enact the systemic change he first envisioned from behind the counter of his family's taqueria."
