Her father, an African American aircraft mechanic, spoke of tolerances and torque with a reverence usually reserved for scripture. Her Korean mother, a masterful seamstress, could spot a flawed stitch from across the room. Growing up, Nia\u2019s world was one of well-made things, from tuned-up engines to perfectly tailored clothes. This instilled in her a deep appreciation for quality, though her path to professionalizing it was indirect.\n\nShe pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Industrial Design, drawn to the intersection of aesthetics and function. However, upon graduating, she found the design world more conceptual than she craved. A key turning point came through a temp job at a medical device assembly plant. While her peers saw tedious repetition, Nia saw systems. She instinctively identified bottlenecks and potential points of failure, drafting reports on her own time to improve the workflow. Her manager, impressed by her unsolicited expertise, created a junior quality assurance role for her. This was her calling.\n\nNia\u2019s career blossomed. She moved to San Francisco a decade ago, recruited by a boutique electronics firm specializing in high-end audio equipment. The move also marked a personal fresh start after the amicable end of a long-term relationship. Today, her 0.0-mile commute is the envy of the city; she lives in a spacious live-work loft in the Dogpatch, directly above the small-batch manufacturing lab where she works.\n\nHer days are a careful rhythm of process audits, material testing, and statistical analysis. After work, she trades her calipers for a walk along the waterfront, often ending up at a local brewery with a small circle of friends from the neighborhood\u2019s maker scene. Nia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tactile\u2014it's in the reclaimed industrial architecture of her home and the innovative products she helps bring to life. Her dream isn\u2019t corporate ascent but mastery. She aspires to one day open her own consulting firm, helping small, ethical hardware startups build things that are not just beautiful, but built to last."
