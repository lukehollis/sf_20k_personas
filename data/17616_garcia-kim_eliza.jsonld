Raised in Berkeley, she was the only child of a quiet, methodical Korean-American architect and a fiery third-generation Spanish-American community organizer. Her childhood home was a place of intellectual debate and cultural fusion, where blueprints for low-income housing shared table space with posters for farmworker rallies. This blend of pragmatism and passion defined her from a young age, instilling a deep belief that well-designed systems could foster social justice.\n\nHer path was clarified by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a teenager, witnessing neighborhoods crumble and communities rally in response, Eliza saw her future. She pursued her undergraduate degree at UCLA before earning a Master's in Urban Planning and Public Policy from Harvard. Her early career was spent in the trenches of city government, working on housing initiatives and transit projects. While she found the work rewarding, the bureaucratic pace was frustrating. This led her to a pivotal career change, moving into the private sector as a social impact consultant. Here, she discovered she could effect broader change by advising dozens of foundations and companies on how to invest their resources for maximum community benefit.\n\nNow a Director of Strategy, Eliza lives a life of intentionality in Hayes Valley. Her hyphenated name is a relic of a marriage that ended amicably a decade ago; she kept it as an honor to that chapter of her life. Her 2.6-mile commute on the MUNI Metro isn't a chore but a daily affirmation of her belief in public infrastructure. Evenings are often spent with her long-term partner, a jazz musician, hosting small dinner parties or attending a performance at SFJAZZ.\n\nAt 51, Eliza feels a growing pull towards a more direct legacy. Her professional success is secure, but her ambition has shifted. She dreams of leveraging her experience to run for a City Supervisor seat in the next decade, moving from advising power to wielding it for the public good, completing the circle that began in her parents' bustling, idealistic home."

            "value": "Here are 5 personal memories for Eliza Garcia-Kim:\n\n1.  She was 17. The shaking had stopped, but the world still felt tilted. In the dusty Berkeley twilight, she saw her father methodically checking the foundations of a neighbor\u2019s porch while her mother coordinated a water-sharing station on the sidewalk. It wasn't the chaos of the Loma Prieta quake that struck her, but the immediate, instinctual creation of a new, temporary system. In that fractured moment, she saw not rubble, but the blueprint of her own future, a career built on mending the breaks.\n\n2.  She was in her early thirties, sitting in a beige City Hall conference room. The plans for the Mission Creek affordable housing project, her project, were perfect. Yet, the meeting devolved into a fifth debate over three parking spaces. She felt the passion drain out of her, replaced by a cold, bureaucratic weight. It was then she realized she was trying to fix the machine from the inside with a tiny wrench, when what she really needed was to advise the person who owned the entire factory.\n\n3.  A decade ago, sitting with the name-change forms after the divorce was finalized, her pen hovered. Garcia-Kim. It wasn\u2019t a reminder of an ending, but an artifact of a life built together, a foundational chapter. Keeping it felt less like holding on and more like an architectural preservation\u2014honoring a structure that was part of her own story. It was a quiet, personal decision to carry her whole history with her, not just the parts that were still standing.\n\n4.  Just last winter, on her morning MUNI ride, the train stalled briefly near Duboce Park. A tourist looked panicked, late for a tour. Without a word, a construction worker and a young woman in scrubs both pulled out their phones to show him alternate bus routes. The shared, quiet act of city-dweller solidarity filled Eliza with a profound sense of rightness. This, she thought, is the return on investment. This is the system working not because of policy, but because of people.\n\n5.  She was at SFJAZZ a few months ago, watching her partner\u2019s hands fly across his upright bass. He was improvising, taking a simple theme and building something complex and beautiful from it. In that moment, watching him lead his trio through a measure of pure artistry, Eliza saw her own future flicker into focus. It wasn't enough to advise anymore. She wanted the instrument in her own hands\u2014to take the city\u2019s foundational theme and, through experience and guts, improvise a better, more just future."
