Born in Fiji to an Indo-Fijian family, he was five when his parents immigrated to the Bay Area, seeking better opportunities. They settled in Daly City, where Rohan grew up surrounded by a vibrant, diverse community. His father worked long hours as a taxi driver and his mother as a hotel housekeeper, instilling in him a formidable work ethic. School was a place Rohan navigated with quiet diligence, but he never felt a strong academic calling.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life came at sixteen when his younger sister, Maya, was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. Rohan watched, fascinated, as behavioral technicians worked with Maya, patiently unlocking her ability to communicate and connect with the world. He saw a career that wasn't about abstract theories but about tangible, life-changing impact. After graduating high school, while his friends left for college, Rohan enrolled in a certification program and became a Registered Behavior Technician.\n\nNow 24, Rohan lives in a small, shared apartment in the Inner Richmond. His life is a carefully budgeted routine. His day begins before the fog has fully lifted, with a 3.8-mile commute on the 38-Geary Muni bus to the clinic where he works. His job is demanding, requiring immense patience and empathy as he helps children with developmental challenges. He finds deep fulfillment in the small breakthroughs\u2014a new word spoken, a moment of shared eye contact. His $52,000 salary is tight in San Francisco, but he makes it work, finding joy in simple pleasures: cheap, delicious dim sum on Clement Street, long walks through Golden Gate Park, and weekend visits to his family in Daly City.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic landmarks and more about its human tapestry. He sees the city through the eyes of the families he serves and the diverse faces on his daily bus ride. His core social circle is small, consisting of a few coworkers and childhood friends. His dream is to eventually become a Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA), which would allow him to design treatment plans himself. Ultimately, he hopes to earn enough to help support his parents and ensure his sister Maya always has the best possible care, continuing the cycle of family devotion that brought him to this city."

For an hour, there was only patient repetition. Then, Maya, who had been silent for weeks, looked at the card, then at him, and whispered, \u201cRo.\u201d It wasn't his full name, but it was everything. In that moment, the abstract idea of a job became a concrete calling. It wasn\u2019t about a career; it was about hearing his name again.\n\n2.\nThe memory of his father coming home late is etched in his mind. Rohan, about twelve, would pretend to be asleep but watch from his doorway. He\u2019d see his dad slumped at the kitchen table, the scent of car air freshener and gasoline clinging to him as he counted out a stack of crumpled bills. No words were exchanged, but Rohan understood. That quiet, exhausted ritual became the foundation of his own work ethic\u2014a silent promise to make that parental sacrifice mean something.\n\n3.\nLast year, a four-year-old boy at the clinic, a child lost in his own world, had not willingly touched another person for months. Rohan spent weeks just sitting near him, humming softly. One rainy Tuesday, the boy wordlessly walked over and placed his small hand on Rohan\u2019s arm. It lasted only five seconds. For Rohan, that fleeting touch was a seismic event, a jolt of pure joy that refueled his spirit and made the tight budget and long bus rides feel insignificant.\n\n4.\nRiding the 38-Geary home last spring, the bus was crowded and damp. An elderly Cantonese woman saw a young mother struggling with a crying baby and a grocery bag. Without a shared word, the older woman reached out, rocked the baby\u2019s carrier with a gentle, practiced hand, and smiled. Rohan watched the silent, effortless act of community. It affirmed his vision of San Francisco: not as a city of bridges, but of small, unspoken connections that hold everything together.\n\n5.\nJust last month, sitting on a bench near Stow Lake, fog swirling around the trees, he felt the week\u2019s exhaustion settle deep in his bones. He pulled out his phone, not to scroll, but to review flashcards for his BCaBA coursework. Looking from the flickering screen to the serene water, he felt a profound sense of peace. This was his path\u2014the daily grind, the quiet study, the slow walk towards a future where he could finally provide for his family the way they had for him."
