Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants who ran a successful fabric import business, her childhood was defined by the sun-baked sprawl of the South Bay. She was a quiet, observant child, fascinated not by the suburban cul-de-sacs but by the BART train that sliced through it all, a silver promise of a different, more concentrated world. This fascination with how people and places connect propelled her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco in her late twenties, trading suburban quiet for the kinetic energy of the city she\u2019d only studied. Priya dedicated her career to the public sector, believing that transportation was a fundamental equity issue. She started as a junior planner, meticulously analyzing traffic flow and bus routes, and steadily rose through the ranks at the SFMTA. Her early career was marked by a marriage to a software engineer and the birth of their daughter, Maya. For years, she was a working mother, intimately familiar with the challenges of navigating the city with a stroller and a deadline.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago. An amicable divorce left her a single parent and, paradoxically, more rooted in her community than ever. She moved into her current apartment in Duboce Triangle, chosen for its central location and proximity to transit and parks. Now, at 51, her daughter is away at college on the East Coast, and her life has found a new rhythm.\n\nPriya\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her life\u2019s philosophy. She works primarily from her light-filled apartment, her professional analyses of MUNI reliability punctuated by the real-world rumble of the N-Judah line outside her bay window. Her days involve long walks through her neighborhood, greeting the owners of the local corner store and observing the daily ballet of dog walkers, commuters, and unhoused residents that she factors into her planning. Her hope is not for a promotion but for legacy: to see a handful of her long-term projects\u2014a more efficient bus rapid transit line, a network of truly safe bike lanes\u2014come to full fruition. She dreams of a San Francisco that is more accessible for everyone and, for herself, perhaps a trip to see the public transit systems of Tokyo and Berlin, finding inspiration for the city she continues to serve."

Stepping out of the Montgomery BART station, the dense air, the symphony of languages and sirens, the sheer verticality of it all\u2014it wasn't scary, it was a revelation. The sun-baked quiet of Fremont suddenly felt like a preamble, not the story itself. That day, standing on a crowded city corner, she felt the first true thrum of connection, a current that would eventually pull her life\u2019s work into its orbit.\n\n2.\nMaya was a toddler, the rain was relentless, and the 22-Fillmore was packed. Priya remembers the burn of shame and frustration trying to collapse the stroller with one hand while her daughter wailed. An older woman silently helped, a shared, weary glance passing between them. In that moment, her work at the SFMTA became fiercely personal. Equity wasn\u2019t a policy brief; it was a dry, safe space on a crowded bus for a tired mother. Her resolve to fix the system was no longer academic; it was bone-deep.\n\n3.\nThe first night in her Duboce Triangle apartment, post-divorce, was startlingly peaceful. Her life was now contained in these boxes, her future hers alone to map. As she sat on the hardwood floor, the N-Judah rumbled past the bay window, its familiar groan a comforting presence. It wasn\u2019t the sound of a city interrupting her solitude; it felt like the city was checking in on her. In that moment, single and newly centered, she felt more rooted and powerfully herself than she ever had before.\n\n4.\nShe stood anonymously at a freshly painted bus shelter on Van Ness, years of contentious meetings and revised blueprints in her past. She watched as one of the new red BRT buses she championed glided into the station. A woman pushing a double stroller and a man using a walker boarded with an ease that simply didn\u2019t exist before. No one knew her role in this small, daily ballet of accessibility. This quiet, invisible victory felt more profound than any promotion she could ever receive.\n\n5.\nOn a recent video call, Maya complained about the inefficient bus system at her East Coast college. From her apartment, Priya listened, offering sympathetic noises as the reliable rumble of the N-Judah punctuated their conversation. She felt a swell of quiet pride, not just for the daughter she raised to be observant and critical, but for the functioning slice of the city outside her own window. She had built a good life for Maya to leave, and a good city for herself to stay in."
