The son of a pragmatic Chinese-American father who ran a small hardware store and a fiercely idealistic Irish-American mother who taught public school, Leo grew up a living bridge between cultures. His childhood was a mosaic of dim sum in the Richmond District and corned beef on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, experiences that taught him how different communities coexist, sharing the same urban space.\n\nThis fascination with the city's living fabric led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies. He was less interested in abstract theories and more in the tangible impact of design on daily life: the width of a sidewalk, the placement of a park bench, the flow of a bus route. After graduating, he landed a junior role at a downtown architecture firm, slowly climbing the ranks from an assistant to a respected Project Manager in Urban Design.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with the death of his grandmother. As he helped clear out her small, rent-controlled apartment in Chinatown, he found journals detailing her decades-long fight against encroaching development and the slow erosion of her community's character. This inheritance wasn't monetary; it was a profound sense of responsibility. His job transformed from a career into a calling, infusing his work with a new urgency to preserve the soul of the city.\n\nToday, Leo lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he loves for its successful blend of modern design and community-focused public spaces. His 1.5-mile commute on the Muni bus is a daily field study. He's in a serious relationship with Clara, a landscape architect he met through work, and their dates often involve dissecting the merits of new parklets or public plazas. He still plays kickball with college friends in Golden Gate Park a few times a month.\n\nLeo\u2019s ambition is to lead a project that becomes a benchmark for equitable urban development\u2014a space that fosters community rather than displacing it. He aspires to create pockets of San Francisco that feel as authentic and welcoming as the city of his memory, ensuring that future generations can build their own diverse stories within its iconic landscape."

His Irish grandfather watches as his dad patiently explains the difference between two screw types to an elderly Cantonese-speaking woman. His father isn't just translating words; he's translating a solution. In that quiet, dusty aisle, Leo saw his family as the glue between worlds. It taught him that the most vital urban infrastructure wasn't concrete, but communication and a shared desire to fix what's broken.\n\n2.\nFive years ago, in his grandmother\u2019s Chinatown apartment, the air was thick with the scent of mothballs and dried citrus peel. He found her journals tucked in a sewing box. Page after page detailed her fight to save a community garden from developers. He felt the weight of her quiet, decades-long resilience, a force he\u2019d never fully understood. It was in that moment his ambition crystallized. His work was no longer about blueprints; it was about honoring her legacy of place-keeping.\n\n3.\nHe remembers an early date with Clara two years ago. They were walking down Valencia Street, and she stopped abruptly, pointing at a new parklet. For twenty minutes, they debated the chosen materials and the angle of the benches\u2014a passionate, joyful argument under the streetlights. It was the first time his professional obsession felt like a shared language of intimacy. In her excitement, he saw a partner not just for his life, but for his mission. It was thrilling.\n\n4.\nJust last month, on his N-Judah commute through the foggy Inner Sunset, his train car was silent. Then, a tourist\u2019s toddler began to cry. Before the parents could react, an older woman pulled a small wind-up bird from her purse, its chirping sound instantly calming the child. A brief, shared smile passed between the strangers. This small, unscripted moment of grace is what he designs for\u2014to create spaces that allow for these tiny, beautiful acts of community to happen.\n\n5.\nTwo summers ago, during a kickball game in Golden Gate Park. The fog was just starting to swallow the tops of the cypress trees. He connected perfectly with the red rubber ball, sending it soaring. As he rounded the bases, his friends\u2019 cheers echoing, he felt a pure, uncomplicated joy. The moment was a visceral reminder that the city wasn't just a project to be managed, but a place to live, to play, to feel the damp grass under his feet. This feeling is what he fights to preserve."
