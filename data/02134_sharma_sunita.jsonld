Raised in a bustling home filled with the fragrance of marigolds and spices, she was a bright, curious girl who dreamed of studying botany. She enrolled in a local college, fascinated by the structure and resilience of plants. However, her path was rerouted at nineteen by an arranged marriage to an ambitious software engineer moving to America. Her college education, like her life in India, was packed away.\n\nLife in the Bay Area was a quiet shock. Swapping the vibrant chaos of Jaipur for the sterile quiet of a Fremont suburb, Sunita devoted herself to being a wife and, soon after, a mother to two children. While her husband built a successful career, she found her purpose in nurturing her family. The true turning point came decades later when her husband was diagnosed with a degenerative illness. For three years, Sunita became his primary caregiver, navigating a complex world of medications, appointments, and profound emotional support. In this crucible of grief and duty, she discovered an unexpected calling.\n\nAfter her husband passed away, with her children grown and leading their own lives, Sunita felt a need for a new identity. At 48, she enrolled in a program and became a Certified Nursing Assistant. The work was demanding but deeply familiar; it was the care she had given her husband, now offered to others. She took a live-in position at an assisted living facility in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, which explains her zero-mile commute. Her small apartment is just an elevator ride away from her work.\n\nHer days are a rhythm of compassion: waking residents, assisting with meals, listening to stories from lives long-lived. Her social circle is her colleagues and the elderly people she cares for, to whom she has become a confidante and friend. On her days off, she takes long walks to Ocean Beach, the cold sea air a stark, beautiful contrast to her Jaipur childhood. Sunita\u2019s dream is no longer of botany, but of saving enough to visit her sister in India. Her quiet aspiration is to start a small herb garden in the facility\u2019s neglected courtyard, bringing a little piece of her first passion to the community that is now her life."
