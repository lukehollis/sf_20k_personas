Born and raised in the Richmond District, she is the eldest child of Hong Kong immigrants who arrived in the 1970s. Her father was a line cook in Chinatown, his hands perpetually smelling of ginger and soy, while her mother worked as a seamstress from their small apartment, the constant hum of her sewing machine the soundtrack to Mei\u2019s childhood. They instilled in her a profound sense of duty and the pragmatic understanding that stability was the ultimate luxury.\n\nAmbitious and bright, Mei enrolled at San Francisco State University to study Business Administration, dreaming of a corner office with a view. However, her plans were derailed when her father suffered a debilitating stroke during her sophomore year. Without hesitation, Mei dropped out to support her family, trading textbooks for the city\u2019s complex transit map. She took a job as a Muni bus operator, a stable, union-protected position that offered the benefits her family desperately needed.\n\nThe work was grueling but honest. Mei discovered a knack for navigating the city\u2019s chaotic streets and a quiet authority in managing unruly passengers. She didn't just drive routes; she learned the pulse of the city, the daily migration of its people. Over two decades, her dedication saw her rise through the ranks from operator to her current role as a Transit Supervisor. Her \"some college\" business knowledge proved invaluable in managing logistics, schedules, and personnel.\n\nNow 42, Mei lives a simple, organized life in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a short bus ride from the depot. Her personal life is centered on her widowed mother, whom she visits every weekend, and her younger brother, an engineer whose college education she helped fund. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow Muni employees\u2014her \"work family.\" Her quiet dream is to one day finish her degree, not for a career change, but for herself. She also harbors a desire to visit her parents\u2019 ancestral villages in Guangdong. Mei Lin Wong may not have the skyline view she once imagined, but as she ensures the city\u2019s arteries flow smoothly each morning, she knows she is an essential part of the San Francisco that truly matters."

Her mother didn't say a word, just stared at her teacup, the hum of the unplugged sewing machine deafening in its silence. In that moment, Mei made the decision. It wasn\u2019t a sacrifice; it was a transfer of responsibility. A cold, heavy certainty settled in her chest, replacing the flimsy dream of a skyline view. It was the moment she understood that for her, love would always be an action.\n\n2.\nHer first solo run on the 38-Geary. Her hands, used to the weight of textbooks, felt alien and small on the enormous steering wheel. The air brakes hissed, a sound she\u2019d come to know as the city\u2019s breath. A wave of terror washed over her, followed by a surprising thrill as she pulled smoothly away from the curb. She wasn't managing a business plan; she was navigating forty tons of steel through living, breathing chaos. It was the first time she felt truly powerful, not in a boardroom, but on the street.\n\n3.\nIt was an elderly woman who was a regular on her old 1-California route. For months, they\u2019d only exchanged quiet nods. Then, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the woman pressed a small, warm, leaf-wrapped zongzi into her hand, murmuring \u201c\u8f9b\u82e6\u4f60\u4e86\u201d (You've worked hard). Mei was so stunned she almost missed the next stop. It was a tiny gesture, but it made her feel seen, not as a uniform, but as a person. She wasn\u2019t just a driver; she was Mrs. Chan\u2019s driver. She belonged.\n\n4.\nShe sat in the stands at UC Berkeley\u2019s Greek Theatre, her Muni uniform jacket folded neatly on her lap. When her younger brother, David, walked across the stage to receive his engineering degree, a feeling of pure, unselfish pride washed over her. Every pre-dawn shift, every holiday worked, every penny saved\u2014it was all there in that moment. Her dream hadn't died; it had been transplanted. She hadn\u2019t built a career for herself, she had built one for him. It felt like her greatest success.\n\n5.\nHer first week as a supervisor. At 4:30 a.m., she stood in her small office at the depot, watching the buses pull out, their headlights cutting through the thick Richmond fog. This was her corner office view now. Not the Transamerica Pyramid, but a fleet of vehicles she coordinated, carrying the city to work. She felt a deep, quiet satisfaction. This wasn't the life she planned, but she could see the city\u2019s arteries begin to flow because of her. In the quiet fog, that was more than enough."
