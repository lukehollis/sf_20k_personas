The son of a high school history teacher and a librarian, he was raised on stories of empires rising and falling, of vast networks of trade and influence. This led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in History, a field he loved for its macro-level view of how societies function, but which offered few clear career paths upon his graduation in the mid-90s.\n\nHe found his entry into the professional world not in a library or classroom, but on the concrete floor of a warehouse for a fledgling electronics company. It was supposed to be a temporary job. However, David\u2019s mind, trained to see historical patterns, saw logistical ones. He instinctively understood the flow of goods, identifying inefficiencies and creating elegant solutions. He was promoted from the floor to supervisor, and eventually to manager, mastering the art of moving things from A to B.\n\nThe key turning point came in 2001 when his company was acquired by a Bay Area tech giant. Offered a relocation package, he traded the Midwest for San Francisco, an ascendant empire of its own. He settled in Cole Valley, a neighborhood whose quiet, village-like feel was a comforting anchor in the frenetic city. He thrived professionally, his calm, systematic approach a valuable asset in the chaotic world of tech.\n\nNow 49, David\u2019s life has minimal friction. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the standing desk in his living room, a remnant of a pandemic-era policy that he has embraced completely. His days are a quiet hum of coordinating global supply chains through Slack and Zoom. His personal life is similarly contained; a serious relationship ended five years ago over divergent life goals, and his social circle has since become small and manageable. He\u2019s a familiar, friendly face at his local coffee shop and bookstore, but his connections remain pleasantly superficial.\n\nHe appreciates San Francisco as a series of beautiful, distant tableaus seen on his evening walks\u2014the fog rolling over Sutro Tower, the meticulous rows of Victorian homes. Lately, a dream has been quietly forming. He imagines applying his logistical genius to a different kind of system, perhaps for a non-profit managing disaster relief supplies. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration to one day organize a supply chain that delivers not just components, but hope."
