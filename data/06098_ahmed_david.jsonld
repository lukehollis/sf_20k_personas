The son of a pragmatic Egyptian structural engineer and a spirited American art historian who met in London, David grew up a third-culture kid, fluent in adaptability. His childhood was a patchwork of Cairo summers and East Coast holidays, leaving him with an accent that was vaguely transatlantic and a sense of belonging everywhere and nowhere. This innate ability to bridge cultural divides would become his greatest professional asset.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, drawn by the Bay Area's innovative spirit. His graduate studies in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon were meant to be a launchpad into product design, a field that satisfied both his father\u2019s logic and his mother\u2019s creativity. However, his trajectory was irrevocably altered by his father\u2019s sudden passing during his final semester. The shock and the ensuing financial insecurity pushed David toward a more lucrative path: management consulting. He took a job helping tech giants streamline their operations, a role where he excelled but which always felt one step removed from true creation.\n\nNow, at 40, David\u2019s world is a meticulously arranged high-rise apartment in Soma, where the 0.0-mile commute means his living room perpetually feels like a corner office. His days are a blur of video calls with teams in different time zones, his sharp analysis cutting through corporate jargon. His lifestyle is comfortable but solitary. Relationships have often been casualties of his demanding schedule, though he maintains a tight-knit circle of friends for weekend hikes in the Headlands and dinners in Hayes Valley.\n\nSan Francisco is his chosen home, a city diverse enough to accommodate his multifaceted identity. Yet, he feels the familiar pull of being an observer. Having achieved the financial stability he craved, David now grapples with a quiet yearning for meaning. He dreams of leaving the consulting world behind to launch a small venture\u2014a tech incubator for social-good startups or a design firm focused on accessible technology. He wants to build something tangible, a legacy that finally synthesizes the engineer and the artist within him."
