The son of a quiet, third-generation Japanese-American architect and a sharp, verbose Jewish-American journalist from Brooklyn, Kenji\u2019s Berkeley upbringing was a loving fusion of two distinct worlds. His childhood home was filled with the scents of teriyaki and brisket, the sounds of NPR debates and gentle koto music. He learned early to navigate different cultural codes, making him a perpetual observer, adept at listening and understanding unspoken nuances\u2014a skill that would later define his career.\n\nFeeling like a bridge between worlds, he pursued sociology as an undergraduate at UC Davis, fascinated by the systems that shape identity. However, it was his own journey through therapy in his late twenties, untangling the complexities of his unique heritage, that served as his pivotal turning point. The experience was so profound that he enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work to help others navigate their own internal landscapes.\n\nNow 42, Kenji works as a Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco healthcare provider, conducting all his sessions via telehealth. His quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond, just blocks from Golden Gate Park, is both his sanctuary and his office. His 0.0-mile commute allows for a structured routine: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, followed by hours of intense, empathetic listening as he guides clients through grief, trauma, and anxiety.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of old friends who understand the emotional toll of his work. While he finds dating in the city challenging, he remains hopeful. For Kenji, San Francisco is the only place that feels like home\u2014a city that largely doesn't demand explanations for a name like his. His dream isn't grand wealth or recognition, but something more intimate: to eventually open a small group practice with colleagues, focusing on mental health for people from multicultural backgrounds. It\u2019s his life\u2019s work, come full circle\u2014creating a space for others to feel seen, understood, and whole."
