Raised in a practical, middle-class family in suburban Ohio, she was instilled with a formidable work ethic but felt a constant pull toward a more dynamic world. While her peers followed traditional paths, Sarah\u2019s ambition was less about climbing a prescribed ladder and more about building her own. She earned a business degree from a state university, a credential she viewed not as a key, but as a simple tool.\n\nHer early career was a grind at a massive consulting firm in Chicago. There, surrounded by Ivy League pedigrees, Sarah discovered her true talent: an incisive ability to diagnose organizational chaos and impose order. She outworked and outsmarted colleagues, but chafed under the rigid corporate structure. The turning point came in the late 1990s. Sensing the seismic shift of the dot-com boom, she quit her stable job, packed two suitcases, and moved to San Francisco, landing a role at a promising startup.\n\nThe city energized her. She survived the bust that followed, her pragmatism a valuable asset amid the rubble. After a decade in the trenches of tech, she made her second pivotal move: going independent. Burnt out on office politics but addicted to complex problem-solving, she became a management consultant, a gun-for-hire for companies navigating growth, crisis, or change.\n\nNow 52, Sarah lives in a meticulously designed condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her neighborhood is her ecosystem. Her day begins with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by a disciplined marathon of Zoom calls and deep work. Her personal life is curated and intentional. An amicable divorce in her early forties left her with a profound sense of self-reliance and a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends. She prefers intimate dinner parties and evenings at SFJAZZ to crowded bars.\n\nFinancially secure and professionally respected, Sarah\u2019s aspirations have shifted. She dreams not of retirement, but of transition. She finds herself increasingly drawn to pro-bono work for arts non-profits and has begun quietly mentoring young, female-led startups. Having built her own ladder, Sarah now hopes to use her wisdom to give others a foothold on theirs."
