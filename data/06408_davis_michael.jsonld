The only child of Cantonese immigrants, he grew up behind the counter of his parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Excelsior District. While his parents preached the gospel of hard work for financial security, Michael absorbed a different lesson from the aisles of their store. He watched neighbors use EBT cards with a mix of gratitude and shame, listened to seniors worry about rising rents, and saw the subtle signs of addiction and mental illness that a community tries to hide. For his parents, this was just business; for Michael, it was a profound, early education in systemic inequity.\n\nHe was the first in his family to attend a four-year university, enrolling at San Francisco State. His parents hoped for an engineering or business degree, but Michael was drawn to Sociology, a field that gave language to the quiet struggles he had witnessed his whole life. A volunteer internship during his junior year at a drop-in center for homeless youth was his turning point. The abstract concepts from his textbooks became real, breathing, and desperate. The desire for a lucrative career evaporated, replaced by an urgent need to be on the front lines.\n\nNow, at 29, Michael is a Case Manager at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a small staff apartment within the same building he works, his life fully enmeshed with his clients'. His days are a relentless cycle of navigating bureaucracy, de-escalating crises, and offering support to individuals battling addiction, trauma, and poverty. The work has taken a toll, etching fine lines of exhaustion around his eyes and contributing to the recent, amicable end of a relationship with a partner who couldn't handle the emotional weight he brought home.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and fraught. He finds solace in early morning runs through Golden Gate Park and quiet evenings with a small circle of friends, mostly fellow social workers who understand the unspoken burdens. Michael\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but a quieter city\u2014one where his job becomes less necessary. He dreams of a future where he can finally move out of the facility, create a boundary between work and life, and simply enjoy the city he works so hard to heal."
