His father, a taxi driver who adopted the \u2018Miller\u2019 surname to sound more accessible, and his mother, a homemaker whose cooking was the heart of their community, pushed Thomas toward a practical path. He dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College of San Francisco, a compromise to appease them, and spent his twenties as an accounting clerk, his world a bland landscape of spreadsheets and ledgers.\n\nThe turning point came with his mother\u2019s sudden passing when he was 31. The grief was profound, but it also awakened a dormant passion. He realized the most precious thing she had left behind was not her meager savings, but her handwritten book of recipes. Quitting his job, Thomas poured his grief and inheritance into a small, neglected storefront in the Richmond District, living in the modest apartment upstairs. He named the restaurant \u201cSaanjh,\u201d meaning \u2018evening\u2019\u2014the time his family always came together for a meal.\n\nNow, at 53, Thomas\u2019s commute is the thirteen steps from his apartment down to his kitchen. His life revolves around the rhythms of the restaurant. His mornings are for sourcing produce in the Alemany Farmers' Market, his days for the meditative process of grinding spices and slow-cooking daal, and his nights are a blur of service. Divorced years ago due to his all-consuming work, his family is now his small, loyal staff and the neighborhood regulars who know to ask for the off-menu lamb curry.\n\nConnected deeply to the Richmond\u2019s diverse, unpretentious spirit, Thomas is a neighborhood fixture. His dream isn\u2019t expansion or fame, but preservation. He hopes to keep Saanjh afloat, a warm and welcoming haven serving the authentic flavors of his mother\u2019s love. His greatest aspiration is to one day find a young, passionate chef to whom he can pass down the recipe book, ensuring his family\u2019s legacy continues to simmer long after he\u2019s gone."

The memory is a quiet ache, a constant reminder of the sacrifices made for belonging, and it fueled his later insistence on naming his restaurant \"Saanjh,\" a name that required explanation, a name that was wholly his.\n\n2.\nA week after the funeral, at 31, he sat in his mother\u2019s silent kitchen. While sorting through her meager belongings, he found the oil-stained notebook. He ran his thumb over her neat Punjabi script, the pages smelling faintly of turmeric and cardamom. He traced the letters for \u2018Garam Masala,\u2019 and the grief was so sharp it felt like a physical blow. But in that moment, he realized this wasn\u2019t just a book; it was a tangible piece of her love. The accountant died that day, and the chef was born.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the terror of the first Friday night when every table filled and the ticket printer chattered like an angry insect. He was sure he would fail. But then, through the pass-through window, he saw an elderly couple taste his daal makhani. The woman closed her eyes and smiled, a pure, uninhibited smile of delight. The fear receded, replaced by a deep, resonant warmth. He wasn't just serving food; he was serving a memory, his mother's memory, and it was being cherished.\n\n4.\nThe divorce papers arrived on a Tuesday. He remembers signing them on a prep table dusted with flour, the scent of fenugreek heavy in the air. His ex-wife had called his work an obsession, and she wasn't wrong. There was a profound sadness, a sense of personal failure. But as he looked around the empty dining room, at the chairs waiting for their guests, he knew he couldn't have chosen differently. This restaurant was his child, his partner, his entire life. It was a lonely-making love, but it was his.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, a young woman, a culinary student, ate at the counter three nights in a row. On the third night, she asked him not about the recipe, but why he ground his coriander seeds by hand. He spent twenty minutes explaining the volatile oils, the texture, the connection. He saw in her eyes the same reverence he felt. That conversation planted a seed of hope in him; the quiet dream that one day, he wouldn't just be passing on a meal, but the entire history contained in his mother\u2019s book."
