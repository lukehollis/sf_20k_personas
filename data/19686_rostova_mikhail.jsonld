Born in Berkeley, he was the son of a pragmatic Iranian literature professor, his mother, and an ephemeral, charming Russian poet, his father. His father vanished when he was six, leaving behind a love for resonant words and the Slavic first name. In a deliberate act of allegiance, a teenaged Mikhail legally took his mother\u2019s surname, Rostova, cementing his bond with the woman who raised him. This upbringing, navigating Persian traditions at home and the eclectic culture of the East Bay outside, made him a keen observer of human identity and the feeling of \"in-betweenness.\"\n\nInitially, he pursued literature at UC Berkeley, attempting to connect with his father\u2019s ghost. However, the 2008 financial crisis was his turning point. Witnessing the profound psychological toll on his friends and community, he saw a more urgent calling. He pivoted, driven by a newfound purpose to understand and heal mental wounds, eventually earning his Psy.D. with a focus on adolescent psychology from a Bay Area university.\n\nDrawn to San Francisco\u2019s rich tapestry of transplants and blended families, Mikhail established his private practice in Hayes Valley. He specializes in helping young people, particularly those from immigrant or mixed-race backgrounds, navigate the immense pressures of identity formation, academia, and societal expectations. His work is his passion, a way of offering the guidance he once craved.\n\nHis life is one of deliberate balance. His 0.8-mile walk to the office is a daily ritual, a mental transition from his serene apartment to the intense emotional landscape of his clinic. Mornings start with dark coffee from a local cafe, and evenings are for decompression with his partner of eight years, Leo, a landscape architect whose work with solid, living things provides a grounding contrast to Mikhail\u2019s abstract field.\n\nNow at 40, Mikhail feels a deep sense of belonging in his Hayes Valley neighborhood. He is a familiar face, valued for his quiet presence. His aspiration isn't to grow wealthier, but to expand his impact. He dreams of partnering with a local non-profit to establish a dedicated, low-cost mental health clinic for the city\u2019s underserved youth, ensuring others have the support to build a cohesive identity from their own beautiful, disparate parts."

            "value": "1.\nHe is six, sitting on the floor of their Berkeley apartment. Rain streaks the windows. His father\u2019s voice, a low rumble of Russian verse, fills the small room. The poem ends. His father closes the book, kisses the crown of Mikhail\u2019s head, and walks out the door with a single bag. The scent of his wool coat and wet asphalt lingers. It wasn\u2019t a goodbye, just a silence where the words used to be. This memory is the seed of his lifelong search for meaning in language and loss.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, in a sterile Alameda County courthouse, he watches his mother\u2019s hand tremble slightly as she signs the document. When it\u2019s his turn, the pen feels heavy. He carefully writes \u2018Mikhail Rostova\u2019 for the first time. In that moment, the ghost of his father feels distant. It is not an act of erasure, but of construction; a deliberate claim of the steady, unwavering love that raised him. It was his first true act of defining himself, choosing the anchor over the tide.\n\n3.\nHe is twenty-six, a literature grad student at Berkeley in the fall of 2008. He sits in a cafe, listening to a brilliant classmate describe the hollowing shame of his father losing his job. The elegant deconstruction of poetry suddenly feels like a useless luxury. He sees the real, urgent story isn't on the page, but in the psychological fractures appearing all around him. That afternoon, he walks to the psychology department to inquire about their Psy.D. program, forever changing course from analyzing words to healing minds.\n\n4.\nComing home after a brutal session with a family in crisis, he finds Leo on their small patio, his hands black with soil as he repots a ficus tree. The weight of his day, a tangled mess of abstract pain, begins to dissipate as Leo explains the simple, tangible need for better drainage and root space. Leo doesn't need to know the details of the session; his quiet, grounding work with living things is a powerful antidote, a reminder of the solid world that holds them both.\n\n5.\nA seventeen-year-old client, the daughter of Filipino and Irish parents, looks at him during a session in his Hayes Valley office and says, \u201cI\u2019m not half of anything. I\u2019m double.\u201d A profound stillness fills the room. In her declaration, he hears the echo of his own journey, the resolution he fought so hard to find. It\u2019s a moment of pure connection, affirming that his entire life\u2014the loss, the choice, the pivot\u2014was leading him here, to help others build a whole self from their beautiful, disparate parts."
