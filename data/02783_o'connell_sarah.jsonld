The daughter of a union electrician and a school secretary, she was raised on the values of practicality and hard work. Her decision to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature was a quiet rebellion, a choice for passion over a predictable career path. She graduated in the mid-90s, just as the digital world was beginning to roar.\n\nFinding few openings for literary analysis, Sarah fell into a project coordinator role at a fledgling dot-com in Chicago. She discovered a knack for translating the chaotic energy of developers into structured timelines and clear deliverables. When the dot-com bubble burst, her company folded. Seeing the wreckage as an opportunity, she packed her car and drove west in 2002, determined to find a place in the tech industry\u2019s epicenter, San Francisco.\n\nThe move was her life\u2019s defining turning point. She landed a job at a more stable tech firm and began a steady, two-decade climb. She wasn\u2019t a coder, but she became essential\u2014the supervisor who ensured software went from concept to launch smoothly. She thrives on order and process, a calm anchor in the fast-paced tech storm.\n\nNow, at 49, Sarah\u2019s world is largely contained within her rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her day starts with coffee overlooking Geary Boulevard, followed by a brisk walk in Golden Gate Park before logging on. Her life is a cycle of Zoom calls, digital spreadsheets, and managing teams scattered across the globe. Never married, her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a chosen family forged over shared industry battles and expensive city brunches.\n\nSarah loves the city\u2019s proximity to nature and its independent spirit, even as she laments its changing landscape. Looking ahead, she dreams of a life beyond production deadlines. She yearns to travel without a laptop, to perhaps mentor young women entering the field, or even revisit her literary roots and finally write something of her own. For now, however, another product launch is always just around the corner."
