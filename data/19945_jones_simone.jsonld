            "value": "Simone Jones is a daughter of San Francisco in a way few newcomers can comprehend. Born and raised in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, her world was shaped by the rhythm of her parents' working-class lives\u2014her mother a nurse at SF General, her father a Muni operator. While other kids played on the streets, Simone found her sanctuary in the quiet, sun-dusted aisles of the local library. It was less about escaping and more about discovering worlds bigger than her own.\n\nShe wasn't a star student in high school; the structured curriculum felt rigid compared to the boundless knowledge she found on the library shelves. Upon graduating, academia held little appeal. Instead, her meticulous nature and deep love for the library system caught the eye of a head librarian who encouraged her to apply for an entry-level page position. This was her true calling. Simone didn't need a four-year degree to understand the intricate logic of information. She climbed the ranks from page to clerk to technician, mastering the city\u2019s digital archives with an intuitive grace that no university could teach.\n\nNow 32, Simone\u2019s life is a tapestry of comforting routines. Her rent-controlled apartment in the Lower Haight is her haven, filled with well-loved books and thriving houseplants. Her 1.8-mile commute on the 7 Haight/Noriega bus to the Main Library in the Civic Center is a time for observation, watching the city wake up. At work, she is the quiet, indispensable force who can locate an obscure historical document or digitize a fragile manuscript, finding deep satisfaction in preserving information for future generations.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, centered around a tight-knit book club with a few fellow civil servants. A key turning point was realizing her unique position: she possesses the technical skills to safeguard the history of the very communities, like her own, being reshaped by gentrification. Simone\u2019s dream isn't one of wealth or status, but of purpose. She is slowly developing a proposal for a digital oral history project, aiming to archive the stories of San Francisco's longtime Black residents before they fade away. For Simone, a library isn't just a building with books; it's the city's memory, and she is one of its most dedicated keepers."
