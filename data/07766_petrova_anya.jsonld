The daughter of pragmatic Russian immigrants who settled in Daly City, her upbringing was a quiet battle between their desire for her security and her own yearning for authentic expression. They pushed for a stable career, so Anya dutifully enrolled in business classes at SF State. She lasted three semesters. The world of spreadsheets and marketing theory felt like a colorless cage, and she abruptly dropped out, causing a deep, though mostly unspoken, rift with her family.\n\nAdrift, she took a part-time job at a small, cluttered home goods and vintage curiosities shop. It was there, amidst dusty antique globes and locally made ceramics, that Anya found her calling. She had an intuitive eye for display, a quiet warmth with customers, and a genuine love for the stories embedded in objects. The elderly owner, Eleanor, became her mentor, teaching her everything about sourcing, pricing, and the art of running a neighborhood institution.\n\nThe turning point came eight years ago when Eleanor announced her retirement. Faced with the shop\u2019s closure, a 31-year-old Anya liquidated her meager savings and took out a daunting small business loan to buy it. She renamed it \"Vesche,\" the Russian word for \"things,\" and moved into the small one-bedroom apartment directly above it.\n\nNow 39, Anya\u2019s life moves to the rhythm of her store. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a creaky staircase. Her days are spent arranging displays, chatting with regulars who have become her de-facto family, and brewing coffee. Her social life consists of casual dates that rarely blossom into relationships; she is more married to her business than to any person.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intensely localized. She is queen of her small corner, a familiar face who knows the dog walkers and the N-Judah train schedule by heart. Yet, a quiet restlessness is setting in. While proud of the sanctuary she\u2019s built, she dreams of a life beyond her storefront\u2014of traveling to the places she only sees on her antique maps, of finding a partnership that feels as real as her shop, and of creating something of her own to sell, not just curating the work of others."
