The daughter of a pragmatic Caucasian-American engineer and a first-generation Chinese immigrant mother, Jia grew up in Walnut Creek. Her childhood was a landscape of cul-de-sacs and strip malls, defined by the necessity of a car for every errand. She spent countless hours in the back of the family minivan, watching the uniform houses blur by and yearning for the vibrant, chaotic energy she only saw on trips into San Francisco.\n\nThis yearning solidified into a career path during a college study abroad program in Copenhagen. Witnessing a city where bicycles outnumbered cars and public squares pulsed with life was a profound awakening. She returned to UC Davis, switched her major to Environmental Design, and set her sights on a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA.\n\nJia moved to San Francisco a decade ago, accepting a junior planner role with the city. It was a deliberate choice to live in the kind of environment she wanted to create. She has since worked her way up to Senior Transit Planner, a role she considers a calling. For Jia, optimizing a bus route or securing funding for protected bike lanes is a tangible act of improving thousands of lives.\n\nShe lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its diversity and direct access to Golden Gate Park. Her 3.8-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus is her daily field research, a time to observe passenger flow and silently critique stop spacing. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow public servants, artists, and teachers\u2014who share her love for the city\u2019s non-tech culture. A serious long-term relationship ended three years ago over the classic SF dilemma: he wanted to move to Marin for more space, and Jia couldn\u2019t imagine abandoning the city she was so dedicated to building.\n\nJia\u2019s dream is to see a major project, like a new bus rapid transit corridor, through from conception to completion. She aspires to leave a lasting mark on the city\u2019s infrastructure, a legacy of accessibility and efficiency. Personally, she hopes to one day afford a small condo in her neighborhood, planting permanent roots in the city she helps shape every single day."

The clatter of mahjong tiles from an open doorway, the smell of roast duck, the sheer energy of the crowd\u2014it wasn\u2019t chaos, it was life. That day, standing on a bustling Grant Avenue, she felt a cellular sense of belonging. It planted a seed of yearning that defined her adolescence and eventual escape from the suburbs.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt wasn't just the number of bikes in Copenhagen; it was one specific evening rush hour. Sitting at an outdoor caf\u00e9, she watched a river of cyclists\u2014parents with kids in cargo bikes, elders, professionals in suits\u2014all flowing effortlessly through the city. There were no angry horns, just the gentle whir of wheels and chiming of bells. In that moment, the suburban logic of her youth shattered. She realized a city could be designed for people, a revelation that reoriented her entire future academic and professional life.\n\n***\n\n3.\nNine years ago, as a junior planner, she argued for relocating a bus stop just fifty feet. Her boss was skeptical, but she had the data: it would save seniors from a steep incline. Six months later, she saw an elderly woman with grocery bags use the new, flatter stop and sit down with a sigh of relief. It was a tiny change on a giant map, but for Jia, it was everything. It was the moment her theoretical passion became a tangible act of care, cementing her calling.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe conversation with Mark happened on a foggy Sunday three years ago. He spoke of backyards in Marin while Jia stared out at the 38-Geary rumbling past their window. She heard the hiss of its brakes and felt a fierce, protective loyalty. Giving up the city felt like amputating a part of herself\u2014the part she was most proud of. The breakup wasn\u2019t just about a relationship ending; it was a profound choice to dedicate herself completely to the city, solidifying her own identity in the process.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last week, riding the 38-Geary home, the bus crested a hill as fog rolled in, softening the lights of the Richmond. A Russian couple debated their grocery list, a student sketched in a notebook, and the familiar scent of damp eucalyptus drifted in from Golden Gate Park. She watched the diverse, ordinary lives unfolding around her and felt a profound sense of peace. This daily, shared journey was the very fabric of the city she fought to improve, reaffirming her love on a molecular level."
