Born in Walnut Creek to a young, single white mother, he was given his surname at age seven when his mother married Stephen Chan, a kind and pragmatic accountant who became the only father Todd ever knew. Growing up a white kid with a Chinese last name in the suburbs, Todd always felt slightly out of sync, a feeling that drew him not to rebellion, but to curation. He found his calling in the cluttered racks of East Bay thrift stores, seeing stories and potential where others saw old clothes.\n\nRejecting the four-year university path his stepfather hoped for, Todd moved to San Francisco in his early twenties and enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. The city was an immediate fit. He earned his Associate's degree and landed a job at \"Epilogue,\" a high-end vintage boutique in Hayes Valley. He never left. Over two decades, he worked his way from stockroom grunt to the trusted store manager, his eye for period-specific stitching and fabric becoming legendary among regulars. A major turning point came in his late thirties after the amicable end of a long-term relationship. The breakup, while painful, solidified his identity as a proudly independent man whose life was his work, his friends, and his neighborhood.\n\nToday, Todd\u2019s life is a finely tailored routine. He resides in a rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment on Page Street, a sanctuary filled with mid-century furniture, obscure vinyl, and a walk-in closet that\u2019s a museum of textile history. His 1.1-mile walk to the boutique is his daily meditation, a ritual of nodding to fellow shopkeepers and grabbing an oat latte from his favorite cafe. His social life consists of a small, loyal circle of industry friends and bi-weekly dinners with his now-retired parents.\n\nAt 48, Todd is content but not complacent. He\u2019s a fixture in Hayes Valley, a quiet pillar of the community he helped build. His deepest aspiration is to one day buy \"Epilogue\" from its aging owner, ensuring its legacy continues under his care. He doesn\u2019t dream of riches, but of turning the key to a place that is finally, wholly, his own."

It wasn\u2019t a painful moment, just the first time he felt like a carefully chosen accessory, a beautiful piece that didn\u2019t quite match the original set. It was the beginning of his lifelong fascination with things that were perfectly, imperfectly curated together.\n\n2.\nThe air in the Berkeley thrift store was thick with the scent of dust and decades. He was sixteen, running his hand over a rack of men's shirts when he stopped. It was a 1960s Arrow Decton, the tell-tale cross-stitching on the buttons still perfect. He saw its history: office parties, first dates, a life lived before his own. In that moment, the chaotic racks weren't just a mess of old clothes; they were a library, and he had just discovered he could read every spine.\n\n3.\nA week after his boyfriend moved out, the silence in his Page Street apartment was absolute. He stood in the doorway of his walk-in closet, looking at the perfectly ordered rows of textiles. Instead of the gaping void of loneliness he\u2019d expected, he felt a profound, grounding peace. He was surrounded not by what was missing, but by the tangible history he had so carefully assembled. The quiet wasn't empty; it was his. The realization settled over him: he was not half of a whole, but complete on his own.\n\n4.\nHe was still new at Epilogue, maybe twenty-three, and scared of its formidable owner. She was appraising a supposedly pristine 1970s Halston gown. From across the room, his eye caught a nearly invisible irregularity in the bias cut, a subtle pucker that spoke of a past, inexpert alteration. Voice trembling, he pointed it out. She stopped, squinted, and then gave a short, sharp nod. \"Good eye,\" she\u2019d said. The simple validation was more powerful than any degree; it confirmed he had chosen the right city, the right life.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, he watched the store\u2019s owner, Elodie, sigh as she looked at her handwritten ledger, her fingers tracing the numbers. She looked tired, her passion now weighted by the practical burdens of age. He felt a sudden, protective ache. His quiet ambition to one day own Epilogue ceased to be about himself. It became a solemn vow to her and to the store itself\u2014a promise to be its steward, to keep its stories safe when she was finally ready to rest."
