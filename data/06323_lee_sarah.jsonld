The only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Geary Boulevard, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was a blend of filial duty and a quiet, artistic yearning. Her parents, valuing stability above all, encouraged practicality, but Sarah found her escape in sketchbooks filled with vibrant designs and imagined logos.\n\nHer dream took flight at San Francisco State University, where she enrolled to study graphic design. For two years, she thrived, her world expanding beyond the fog-laced streets of her childhood. However, this chapter was abruptly cut short when her father suffered a major health crisis. Dropping out of college felt less like a choice and more like an inevitability. Sarah returned home to help her mother manage the family business and navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system.\n\nIt was this experience that led to her current career. Needing a stable income, she took a temporary position as an administrative assistant for a large healthcare provider. The temporary role soon became permanent. Now, at 33, her commute is a ten-step journey from her bed to her desk in the corner of her one-bedroom apartment. Her days are a cycle of scheduling, responding to emails, and managing digital files\u2014a life of organized efficiency that pays the bills but doesn't feed her soul.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. It\u2019s the morning bun from her favorite Clement Street bakery, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, and the comfort of hearing Cantonese spoken at the grocery store. Her social life is small but cherished, consisting of a few close friends from high school.\n\nLately, a quiet rebellion has been brewing in her evening hours. After logging off from her day job, Sarah opens Adobe Illustrator. She takes online courses and works on a personal portfolio, slowly rebuilding the dream she set aside a decade ago. Her aspiration isn't fame or fortune, but a future where she can support herself through her own creativity\u2014to one day have her email signature read \u2018Graphic Designer,\u2019 a title she chose for herself."
