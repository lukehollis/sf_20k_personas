Raised in the foggy, working-class landscape of Daly City, she was the daughter of a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a history teacher father who filled her head with stories of social movements and environmental justice. Her childhood was spent exploring the coastal bluffs of San Mateo County, where she first witnessed the delicate, often contentious, line between urban development and fragile ecosystems.\n\nThis early awareness fueled her academic path, leading her to UC Berkeley and later to Tufts University for a graduate degree in Urban and Environmental Policy. She returned to the Bay Area not as an idealist, but as a pragmatist armed with data and legislative knowledge. Her early career was spent in the trenches of non-profits, organizing communities to advocate for park space and cleaner waterways. It was there she learned that passion needed a seat at the table where decisions were made. This realization spurred her move into the private sector, where she could influence large-scale infrastructure projects from the inside.\n\nNow, as a Director of Environmental Policy, Kaiya navigates boardrooms with the same tenacity she once brought to community meetings. Her key turning point was helping steer a major downtown development toward incorporating a living roof and water recycling system, proving that profitability and sustainability weren't mutually exclusive.\n\nKaiya lives in a tastefully restored condo in the Mission District with her partner of fifteen years, Mateo, a ceramic artist whose abstract work beautifully contrasts with her structured world. Her daily routine is quintessentially San Francisco: a brisk walk to the J-Church Muni line, a ride downtown reading policy briefs on her tablet, and long days orchestrating policy for a greener city. Evenings are for quiet dinners with Mateo or attending neighborhood association meetings.\n\nAt 51, Kaiya\u2019s ambition has shifted from personal advancement to legacy. She dreams of spearheading a \"blue-green\" infrastructure corridor that connects the city\u2019s parks and waterways, a tangible monument to a more sustainable San Francisco. It\u2019s a project that speaks to the core of who she is\u2014a builder of bridges, tirelessly working to ensure the city she loves can thrive for generations to come."

The wind whipped her hair as she stared at a wooden surveyor\u2019s stake hammered into the ground, just inches from a patch of wild irises. Its raw, splintered wood felt like a violation against the delicate purple. A cold, clear resolve settled in her small chest\u2014not just to admire the beauty, but to learn the language of stakes and blueprints. It was the moment she realized she had to fight for the earth not with poetry, but with power.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she sat at their dinner table, heady with the scent of her mother's sinigang. Her father was passionately recounting the history of the Delano grape strike, his voice full of righteous fire. Her mother, meanwhile, quietly described the precise, compassionate logistics of her nursing shift. Kaiya saw it then: her father\u2019s fight for justice and her mother\u2019s practical systems of care were two sides of the same coin. This insight became her compass, showing her that idealism and pragmatism could live in a beautiful, powerful harmony.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe community meeting was in a damp church basement in the Bayview. Kaiya, then 28, listened to another impassioned speech against a shoreline development, her own voice hoarse from weeks of organizing. She scanned the tired, hopeful faces and realized with a sinking heart they were only talking to each other. The real decisions were happening in a boardroom miles away. At that moment, her activism shattered and reformed. She knew then she couldn't just shout from the outside; she had to get a seat inside.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe sun was rising as she stood on the finished living roof, forty stories above the Financial District. Below, the city hummed to life, but up here was the quiet rustle of native grasses. She could feel the faint vibration of the water recycling system, a mechanical heartbeat she\u2019d fought for in a dozen hostile meetings. It wasn't just a win; it was proof. A deep, validating peace washed over her. Profit and planet could breathe the same air. This tangible success became the foundation for all her future work.\n\n***\n\n5.\nShe came home late, drained from a brutal zoning fight, the words of angry board members still ringing in her ears. Mateo didn\u2019t speak. He just glanced up from his pottery wheel, wiped his hands, and handed her a ball of cool, wet clay. As she worked the earth in her hands, the rigid structures of policy and argument dissolved into something elemental and forgiving. It was his silent way of reminding her what she was fighting for\u2014not an abstract idea, but this tangible, beautiful world."
