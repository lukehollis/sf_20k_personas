The only daughter of hardworking immigrant farmers, Priya grew up navigating two worlds: the traditional, community-focused life at home and the individualistic pressures of American schooling. Her parents envisioned a future for her in medicine or engineering, a stable path to honor their sacrifice. Priya, however, was the quiet observer, more interested in the unspoken anxieties of her classmates than in calculus.\n\nHer turning point came at UC Davis. While dutifully pursuing a degree in psychology, she volunteered at a crisis hotline. The raw, urgent need she encountered on those calls ignited a passion she couldn't ignore. She finally broke from her parents\u2019 expectations, not with anger, but with a quiet resolve. This path led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a Master of Science in School Counseling, drawn to the city's promise of acceptance and progressive ideals.\n\nNow, at 30, Priya lives a uniquely insulated San Francisco life. She is a counselor at a prestigious private boarding school in Pacific Heights, and her 0.0-mile commute is a walk across a manicured quad from her small faculty apartment to her office. Her days are a structured rhythm of scheduled sessions with teens grappling with academic pressure, family expectations, and identity formation\u2014struggles she understands intimately. She is the calm, steady anchor for students adrift in the turbulent seas of adolescence.\n\nWhile devoted to her students, Priya feels a growing desire for a life beyond the school\u2019s ivy-covered walls. Her social world consists of a tight-knit group of friends she meets for weekend hikes in the Presidio or for dim sum on Clement Street. She is a skilled listener in a city full of people shouting to be heard, offering solace within her professional bubble. Her dream is to one day find a partnership and create a home that is truly her own, separate from her work. For now, however, she finds fulfillment in her role, knowing that within the strange quiet of her campus home, she is helping shape the next generation of San Franciscans."
