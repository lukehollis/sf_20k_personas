As the only child of Korean immigrants who ran a dry-cleaning business, her childhood was defined by the scent of steam and the weight of expectation. Her parents envisioned a secure, traditional path for her\u2014doctor or lawyer\u2014built on tangible success. Jessica, however, was fascinated by the intangible: the hidden structures of language and the logic of music. This passion led her to defy expectations, pursuing an undergraduate degree in linguistics before finding her true calling at the intersection of language and data.\n\nHer educational journey culminated in a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from Stanford, a choice that finally bridged the gap between her parents' desire for a prestigious career and her own intellectual curiosity. The move to the Bay Area was a revelation. Surrounded by people who spoke her \"language,\" she thrived, quickly landing a role at a burgeoning tech startup. Jessica\u2019s ability to find meaning in chaotic datasets saw her rise quickly, and she now holds the title of Senior Data Scientist.\n\nHer apartment in Hayes Valley is both her office and her sanctuary. The 0.0-mile commute means her days have a disciplined rhythm: a morning run through the Panhandle, followed by deep work sessions analyzing user behavior, her fingers flying across the keyboard. The promotion to Senior Data Scientist coincided with the quiet end of a two-year relationship, a turning point that left her feeling both professionally accomplished and personally adrift.\n\nTo combat the isolation of remote work, Jessica is intentional with her time. She\u2019s a regular at a local yoga studio and has a tight-knit group of friends, mostly met through a weekend hiking club that explores trails on Mount Tamalpais. Her connection to San Francisco is rooted in these moments\u2014the fog rolling over Twin Peaks, the taste of a perfect croissant from a neighborhood bakery, the intellectual spark of a conversation at a meetup.\n\nLooking forward, Jessica dreams of shifting her skills toward social impact, perhaps using data to tackle urban inequality or aid in language preservation. While she finds fulfillment in solving complex problems, she yearns for a connection that can\u2019t be quantified\u2014a partnership built on shared values rather than optimized metrics. She hopes to build a life in San Francisco that is as rich in human connection as it is in professional success."
