Raised in Daly City, the child of a Salvadoran immigrant mother who worked as a home healthcare aide and a second-generation Irish-American father who ran a small auto shop, Maya\u2019s upbringing was grounded in hard work and practicality. Her childhood was filled with the scent of pupusas from her mother\u2019s kitchen and the lingering smell of motor oil on her father's clothes. Family was everything, a tight-knit unit that valued stability over extravagance.\n\nChoosing to study Psychology at San Francisco State University felt like a rebellion of sorts\u2014a departure from the tangible world of her parents into the abstract realm of the human mind. It was during a research methods class, staring at spreadsheets of survey results, that Maya discovered her true calling. The raw data wasn't just numbers; it was a story waiting to be told. She found a surprising passion for uncovering patterns in human behavior through statistical analysis.\n\nAfter graduating, she bypassed traditional psychology routes and dedicated six months to an intensive online data science bootcamp. She taught herself Python and SQL with the same determination her father used to fix a faulty transmission. This pivot paid off, landing her a role as a data analyst at a mid-size tech firm.\n\nNow 26, Maya lives in a minimalist studio in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her day begins not with a packed BART train, but with a walk to a local coffee shop, laptop in tow for a change of scenery. Her life is a disciplined routine of queries, data visualization, and virtual meetings. To decompress from the screen, she finds solace in the physical challenge of the bouldering gym, a social hub where she\u2019s found a new community.\n\nWhile she loves the energy of Hayes Valley, she remains deeply connected to her roots, often taking the short drive back to Daly City for her mother\u2019s Sunday dinners. Her dream is to advance to a product management role, using her data insights not just to report on the past, but to shape the future of a product. More privately, she hopes to earn enough to allow her parents to retire comfortably, a quiet thank you for the foundation they built, one that allows her to reach for the San Francisco skyline."
