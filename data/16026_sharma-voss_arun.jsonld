He was raised in Berkeley by his mother, a warm but exacting microbiology professor from Lucknow, India, and his German-American father, a pragmatic architect from Wisconsin. Their home was a loving, if occasionally tense, negotiation between cultures, languages, and expectations. Arun, a quiet and observant child, became the family\u2019s emotional translator, learning to read the subtle cues and unspoken frustrations that simmered beneath the surface of his parents\u2019 deep affection. This early, informal training in mediation planted the seed for his future career.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line toward understanding the human heart. After an undergraduate degree at UC Davis, he enrolled in a demanding Counseling Psychology program at the University of San Francisco, drawn to the city's complex, multicultural tapestry. The turning point came during his internship at a community health clinic in the Mission District, where he worked with families grappling with immigration stress, poverty, and intergenerational conflict. He saw his own family\u2019s struggles magnified and realized his calling was to provide the tools for communication that he wished his own parents had possessed.\n\nNow 39, Arun is a respected Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist within a large healthcare system, specializing in adolescent mental health. His days are filled with the intense, rewarding work of guiding young people and their families through crises. He is married to Caleb, a landscape architect, and their stable, communicative partnership is the anchor of his life.\n\nArun lives in a rent-controlled apartment in NOPA (North of the Panhandle). His daily 2.8-mile bicycle commute is a cherished ritual, a meditative buffer between his personal life and the emotional weight of his work. He rides through the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park, the cool fog a familiar comfort. He loves San Francisco for its acceptance of complexity\u2014the same quality he cultivates in his therapy sessions. His future aspiration isn\u2019t a bigger salary but greater impact; he dreams of developing a culturally-sensitive mental health curriculum for Bay Area schools, a project that would bring his life\u2019s work full circle."

He saw his mother\u2019s smile tighten\u2014a silent signal of a tradition misunderstood. Arun quickly explained to his father that the sweets were about nostalgia, not just sugar. In that moment, he felt the weight and power of being the translator, the small, necessary bridge between two worlds. It was a burden that became his calling.\n\n2.\nDuring his internship in the Mission, he watched a 16-year-old girl patiently translate a doctor\u2019s questions for her anxious Salvadoran father. He saw the girl\u2019s shoulders slump with a familiar, premature responsibility. In her tired eyes, Arun recognized his own childhood self. A profound empathy washed over him, solidifying his purpose. He wasn't just choosing a career; he was answering a lifelong call to help families find a language for their love, one he always wished his own had possessed.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday, a few years after he and Caleb had moved in together. He\u2019d come home hollowed out by a parent-teen session that had gone badly. As he started to explain the emotional debris, Caleb simply put a hand on his back and said, \u201cLeave it at the door. You\u2019re home.\u201d The permission to just *be*, without performing emotional labor or translating his own exhaustion, felt like the deepest form of love. It felt like safety.\n\n4.\nJust last winter, cycling home through the Panhandle, the chill from the fog bit at his skin. His mind was a tangled knot, replaying a session with a suicidal teen. As he crossed into Golden Gate Park, the trees and dense fog muted the city, and his frantic internal monologue quieted with it. He focused on his breath, the rhythm of his own pedaling. This commute wasn't just travel; it was his essential, daily ritual of release, a psychological airlock between work and home.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, listening to a school principal describe a painfully generic mental health presentation, Arun felt a flash of deep frustration. He thought of his own clients, whose specific cultural anxieties were being ignored by these one-size-fits-all solutions. The inadequacy was galling. In that sterile conference room, his vague ambition sharpened into a concrete dream: he would build the curriculum himself. He would create the tools he knew these kids and their families truly needed."
