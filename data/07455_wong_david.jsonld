His commute is a simple walk from the kitchen to his small home office, a 0.0-mile journey that suits his contemplative nature.\n\nBorn and raised just a few blocks away, David is the son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong. His parents ran a small grocery store on Clement Street, instilling in him a formidable work ethic and the expectation that he would pursue a more prestigious, lucrative career. They dreamed of him becoming an engineer. David, however, was a quiet observer, more interested in the unspoken anxieties he saw in his own family and community\u2014the stoic burdens carried without complaint. He watched his own mother struggle with a deep, unnamed sadness after his grandfather passed, a grief that was never acknowledged or treated.\n\nThis silent suffering became the catalyst for his professional life. He attended UC Berkeley for his undergraduate studies but defied his parents\u2019 wishes by pursuing a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. It was a decision that caused a rift, one that took years to mend. David began his career in a bustling community clinic, but the burnout was immense. The transition to a telehealth role within a major healthcare system a few years ago was a revelation.\n\nNow 47, David specializes in geriatric and cross-cultural counseling. His days are a structured rhythm of back-to-back video sessions, providing a calm, empathetic ear to elderly clients navigating loneliness, or to younger generations of Asian Americans grappling with the same cultural pressures he once faced. His personal life is similarly understated. A long-term relationship ended amicably five years ago, and he has since found contentment in solitude. His social connections are deep but few: a weekly dim sum lunch with two childhood friends and regular calls with his now-supportive, aging parents.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s centered on impact. He hopes to one day launch a small, community-funded support group specifically for older Asian men, creating a space for them to speak the language of emotion he was never taught as a child. For now, he finds fulfillment in his quiet work, his morning walks through Golden Gate Park, and his deep, unwavering connection to the San Francisco neighborhood that shaped him."
