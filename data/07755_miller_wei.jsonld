His father, a pragmatic software engineer who emigrated from Taiwan, and his mother, a second-generation Chinese-American accountant, provided a life of comfortable stability. His last name was an inheritance from his maternal grandfather, who had changed it from \u2018Wong\u2019 to \u2018Miller\u2019 upon arriving in the US\u2014a piece of family history Wei carried with a mix of understanding and melancholy. Growing up, San Francisco was the glittering, chaotic metropolis over the hills, a place he yearned for more than the manicured lawns of his youth.\n\nHe dutifully attended UC Davis, earning a Bachelor\u2019s in Communications, a degree vague enough to appease his parents while allowing him to avoid their more rigid career paths. His first job was in tech marketing, a predictable route for a Silicon Valley kid. But Wei found the work soulless, a blur of metrics and jargon detached from the real world. The turning point came during a weekend open house he attended on a whim in the Mission District. He was captivated not by the property itself, but by the agent\u2019s ability to sell a story\u2014a narrative of life, community, and belonging within the city\u2019s vibrant tapestry. Within a year, he had quit his job and earned his real estate license.\n\nNow 36, Wei lives and works out of a sleek condo in Hayes Valley. His commute is a walk from his bedroom to his home office, with a panoramic view of the bustling street below. His days are a blur of client calls, virtual tours, and coffee meetings at local spots like Ritual Coffee Roasters. He has carved a successful niche for himself, known for his calm demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of the city\u2019s micro-neighborhoods. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of college buddies and industry peers\u2014with whom he explores the city's ever-changing culinary scene.\n\nWei sells the dream of owning a piece of San Francisco, but his own aspirations have evolved. He is saving aggressively, not for a bigger home, but for an investment. His ultimate goal is to transition from agent to developer, to purchase a small lot and build a thoughtfully designed multi-unit building. For Wei, this isn\u2019t just about wealth; it\u2019s about creating something tangible and lasting in the city that finally feels like home, honoring his family's immigrant legacy by building his own."
