The only son of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up in the Sunset District under the unspoken weight of his parents\u2019 expectations. His father, a restaurant cook, and his mother, a hotel housekeeper, envisioned a future for him in engineering or medicine\u2014a secure path far from their own physically demanding labor. David, a quiet and observant child, excelled in school but felt a constant, low-level dissonance between their dreams and his own introspective nature.\n\nThe turning point came during his undergraduate years at SF State. Initially a business major to appease his family, David\u2019s trajectory shifted when his grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. He witnessed firsthand his family\u2019s struggle to navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system, compounded by language barriers and cultural misunderstandings. The person who brought clarity and comfort was not a doctor, but a hospital social worker who patiently connected them with resources and translation services. In that experience, David found his calling. He changed his major and later earned a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, a decision that created a quiet but persistent rift with his father.\n\nNow 42, David lives alone in a small apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a few miles from his childhood home. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his bedroom to a small desk in his living room, where he conducts telehealth sessions for a major hospital network. He specializes in geriatric care, often counseling patients who remind him of his own grandparents. The work is emotionally taxing but deeply rewarding. He has a small circle of close friends, and his relationship with his aging parents has softened into a peaceful understanding.\n\nHis days are structured: virtual patient meetings, a midday walk through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park to clear his head, and evenings spent cooking or reading. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; he hopes to eventually develop a community-based program to help elderly immigrants access mental health support. He is a man who found his purpose not in climbing a corporate ladder, but in tending to the quiet, vital needs of the city that raised him."
