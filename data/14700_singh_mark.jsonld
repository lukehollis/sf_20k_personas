His father, Dr. Amar Singh, a brilliant cardiologist from Punjab, India, met his mother, Emi Kenji, a third-generation Japanese-American nurse, at a Bay Area hospital in the late 1960s. Raised in a quiet San Jose suburb, Mark grew up navigating the dual heritage of his name: the disciplined ambition of his father and the stoic resilience of his mother, whose family had endured internment camps. This blend of cultures fostered in him a meticulous, observant nature.\n\nInheriting his parents\u2019 scientific inclination but not their desire for direct patient care, Mark pursued a graduate degree in Biopharmaceutical Sciences at UCSF. He was fascinated not by discovering new molecules, but by the labyrinthine process of bringing them to the public. He found his calling in the structured world of Regulatory Affairs, a field that rewarded his methodical mind and profound sense of responsibility. His career began in the burgeoning biotech scene of the 90s, slowly and steadily climbing the ladder from an associate to his current role as a Director. His key turning point was shepherding a novel cancer therapy through FDA approval, a grueling three-year process that culminated in seeing his meticulous paperwork translate into extended lives.\n\nToday, Mark\u2019s life is a study in disciplined routine. He and his wife of 25 years, Lena, an architect, live in a thoughtfully renovated home in the Inner Sunset. His daily 11.8-mile drive to the biotech hub in Mission Bay is a meditative ritual, filled with industry podcasts and NPR. He has seen San Francisco transform from a gritty, iconoclastic city to a global tech capital, and while he sometimes misses the former, his career is inextricably linked to the latter.\n\nWith his two children now away at college, Mark\u2019s aspirations are shifting. The relentless drive for career advancement is softening, replaced by a desire for mentorship and legacy. He dreams of seeing one more breakthrough drug through the pipeline before considering retirement. Beyond that, his hopes are simpler: to travel with Lena, learn the art of Japanese pottery his mother once practiced, and finally have time to walk along Ocean Beach without checking his work email."

He asked why her parents never spoke of their past. Emi didn\u2019t stop the wheel, but fixed her gaze on the spinning form. \"Some things,\" she said, \"you don't talk about. You carry them, and you make something new.\" In that moment, he understood her stoic resilience wasn't an absence of feeling, but a profoundly disciplined strength. It became the foundation of his own methodical nature.\n\n2.\nIn his mid-20s, adrift in a UCSF lab filled with brilliant discovery scientists, Mark felt like an impostor. He stumbled into a seminar on regulatory pathways. While others yawned, he saw a beautiful, intricate system\u2014a map through a dangerous wilderness. He realized his purpose wasn't finding the treasure, but drawing the map that guided it safely to the people who needed it. It was the day he found his calling, a perfect synthesis of his father's medical mission and his own need for structure.\n\n3.\nThe email confirming the FDA approval for the cancer therapy felt abstract. The real moment came months later, in his early forties, at a company function. A woman from the clinical trials, vibrant and alive, took his hand. \"Your paperwork,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion, \"is why I'm here to see my daughter graduate.\" He wasn't a doctor, but for the first time, he felt the profound weight and grace of a life extended. His binders and spreadsheets had a heartbeat.\n\n4.\nFifteen years ago, during the renovation of their Inner Sunset home, he and Lena were covered in dust, exhausted and arguing over a wall. Lena stopped, grabbed a piece of charcoal, and sketched directly onto the plasterboard\u2014showing him exactly how the morning light would fill the new kitchen. Seeing her vision so clearly amidst the chaos, he felt a wave of calm. They weren't just building a house; they were collaborating on a life, a shared space built on her creativity and his steadfastness.\n\n5.\nThe drive home from their youngest child\u2019s college dorm last year was quieter than he\u2019d ever known. As they crossed the Bay Bridge, the gleaming towers of the city he helped build felt different\u2014less like a challenge and more like a chapter closing. He looked at Lena and realized the relentless drive had finally eased. A new desire was taking its place: not to achieve more, but to simply be more. The dream of a walk on Ocean Beach, untethered, suddenly felt less like a fantasy and more like a plan."
