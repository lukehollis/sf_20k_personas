The son of Egyptian immigrants who settled in Dearborn, Michigan, he grew up navigating the space between two cultures. At home, he was surrounded by the aromas of koshari and the sounds of Cairo; at school, he was another Midwestern kid who, on official forms, had to check the box for \"White,\" a label that felt like a stark oversimplification of his identity.\n\nHis academic path was forged in the aftermath of 9/11. As a college sophomore, the sudden scrutiny and suspicion directed at anyone with an Arab name transformed his abstract interest in sociology into a focused passion. He realized that the design of communities\u2014their public spaces, infrastructure, and transportation\u2014could either foster inclusion or deepen divides. This epiphany led him to a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, with a clear goal: to build more equitable cities.\n\nDrawn to its complex transit challenges and progressive ideals, Karim moved to San Francisco for his career. He started as a junior planner, full of textbook solutions, but quickly learned the city\u2019s realities. His early idealism is now tempered with a pragmatism forged in countless community meetings and budget battles. As a Senior Transit Planner, he\u2019s an expert in the delicate dance of data analysis, political will, and public opinion.\n\nKarim lives his professional ethos. He resides in a Hayes Valley apartment, just a 1.8-mile Muni ride from his office. His daily commute is a form of field research; he notices transfer times, crowded buses, and the relief on people\u2019s faces when a train arrives on schedule. His evenings are often spent with his partner, David, an architect, their conversations frequently circling back to the city\u2019s form and function.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of a dedicated, often frustrated, caretaker. He sees its immense potential choked by inertia. Karim\u2019s quiet aspiration is to see one of his major projects\u2014a new bus rapid transit corridor connecting the west side\u2014fully realized. He dreams of a city where a car is an afterthought, where mobility is a right, ensuring that no one is left on the margins simply because they can\u2019t get from one neighborhood to another."

His father\u2019s stories of Cairo, his mother's koshari\u2014none of it fit inside the neat circle next to \u201cWhite.\u201d Checking it felt like a silent betrayal, a quiet erasure. It was his first lesson in how a poorly designed system could make a person invisible, a lesson that would one day become his life\u2019s work. This occurred in a Dearborn classroom around 1990.\n\n2.\nFall 2001. Walking across the University of Michigan Diag, he felt the campus map redrawn by invisible lines of suspicion. The friendly, collegiate space now felt hostile. He saw the glances, the way conversations quieted as he passed. It wasn't just news; it was personal. In that chill, his abstract interest in sociology burned into a specific need: to build physical spaces where no one would ever feel the way he did then\u2014an outsider in their own community.\n\n3.\nHis first SF community meeting, maybe 2012. He came armed with data, convinced his plan to move a Tenderloin bus stop was elegantly efficient. An elderly woman stood up, her voice shaking with anger, explaining how those extra 50 feet were a barrier, a risk. Her testimony dismantled his neat diagrams in minutes. He felt his textbook certainty crumble, replaced by a humbling truth: a city isn't a schematic. It\u2019s a collection of human needs, and his job was to listen first.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, sitting on their Hayes Valley fire escape with David. As the N-Judah rumbled past, David traced an imaginary new building on the skyline with his finger. Karim, in turn, mapped a more efficient bus route with his. In that moment, looking at the city lights, he felt a profound sense of home. It wasn't just about a place, but about sharing its intricate language\u2014its failures and its infinite promise\u2014with someone who truly understood.\n\n5.\nLast year, waiting for the 21 Hayes, he watched a young mother with a stroller check the new digital arrival sign he\u2019d spent six months fighting for. He saw the flicker of relief on her face as she timed her child\u2019s wrangling with the bus\u2019s actual arrival. It wasn\u2019t his grand transit corridor, but it was tangible. A small knot of frustration in his chest loosened. In that moment of quiet efficiency, he remembered that a better city is built one small, hard-won victory at a time."
