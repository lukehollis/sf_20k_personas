Raised by a CPA father and a dental hygienist mother, his upbringing was one of practicality and predictable comfort. This stable foundation, however, fueled a quiet desire for something less defined. He pursued this at the University of Oregon, graduating with a degree in English Literature, a choice that left him with a deep appreciation for narrative but no clear career path.\n\nHis first real job was managing a high-end men\u2019s boutique in the Pearl District. There, he discovered a talent for understanding not just the customer, but the story a product tells. He loved arranging displays to create a feeling and guiding a customer to the perfect item. But he saw the ceiling of brick-and-mortar retail approaching fast. The key turning point came when he started teaching himself the backend of the store\u2019s nascent e-commerce site, mastering analytics, user flow, and digital merchandising. This self-taught skill set was his ticket out.\n\nSix years ago, a burgeoning SF tech company, impressed by his unique blend of retail sensibility and data-driven acumen, offered him a role. He packed his life into his car and traded Portland\u2019s damp greenery for the vibrant energy of San Francisco. He settled in Hayes Valley, drawn to its boutique-lined streets that reminded him of his professional beginnings.\n\nToday, Ethan\u2019s life is anchored in his sunny one-bedroom apartment. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his standing desk, where he manages digital storefronts for millions of users. His days are a blur of Slack messages, analytics dashboards, and Zoom calls. Working from home has fused his personal and professional spaces, making his neighborhood his entire world. Mornings start with a coffee from Ritual, lunch is often a salad from Souvla, and evenings are for unwinding with a run through the Panhandle or meeting a friend at a local wine bar.\n\nWhile professionally successful, a recent breakup left him feeling introspective. He\u2019s now reconnecting with old friends and focusing on hobbies outside of screens, like learning to shape sourdough and planning hiking trips to Marin. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder, but about synthesis: he fantasizes about one day launching his own small, curated e-commerce brand, a venture that would finally unite his love for tangible goods and the powerful engine of technology."
