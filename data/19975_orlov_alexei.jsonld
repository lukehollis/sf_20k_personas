His heritage is a map of the region's complex history: a Kazakh mother and a Koryo-saram (ethnic Korean of the former USSR) father who carried a Russified surname. When Alexei was five, his parents immigrated to San Francisco, settling in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District, seeking a stability that their new country couldn\u2019t yet promise.\n\nGrowing up, Alexei absorbed the city's relentless energy. He wasn\u2019t an academic; classrooms felt confining compared to the lessons learned on Muni buses and in neighborhood parks. Witnessing his parents\u2019 constant struggle with rent, language barriers, and precarious employment instilled in him a pragmatic drive. After graduating from high school, he bypassed college, seeing it as an expensive detour from the real world. His turning point came from helping his family navigate a complex lease renewal. He realized that power in San Francisco was tied to property, and he wanted to understand its language.\n\nHe worked odd jobs, saving meticulously until he could afford the real estate licensing course. At 23, he passed the exam and entered the industry, his youthful appearance belying a fierce, street-smart tenacity. Now 31, Alexei is a moderately successful agent. His $85,000 income is a source of both pride and anxiety, barely enough to thrive in the city he markets. He can't afford the condos he shows, so he lives in Daly City, making the daily 15-mile commute in his used Honda a necessary grind.\n\nHis days are a blur of client calls, open houses, and late nights writing offers. His social life is largely intertwined with work, though he maintains a small circle of loyal friends from his youth. Alexei\u2019s primary motivation is a singular, powerful dream: to buy his parents a home, providing them the security they crossed the world for. San Francisco is his arena\u2014a place of immense opportunity that also serves as a constant, frustrating reminder of the very stability he sells but has yet to fully grasp for himself."

He remembers the smell of eucalyptus and salt, the strange English sounds overwhelming him. In that moment, clutching his father\u2019s calloused fingers, San Francisco wasn\u2019t a promise; it was a vast, grey mystery. It taught him that security wasn't a place, but a hand to hold in the bewildering unknown. That feeling of needing to find solid ground never left him.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, he watched his parents stare at a lease renewal, their faces a mask of confusion and fear. The landlord spoke quickly, his words like stones. Alexei snatched the papers, the dense legal jargon a foreign language he forced himself to translate in their small living room. Deciphering clauses about rent increases, he felt a hot surge of anger and purpose. He realized then that knowledge wasn't in textbooks; it was the weapon you needed to protect your family, and property wasn't just land; it was power.\n\n3.\nHis first open house as a licensed agent, a tiny Mission condo. He was 23, wearing a suit that felt like a costume. A tech couple, younger than him but radiating wealth, looked right through him, openly questioning his experience. He remembers the flush of shame, followed by a cold wave of defiance. He didn't have their polish, but he knew the Muni lines, the best pupusas, the pulse of the block. That day, he learned to sell not just square footage, but the city he truly knew\u2014the one you live, not just buy.\n\n4.\nJust last week, sitting in the familiar crawl of traffic on 280 from Daly City. His old Honda\u2019s engine hummed its usual complaint as the sun caught the glass of the downtown towers, making them glow. He held a lukewarm coffee, his phone buzzing with client texts about million-dollar views he could see from his car window. The irony was a physical weight: he was the gatekeeper to a kingdom where he couldn't afford a single room. The sight fueled his grind and hollowed him out all at once.\n\n5.\nTwo months ago, at his parents' dinner table in the Richmond. His mother served him *manti*, a taste of a life before this one. He watched her hands, the knuckles swollen with arthritis, place the bowl before him. In their small, rent-controlled apartment, surrounded by the same furniture for twenty years, his ambition sharpened into a piercing point. This wasn\u2019t about commissions or success. It was about those hands, and earning enough to give them a home where they could finally, truly rest."
