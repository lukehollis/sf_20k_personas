The daughter of a Korean software engineer and an Indian classical dancer, she grew up in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of Orange County. Her childhood was a comfortable blend of traditions, but it was defined by the endless asphalt ribbons connecting one planned community to the next. The key turning point came from watching her maternal grandmother, who never learned to drive, become increasingly isolated. Her world shrank to the walkable radius around her home, a quiet frustration that planted a seed in young Priya\u2019s mind: mobility was freedom.\n\nThis observation fueled her academic path. She pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology before being accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Master of Public Policy program. The Bay Area was a revelation\u2014a dense, complex ecosystem where public transit was not an afterthought, but the city\u2019s circulatory system. She threw herself into her studies, focusing her thesis on improving transit equity and access for elderly and disabled populations. Her research and passion led directly to a coveted role as a Policy Analyst at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA).\n\nNow, at 26, Priya lives the reality she advocates for. Her home is a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond, chosen for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and the 38R-Geary Rapid bus line. Her daily 3.5-mile commute is a field study; she observes rider patterns, overhears complaints about service delays, and feels the tangible impact of the data she analyzes at her office near City Hall.\n\nHer life is a deliberate construction of urban community. Weeknights might involve a pottery class to decompress from data-heavy days, or dinner with her close-knit circle of friends from grad school. Weekends are for exploring the city's diverse neighborhoods, from the Mission\u2019s murals to North Beach\u2019s history. Priya dreams of one day leading a major project that fundamentally improves transit on the west side of the city. For her, it\u2019s not just about shaving minutes off a commute; it\u2019s about making sure no one gets left behind, ensuring San Francisco belongs to everyone, regardless of whether they own a car."

An ice cream truck\u2019s jingle drifted down the quiet suburban street, a sound her grandmother loved. But the truck was too far to walk, and without a car, it might as well have been on the moon. Priya saw not just disappointment in her grandmother\u2019s eyes, but a quiet resignation. A world shrinking. In that silent moment, watching the truck disappear, the abstract idea of mobility ignited in her chest as a fierce, personal mission for freedom.\n\n2.\nThe first week of grad school at Berkeley, age 22, she took the BART under the bay alone. Emerging into the Embarcadero station, she was swept into a current of people\u2014students, couriers, tourists, executives. It was a symphony of movement, so different from the isolated silence of her OC childhood drives. She felt a profound sense of arrival, not just in a new city, but in a new way of life. This complex, interconnected system was the world she wanted to understand and improve.\n\n3.\nLast winter, on her commute home on a crowded 38R bus, she overheard an elderly woman thank the driver, explaining she could now visit her grandson in the hospital without asking for a ride. Priya, who had just spent her day analyzing service frequency data for that exact line, felt a jolt of connection. The numbers on her spreadsheet suddenly had a face and a voice. It was the purest form of validation, transforming her policy work from an academic exercise into a tangible act of care.\n\n4.\nA few months ago, her hands were covered in cool, wet clay at her weeknight pottery class in the Richmond. Afterwards, she shared takeout dumplings with two friends from grad school, their conversation echoing in her small apartment. She looked at these people, this space, this simple routine she had built. She realized community, like mobility, had to be intentionally constructed. It didn\u2019t just happen. In that moment, surrounded by laughter and the smell of clay, San Francisco finally felt less like a city and more like home.\n\n5.\nStanding near Sutro Baths just last month, she watched the fog roll over Ocean Beach. She looked east, back at the sprawling grid of the Richmond and Sunset districts, imagining a new light rail line cutting through the avenues. It wasn't just a fantasy; she could see it\u2014the stops, the shelters, the people waiting. She envisioned a future where a grandmother on the west side would never have to feel trapped behind her own window. For Priya, it solidified her ambition from a distant dream into a concrete plan."
