Born in Leningrad to parents who were intellectuals disillusioned with the Soviet regime, his first memories are of hushed conversations and the bitter cold. They emigrated when he was seven, landing in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District with little more than their academic credentials, which proved useless in their new home. His father, a former engineer, drove a taxi, and his mother, a literature professor, cleaned houses. They instilled in Alexei a fierce drive for stability, viewing America as a system to be mastered, not simply enjoyed.\n\nHe spurned their practical advice, pursuing a Master's degree in Economic History at UC Berkeley. He was fascinated not by the numbers themselves, but by the human folly and ambition that drove historical market cycles. The dot-com boom of the late 90s was his proving ground; he left academia, seeing his thesis playing out in real-time. He joined a boutique firm and began his climb. The true turning point was the 2008 financial crisis. While others panicked, Alexei, armed with a historian\u2019s perspective on bubbles and collapses, made shrewd, contrarian moves that cemented his reputation and his fortune.\n\nToday, Alexei inhabits a minimalist condo on Telegraph Hill, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his bedroom to his home office overlooking the Bay and the Financial District. His days are a disciplined ritual: up before dawn to track the European markets, a walk up the Filbert Steps for exercise, and hours of intense, silent focus managing portfolios. His social circle is small and curated. An amicable divorce over a decade ago left him with a lasting friendship with his ex-wife and a deep bond with their daughter, a musician in Oakland whose creative path he quietly subsidizes, proud of the freedom he can provide.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is more observational than participatory. He sees the city as a complex ecosystem he analyzes from his perch. Alexei\u2019s aspiration isn't more wealth, but validation. He dreams of endowing a fellowship at Berkeley in his old department and finally writing the book connecting historical economic patterns to modern algorithmic trading\u2014a final, definitive statement proving his intellectual journey was the most profitable of all."
