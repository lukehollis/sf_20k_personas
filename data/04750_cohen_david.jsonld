Raised by a history professor father and a non-profit director mother, David\u2019s upbringing was steeped in intellectual curiosity and social consciousness. He naturally followed this path to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree, and then to Columbia University for a Master\u2019s in Urban Planning, dreaming of designing equitable, beautiful public spaces.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was the pivot he never saw coming. Graduating into a world of hiring freezes and budget cuts, the idealistic public sector jobs he coveted had vanished. On a whim, and burdened by student debt, he took an interview with a top-tier consulting firm that was recruiting analytical minds, regardless of their field. To his surprise, and his parents\u2019 quiet dismay, he was a natural. The same systematic thinking he\u2019d applied to city grids worked wonders on corporate inefficiencies. The job was meant to be a two-year stopgap; it became a fourteen-year career.\n\nNow 43, David is a partner, a specialist in streamlining operations for investment banks. The success bought him a minimalist, art-filled condo in Hayes Valley following a divorce five years ago\u2014a casualty, he admits, of 80-hour work weeks and his emotional distance. His 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, trading a corner office in the Financial District for a meticulously organized home office overlooking Patricia's Green.\n\nHis days follow a disciplined rhythm: a pre-dawn run through the quiet streets, a pour-over coffee from a local roaster, and then a cascade of video calls with teams in New York and London. He\u2019s an expert in a world he never intended to join. The ghost of the young urban planner still haunts him. He finds himself sketching park designs in his notebook during meetings and spends his substantial income supporting local arts and urban renewal projects. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to climb higher, but to find an exit. He dreams of leveraging his capital and strategic skills to launch a B Corp focused on sustainable urban development, finally closing the gap between the man he is and the man he once set out to be."

His dad pointed at the steel canyons, not as buildings, but as a living text. \u201cA city has bones, David,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cIt tells you who it values.\u201d In that moment, the abstract idea of a city became a tangible, moral puzzle he desperately wanted to solve. It wasn\u2019t a career choice; it felt like a calling, a way to imprint his family\u2019s values onto the world itself.\n\n2.\nThe email from the Portland planning fellowship arrived on a rainy Tuesday in his cramped Morningside Heights apartment. He was 29. The wording was brutally corporate: \u201c...regret to inform you\u2026 comprehensive budget freezes.\u201d He read it three times. The world he had trained for, the one his parents were so proud of, had simply vanished. It wasn't just a rejection; it was an erasure of his future. That clinical email was the precise moment his idealism died, replaced by the cold, heavy weight of his student loan statements.\n\n3.\nThe first time he knew he was truly lost was at 31, in a glass-walled conference room. After he presented a model for streamlining a bank\u2019s trading floor, the client, a man twice his age, simply said, \"Brilliant.\" David felt a hot flush of pride, immediately chased by a hollow pang of guilt. It was the thrill of solving a complex puzzle he didn\u2019t respect. That praise was the first gilded bar on a cage he wouldn't recognize he was in for another decade.\n\n4.\nThe moment his marriage ended wasn\u2019t a fight, but a quiet statement five years ago. His wife, Sarah, stood in the doorway of his home office, looking at the neat stacks of files. \u201cYou\u2019re not here, David,\u201d she said, her voice flat with resignation. \u201cEven when you\u2019re here.\u201d Her words didn\u2019t feel like an accusation, but an observation of fact. He looked at his screen, then at her, and realized she was right. He had streamlined his own life until the most important person in it was an externality.\n\n5.\nIt was a Saturday last spring. From his silent, art-adorned condo, he watched the messy, joyful chaos of families and dogs in Patricia\u2019s Green below. A child fell and scraped a knee; a couple shared a pastry on a bench. He felt a profound, aching distance. And then a thought, clear as a bell: *I know how to build that.* Not the condo, but the green. The life. It was the first time in years the urban planner and the consultant spoke with one voice, igniting the quiet resolve to finally build an exit."
