The daughter of a union longshoreman and a hospital administrator, she was raised on pragmatism and the belief that a good education was the surest path out. For Moira, that path led through libraries. She found solace in the quiet order of the Dewey Decimal System, eventually earning a Master's in Library and Information Science. She envisioned a stable, meaningful life surrounded by books.\n\nThe 2008 recession shattered that vision. Her coveted academic library position was eliminated, and Moira found herself over-educated and unemployed. The turning point came from an unlikely source: a fledgling tech startup needed someone to organize and tag a massive dataset. Her MLIS degree, which focused on information architecture, was suddenly relevant in a world she\u2019d never considered. She leveraged that first gig into another, quickly learning the language of user experience and data analysis. In 2012, she followed the industry\u2019s gravitational pull to San Francisco.\n\nNow 41 and a Director of E-commerce Strategy, Moira manages a global digital marketplace from the quiet of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her commute is a two-step shuffle from her espresso machine to her standing desk. Her life is a study in controlled efficiency: deep work sessions broken up by walks through Golden Gate Park or to her favorite bakery on Clement Street. She left behind a serious relationship on the East Coast and has since cultivated a fiercely protected independence, finding her family in a small, loyal circle of friends met through rock climbing gyms and industry meetups.\n\nThough successful, Moira feels the echo of her first love. Her ultimate dream is not to climb higher on the corporate ladder, but to build something of her own: a beautifully curated online bookstore, using her tech acumen to champion obscure authors. It would be the perfect synthesis of her two lives\u2014the Boston librarian and the San Francisco strategist\u2014finally bringing her story full circle."

Running her fingers along the cloth-bound spines, she felt she was ordering a small piece of the world. It wasn't just a job; it was a calling. That quiet, tactile certainty was the bedrock of the future she\u2019d planned, a peaceful foundation she believed to be unshakable.\n\n2.\n**Event:** Packing a small cardboard box in a silent, empty office.\n**When:** Late 2008, after her position was eliminated.\nThe box held only a coffee mug and a single, framed photo. The rows of empty shelves around her seemed to mock the very skills she\u2019d spent years honing. The feeling wasn't anger, but a cold, hollowing shame. It was the moment she learned that passion was a liability and that the world didn\u2019t care about her perfectly organized plans. This memory forged a pragmatic, protective shell around her heart.\n\n3.\n**Event:** Her first interview at the tech startup, explaining information architecture.\n**When:** 2009, in a sterile Cambridge conference room.\nAs she described organizing principles, she saw the interviewer's eyes light up. Moira realized they weren\u2019t just hearing librarian jargon; they were hearing a solution. What she called \"cataloging,\" they called \"tagging unstructured data.\" In that instant, Dewey Decimal became an algorithm. It wasn't a moment of rekindled passion, but of stark clarity\u2014her knowledge had market value. It was the birth of the strategist, the survivor.\n\n4.\n**Event:** Trusting her belay partner for the first time at Mission Cliffs.\n**When:** 2014, two years after moving to San Francisco.\nHanging fifty feet up, muscles screaming, she looked down not at a lover, but at the upturned, focused face of her climbing partner. She let go, falling just a few feet before the rope caught her with a gentle jolt. It was a different kind of trust\u2014not the sweeping romance she\u2019d left behind, but something specific, earned, and functional. It was how she learned to build her new family: one solid, reliable anchor at a time.\n\n5.\n**Event:** Finding a forgotten author's poetry collection at a Clement Street book sale.\n**When:** Last autumn.\nShe was walking home from her favorite bakery, the e-commerce metrics from her morning's work still swimming in her head. She picked up a slim, beautiful book, and the old librarian instinct flared to life\u2014a thrill of discovery. Standing on the sidewalk, she realized her tech skills weren't a departure from her dream; they were the key. She could build a system to create this exact feeling for others. The idea became a tangible, electric plan."
