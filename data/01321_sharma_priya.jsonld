The only child of immigrants from Jaipur, India, she was raised in a home that valued stability and academic achievement. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a meticulous accountant, hoped she would pursue a similarly pragmatic career. Priya, however, was always more interested in the \u2018why\u2019 behind people\u2019s actions than in lines of code or balance sheets.\n\nThis quiet calling became a clear path during her undergraduate years at UC Davis. While her parents celebrated her acceptance, they were privately wary of her choice to major in Psychology. A volunteer position at a student crisis hotline became her defining turning point. Hearing the raw, unfiltered struggles of her peers ignited a fierce resolve to dedicate her life to helping others navigate their internal worlds. This solidified her decision to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, a move that finally brought her to the city she now calls home.\n\nThe journey to becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker was a grueling multi-year process of clinical hours and supervision, but Priya never wavered. Today, at 37, she runs a small private practice from a quiet, sunlit room in her North of the Panhandle flat, making her commute exactly zero miles. Her work is emotionally demanding, focusing on young adults and first-generation Americans grappling with anxiety, identity, and family expectations\u2014a world she understands intimately.\n\nPriya\u2019s life is one of intentional balance. Mornings often begin with a walk through the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe in hand. Her client sessions, a mix of in-person and telehealth, fill her days. Evenings are for decompressing: cooking elaborate vegetarian meals, losing herself in a novel, or meeting her tight-knit group of friends\u2014an eclectic mix of artists, teachers, and tech workers\u2014for dinner in the Mission. Though currently single, she values deep connection and is open to a relationship built on mutual respect and emotional intelligence.\n\nHer dream is not of wealth, but of impact. Priya hopes to one day expand her practice into a group that offers accessible, culturally-competent therapy for immigrant communities, breaking down the stigmas she witnessed growing up. For her, San Francisco is not a landscape for ambition, but a community to serve, heal, and deeply belong to."
