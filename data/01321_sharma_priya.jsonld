The only child of immigrants from Jaipur, India, she was raised in a home that valued stability and academic achievement. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a meticulous accountant, hoped she would pursue a similarly pragmatic career. Priya, however, was always more interested in the \u2018why\u2019 behind people\u2019s actions than in lines of code or balance sheets.\n\nThis quiet calling became a clear path during her undergraduate years at UC Davis. While her parents celebrated her acceptance, they were privately wary of her choice to major in Psychology. A volunteer position at a student crisis hotline became her defining turning point. Hearing the raw, unfiltered struggles of her peers ignited a fierce resolve to dedicate her life to helping others navigate their internal worlds. This solidified her decision to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, a move that finally brought her to the city she now calls home.\n\nThe journey to becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker was a grueling multi-year process of clinical hours and supervision, but Priya never wavered. Today, at 37, she runs a small private practice from a quiet, sunlit room in her North of the Panhandle flat, making her commute exactly zero miles. Her work is emotionally demanding, focusing on young adults and first-generation Americans grappling with anxiety, identity, and family expectations\u2014a world she understands intimately.\n\nPriya\u2019s life is one of intentional balance. Mornings often begin with a walk through the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe in hand. Her client sessions, a mix of in-person and telehealth, fill her days. Evenings are for decompressing: cooking elaborate vegetarian meals, losing herself in a novel, or meeting her tight-knit group of friends\u2014an eclectic mix of artists, teachers, and tech workers\u2014for dinner in the Mission. Though currently single, she values deep connection and is open to a relationship built on mutual respect and emotional intelligence.\n\nHer dream is not of wealth, but of impact. Priya hopes to one day expand her practice into a group that offers accessible, culturally-competent therapy for immigrant communities, breaking down the stigmas she witnessed growing up. For her, San Francisco is not a landscape for ambition, but a community to serve, heal, and deeply belong to."

A freshman boy, his voice cracking, confessed his fear of failing his parents. He wasn't talking about grades; he was talking about his soul. In that moment, the theories from her psychology textbooks dissolved into a raw, human truth. It wasn't about analysis; it was about presence. The quiet click after he said \"thank you\" was the loudest sound she\u2019d ever heard. It wasn't a choice anymore; it was a calling.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-two, she explained her decision to pursue social work to her father over chai in their Fremont kitchen. She saw the flicker of worry in his eyes\u2014the fear she was choosing a life of struggle over the stability he had worked so hard to give her. She didn't argue. She just held his gaze and said, \u201cPapa, this is how I can help.\u201d The sadness of his quiet disapproval was immense, but it forged a gentle, unshakeable resolve in her own heart. It was the first time she truly parented herself.\n\n3.\nThe day she got the keys to her NOPA flat, she was thirty-two. Before any furniture arrived, she stood in the empty room that would become her office. Afternoon sun streamed through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A profound quiet settled over her, a feeling of deep, earned peace. This wasn't just an apartment; it was the culmination of a decade of grueling work. It was her sanctuary and her life's work, finally under one roof. She was home.\n\n4.\nHer client, a young programmer from a family like her own, finally broke his silence. He described feeling like a ghost, haunting the space between his parents\u2019 expectations and his own quiet despair. Priya felt a powerful thrum of recognition, a shared ache that transcended the clinical. In his breakthrough, she saw her own journey. The moment affirmed her purpose with breathtaking clarity: she was meant to hold this specific space, to help others translate the language of their own fractured parts back into a whole.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a warm Tuesday, she sat on a crowded patio in the Mission, laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. Her friends\u2014a teacher, a painter, a coder\u2014were debating the merits of different breakfast burritos. In the midst of the easy, chaotic joy, she felt a wave of profound gratitude. This was her chosen family. This feeling\u2014of being fully known and accepted, without pretense or performance\u2014was the very thing she worked to cultivate in others. She realized it was the anchor in her own life, too."
