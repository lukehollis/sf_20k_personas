The daughter of first-generation immigrants, Priya grew up watching her parents pour their life savings and relentless energy into a small, unassuming import business. They operated out of a converted garage, and the family lived in the small house attached. For Priya, the scent of cardboard and foreign spices is the smell of home.\n\nHer educational journey was cut short not by a lack of ambition, but by necessity. Just as she was finishing high school, with vague plans for City College, her mother\u2019s health took a serious downturn. Without a second thought, Priya stepped in to help her father manage the business. She became the de facto administrative assistant, learning bookkeeping, logistics, and customer relations on the fly. College became a distant dream, replaced by the immediate reality of invoices and shipping manifests. This was her turning point: the moment her future became entwined with her family\u2019s survival.\n\nAt 25, Priya\u2019s daily routine is a seamless loop. She wakes, walks the ten feet from her bedroom to the home office, and begins her day. Her commute is zero miles, but her mind travels thousands as she coordinates shipments from overseas. Her social connections are primarily her tight-knit family and a handful of old high school friends she meets for boba in the Mission on rare weekends off. She feels a deep, abiding connection to her neighborhood \u2014 she knows the grocer by name and the precise moment the fog will roll in over the hill \u2014 yet she also feels profoundly stuck.\n\nHer secret dream lives on her laptop. After her father goes to bed, Priya loses herself in online graphic design courses. She creates vibrant, intricate digital art, a stark contrast to her muted daily life. Her greatest aspiration isn't fame or fortune, but independence. She fantasizes about saving enough to rent a small studio apartment in the Inner Richmond, a place that is hers alone. She hopes to one day launch a small online store for her designs, turning her quiet passion into a path that leads beyond the familiar streets of her childhood home and into a San Francisco of her own making."
