Born to a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a third-generation Irish-American handyman, he grew up in the fog-drenched landscape of Daly City. His childhood was a blend of his mother's insistence on stability and his father\u2019s love for taking things apart and putting them back together. While his friends dreamed of coding and IPOs, Liam was fascinated by the intricate systems humming behind walls\u2014the plumbing, the wiring, the airflow.\n\nAcademically, Liam was adrift. Traditional high school subjects felt abstract and pointless. His turning point came not in a classroom, but in the family garage, helping his father replace a water heater. The satisfaction of a job done right\u2014the restored warmth, the quiet hum of a working machine\u2014was a revelation. Rejecting the four-year university path his mother had hoped for, he enrolled at a local community college and earned an Associate of Applied Science in HVAC/R Technology. He thrived in the hands-on environment, his mind and hands finally working in sync.\n\nAfter getting his certification, Liam landed a uniquely San Franciscan gig: the live-in HVAC technician for a sprawling, pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. This explains his zero-mile commute; his small basement apartment is part of his compensation. His days are a mix of routine maintenance on the ancient, groaning boiler and frantic emergency calls for malfunctioning heaters. He knows the building's secrets\u2014which radiator clangs at 3 a.m., which unit has the draftiest window.\n\nLiam is a fixture in the building's ecosystem, on a first-name basis with everyone from tech executives on the penthouse level to elderly tenants who have lived there since the 1970s. These connections form his primary social circle, a vertical neighborhood of familiar faces. His dream is as practical as he is: to save enough to start his own HVAC business, focusing on retrofitting older San Francisco buildings with modern, efficient systems. He doesn\u2019t want to change the world, just to ensure it stays warm, one building at a time."
