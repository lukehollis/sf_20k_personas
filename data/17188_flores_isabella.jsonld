Growing up in Daly City, the daughter of a Filipino immigrant nurse and a second-generation custodian, public transportation was not an abstract concept but a daily reality. She remembers watching her father, weary after a late shift, time his walk to the BART station with practiced precision. The rumble of the trains was the sound of her family\u2019s livelihood, and she saw firsthand how a 10-minute delay could cascade into a stressful evening.\n\nThis intimate understanding of transit\u2019s human impact fueled her academic journey. While her peers at UC Berkeley romanticized startups, Isabella was drawn to the complex, tangible problems of urban systems. She pursued a Master of Urban Planning, focusing her thesis on transit equity in fog-belt communities. Her professors noted her unique blend of data-driven analysis and profound empathy.\n\nA key turning point was a summer internship with the SFMTA. Tasked with analyzing community feedback for a proposed route change in the Bayview, she spent weeks riding the bus, talking to elderly residents and young parents. She realized her work wasn't just about maps and timetables; it was about preserving a grandmother's access to her doctor or ensuring a student could get to their after-school job safely. She knew this was her calling.\n\nNow, as a Transit Planner, Isabella lives in the Inner Richmond, sharing a classic Edwardian flat with two friends from grad school. Her daily 5.8-mile commute on the 38R Geary Rapid is both her routine and her ongoing field research. She instinctively notes passenger flow, bus bunching, and the accessibility of each stop. Her evenings are often spent with friends, intentionally exploring different neighborhoods via the systems she helps design, from dim sum in Chinatown to trivia nights in the Mission.\n\nHer aspiration isn't a corner office but to lead the implementation of a major service improvement project, one that tangibly benefits the city's most underserved residents. Isabella dreams of a San Francisco where mobility is a universal right, not a privilege. She is a product of the Bay Area\u2019s arteries, and she has dedicated her life to ensuring they flow freely and fairly for everyone."

When her father finally emerged from the escalator, his custodian uniform softened by exhaustion, his smile was a small, tired victory. In that moment, watching him nod at the train operator, she didn't just see her dad coming home. She felt the weight of every minute the train ran late. This was the first problem she ever wanted to solve.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, the city cracked open for her. Clutching a crumpled Muni map, she took the 28 bus alone for the first time, all the way to Golden Gate Park. The lurch of the bus as it turned felt like a leap of faith. When the doors hissed open and she saw the green expanse, a profound sense of freedom washed over her. The city wasn\u2019t just a place her parents worked; it was hers to explore. That bus route became her personal map to independence.\n\n3.\nFor her master\u2019s thesis, she interviewed an elderly woman in the Outer Sunset. The woman, frail and clutching a worn grocery bag, spoke not of timetables but of loneliness. She described watching the fog roll in, knowing the infrequent L Taraval was her only link to her doctor and friends. Hearing the tremor in her voice, Isabella\u2019s academic research suddenly had a heartbeat. Data points transformed into a lifeline, and her empathy gained a fierce, protective edge.\n\n4.\nDuring her SFMTA internship, she rode the T Third through Bayview. She wasn't just observing passenger counts; she was listening. A young mother told her son they had to leave the library early, her voice tight with anxiety about catching the last reliable bus home. Isabella felt a jolt of profound responsibility. Her spreadsheets and maps weren\u2019t just abstract plans; they were the boundaries of this family's world. Her career path solidified right there, on that rattling train car.\n\n5.\nLast month, trivia night was in the Mission. As she and her roommates left their Richmond flat, the 38R was bunched with another bus. A flicker of professional annoyance mixed with a quiet pride. \"Detour on Divisadero,\" she announced, already mapping a new route in her head. \"We'll grab the 5R and walk from McAllister.\" In that seamless pivot, she felt the city not as a problem to be solved, but as a living system she intimately understood and belonged to."
