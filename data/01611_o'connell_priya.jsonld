Born and raised in the fog-dusted hills of the Sunset District, she is the daughter of a second-generation Irish-American firefighter and an immigrant mother from Mumbai who worked as a university librarian. Her childhood was a blend of two cultures: her father\u2019s stoic sense of civic duty and the expressive warmth of her Indian heritage. This duality taught her to listen for the words left unsaid and to see the world from multiple perspectives, planting the seeds for her future career.\n\nHer educational path was not a straight line. Initially, she pursued literature at UC Santa Cruz, captivated by stories. The true turning point came during the aftermath of a major warehouse fire her father fought. She watched him struggle silently with the trauma, his emotional armor cracking under a weight the family didn't have the language to address. Witnessing his pain, and the city\u2019s limited resources for its first responders, ignited a new purpose in her. She transferred her focus, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nAfter years working in community mental health in the Mission District, dealing with crises on the front lines, Priya opened a private practice. She now works as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker from a serene, soundproofed office on the ground floor of her Noe Valley home, making her commute exactly zero miles. Her daily routine is a structured ballet of client sessions, note-taking, and walks through her quiet neighborhood with her husband, Marcus, an urban planner.\n\nNow 45, Priya is a quiet anchor in a city of turbulent currents. She is deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014not just the glossy tech hub, but the city of foghorns, corner stores, and resilient families she grew up with. Her clients are a cross-section of the city's anxieties: tech founders battling imposter syndrome, artists facing displacement, and couples navigating the pressures of modern life. Her greatest aspiration is to continue providing a space for healing, helping others navigate their own internal landscapes. She dreams of one day taking a sabbatical with Marcus to finally explore the vibrant streets of Mumbai that her mother always described with such love and longing."
