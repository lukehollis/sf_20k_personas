A San Francisco native, born and raised in the Sunset District, the vast expanse of Golden Gate Park was his childhood backyard. His father, a union plumber, and his mother, a school secretary, instilled in him a steady, working-class ethic. They weren't people of grand ambitions, but of quiet dignity and reliability\u2014traits Thomas inherited completely.\n\nHis educational journey was practical. After high school, he enrolled at the City College of San Francisco, pursuing a certificate in horticulture. He loved learning the Latin names for plants and the science of soil, but life intervened. When his father suffered a debilitating back injury, Thomas left his studies to take a seasonal job with the Recreation and Parks Department, the same entity that managed his childhood playground. The temporary job became a career. He found a profound satisfaction in nurturing the city\u2019s green spaces, a tangible result you could see and touch.\n\nOver two and a half decades, he steadily worked his way up from a seasonal gardener to a lead, and finally, to a Parks Maintenance Supervisor. His key turning point was securing his current position, which came with a small, city-owned maintenance cottage nestled deep within the park itself\u2014explaining his zero-mile commute. This solidified his identity as a man of the park, rather than just the city.\n\nHis personal life has been as quiet as his surroundings. A marriage in his late twenties to a woman who loved the vibrancy of San Francisco nightlife ended amicably after five years; she craved the energy he sought to escape. His closest connections now are the members of his crew and the early-morning dog walkers he greets by name. His routine is governed by seasons, not schedules: inspecting irrigation, managing staff, overseeing repairs, and ensuring his section of the park remains a sanctuary.\n\nThomas dreams not of wealth or travel, but of continuity. He hopes to see the historic Dutch Windmill fully restored before he retires and to mentor a young, passionate gardener to take his place. His aspiration is to be a quiet steward, an unseen hand ensuring that the heart of San Francisco remains green for generations to come, a silent anchor in a city of constant, roaring change."
