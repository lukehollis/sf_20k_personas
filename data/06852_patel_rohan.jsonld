The only child of first-generation Indian immigrants, his upbringing was a blend of high expectations and loving pragmatism. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a straightforward path for him: a prestigious university followed by a stable, high-earning profession. Rohan, however, was more interested in the \"why\" behind human decisions than the \"how\" of building circuits. He found a middle ground at UC Davis, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science\u2014a field that satisfied his curiosity about the mind while still being analytical enough to appease his parents.\n\nUpon graduating, he landed a junior data analyst role at a mid-sized San Francisco tech company. The twist was the job\u2019s fully remote nature. For the first year, he worked from his childhood bedroom, the familiar comfort of home slowly morphing into a gilded cage. The key turning point came on his 25th birthday. Staring at the same four walls, he realized his life was a dataset with no interesting variables. He packed his bags and moved into a small, sparsely furnished studio in the Mission District, trading suburban quiet for the vibrant hum of Valencia Street. His 0.0-mile commute remained, but his world had expanded infinitely.\n\nRohan\u2019s current life is a study in disciplined routine. Mornings are for pour-over coffee and parsing complex data sets on his dual monitors, the clatter of his keyboard mingling with distant city sounds. To combat the isolation of remote work, he found his tribe not in bars, but at Mission Cliffs climbing gym. The physical problem-solving of a bouldering route became his meditation, and the shared encouragement from fellow climbers formed the bedrock of his new social life.\n\nThough he finds satisfaction in spotting trends for his company, Rohan dreams of applying his skills more meaningfully. He imagines using data to optimize SF\u2019s public transit systems or to analyze patterns in urban development to create more equitable communities. For now, he is content building his own narrative, one data point at a time, finding his footing in a city that feels less like a place to work and more like a home he is actively choosing, every single day."
