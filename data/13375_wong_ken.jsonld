Born and raised in the fog-laced avenues of the Outer Richmond, Ken is the only son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store. From a young age, his world was a symphony of stocking shelves, rotating produce, and the subtle calculus of customer flow. He saw the grueling hours his parents worked and didn't dream of escape, but of optimization. He wondered, even then, if there was a better way to arrange the aisles, a faster way to do inventory.\n\nThis innate curiosity led him to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where he pursued a degree in Industrial Engineering. It was a perfect fit, giving a name and methodology to his lifelong observations. After graduating, he began a steady career climb, moving from a junior process engineer to his current role as an Operations Manager for a specialty electronics manufacturer in the Dogpatch district. He finds deep satisfaction in streamlining production lines and eliminating bottlenecks, taking pride in the steady hum of machinery he helps orchestrate.\n\nHis personal life has been less linear. A marriage in his late twenties ended amicably in divorce a decade later, the result of two people who, despite their affection, simply operated on different systems. The enduring success from that union is his daughter, Mia, now a sophomore at UC Davis. She is his greatest project and deepest love. Witnessing her carve her own path is his primary source of joy. Another key turning point was his parents' retirement ten years ago; selling the family store felt like closing a foundational chapter of his life.\n\nToday, Ken lives a life of disciplined routine in a tidy Inner Richmond condo. His day begins before dawn with the rumble of the Muni bus for his 3.2-mile commute, a time he uses for reading technical journals. Evenings are for simple, home-cooked meals and video calls with Mia. A lifelong San Franciscan, he carries a quiet nostalgia for the city of his youth but adapts to its changes with an engineer\u2019s pragmatism. His dream isn\u2019t for radical change, but for continued improvement: to see his daughter flourish, to mentor the next generation of engineers, and perhaps, one day, to travel to Guangdong to trace the complex, unoptimized path his parents took so that his could be so clear."

While his father hunched over the ledger, Ken ignored the comics he was supposed to be reading and rearranged the soup cans. Not by name, but by sales velocity. Tomato and Chicken Noodle at the front, Clam Chowder further back. He felt a quiet, profound satisfaction in this small, hidden efficiency. It was the first time he understood that creating order was his way of trying to lessen his parents\u2019 exhaustion, a love expressed through logic.\n\n2.\nEleven years ago, during the final stages of their separation, he was packing boxes of books. He stacked them by size to maximize space, a perfect tetris. His wife, watching from the doorway, gave a sad smile. \"I would have sorted them by author,\" she said softly. There was no malice in her voice, only a quiet acknowledgment. In that moment, he knew their divorce was right. They weren't broken, they were simply two well-meaning, incompatible systems that could no longer integrate. The lesson was pragmatic and heartbreaking.\n\n3.\nTen years ago, he stood with his parents on the sidewalk outside the sold grocery store. His father turned the key in the lock for the last time. The air, usually thick with the scent of cardboard and ripe peaches, smelled only of industrial cleaner. It wasn\u2019t just a building; it was the entire operating system of his childhood being shut down. That silence felt louder than any machine he\u2019d ever managed, marking the moment his foundation shifted from a physical place to a memory.\n\n4.\nJust over a year ago, he watched Mia unpack in her chaotic UC Davis dorm room. His engineering mind screamed to create a flowchart, to optimize the placement of her desk and bed. But he stayed quiet, watching her direct friends with a joyous, inefficient energy. He felt a surge of pride so sharp it ached. His life\u2019s greatest project was now self-sustaining, beautifully messy, and entirely her own. True success, he realized, was knowing when to step back and just admire the process.\n\n5.\nOn a video call last spring, Mia casually mentioned a paper she was writing on diasporic communities. \"I wonder what Gung Gung's village was actually like,\" she mused. The simple question landed with the force of a dropped machine part. Ken had spent his life streamlining the future, but had never once analyzed the complex, unoptimized path his parents forged for him. That idle comment from his daughter crystallized a vague notion into a necessary pilgrimage: to understand the original system he came from."
