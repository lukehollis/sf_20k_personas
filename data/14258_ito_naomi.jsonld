A third-generation Japanese American (*Sansei*), she was raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a nurturing schoolteacher mother who instilled in her the values of diligence and community service. While they hoped she would pursue medicine, Naomi\u2019s path diverged in college. The turning point was watching her own family struggle to support her younger brother through a severe bout of adolescent depression, navigating a system that felt culturally tone-deaf and clinical. This experience ignited in her a fierce desire to bridge that gap.\n\nShe pursued her undergraduate degree at UCLA before returning to the Bay Area for her doctorate in Clinical Psychology, focusing her studies on family systems and adolescent mental health. She intentionally chose a career outside of lucrative private practice. Today, Naomi works as a licensed psychologist for a community health network that partners with San Francisco\u2019s public schools. Her days are a challenging tapestry of student sessions, family mediations, and teacher consultations, addressing everything from anxiety and trauma to learning disabilities.\n\nAt 43, Naomi has built a life of deliberate purpose. Her commute is a 3.5-mile ride on the 5-Fulton bus from her NOPA apartment, a small but quiet space she treasures. After emotionally demanding days, she finds solace in long, meditative walks through the Panhandle and into Golden Gate Park, letting the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth reset her senses.\n\nWhile a long-term relationship ended amicably two years ago, her life is rich with connection. She maintains a close-knit group of friends from her doctoral program and regularly visits her aging parents in San Jose. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees her work as a direct contribution to the city's complex, often-strained social fabric. Her ambition isn't for a larger salary but for deeper impact\u2014she dreams of developing a mentorship program that connects older AAPI adults with struggling teens, creating the kind of culturally aware support system her own family once needed."
