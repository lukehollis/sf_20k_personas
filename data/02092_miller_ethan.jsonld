            "value": "Ethan Miller is the product of a classic San Franciscan immigrant dream. His parents, Wei and Li, left Guangzhou in the late 1970s, eventually opening a small, beloved grocery store in the Outer Richmond. Ethan\u2019s childhood was a mix of foggy afternoons stocking shelves and the immense, unspoken pressure to validate his parents' sacrifices. He saw their exhaustion and vowed to build a life of stability, one measured not in long hours over a cash register, but in stock market returns and financial security.\n\nWhile his parents managed inventory and community ties, Ethan managed spreadsheets and probabilities. He saw finance not as a passion, but as the most direct path to the life he felt he owed them. After a B.S. in Economics from UCLA, he returned to the Bay Area, climbing the corporate ladder before securing an MBA from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. This degree was his key, unlocking the senior-level roles he now occupies.\n\nThe major turning point was the pandemic-induced shift to remote work, a change Ethan embraced with clinical efficiency. He traded a downtown office for a sleek, high-rise condo in Mission Bay, his commute shrinking to the ten steps from his bedroom to his ergonomic desk. His days are a disciplined cycle: up at 6 AM for market--opening analysis, a precisely timed coffee, and a long day of virtual meetings and financial modeling. A past long-term relationship withered under the strain of his relentless work schedule, a casualty of his ambition he rarely allows himself to dwell on.\n\nNow, at 39, a quiet disquiet has set in. He\u2019s achieved the financial stability his parents craved for him, but his world is circumscribed by his floor-to-ceiling windows. His relationship with San Francisco is one of an admirer from a distance, watching the Bay Bridge lights and the flurry of Oracle Park from his orderly perch. Recently, he\u2019s begun exploring the Embarcadero on foot during lunch, contemplating joining a sailing club at the nearby marina. His next big investment, he hopes, will be in a life lived beyond the balance sheet."
