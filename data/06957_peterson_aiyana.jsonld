Their dinner table conversations were a constant analysis of cause and effect, of historical injustices manifesting as modern inequities. This environment didn't just shape her worldview; it built the framework for her life\u2019s work. A bright, observant child, she saw firsthand how city policies on zoning and redevelopment could either uplift or displace the families she had known her entire life.\n\nThis formative awareness led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Master of Public Policy. She found her calling not in abstract theory but in tangible data sets that told human stories. An internship with the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development solidified her path. For the first time, she saw how a well-researched policy brief could directly influence the creation of affordable housing units or tenant protection laws.\n\nNow 39, Aiyana is a senior policy analyst for the City, specializing in housing stability. Her commute is a few steps from her bed to her desk in her bright Mission District apartment, a detail that allows her to be deeply immersed in her work and her neighborhood. Her days are a disciplined rhythm of data analysis, stakeholder calls, and writing reports that distill complex urban problems into actionable recommendations. She starts each morning with a walk to a local panaderia for coffee, observing the very community her policies affect.\n\nThough her work is demanding, Aiyana maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow policy wonks, artists, and educators\u2014who ground her. They meet for weekly trivia at a local pub or long hikes in the Marin Headlands. She\u2019s professionally respected but personally reserved, an analyst in life as well as work. Her connection to San Francisco is one of profound, critical love; she sees its beauty and its deep-seated flaws with equal clarity. Aiyana\u2019s quiet aspiration is to eventually move from analyst to architect, perhaps by running for the Board of Supervisors. She doesn't just want to advise on policy; she dreams of one day having the power to write it."
