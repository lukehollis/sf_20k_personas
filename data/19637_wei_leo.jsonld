The son of Taiwanese immigrants who settled in Cupertino, he grew up surrounded by the burgeoning ambition of Silicon Valley. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a similar path for him: stable, prestigious, and lucrative. However, Leo was more attuned to the unspoken anxieties that permeated his high-achieving community. The turning point was watching his older sister grapple with debilitating, undiagnosed depression throughout high school, a struggle the family met with confusion and a desire to maintain appearances.\n\nThis formative experience steered him away from STEM and toward UC Berkeley for psychology. He felt a calling not just to understand the human mind, but to build systems of support that he and his sister never had. He later earned his doctorate in Clinical Psychology, specializing in adolescents. Now, as the Lead Clinical Psychologist for a large healthcare provider\u2019s school-based services, Leo develops and oversees mental health programs for students across San Francisco. He manages a team and liaises with school districts, but insists on carrying a small caseload of his own to stay grounded in the work.\n\nHis day begins with the familiar ritual of oiling his bicycle chain. The 3.8-mile ride from his NoPa apartment to a clinic near the Mission is his daily meditation, a journey often cutting through the Panhandle\u2019s green expanse. He finds a deep sense of purpose in serving the city's diverse youth, helping them navigate pressures his own family couldn\u2019t name.\n\nEvenings are a cherished contrast to his demanding days. He and his partner of seven years, a landscape architect named Daniel, have cultivated a quiet life. They cook, tend to their balcony garden, and host small dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends. Leo has seen San Francisco transform, but his connection isn't to its booms and busts; it's to the kids in its classrooms and the fog that rolls over Twin Peaks. His aspiration isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to expand his program\u2019s reach, ensuring no child feels as isolated as his sister once did."

She sat on her bed, a report card with perfect grades clutched in her hand, silent tears tracing paths down her face. He asked what was wrong. She just shook her head, her expression utterly vacant. The chasm between her achievement and her despair was a terrifying void. In that moment, watching his family\u2019s inability to address the emptiness, Leo felt his own future pivot. He would find the words for this pain, the ones his parents couldn't.\n\n2.\nIt was a Psychology 101 lecture at Berkeley, the hall cavernous and impersonal. The professor projected a diagram of a family system, explaining how one member\u2019s symptoms could reflect the whole family\u2019s unspoken anxiety. Leo felt a jolt, like a key turning in a lock he never knew existed. His family\u2019s obsession with appearances, his sister\u2019s silent suffering\u2014it all clicked into a coherent, heartbreaking pattern. For the first time, his departure from STEM felt less like rebellion and more like a necessary search for the truth.\n\n3.\nYears later, in his residency, he sat with a middle schooler who hadn't spoken a word in weeks. The silence felt heavy, a test of his own endurance. Then, during their seventh session, the boy wordlessly pushed a drawing across the table: a tiny figure at the bottom of a deep, dark well. Leo felt a wave of relief and connection so profound it almost brought tears to his eyes. He learned then that his job wasn't to force kids to speak, but to create a space safe enough for them to show him the view from the bottom.\n\n4.\nThey had just moved into their NoPa apartment. Cardboard boxes still lined the walls, but Daniel was on the balcony, his hands covered in soil, gently coaxing a scrawny ficus into a new pot. Daniel looked up, his face smudged with dirt, and gave him a smile that felt like sunlight. Leo felt a sense of calm settle deep in his bones. This was the life he had chosen\u2014not inherited. A quiet life built with intention, where things were allowed to be messy, nurtured, and given space to grow.\n\n5.\nHe was riding his bike through the Panhandle as the fog rolled in, thick and purifying. The hum of his wheels on the damp pavement was a familiar rhythm. Just ahead, a group of high school students waited for the bus, their bright jackets a defiant splash of color against the grey. He saw their faces\u2014bored, anxious, joyful, tired\u2014and felt a fierce, protective love for them, for this city. This was his purpose, not in a grand, abstract way, but here, on this path, on his way to help them carry it all."
