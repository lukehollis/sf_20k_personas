He arrived in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District from Kyiv, Ukraine, at the age of six, his parents trading post-Soviet uncertainty for the promise of American stability. They were engineers by training but took jobs as a janitor and a seamstress, instilling in their only son a profound respect for hard work and the public infrastructure that allowed their new life to function. The rumbling predictability of the 28-19th Avenue bus was the rhythm of his youth, a lifeline that connected his family to work, school, and community.\n\nThis deep-seated appreciation for civic machinery guided him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a degree in Public Administration. He saw it not as a path to power, but as a manual for making things better. He interned with the city during his senior year and secured an entry-level position at the SFMTA shortly after graduating. For over a decade, Dmitri has been a meticulous improver, working his way up to Program Manager. He's not a flashy tech disruptor; he is the guy ensuring the signal timing on Van Ness is optimized and that the community outreach for a new bike lane is thorough.\n\nToday, Dmitri lives in a tidy one-bedroom apartment in Duboce Triangle, a neighborhood chosen for its vibrant park and, crucially, its access to the N-Judah and J-Church lines. His\n5.5-mile commute is a daily field study. He notices rider patterns, overhears complaints, and feels a quiet pride when a train glides seamlessly through the tunnel.\n\nRecently out of a long-term relationship, his social life is rebuilding. It centers on a small group of city-planner friends and a weekly bouldering session at a local gym. Dmitri\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to see a major project\u2014like the Central Subway\u2014become a beloved, functional part of the city he helped build. He aspires to one day own a small condo, a permanent stake in the city he serves not just as an employee, but as a true believer in its potential for a more connected, equitable future."

The city outside was a foggy, overwhelming blur, but inside, the bus was a warm, predictable world. He watched the pull-cord, the lit-up \u201cSTOP REQUESTED\u201d sign. It was the first system he understood in America, a promise that you could pull a string and the whole big machine would listen. That feeling of reliable order became the core of his professional ambition.\n\n2.\nHe was about ten, waiting for his father to finish his shift at the middle school. He watched him, an engineer who once designed factory systems, meticulously buffing a scuffed hallway floor until it gleamed. Dmitri felt a hot flash of shame, quickly replaced by a wave of awe. His father wasn't just a janitor; he was tending to the physical space that allowed learning to happen. It taught Dmitri that maintaining the system was a noble, essential act, a lesson he carries into every signal timing project he oversees.\n\n3.\nIn his junior year of high school, he attended a required community meeting about rerouting a bus line. He remembers the shouting, the confusion, and the city planner at the front with maps and charts, patiently trying to explain the logic. In that chaotic room, Dmitri saw his calling. It wasn\u2019t in the politics or the anger, but in the quiet work of untangling the knot\u2014of finding the most elegant, efficient path forward. He decided then to study public administration, to become the person with the answers.\n\n4.\nHe was 26, standing on a corner in the Mission, pretending to check his phone. In reality, he was watching traffic. It was his first solo project: re-timing a series of difficult intersections. He watched for ten minutes as buses, cars, and cyclists flowed through with a new, subtle grace that no one else would ever notice. There was no plaque, no ceremony. But the smooth, uninterrupted pulse of the street felt like a secret handshake between him and the city. It was the proudest moment of his early career.\n\n5.\nJust last month, after a lonely Tuesday evening, he rode a near-empty N-Judah home. The train car, usually a data set of faces and movements, was just a quiet space for him and his thoughts about the future. As it emerged from the tunnel and the lights of the city spread below, he felt a profound connection not to a person, but to the place itself. This system, this network of steel and light, was his constant. It solidified his quiet dream: to own a piece of it himself."
