Driven by a desire for a life with a broader scope, she pursued a political science degree at a large state university, which became her ticket out. She arrived in California for a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, armed with ideals about shaping public good and reforming inefficient systems.\n\nHer key turning point came not in a government office, but during an internship where she analyzed economic policy for a private think tank. She found herself energized by the pace and tangible results of the private sector, and disillusioned by the slow churn of bureaucracy. When a prestigious finance consultancy recruited her for her sharp analytical skills, she pivoted. The idealism of her youth was channeled into a new, more lucrative pragmatism: optimizing capital instead of policy.\n\nNow 34, Sarah is a Senior Management Consultant. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a standing desk in the corner of her gleaming Mission Bay condo. Life is a sequence of intense Zoom calls, complex financial models, and late-night food delivery apps. Her connection to San Francisco is professional; she loves its ambition and intellectual energy but experiences the city mostly through her floor-to-ceiling windows and curated weekend excursions to Napa or hikes in Marin.\n\nHer social life is tight-knit, consisting of a few colleagues and grad school friends who understand her demanding schedule. A serious relationship ended two years ago, a casualty of her all-consuming career. While she has achieved the financial security her parents prized, a quiet restlessness has set in. Sarah dreams of leveraging her expertise to start her own boutique firm focused on sustainable and ethical investments, a way to finally merge the idealist she was with the powerhouse she has become."
