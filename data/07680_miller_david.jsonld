The orderly, predictable world of his father\u2019s generation\u2014job, house, family\u2014was crumbling around him, replaced by abandoned factories and uncertain futures. This childhood spent amidst urban decay ignited a lifelong obsession not with building things, but with building systems for things to exist within. He wanted to bring order to chaos.\n\nHis path was methodical. A state university degree led to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from a prestigious East Coast school. In 1998, lured by the frenetic energy of the dot-com boom, he moved to San Francisco. He arrived with a long-term girlfriend, an artist who thrived on the city\u2019s spontaneity, but the relationship fractured under the weight of his structured nature. While she painted chaotic abstracts, he meticulously studied zoning maps. They separated amicably, and David poured his unspent emotional energy into his work, joining the City Planning Department as a junior planner.\n\nOver two decades, he ascended the bureaucratic ladder through sheer competence and an unparalleled understanding of municipal code. Now a Division Manager, David lives his work literally. His minimalist condo in Hayes Valley is a four-minute walk from his office in City Hall, rendering his commute nonexistent. His life is a routine of precision: morning espresso from the same cafe, long days navigating public feedback and developer proposals, and evenings spent reading historical planning documents.\n\nHis personal life is sparse; his closest connections are with a few fellow policy wonks and architects with whom he shares a drink and debates the merits of transit-oriented development. He is respected, but not intimately known. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t personal; it\u2019s civic. He hopes to see his division\u2019s long-term plan for a more climate-resilient and equitable waterfront come to fruition before he retires. He finds his deepest satisfaction not in human connection, but in the elegant logic of a well-planned city block, a lasting legacy of order carved into the beautiful, chaotic heart of San Francisco."
