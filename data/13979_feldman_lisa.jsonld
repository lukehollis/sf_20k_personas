The daughter of Filipino immigrants, she was raised in Daly City with the core values of family obligation and quiet diligence. Her parents worked tirelessly\u2014her father in a hotel kitchen, her mother as a home health aide\u2014to provide for Lisa and her brother. College was the goal they had for her, a path to a life easier than their own.\n\nThat path diverged when Lisa was eighteen. Just as she was preparing community college applications, her mother suffered a severe stroke. Without hesitation, Lisa deferred her education to become a primary caregiver and took a receptionist job at a local clinic to help with bills. It was a turning point that defined her: a sacrifice made not with resentment, but with a deep-seated sense of duty.\n\nShe found she had a knack for the structured compassion of healthcare administration. Over the years, she moved from receptionist to her current role as Patient Intake Coordinator at a community health center serving low-income families. Lisa is the calm, organizing force at the chaotic intersection of need and care.\n\nIn her late twenties, she married Mark Feldman, a kind, Jewish musician she met through a patient. They had a son, Alex, and shared fifteen years in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Outer Richmond. The marriage ended amicably; their paths simply grew too different. Now, Alex is in his second year at Sacramento State, a source of immense pride for Lisa.\n\nHer days follow a steady rhythm: a 6:30 AM alarm, a walk to the corner bakery for coffee, and the 6.5-mile commute on the N-Judah train, where she reads novels on her phone. Her San Francisco isn't the city of tech booms and tourist landmarks; it\u2019s the quiet hum of her neighborhood, the familiar faces on her bus route, and the satisfaction of helping someone navigate a confusing system. With her son grown, Lisa dreams of small, personal freedoms: a trip to see her relatives in the Philippines, learning how to throw pottery, and perhaps finding a quiet companionship to share city walks with."

Her mother, so strong and tireless, looked small and fragile, her hand limp in Lisa\u2019s. In that sterile, quiet room at age eighteen, a path forked. The life her parents wanted for her vanished and was replaced by a duty that felt more real than any dream. It wasn't a choice made with sadness, but with a sudden, steeling clarity. That moment forged a resilience she would carry forever.\n\n2.\nOne foggy Sunday when Alex was an infant, Lisa sat on their worn couch in the Outer Richmond apartment. The world outside was a soft, grey blur. Inside, Mark wasn't playing a complex jazz piece, but a simple, gentle lullaby on his guitar. The melody mingled with the sound of the heater and Alex\u2019s soft breathing. In that moment, she felt a profound sense of peace and rightness. This small, warm world they had built together felt like the most perfect, significant thing in the entire city.\n\n3.\nA few years ago, a young woman who spoke only Mam came into the clinic, frantic, clutching her sick child\u2019s confusing paperwork. The other staff were overwhelmed, but Lisa sat with her for an hour, patiently pointing to forms, using simple gestures, and projecting a calm she didn't always feel. When she finally found the right referral and the mother\u2019s eyes filled with tears of relief, Lisa felt a fierce, private pride. This was why she was here. This was her purpose, sharpened and made real.\n\n4.\nShe can still feel the rumbling floor of the N-Judah as it emerged from the tunnel into the sunlight at Duboce Park. Alex, then maybe seven years old, had his face pressed against the glass, utterly captivated by the city zipping past. His small hand was sweaty in hers. For those twenty minutes, she wasn't just a coordinator or a caregiver; she was a mother showing her son the magic of his city. The memory is suffused with a pure, uncomplicated joy that still warms her.\n\n5.\nThe first Saturday after Mark had moved out and Alex had left for Sacramento, the apartment was achingly quiet. She made coffee and walked to Ocean Beach, just to feel the wind. Staring at the vast, grey expanse of the Pacific, she didn\u2019t feel lonely, but hollowed-out in a clean, new way. It was the first time in over thirty years that no one immediately needed her. The feeling was terrifying, but it was also the first whisper of freedom, a quiet question of what came next."
