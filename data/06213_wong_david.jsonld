The son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small laundry in the Richmond District, David\u2019s upbringing was a study in diligence and expectation. His parents, having sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned him becoming a medical doctor\u2014a path of prestige and security.\n\nHe dutifully enrolled in pre-med at UC Berkeley, but a volunteer position at a free clinic in Oakland changed his trajectory forever. There, he didn't just see illness; he saw the systemic barriers\u2014language, poverty, and cultural misunderstandings\u2014that kept his community from getting well. He witnessed firsthand how a translator could be more critical than a prescription. This revelation was his turning point. He abandoned the M.D. track and instead pursued a Master of Public Health, convinced he could make a greater impact by building bridges rather than just treating symptoms.\n\nHe started at his current clinic over two decades ago as a bilingual health educator, his fluency in Cantonese making him an invaluable and trusted resource for the neighborhood's elderly residents. He rose through the ranks, his quiet competence and deep empathy earning him the director role. His professional dedication is deeply intertwined with his personal life; his late wife, Elena, was a social worker he met at a community coalition meeting. They shared a vision for a more equitable San Francisco. Since her passing from cancer ten years ago, David\u2019s work has become a way to honor her memory, a continuation of their shared mission.\n\nToday, his life is one of purposeful routine. Mornings start with a walk through the neighborhood, greeting shop owners and the seniors doing tai chi in Portsmouth Square. His days are a blur of grant writing, managing staff, and occasionally stepping in to translate for a frightened patient. His dream isn't for personal glory, but to secure enough funding to finally open a low-cost dental wing at the clinic. David Wong seeks no spotlight; his fulfillment comes from the quiet, steady work of caring for the city that raised him, one person at a time."
