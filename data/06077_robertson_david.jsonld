Raised in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of Orange County, his youth was a landscape of identical tract homes and strip malls, a place where community was defined by the length of a driveway. This beige uniformity sparked in him a fascination with the opposite: the dense, chaotic, and vibrant life of cities. He found his calling at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Master's in Urban Planning, where academic theory finally gave a name to his innate desire for walkable, human-scaled environments.\n\nHe began his career with the San Francisco Planning Department in the late 1990s, just as the first dot-com boom was convulsing the city. It was a trial by fire. David\u2019s idealism about community-led design clashed with the relentless pace of development and speculation. He learned hard lessons in public forums and backroom meetings about the immense political and economic forces that truly shape a city\u2019s skyline. A marriage in his thirties dissolved under the weight of his all-consuming work, a personal casualty of his public service. This period tempered him, leaving him less of an idealist and more of a pragmatist, a man who understood that progress was measured in inches, not miles.\n\nNow 50, David lives his principles. His apartment in Hayes Valley is a deliberately chosen base for a life lived on foot, a short walk from his office near City Hall. His 0.0-mile commute is a daily affirmation of his life's work. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe, followed by days spent poring over blueprints, negotiating zoning variances, and attending public hearings. He is a familiar face in his neighborhood, known for his thoughtful presence at the farmers' market and his quiet patronage of local bookstores.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambitions are no longer for personal advancement but for legacy. He dreams of seeing key projects through to completion: a new public park in a neglected neighborhood, a thoughtfully designed affordable housing complex, a permanent \"slow street\" that prioritizes people over cars. His love for San Francisco is a complex, enduring relationship\u2014a mix of deep affection, profound frustration, and an unwavering commitment to leaving the city just a little more livable than he found it."
