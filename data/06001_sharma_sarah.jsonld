The daughter of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised in a home filled with the scent of spices and the weight of expectation. Her father, a successful software engineer, envisioned a similar path for her in tech or medicine\u2014stable, prestigious, and lucrative. Her mother, a community cornerstone, instilled in her a deep sense of social duty. Sarah internalized both lessons, but chose to apply them in a way her parents initially struggled to understand.\n\nThe pivotal moment came during her undergraduate years at UC Davis. She watched her own grandmother, a proud woman fluent in Punjabi but hesitant in English, struggle to navigate the impersonal American healthcare system. The frustration and fear she witnessed in her grandmother's eyes ignited a fire in her. Instead of pursuing an M.D. to treat individuals, Sarah enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Public Health to treat systems.\n\nNow 42, Sarah is the Program Manager for Community Health Initiatives at a major Bay Area healthcare provider. From her light-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset, she designs and oversees programs that connect underserved populations\u2014the elderly, new immigrants, low-income families\u2014with the resources they need. Her work-from-home routine is disciplined: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, hours of Zoom calls with community partners and data analysis, and evenings often spent volunteering at a local clinic or unwinding with a pottery class.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is profound. She loves the city\u2019s progressive ideals and its proximity to wild nature. Living in the Inner Sunset allows her to feel part of a true neighborhood, swapping greetings with the owners of her local coffee shop and grocer. Though single, her life is rich with a close-knit circle of friends from grad school and former jobs. Her dream is to see one of her pilot programs\u2014a multilingual health navigator service\u2014adopted as a national model. For Sarah, success isn\u2019t measured by stock options, but by the tangible well-being of the community she calls home."
