Raised in the quiet, sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, he was a reserved child who felt more at home with a sketchpad than with playground chatter. His parents, a well-meaning but emotionally distant pair, saw his art as a simple hobby, never grasping that it was his primary way of processing the world. Seeking a place where his introspective nature might be understood, Julian moved to San Francisco in the late 1980s to study psychology at San Francisco State University.\n\nThe city embraced him, but it also delivered his life\u2019s most profound turning point. As a young man in his early twenties, Julian watched the AIDS crisis devastate the community he had just found. He lost friends, and then his first serious partner, to the disease. The experience was a crucible, forging his academic interest in psychology into a passionate, urgent calling. He realized that for so many, grief was too immense for words alone. This led him to art therapy, a path where he could help others use color, shape, and form to navigate their trauma.\n\nNow 52, Julian has built a life of quiet purpose. He lives in a cozy, fog-kissed apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood whose peaceful residential feel he cherishes. His daily routine begins with a walk with his scruffy terrier, Buster, in Golden Gate Park, followed by a 4.8-mile commute on the N Judah line to a non-profit agency in SoMa. There, he works with a range of clients, from children in troubled homes to elderly individuals grappling with memory loss, helping them find their voices on canvas and in clay.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight circle of friends, many of whom he\u2019s known for decades\u2014survivors like himself who have weathered the city\u2019s many changes. Though his $95,000 income requires careful budgeting in San Francisco, it affords him a stable, meaningful existence. Julian\u2019s dream is no longer grand; it\u2019s to continue his work, mentor a new generation of therapists, and perhaps, one day, have a small gallery show of his own pottery. San Francisco is more than his home; it\u2019s the landscape of his entire adult life, a place of both profound loss and enduring community."

For the first time, he wasn't the quiet boy in the corner; he was just one person in a joyful, swirling constellation of humanity. Nobody needed him to speak. His shy smile was enough. That dizzying, profound relief was the moment the city claimed him. It cemented his decision to stay, assuring him that he had finally found a place where his quiet nature wasn't a flaw, but simply a fact.\n\n2.\nThe memory that never fades is sitting by his partner David\u2019s hospital bed at SF General in 1992. The only sound was the rhythmic beeping of machines. Every word felt useless, hollow. So Julian did the only thing he could: he sketched the tired line of David\u2019s profile on a napkin, trying to memorize him before he was gone. That silent, shattering helplessness broke his youthful idealism and forged his life\u2019s mission: to help others find a language for grief when words fail.\n\n3.\nIt was 1996, and a young client, a girl who hadn\u2019t spoken since a house fire, finally picked up a piece of charcoal. She didn\u2019t draw the flames; she drew a tiny, perfect birdcage with the door wide open. In that one stark image, Julian felt her entire story of loss and hope. The moment was a quiet thunderclap. It proved his theory wasn't just academic\u2014it was a tangible key. This work was his purpose, a way to honor the past by helping others illustrate their futures.\n\n4.\nJust last week, walking Buster near Stow Lake as the thick fog rolled in, blanketing the cypress trees in white. The world shrank to just the damp smell of eucalyptus and the happy jingle of his dog\u2019s tags. There was no grand epiphany, just a deep, settled peace in the quiet. He stopped and watched the mist, feeling the weight of his 52 years not as a burden, but as ballast. This was the contentment he had worked for: simple, present, and profoundly his own.\n\n5.\nHe recalls a dinner a few years back at his friend Elena\u2019s place in the Mission. There were only four of them at the table, the surviving members of a once-boisterous circle of friends. They were laughing about the N Judah breaking down, and in that easy, familiar moment, an entire history of shared loss and survival hung unspoken in the air. That effortless camaraderie, the unspoken understanding between them, has been his most vital anchor. It\u2019s the community that makes San Francisco home."
