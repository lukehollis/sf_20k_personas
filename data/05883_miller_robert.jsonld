He was born in the Richmond District to first-generation Chinese immigrants, Mei and Lin, who ran a small, perpetually steamy laundromat on Clement Street. His childhood was a mix of the sharp scent of detergent, the drone of Cantonese radio, and the unspoken weight of his parents\u2019 expectations. They envisioned a prestigious, stable future for their only son\u2014a doctor or an engineer, a path paved with financial security they never had.\n\nRobert dutifully enrolled in pre-med at UC Berkeley, but the soulless grind of organic chemistry felt alienating. A volunteer stint at a free clinic in Oakland became his turning point. There, listening to the complex, often heartbreaking stories of patients, he found his calling not in curing bodies, but in mending the unseen wounds of trauma, poverty, and isolation. Announcing his decision to pursue a Master of Social Work was a quiet devastation for his parents, a rift that took years to heal.\n\nHis career as a Clinical Social Worker led him deep into the city's healthcare system, specializing in geriatric and palliative care. He has spent decades navigating the delicate spaces between life and death, helping families face their most difficult moments. The work is emotionally taxing, but it provides a profound sense of purpose that a sterile lab never could.\n\nTen years ago, a critical bout of burnout led him to reshape his life. He transitioned his practice entirely to telehealth, allowing him to work from the quiet sanctuary of his Cole Valley apartment, which he shares with his partner of fifteen years, David, a landscape architect. His 0.0-mile commute has transformed his daily routine. Mornings now begin with a foggy walk through the Panhandle, coffee from the corner caf\u00e9, and time to decompress between virtual patient sessions.\n\nNow, Robert feels a deep, settled connection to his neighborhood. He is a quiet observer of the city\u2019s constant evolution, from the Richmond of his youth to the gentrified enclave he now inhabits. His hopes are no longer grand; he dreams of mentoring new social workers, traveling with David, and finding a sustainable peace in the life he carefully, and defiantly, built for himself."
