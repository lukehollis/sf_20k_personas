Born to a Black father from Oakland and a Filipina mother from Daly City, he grew up in San Francisco\u2019s Excelsior district, a neighborhood rich in culture but short on opportunity. He navigated his dual heritage with a quiet grace, never feeling he fully belonged to either side, a sentiment that led him to check \"None\" on forms asking for his race. His family background was grounded in love and hard work, but also the constant financial pressure familiar to many in the city.\n\nHis educational journey was practical, not prestigious. After graduating from Balboa High School, the abstract idea of a four-year university felt inaccessible. The trajectory of his life shifted not in a classroom, but at his grandmother\u2019s bedside. When she fell ill, Marcus became her primary caregiver, discovering a deep well of patience and empathy within himself. This was his calling. After she passed, he completed a Home Health Aide (HHA) certification, turning familial duty into a profession.\n\nThis path led him to his current role, the reason for his 0.0-mile commute. He is a live-in caregiver for Arthur, an elderly, sharp-witted former architect with mobility issues, in a spacious but lonely house in the Inner Richmond. Marcus\u2019s days are a structured routine of medication schedules, meal preparation, physical assistance, and companionship. His world is largely contained within the home's walls, a quiet existence starkly contrasting with the city's hustle.\n\nHis social connections are maintained through texts and rare days off, where he meets old friends for pho on Clement Street or a walk through Golden Gate Park. His primary relationship is with Arthur, a bond that has evolved from employer-employee to a complex, intergenerational friendship built on shared stories and mutual dependence.\n\nMarcus dreams not of wealth, but of autonomy. He meticulously saves what he can, aspiring to one day have his own small apartment in the Sunset. His ultimate goal is to enroll in a nursing program at CCSF, leveraging his hands-on experience into a stable career. He is a native son of San Francisco who experiences the city from the inside out, a quiet observer whose profound contribution to another's life remains largely invisible to the world outside Arthur\u2019s front door."
