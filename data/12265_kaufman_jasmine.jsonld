Born in the foggy Sunset District to a Shanghainese immigrant mother, a compassionate nurse, and a second-generation Jewish-American father, a detail-oriented architect, her upbringing was a blend of meticulous planning and heartfelt empathy. This dual perspective shaped her worldview from an early age, fostering a deep sense of responsibility for the well-being of her community.\n\nThe true turning point in her life came during her teenage years when her younger brother battled severe anxiety. Jasmine witnessed firsthand the frustrating gaps in the school system\u2019s mental health support, a bureaucratic maze that offered more paperwork than genuine care. This experience ignited a fire within her, transforming a vague desire to \"help\" into a focused mission. She pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Davis before earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, determined to dismantle the very systems that had failed her family.\n\nJasmine began her career as a school social worker, but her ambition and frustration with systemic flaws quickly propelled her into management. Now, as a Senior Mental Health Program Manager, she develops and oversees programs that impact thousands of students across the city. Her days are a whirlwind of grant proposals, staff management, and crisis intervention, a high-stakes balancing act she navigates with practiced calm.\n\nCurrently living in a rent-controlled apartment in NOPA, her life is one of structured routine. Her mornings begin with a run in the Panhandle, clearing her head before the demanding day. The 3.8-mile MUNI ride on the 5-Fulton is her time for podcasts on policy and social justice. Though a long-term relationship recently ended, partly due to the emotional toll of her work, she is sustained by a tight-knit circle of friends. Jasmine finds solace in the city\u2019s quiet corners\u2014the Botanical Garden, the rugged coastline at Lands End. Her ultimate dream is to establish a truly integrated, preventative mental health curriculum for the entire school district, ensuring no other family feels as lost as hers once did."

The school counselor slid a stack of forms across the table toward her parents, her brother staring at his own shoes, his shoulders hunched. Jasmine remembers the sheer uselessness of the paper, a bureaucratic dam against a flood of panic. A cold, quiet rage began to build in her chest\u2014not at a person, but at the brokenness of the system itself. That was the moment a vague wish to help others solidified into a precise, unshakeable mission.\n\n2.\nChildhood Sundays in the Sunset smelled of ginger and chives. Her mother would be at the kitchen table, fingers flying as she folded wontons, each a perfect parcel of care. Her father, an architect to his core, would have a napkin sketch of their \"assembly line\" for maximum efficiency. Watching them, Jasmine absorbed their dual languages of love: her mother\u2019s boundless empathy and her father\u2019s belief that a better world could be designed. It taught her that compassion required a blueprint to be truly effective.\n\n3.\nIt was her third year as a school social worker. She had fought for weeks to get a shy, artistic seventh-grader named Leo into a specialized therapy program, finally securing a spot. A month later, she learned his referral was lost in an inter-departmental black hole; the spot was gone. The feeling of utter powerlessness was suffocating. She realized then that she couldn't just guide children through a broken system. She had to get inside the machine and fix the gears herself, no matter the cost.\n\n4.\nHe had cooked her favorite meal, but her phone buzzed incessantly with a crisis involving a student\u2019s housing. She barely heard him talking. Finally, he put his fork down and said, \"You're saving everyone, Jaz, but you're not here.\" There was no anger in his voice, only a deep, bottomless sadness. In that quiet moment in their NOPA apartment, she felt the true weight of her work\u2014a necessary sacrifice that had carved out a hollow space where their shared future was supposed to be.\n\n5.\nAfter a brutal week of budget cuts, she drove to Lands End. The wind was relentless, whipping fog across the cypress trees. Staring at the massive, indifferent churn of the Pacific, the city's problems felt both immense and manageable. She wasn\u2019t fighting the ocean, she realized, she was building a lighthouse. This rugged edge of the city became her sanctuary, a place where the scale of nature didn't diminish her work but gave her the perspective and strength to continue it."
