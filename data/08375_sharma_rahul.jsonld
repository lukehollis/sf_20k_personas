Born in Delhi to an engineer father and a teacher mother, his upbringing was one of pragmatism and high expectations. While Rahul secretly harbored a love for history and the sprawling narratives of ancient empires, he followed the practical path laid out for him. He dutifully earned his undergraduate degree in economics before moving to the United States for an MBA in the late 1990s, arriving just in time to witness the tail-end of the dot-com exuberance and its spectacular collapse.\n\nThat market crash was his true education. It solidified his inherent caution and shaped his career as a financial analyst. He rose steadily, his calm demeanor and meticulous risk assessment making him invaluable. He married, moved to a spacious home in Marin, and had a daughter, Anjali. For two decades, he lived the successful immigrant\u2019s dream. But the long commute and suburban quiet felt like a costume he could never quite get comfortable in. The life, like his marriage, was well-structured but lacked a deeper connection.\n\nThe turning point was his amicable but definitive divorce five years ago. Shedding his suburban life, Rahul moved into a sleek high-rise in Rincon Hill. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice for simplicity; his office is a dedicated corner of his condominium overlooking the Bay Bridge. His days are disciplined: up before dawn to track European markets, a flurry of analysis and calls through the afternoon, and then, silence.\n\nIn that silence, Rahul connects with San Francisco. He\u2019s not a nightlife person; his social circle is a small group of industry colleagues. Instead, he walks for hours along the Embarcadero, tracing the old piers and imagining the city\u2019s past lives\u2014the Gold Rush, the Barbary Coast, the rebuilding after 1906. His current life is solitary but not lonely. He has polite, slightly distant weekly calls with Anjali, now at UCLA. His greatest hope is to bridge that distance before she graduates. His secret dream is to finally merge his passion and profession: to write a detailed book, not on market futures, but on the economic history of San Francisco, the city he observes so intensely from his quiet, orderly perch in the sky."
