His immigrant parents from Hong Kong ran a small, beloved Cantonese restaurant, a place where David did his homework at a corner table and learned to wrap wontons before he could properly ride a bike. He was the dutiful son, but he harbored dreams of a different life, one filled with color palettes and fonts.\n\nHis escape was a graphic design program at SF State, a world away from the clatter of the kitchen. But two years in, a sharp turning point altered his path: his father\u2019s health failed, and the family business needed him. David dropped out, trading his design software for inventory ledgers, believing it was a temporary sacrifice. It wasn\u2019t. The family eventually sold the restaurant, but by then, hospitality was in his blood. He had a knack for managing chaos and an empathy for both staff and customers.\n\nNow 44, David manages a chic, bustling Californian-Asian fusion restaurant in Hayes Valley. His commute is a single flight of stairs; he lives in the small apartment above the business, a world where his personal and professional lives are completely merged. His days are a disciplined rhythm of inventory checks, staff meetings, and orchestrating the nightly ballet of dinner service. A past engagement crumbled under the weight of 80-hour work weeks, and his social life now consists of shared drinks with his chefs after closing and the familiar faces of his regulars.\n\nThough successful, David feels a quiet sense of being adrift. He is a steward of someone else\u2019s dream. His own hope has reshaped itself over the years. He no longer thinks of graphic design, but of a small, 10-table wine bar of his own, perhaps in the Outer Sunset, a return to his roots but on his own terms. He is the consummate host, a man who lives and breathes the city's hospitality, forever measuring his life in service tickets and the satisfied murmurs of a full dining room."
