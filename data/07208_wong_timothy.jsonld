The only child of immigrants, he grew up in the Sunset District to the rhythmic hum of washing machines in his parents\u2019 laundromat. They spoke of survival and security, instilling in him a profound work ethic and a quiet pressure to achieve a life beyond their own manual labor. His escape was literature; he devoured novels, finding worlds in words. He followed this passion to UC Berkeley, earning a BA in English Literature, a choice his parents quietly questioned but supported.\n\nThe pragmatic weight of their sacrifice, however, steered his next step. He pivoted from prose to precedent, earning a Juris Doctor from UC Hastings. After a brief, soul-crushing stint at a massive corporate firm, Timothy found his calling. A turning point came when he took on a pro-bono case for a Mission District muralist whose work was stolen for a major ad campaign. Winning the case felt more rewarding than any multi-million-dollar merger. He left the corporate world and, with two like-minded colleagues, founded a boutique law firm specializing in intellectual property and art law.\n\nToday, at 47, Timothy lives a seamlessly integrated life in a sleek Hayes Valley loft, his office occupying a light-filled corner of his home, hence the zero-mile commute. His days begin with a run through the Panhandle and end with either a quiet evening with a book or dinner with his close-knit circle of friends\u2014artists, chefs, and tech founders. Though single after a long-term relationship ended amicably years ago, his life is full, connected to the city\u2019s creative pulse. He regularly visits his now-retired parents in the Sunset, his success their ultimate peace of mind.\n\nHis aspiration is no longer about climbing a ladder, but building a legacy. He dreams of establishing a foundation to provide legal services and grants for emerging Bay Area artists, protecting the very culture that makes his city unique. For Timothy, it\u2019s the perfect synthesis of his parents\u2019 pragmatism and his own enduring love for the arts."
