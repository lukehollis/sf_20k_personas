Raised in Sacramento by a mechanic father and a bookkeeper mother, Todd inherited a unique blend of practical skill and meticulous detail. He spent his youth sketching in notebooks while helping his dad rebuild engines, a duality that defined his path. Drawn to the vibrant, rebellious art scene of the 1990s, he moved to San Francisco at 21 and never looked back.\n\nHe enrolled at City College of San Francisco, pursuing a Fine Art associate's degree. While he loved the theory, he felt more at home in the woodshop than in front of a blank canvas. A turning point came during an internship at a small SoMa gallery where he was asked to help install a complex sculpture. The challenge of problem-solving\u2014calculating weight loads, building custom mounts, and perfectly lighting the piece\u2014was a revelation. He found his true calling not in creating the art itself, but in giving it a physical home.\n\nThis discovery launched his career. Todd worked his way up from a freelance art handler to positions at several galleries before landing his current role as Head Preparator for a major museum. He is the respected, unflappable anchor of the exhibitions team, the one who ensures a priceless masterpiece is hung securely and safely.\n\nToday, Todd lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Lower Haight. His daily routine is a ritual: a strong coffee from a local cafe, followed by a 2.8-mile bike commute, a path he knows by every pothole and mural. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of fellow art-world lifers\u2014curators, technicians, and struggling artists\u2014who meet for beers at a beloved dive bar. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, largely because his partner wanted to leave the expensive, demanding city, but Todd couldn't imagine being anywhere else. San Francisco is woven into his identity. His dream isn't fame or fortune, but the quiet satisfaction of his craft and, maybe one day, owning a small condo. He hopes to mentor the next generation of preparators, passing on the knowledge held in his capable, steady hands."

But for Todd, everything went quiet. He saw the physics, the balance points, the solution. As he custom-built the mount and hoisted the piece into place, he felt a click of rightness far more profound than any brushstroke. It was the mid-90s, and he\u2019d just discovered his hands weren\u2019t for making art, but for giving it a home.\n\n2.\nThe memory of his first year in the city is less a picture and more a feeling, thick with the smell of wheatpaste and damp Mission fog. It was 1996. He was out at 2 a.m. with a crew of artists, slapping a massive, screen-printed poster onto a corrugated wall off Clarion Alley. The thrill wasn't just in the illicit act, but in the communal creation\u2014claiming a small piece of the city's skin as their own. In that moment, he wasn't just visiting; he was helping write the city's story.\n\n3.\nThe conversation five years ago was quiet, held over a cold dinner in their Lower Haight apartment. She laid out a future of affordable mortgages and backyards in Portland. He looked out the window at the 7-Haight bus sighing past, the neon glow of the corner store painting their floor. A wave of profound, painful clarity washed over him. He could lose her, but he couldn't lose this. The choice to stay was the truest, hardest thing he had ever done, cementing his identity into the city's very pavement.\n\n4.\nIt was the night before the big retrospective opened, the museum halls empty and silent. All that mattered was the final, massive canvas, a sea of deep, fragile blue. His team looked to him. With a calm he didn't entirely feel, he guided the piece to the wall, his hands steady as he secured the cleat. Stepping back, he saw it was perfect\u2014level, secure, breathing. The director gave him a single, knowing nod. In that silent exchange, Todd felt the immense, quiet pride of a guardian, a keeper of sacred things.\n\n5.\nJust last week, biking home up the Wiggle, he saw it. A new mural had bloomed overnight on the wall of the laundromat, a riot of orange and purple poppies. He coasted to a stop, his daily 2.8-mile commute momentarily paused. He didn't know the artist, but he knew the impulse. This constant, chaotic, beautiful reinvention of surfaces was the city\u2019s heartbeat. A small smile touched his lips. This daily discovery was his quiet covenant with San Francisco, a place he\u2019d never dream of leaving."
