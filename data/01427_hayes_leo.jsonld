Born to an itinerant academic father and a free-spirited painter mother, his childhood was a collage of temporary homes in Berkeley, Berlin, and Kyoto. This constant motion left him with a fluid sense of identity and a keen eye for the details others missed, but without a place to call his own. The world was a filmstrip flickering past his window.\n\nHe never pursued formal education after high school, finding classrooms stifling. Instead, his education came from the revival cinemas of whatever city he was in and a used Super 8 camera gifted by his uncle. He taught himself to frame a shot, to tell a story without words. When digital editing software became accessible in the late '90s, he locked himself away, mastering the craft through sheer obsession. This became his trade: a freelance editor piecing together corporate videos and wedding montages to fund his true passion.\n\nHis turning point came at 32. After drifting to San Francisco, drawn by its cinematic light and layered history, he created a short, poignant documentary about the last days of a legacy business in the Mission. It was accepted into a small local film festival. The quiet applause in the darkened theater was the most profound validation he had ever experienced. It was then he knew this was his life's work.\n\nNow 44, Leo lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a maze of books, hard drives, and storyboards. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bed to his editing suite. His days are a disciplined cycle: coffee from a local cafe, client work until midafternoon, and long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. Evenings and weekends are devoted to his personal projects. His social life is small but meaningful, centered around his pragmatic partner, Clara, a graphic designer, and a handful of fellow artists.\n\nLeo\u2019s goal isn\u2019t fame, but permanence. He is currently two years into a feature-length documentary about the city's foghorn operators\u2014a lonely, poetic sound he feels is the true soul of San Francisco. He dreams of creating one definitive work that captures the city\u2019s ephemeral beauty, a piece of art that says, \"I was here. I was watching.\""
