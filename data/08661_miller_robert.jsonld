Born in the Excelsior District to a Filipino mother who infused their home with the scent of adobo and an Irish-American father who worked the dry docks, Robert grew up between cultures. He was a quiet, observant boy, more interested in taking apart the family toaster than in excelling at school. After a few aimless years post-graduation doing odd jobs, a recession scare in the early \u201890s pushed him toward City College. He earned an Associate's degree in Building Maintenance Technology, finding a sense of purpose in the logic of systems and the satisfaction of a clean repair.\n\nHis career was a steady, upward climb from apprentice handyman to maintenance chief. The key turning point came not in his profession, but in his personal life. He met his wife, Elena, a fiery and compassionate nurse, at a neighborhood potluck. They built a simple, happy life and had a daughter, Sofia. Elena\u2019s sudden death from cancer when Sofia was a teenager cleaved Robert\u2019s world in two. Grief hardened him, but his responsibility to his daughter anchored him.\n\nSeeking stability, he took the live-in Facilities Manager position at The Crestview, a stately pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. The job came with a small but comfortable apartment, eliminating his commute and providing a safe, if gilded, cage for him and Sofia. For the past twelve years, his world has been contained within these ornate walls. His daily routine is a circuit of inspections, vendor calls, and placating wealthy residents. He knows the building\u2019s secrets\u2014the ghost drafts, the temperamental plumbing, the quiet dramas played out behind mahogany doors.\n\nNow 54, with Sofia finishing her nursing degree at SF State, Robert\u2019s aspirations have downsized to a quiet contentment. He maintains a friendly but professional distance from the building\u2019s residents, sharing his evenings with a well-worn novel or a call with his daughter. His dream is no longer about climbing a ladder, but about one day buying a small plot of land in Petaluma where he can finally build a workshop of his own, a place where the only systems he has to manage are his."
