The son of an Iranian engineer who fled pre-revolution turmoil and a practical, second-generation Irish-American mother, David grew up in Daly City. His upbringing was a gentle blend of cultures, defined more by his father's emphasis on stability and his mother's nurturing presence than any specific tradition. He was an observant, thoughtful kid who never felt the pull toward a high-powered career.\n\nAfter high school, David drifted. He worked at a bookstore and a caf\u00e9, absorbing the city's energy without a clear path forward. The turning point came unexpectedly when he was 24. A close friend was in a serious bike accident, and David spent days in the hospital, witnessing the calm, competent care of the nursing staff. In that sterile, anxious environment, he found his calling. He enrolled in the nursing program at City College of San Francisco, drawn to a profession that was tangible, necessary, and focused on direct human impact.\n\nHe began his career on a busy medical-surgical floor, but found the relentless pace draining. He craved connection over chaos. A decade into his career, he found the perfect fit: a position as the sole Registered Nurse for a large public high school in the Mission District. For the past sixteen years, he has been the steady, unflappable presence in a small office, treating everything from scraped knees and anxiety attacks to serious adolescent health crises. He is a confidant, a first responder, and a vital part of the school's ecosystem.\n\nNow 48 and divorced amicably for nearly a decade, David lives a life of comfortable routine in the Inner Sunset. His 5.5-mile commute on the N-Judah MUNI is a daily ritual of reading and people-watching. Evenings are for walks in Golden Gate Park, cooking simple meals, and connecting with a small circle of close friends. He doesn\u2019t dream of reinvention, but of deepening what he has. He hopes to one day visit Iran to see his father\u2019s homeland and quietly fantasizes about retiring to open a small bookstore near the ocean, a final chapter dedicated to the quiet pursuits that have always brought him peace."
