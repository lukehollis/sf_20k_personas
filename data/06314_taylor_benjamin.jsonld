Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a pragmatic engineer father and a librarian mother, he grew up with a deep appreciation for both structure and story. This duality led him to pursue a Master's degree in Industrial Design, where he learned to shape physical objects with purpose and beauty. His early career was spent designing ergonomic office furniture, a respectable but creatively unfulfilling path.\n\nThe key turning point came in his late twenties. Watching the nascent digital world reshape society, Ben saw the future wasn't in chairs, but in the interfaces people held in their hands. He taught himself coding fundamentals and leveraged his design thinking to pivot into technology, landing his first role as a junior Product Manager in the Bay Area. It was a calculated risk that paid off, launching a successful career building and refining software products for a series of well-known tech firms.\n\nNow 43, Ben is a seasoned professional who works entirely from his meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute defines his life. Mornings begin not with a drive, but with a short walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by hours of focused work managing development sprints and strategy documents via video calls. He is a quiet architect of the digital world, coordinating teams spread across time zones from his standing desk.\n\nHis social life has simplified over the years, shrinking to a tight-knit circle after a long-term relationship ended amicably five years ago, a casualty of divergent life goals. He maintains connections with a few old colleagues and a friend from his design school days. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; he knows the baristas, the grocers, and the best benches in Patricia's Green.\n\nLately, a familiar longing has surfaced. Ben\u2019s dreams are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder but about reconnecting with the physical world. He recently cleared out a corner of his spare room, not for a new monitor, but for a workbench. His aspiration is to spend his weekends crafting things from wood\u2014small, imperfect, tangible objects that he can hold, a grounding contrast to the ethereal, pixel-perfect products that fill his professional life."
