The daughter of a practical accountant and a high school librarian, she spent her youth watching beloved green spaces get paved over for strip malls. A pivotal moment came at age 16 when her favorite patch of woods was bulldozed for a parking lot, an event that ignited a quiet but fierce resolve to build better, more human-centric spaces.\n\nThis drove her educational journey. After completing her undergraduate degree in sociology, she moved to the Bay Area to pursue a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. She fell hard for San Francisco\u2019s dense, chaotic, and beautiful urban fabric\u2014a complex puzzle she was desperate to help solve. Upon graduating, she secured an entry-level position with the San Francisco Planning Department, beginning a steady, two-decade climb to her current role as Senior City Planner.\n\nHer career became her identity, a demanding passion that ultimately contributed to the amicable end of her eight-year marriage a few years ago. Her ex-husband, a tech entrepreneur, never quite understood her obsession with zoning minutiae and late-night community outreach meetings. Now, at 42, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply woven into the city she serves. She lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, a stone's throw from City Hall, making her commute negligible on the days she goes into the office.\n\nHer daily routine is a testament to her beliefs: she starts with coffee from a local cafe, walks everywhere, and knows her neighbors by name. Her social circle is tight-knit, composed of fellow civil servants, architects, and old friends from her book club. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of legacy. She aspires to be the driving force behind a landmark affordable housing project or a transformative public park. She pours over blueprints and policy documents, seeing not just lines on a page, but the future of a more equitable and livable San Francisco she is dedicating her life to building."

She watched the bulldozer tear into the woods behind her house, its steel jaws ripping out the saplings she\u2019d known her whole life. It wasn't just trees; it was a promise being broken. In that moment of helpless rage, watching her green space become a flat, gray void for a parking lot, a cold, hard purpose settled in her heart. She wouldn\u2019t just mourn\u2014she would build.\n\n2.\nHer first week at Berkeley, around age 22, she took BART into the city alone. Emerging at 24th and Mission, she was hit by a wall of life: the cumbia music blasting from a storefront, the smell of grilling bacon-wrapped hot dogs, the jostle of a hundred conversations in Spanish and English. It wasn't the neat, quiet suburbia she fled. It was messy, human, and vibrant. A deep, profound sense of belonging washed over her. This chaotic, beautiful puzzle wasn't intimidating; it felt like coming home.\n\n3.\nIt was a late-night community meeting in the Tenderloin, maybe ten years into her career. An elderly woman, a lifelong resident, spoke with quiet fury about feeling invisible. After the meeting, Sarah didn\u2019t leave. She found the woman and simply listened for an hour, promising nothing but her attention. A month later, Sarah successfully advocated for adding two more benches and better lighting on the woman's block. It was a tiny, bureaucratic win, but it taught her that her true work happened not in City Hall, but on the sidewalk.\n\n4.\nShe was 39, standing in their immaculate kitchen as her husband celebrated a massive round of funding for his new app. He talked excitedly of disruption and scaling, of changing the world from a screen. She had just spent her entire day in a fight over adding a single protected bike lane on a dangerous street. Looking at his face, she realized they were building two completely different worlds, and hers would never scale. The love was still there, but the shared language, the fundamental \u201cwhy,\u201d was gone forever.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, walking home, she cut through the recently opened Helen Diller Civic Center Playgrounds. She\u2019d spent three years on the backend of that project, buried in permits and zoning variances. Now, she watched a swarm of kids shrieking with joy on the coiled climbing structure she\u2019d only ever seen on a blueprint. A father pushed his daughter on a swing. It was the physical manifestation of all her paperwork and late nights\u2014pure, unadulterated public joy. It was the legacy, happening right now."
