The daughter of a seamstress from Guangzhou and a third-generation Irish-American longshoreman, she was raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the boisterous stories of the docks from her father, teaching her early on how to navigate different worlds with a warm, disarming smile.\n\nForgoing college, Mei threw herself into the city\u2019s service industry, waitressing in North Beach and working retail in Union Square. These jobs honed her innate ability to read people, to understand their unspoken wants and anxieties. The true turning point came during the 2008 financial crisis. Watching neighbors lose their homes, she saw an opportunity not for predation, but for advocacy. She studied relentlessly, earned her real estate license, and started as an assistant at a small brokerage. Her grit and unparalleled knowledge of the city\u2019s micro-neighborhoods propelled her forward. She never forgot the feeling of housing insecurity and now channels that empathy into her work.\n\nNow 44, Mei is a top agent. A brief, amicable marriage in her late twenties taught her the value of self-sufficiency, a lesson she took to heart. Her life is her career. Mornings start with a black coffee and a review of new listings from her tidy Noe Valley condo. Her 3.5-mile commute in her hybrid SUV is a short, purposeful trip to her office near the Castro. Days are a blur of calls, client meetings, and open houses where she masterfully translates market data into a family\u2019s dream.\n\nHer social circle is small but loyal, consisting of a few old friends and former clients who were won over by her honesty. Mei\u2019s deepest connection remains with San Francisco itself. She\u2019s seen it boom, bust, and reinvent itself. Her dream isn't to own a grander home, but to one day open her own firm\u2014Sullivan Properties\u2014built on the principle of placing people before profit. It\u2019s her way of giving back to the city that has given her everything."

Her father walked in, smelling of saltwater and the longshoreman\u2019s union hall, his booming voice filling the small space. Her mother met him with a quiet smile, handing him a steaming mug of oolong tea. In that moment, the brash Irish docks and the gentle cadence of Guangzhou existed in perfect harmony. It was her first, truest definition of home: a place where different worlds found balance.\n\n2.\nIn her early twenties, waitressing in North Beach, she served an elderly man who came in daily, always gruff and alone. One rainy Tuesday, she noticed his worn copy of Saroyan and mentioned she loved the author's descriptions of the city. He looked up, his eyes clearing, and for the first time, he smiled and shared a story. She felt a profound click of connection, realizing her real talent wasn't carrying plates, but seeing the person behind the facade. It was a currency more valuable than tips.\n\n3.\nThe memory that changed everything is from 2009. It wasn\u2019t just a news story; it was the bright red \u2018Bank Owned\u2019 sign staked into the lawn of the Delgados\u2019 house down the street. She saw Mrs. Delgado quietly weeping as she loaded a box into her car, trying to hide her face from the kids. A cold, clarifying anger washed over Mei. She wasn't just witnessing a financial crisis; she was witnessing a crisis of empathy. That day, she enrolled in her first real estate course, armed with purpose.\n\n4.\nHer first solo closing wasn\u2019t a mansion; it was a tiny starter condo in the Excelsior for a young couple who reminded her of her parents. When she handed them the keys, the wife was crying with relief and the husband just kept saying, \u201cIt\u2019s ours.\u201d The commission was small, but the feeling\u2014a powerful, resonant sense of righting a small wrong in the world\u2014was immeasurable. It confirmed her mission: this job wasn't about property, it was about providing sanctuary. This was why she was doing it.\n\n5.\nThe night her divorce was final, she sat alone on the floor of her empty Noe Valley condo. She had expected sadness, but instead, a quiet strength settled in. She opened a bottle of wine, looked out the window at the twinkling city lights, and felt a profound sense of ownership. This space, this life, was entirely hers. It taught her that self-sufficiency wasn't a consolation prize but a foundation. It\u2019s a peace she now helps every client find, whether they\u2019re alone or with a partner."
