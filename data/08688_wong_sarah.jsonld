            "value": "Sarah Wong is San Francisco to her core, a child of the Sunset District's fog-laced streets. As the second-generation daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and West Coast ambition. Her parents preached the gospel of stability, envisioning a future for her in a lucrative field like engineering or medicine. Sarah, however, found her calling not in numbers, but in the bright, chaotic world of a second-grade classroom, inspired by a teacher at her own SFUSD school who made her feel seen.\n\nThis divergence was her first major turning point. Choosing to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in Child & Adolescent Development at San Francisco State University felt like a quiet act of rebellion. Her parents, though initially disappointed, eventually came to respect her passion, seeing the same tireless work ethic they possessed reflected in her late nights of lesson planning. Upon graduating, Sarah deliberately sought a position within the community, landing a job as a third-grade teacher in the Richmond District.\n\nNow 28, her life is a testament to her commitment. Her \"0.0-mile commute\" is a cherished luxury; she lives just three blocks from her school in a small, rent-controlled apartment she shares with another teacher. Her days are a whirlwind of phonics, multiplication tables, and mediating playground disputes. Afternoons are spent grading papers at a local cafe, the aroma of coffee mixing with the scent of whiteboard markers on her clothes. Her social life is woven into the city's fabric\u2014weekend dim sum with her parents in the Sunset, hiking the trails at Lands End with college friends, and book-browsing at Green Apple Books.\n\nSarah\u2019s dreams are both intimate and immense. She hopes to guide her current class of 25 children to become kinder, more curious people. On a grander scale, she aspires to one day afford a small condo of her own, a daunting goal on a teacher's salary. It\u2019s her ultimate hope: to plant permanent roots in the city she not only calls home but actively helps to shape, one student at a time."
