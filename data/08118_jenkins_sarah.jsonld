Born in Oakland to a Korean immigrant mother and a white American father, Sarah grew up navigating the space between two cultures. Her childhood was filled with the scent of her mother\u2019s kimchi jjigae and the sound of her father\u2019s classic rock LPs, an upbringing that instilled in her an appreciation for things with a rich story.\n\nHer educational journey began with promise at a state college, where she pursued a passion for art history. She was fascinated by how objects\u2014paintings, sculptures, textiles\u2014could communicate history and emotion. However, her studies were cut short when her mother fell ill, requiring Sarah to leave school and find full-time work to help with mounting medical bills. She took a job on the sales floor of a department store, a practical decision that unexpectedly ignited a new path. She discovered a natural talent for retail: an eye for merchandising, a gentle way with discerning customers, and an innate understanding of quality. She rose through the ranks, eventually being scouted to manage a chic, independent boutique in San Francisco.\n\nA key turning point was accepting the manager position, which came with a unique perk: a small, stylish apartment directly above the store. Her commute became a single flight of stairs. While convenient, this arrangement has deeply entwined her personal and professional lives. A long-term relationship fizzled a few years ago, unable to compete with the demands of a business that was always, literally, just downstairs. Her days are a seamless blend of inventory management, client appointments, and quiet evenings listening to the city hum through her window. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few close friends and the designers whose work she champions.\n\nNow 37, Sarah feels a quiet ambition stirring. She loves her neighborhood and the life she\u2019s built, but she dreams of more. Her ultimate goal is to open her own boutique, a space that reflects her mixed-heritage identity and features emerging AAPI artists and designers. It would be a place where every piece has a story\u2014a tribute to the art history degree she never finished, and the culmination of a life spent finding beauty in the details."
