Growing up in the sprawling Sacramento suburbs, the only child of a high school history teacher and a state health inspector, he was fascinated by the invisible logic of cities. While his friends were obsessed with cars, David was obsessed with the roads they drove on. His stepfather, whose surname he took at age ten, was an architect who nurtured this interest, spreading blueprints across the dining table that looked to David like maps of the future. This upbringing instilled in him a quiet analytical nature and a deep yearning for the dense, chaotic energy of a true metropolis.\n\nHis path was linear and focused. After studying political science at UC Davis, he pursued a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, which cemented his love for the Bay Area. He landed an entry-level job with the City of Oakland before being hired by the City and County of San Francisco. For fifteen years, he has climbed the ladder to Senior Policy Analyst, becoming an expert on housing and transit policy. A key turning point was the failure of a major affordable housing initiative he\u2019d spent three years championing. The project\u2019s collapse under political pressure and budget cuts tempered his youthful idealism with a heavy dose of pragmatism, leaving him dedicated but weary.\n\nAt 41, David\u2019s life is contained within his Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as his office. The 0.0-mile commute means his days are a cycle of Zoom meetings, data analysis, and policy reports. His primary connection to the physical city he governs is his lunchtime walk, where he observes the real-world impact of his work\u2014the new protected bike lane, the shuttered small business, the tent encampment. Recently single after a long-term relationship ended over his partner\u2019s desire to leave the expensive, demanding city, his social life now consists of a small circle of fellow policy wonks.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to see one of his policies create tangible, lasting good\u2014a goal that feels more distant each year. He aspires to break free from the analytical bubble of his work-from-home life, to feel less like an observer of San Francisco and more like a participant. He holds onto the hope of one day looking at a thriving new community hub or transit line and knowing he didn't just write the report; he helped build it."
