Raised in Richmond, his world was defined by the smell of ink and the rhythmic clatter of machinery from his family\u2019s small commercial print shop. College was a foregone conclusion until his father\u2019s sudden stroke during his senior year of high school. David, the only child, shelved his plans and stepped in to run the family business. For fifteen years, he managed client orders, ran the presses, and learned the unforgiving math of small business margins.\n\nA key turning point came in the late 2000s, as digital media decimated the printing industry. After a long, slow decline, David made the heartbreaking decision to close the shop. At 35, with no degree and a defunct skillset, he felt adrift. He took a series of temp jobs in San Francisco, starting as a mailroom clerk at a downtown consulting firm. It was there his innate organizational skills\u2014honed by years of managing complex print jobs\u2014were noticed. He was reliable, unflappable, and understood logistics better than any of the Ivy League grads. A manager took a chance, hiring him as a junior project coordinator.\n\nToday, at 47, David is a senior Project Coordinator at that same firm, working entirely from his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to his desk. His days are a mosaic of spreadsheets, client emails, and video calls, coordinating projects he never touches physically. He lives a quiet, solitary life, finding solace in long walks through Golden Gate Park and exploring the dim sum restaurants on Clement Street. He has a few close friends, most from his early days at the firm.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of an adopted son who has earned his place. He feels a quiet pride in having built a stable career from the ashes of his first one. His dream isn't extravagant; it\u2019s the profound hope of one day buying a small condo, a tangible piece of the city he now calls home. It is a quiet aspiration for permanence in a life defined by change."
