The son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up in the quiet, family-oriented Sunset District. His parents, a restaurant cook and a seamstress, instilled in him a powerful work ethic and the expectation of a stable, lucrative career. However, they communicated love through provision, not words, leaving an emotional void in their home. From a young age, Liam became a keen observer of unspoken anxieties and the quiet burdens his family carried, developing a deep empathy that would later define his path.\n\nHis educational journey began at UC Berkeley, where he initially majored in economics to please his parents. A volunteer position at a community health clinic in Oakland became his turning point. There, he witnessed firsthand the immense need for culturally competent mental health support, especially among immigrant families like his own. He switched his major to social welfare, a decision that caused quiet tension at home but felt like an undeniable calling. He went on to earn his Master of Social Work from UCLA, focusing on clinical practice in community health settings.\n\nNow 26, Liam is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) specializing in telehealth. His commute is a zero-mile journey from his bedroom to the desk in his cozy Inner Richmond apartment, a space that serves as both his sanctuary and his clinic. His days are a series of virtual sessions, providing therapy to a diverse clientele grappling with anxiety, depression, and trauma. He finds profound meaning in offering the emotional vocabulary and support he wished his own family had.\n\nThough his work is fulfilling, it can be isolating. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends and weekly dinners with his parents, where their relationship is slowly healing through his patience and understanding. Liam dreams of eventually opening a small group practice dedicated to serving the Bay Area\u2019s AAPI community, helping to destigmatize mental healthcare. He aspires to find a partner who shares his values and to achieve a healthier work-life balance, but for now, his purpose is clear: to be a source of healing for the city that shaped him."

She\u2019d pricked her finger on the needle, but the single tear that slipped down her cheek wasn\u2019t from the pain. Her shoulders shook almost imperceptibly as she stared at a half-finished dress. He didn't know what to say, so he said nothing. The moment etched itself into him: a deep, helpless empathy and a desperate need to one day understand the language of silent sorrows. This was the moment his observational empathy was born.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, volunteering at the Oakland clinic, he watched an elderly Cantonese woman try to explain her depression to a non-Cantonese-speaking intern. She kept patting her chest, saying it felt \u201cstuffed.\u201d The intern noted \u201cchest pains.\u201d Liam saw the chasm between them\u2014a universe of culturally specific grief being lost in translation. He didn\u2019t just see a patient; he saw his own parents\u2019 unspoken burdens. In that instant, his path diverged. The certainty of his new purpose, to bridge that chasm, was absolute and terrifying.\n\n3.\nThe conversation was in the kitchen when he was twenty. After he explained he was dropping economics for social welfare, his father didn\u2019t raise his voice. He simply turned from the chopping block, wiped his cleaver with meticulous care, and walked away. The silence was deafening, filled with the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifices and their fractured dream for him. That quiet disappointment was more painful than any argument, forging a resolve in Liam to prove that healing people had its own profound, tangible value.\n\n4.\nJust last month, during a telehealth session, a young man grappling with family pressure finally broke down, saying, \"I have the words for my anxiety now. It's not a weakness.\" Liam saw his own reflection in the client's tearful relief. It was a profound, quiet victory. He was providing the emotional vocabulary he had yearned for his entire childhood. The moment wasn't just healing for his client; it was a deeply validating act of healing for himself, affirming every difficult choice he had ever made.\n\n5.\nLast Sunday, during their weekly dinner, his dad was describing a problem with a supplier at the restaurant. For the first time, he paused, looked directly at Liam, and asked, \"What would you say to him? You know... about talking.\" It was a clumsy, almost shy, request for his professional insight. A small crack appeared in the wall of stoicism his father had built for decades. For Liam, this wasn't just a question; it was the beginning of a true connection, a sign that healing was finally beginning at home."
