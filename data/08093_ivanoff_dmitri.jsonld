The son of Russian immigrants who settled in the fog-drenched Outer Sunset, he was raised on the tenets of pragmatism and hard work. His parents, a seamstress and a Muni driver, saw education as the only path to a stable American life, a world away from the uncertainty they had fled.\n\nHe tried to follow their map, enrolling in a business program at San Francisco State University. But the sterile quiet of lecture halls felt alien compared to the controlled chaos of the restaurant jobs he worked to pay his tuition. He was seduced by the immediate, tangible results of a perfectly executed service\u2014the energy, the camaraderie, the nightly finale. After two years, he quietly dropped his classes, trading theoretical case studies for the real-world MBA of the restaurant floor.\n\nHis ascent was swift. He had a natural talent for reading people and a calm demeanor that anchored him in any storm. A seasoned chef at a North Beach trattoria saw his potential beyond waiting tables and mentored him, teaching him the ruthless math of inventory and the delicate art of managing creative, often volatile, personalities. This was his true education.\n\nNow, at 31, Dmitri is the General Manager of \"Vero,\" a perpetually booked Italian-Californian restaurant in Hayes Valley. His life is inextricably tied to the business, a fact solidified by his 0.0-mile commute: he lives in a small, starkly furnished apartment directly above the restaurant. His days begin with the smell of garlic and yeast from the kitchen below and end long after the last celebrating diner has gone home. His social life consists of regulars, his own staff, and fleeting conversations with other industry lifers during pre-dawn trips to the wholesale market. A serious relationship ended a year ago, a casualty of 90-hour work weeks and his inability to ever truly clock out.\n\nDmitri\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not through its tech booms or landmarks, but through its service arteries. He knows the city by its purveyors, its health codes, and the shifting moods of its diners. His dream is to break the cycle. He meticulously saves, hoping to one day open his own place\u2014not a trendy hotspot, but a small, quiet neighborhood bar where people like his parents could feel comfortable. A place he could finally lock up and leave at the end of the night."
