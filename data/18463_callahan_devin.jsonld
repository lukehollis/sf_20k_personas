Raised by a civil engineer father who designed highways and a practical school administrator mother, Devin\u2019s childhood was a comfortable but isolating landscape of wide streets and requisite car trips. He spent his teenage years longing for the dense, unpredictable energy of cities he only saw in movies. This dissatisfaction became the seed of his life\u2019s work.\n\nHis undergraduate studies at UC Davis were a means to an end, but a semester abroad in Copenhagen was a revelation. He was mesmerized by a city designed for people, not cars. The revelation of cobblestone streets, ubiquitous bike lanes, and vibrant public squares transformed his vague interest into a fervent passion. He returned to California with purpose, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Urban and Regional Planning graduate program.\n\nUpon graduating, Devin dove into San Francisco\u2019s complex urban fabric. He spent his initial years in the public sector, learning the grinding mechanics of city bureaucracy, before moving to a private design firm where he could exert more creative influence. Now a Principal Urban Designer, he shapes mixed-use developments and public space revitalization projects across the Bay Area.\n\nDevin lives in a meticulously restored Victorian flat in Hayes Valley with his partner of eight years, Alex, a graphic designer for the SFMOMA. Their life is a curated reflection of the urbanist dream he champions. His 1.8-mile commute is a short Muni ride, a time he uses for observation. Weekends are for farmers' markets, gallery openings, and escaping to hike in the Marin Headlands. He feels a deep, proprietary connection to his neighborhood, having witnessed its transformation into a walkable, dynamic community.\n\nAt 42, Devin is successful, but a quiet restlessness persists. He earns a comfortable living but measures his success in public good. His ultimate aspiration is to lead a legacy project\u2014a new transit corridor or a large-scale public housing development that genuinely combats inequality. He wants to help solve the city's housing crisis, not just design luxury condos. For Devin, San Francisco isn't just home; it's a beautiful, flawed, endlessly fascinating puzzle he feels compelled to solve."

Forced onto a busy thoroughfare with no sidewalk, cars whipping past, he felt a hot surge of anger and isolation. That night, his father proudly unrolled blueprints of a new highway interchange. Devin saw not connection, but wider, faster cages. It was the first time he understood that a place could be designed to keep people apart.\n\n2.\n**Age 20.** His first morning in Copenhagen, jet-lagged, he stepped out not to the roar of engines, but to the gentle dinging of bicycle bells. He watched a grandmother pedal past, a full grocery basket upfront, and felt a profound sense of calm. The air smelled of baked bread, not exhaust. People were everywhere, moving with an unhurried confidence. This wasn\u2019t a movie set; it was real life. The vague yearning of his youth snapped into focus, becoming a blueprint for his entire future.\n\n3.\n**Age 28.** In a stuffy church basement in the Sunset, his first public meeting as a city planner, he was presenting a simple curb extension for pedestrian safety. A man stood up, shaking with rage, accusing him of trying to destroy the neighborhood over two parking spots. Devin\u2019s careful data and diagrams felt utterly useless. He left feeling naive and defeated, realizing for the first time that building a better city wasn\u2019t about drawing lines, but about navigating the deep, messy, and fearful terrain of the human heart.\n\n4.\n**Age 35.** He and Alex stood on the empty balcony of the Hayes Valley flat they were about to buy. Below, Patricia\u2019s Green hummed with life\u2014couples on blankets, kids chasing dogs on land that was once the shadow of a freeway. He saw the physical manifestation of a community healed by thoughtful destruction and deliberate design. Squeezing Alex's hand, he felt an overwhelming sense of rightness. This wasn't just a home; it was proof that his life's work actually mattered, a personal stake in the urban dream.\n\n5.\n**Age 41.** Riding the N-Judah home last winter, he watched the city slide by. The warm glow from a restaurant, the silhouette of a new condo tower he consulted on, the elegant facade of a Victorian. Then, his eyes caught on a woman huddled in a soaking sleeping bag in a bus shelter. The disconnect was a physical jolt. His curated life and professional successes felt hollow against her reality. The quiet restlessness he always felt sharpened into a clear, urgent mandate: designing beautiful spaces wasn't enough. He had to build equity."
