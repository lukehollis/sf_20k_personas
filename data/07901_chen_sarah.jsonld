As a second-generation Chinese-American, she grew up navigating the dual pressures of honoring her family's immigrant hustle while carving out her own identity. Her father, a pragmatic man who built his life from scratch, envisioned a stable, lucrative career for her, perhaps in medicine or engineering. For a time, Sarah tried to fit that mold.\n\nHer turning point came during her sophomore year at San Francisco State University. Enrolled in a daunting pre-med track, she took a ceramic arts class as an elective, seeking a simple creative outlet. Instead, she found a calling. The tactile sensation of shaping clay felt more honest and vital than any biology lab. Against her father's wishes, she declared a major in Studio Art, a decision that caused a rift in their relationship for nearly a year. It was a quiet rebellion, fought not with shouting matches but with a steadfast dedication to her newfound passion.\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is a testament to that choice. She lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment just three blocks from the public elementary school where she works, making her commute a short, pleasant walk. Her days are a vibrant chaos of distributing paint, untangling yarn, and encouraging small hands to create messy, wonderful things. She sees the spark in her students that she once felt in herself and considers nurturing it her life's most important work.\n\nHer social life is deeply woven into her community. She has a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other teachers and local artists. Evenings are often spent working on her own pottery, sharing dinner with her long-term boyfriend, Alex, a graphic designer, or visiting her parents' restaurant, where her father now proudly displays one of her ceramic vases by the register.\n\nSarah dreams of securing a larger grant to build a kiln for her school, giving her students the chance to experience the magic of ceramics. Her personal aspiration is to one day have a small, solo exhibition at a local gallery\u2014not for fame, but to share the quiet, beautiful world she has so carefully built for herself in the city that has always been her home."
