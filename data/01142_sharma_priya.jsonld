The daughter of software engineers who emigrated from Delhi, Priya was raised on a steady diet of academic expectation, with a clear path laid out towards medicine or tech. But from a young age, she was quietly observant, more interested in the stories of people on the fringes than the clean logic of code. She saw the stress behind her parents\u2019 pursuit of the American Dream and felt a growing pull towards a different definition of success.\n\nHer educational journey was a quiet rebellion. She enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, choosing Sociology over a more \u201cpractical\u201d major, much to her family\u2019s gentle dismay. A pivotal semester spent volunteering at a women's shelter in SoMa cracked her world open. Confronted with the raw, complex realities of urban poverty and trauma, she found not despair, but a profound sense of purpose. This experience was her turning point; she knew her life\u2019s work would be in the trenches of human services, not a Silicon Valley campus.\n\nNow 26, Priya is a Case Manager for a non-profit focused on supportive housing. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her commitment: her modest studio apartment is in the same Tenderloin building that houses her clients. Her days are a blur of connecting residents with mental health services, navigating bureaucracy for benefits, and de-escalating crises born from addiction and despair. Her personal and professional lives are deeply intertwined; the sounds of the neighborhood are the sounds of her home, and her clients are also her neighbors.\n\nHer social circle is small, mostly other non-profit workers who understand the unique burnout and fierce hope of their work. On rare days off, she finds solace in the quiet of the Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park or loses herself in the shelves of a Mission bookstore. Priya\u2019s dream isn't a higher salary, but a future in policy advocacy, hoping to address the systemic fractures she mends one-on-one. She has a complicated relationship with San Francisco, acutely aware of its beauty and its brutality. She doesn\u2019t just live in the city; she is committed to it, fighting daily for its most vulnerable souls."
