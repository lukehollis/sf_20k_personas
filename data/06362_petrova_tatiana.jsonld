The only child of Soviet engineers who immigrated from St. Petersburg to Richmond in the early 90s, Tatiana\u2019s childhood was shaped by her parents\u2019 long, multi-transfer commutes. She saw firsthand how access to transportation dictated opportunity, and it became the central puzzle she wanted to solve. This fascination led her to a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, where her thesis focused on improving transit equity in historically underserved Bay Area communities.\n\nHer early career was a testament to her beliefs. As a planner for the SFMTA, she was a devout Muni rider, taking a different bus or train line each week simply for ethnographic observation. She felt the city\u2019s pulse in the lurch of a cable car and the morning rush on the N-Judah. Her work was tangible, her data points were fellow passengers, and her pride was in shaving minutes off a route or justifying a new bike lane.\n\nThe pandemic was her great turning point. The city\u2019s arteries emptied, and her job, once rooted in movement, became entirely stationary. Now, at 37, Tatiana\u2019s commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her laptop. From her small apartment in the Lower Haight, she watches the 7 Haight/Noriega bus pass by, its real-time location a blinking dot on one of her many monitors. Her work is more abstract now\u2014a world of traffic flow models, ridership data streams, and funding proposals. She is an architect of mobility who rarely moves.\n\nHer personal life is quiet and ordered. She maintains a tight circle of friends, mostly fellow urbanists and policy wonks, who gather for dinners where they debate the merits of road diets and bus-only lanes. While professionally respected, Tatiana feels a growing disconnect. Her greatest aspiration is to see her long-term projects come to fruition\u2014a truly integrated and efficient regional transit network. On a personal level, her dream is simpler: to eventually close her laptop, walk out her front door, and get back on the bus, not as its planner, but just as a passenger on her way somewhere new."
