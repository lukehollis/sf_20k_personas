The daughter of Chinese immigrants, she grew up amidst the fragrant bustle of their small grocery store in the Sunset District. Her parents, who spoke of hard work as the highest virtue, hoped she would pursue a stable career in medicine or law. Sarah, however, was drawn to the beauty and stories hidden in the past, graduating from SF State with a Bachelor's degree in Art History.\n\nHer initial foray into the art world was disillusioning, marked by unpaid internships and low-paying gallery jobs. Pragmatism, a trait inherited from her parents, eventually won out. In the late 2000s, a friend helped her get a temporary receptionist job at a burgeoning tech startup. There, amidst the chaotic energy of engineers and ambitious founders, Sarah discovered her true talent: creating order. Her ability to manage schedules, anticipate needs, and act as the calm, organizational hub of the office made her indispensable. She rose steadily, not by writing code, but by making it possible for others to do so seamlessly.\n\nNow 40, Sarah is an Administrative Manager for a mid-sized tech firm, a role she performs entirely from her rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute has reshaped her life. Mornings are for slow coffee and a walk through Golden Gate Park before diving into a day of managing global calendars and virtual teams. The lack of a commute frees her evenings for yoga classes, exploring the restaurants on Clement Street with a tight-knit circle of friends, or simply enjoying the quiet of her home.\n\nThough single, she is far from lonely, cultivating her relationships with the same care she applies to her work. She feels a deep, sometimes complicated, connection to the city that has been her lifelong home. She resents the manic pace of the industry that provides her livelihood but finds solace in the unchanging presence of the ocean and the familiar storefronts of her neighborhood. Her quiet dream is not a career change, but a return to her first love: she aspires to one day use her savings to travel through Europe, finally seeing the masterpieces she only ever studied in books."
