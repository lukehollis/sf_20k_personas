At 54, her world is a tightly woven, lovingly curated village within the bustling city of San Francisco.\n\nHer upbringing in the East Bay was a world away from the chic aesthetic she now oversees. The eldest child in a family that poured every ounce of energy into a small corner grocery store, Priya\u2019s education was not in lecture halls but in stacking shelves, managing inventory, and learning the subtle art of customer service from her parents. College was a luxury the family couldn't afford, and a duty she never questioned. She learned finance by balancing the till and marketing by arranging fruit displays.\n\nThe turning point came in her early thirties when her parents finally retired and sold the store. For the first time, Priya was untethered. A brief, youthful marriage had ended amicably years before, leaving her independent. She set her sights on San Francisco, drawn by its promise of a life she could build for herself. She started as a sales associate at Hearth & Hue, her innate sense of order and quiet competence quickly catching the owner\u2019s eye. Over two decades, she rose through the ranks, her dedication making her the heart of the operation.\n\nToday, Priya\u2019s life is one of comfortable routine and deep connection. Her staff is her second family, a mix of young artists and students she mentors with a firm but gentle hand. Her social life revolves around other small business owners in her Hayes Valley neighborhood\u2014the baker, the gallery owner, the florist. They are a chosen family, bound by shared struggles and triumphs.\n\nSan Francisco, for Priya, isn't the Golden Gate Bridge or the clamor of Fisherman's Wharf; it's the morning quiet of her street, the familiar faces of her regulars, and the satisfaction of locking up a perfectly organized store at night. Her dream is simple: to one day buy a small ownership stake in Hearth & Hue, cementing her legacy in the little corner of the world she so carefully crafted."
