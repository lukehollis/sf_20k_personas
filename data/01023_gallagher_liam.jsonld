Raised by a stoic ironworker father and a mother whose artistic spirit was often dimmed by waves of severe depression, Liam learned to read emotional undercurrents before he could read novels. He became the family\u2019s quiet observer, the mediator, feeling a profound helplessness as he watched his mother struggle without the language or resources to seek help. This formative experience planted the seed of his life's work: to give others the tools his family never had.\n\nSeeking distance and a new identity, he moved west for college, initially adrift until a volunteer gig at a campus crisis hotline ignited a dormant purpose. The work was raw and demanding, but for the first time, he felt effective. He pursued his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn to the Bay Area's progressive culture. His early career was a trial by fire, working in a community clinic in Oakland, handling cases of complex trauma and addiction that solidified his empathy and resilience.\n\nNow 34, Liam has built a life of intentional quiet in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the private practice he runs from a meticulously organized office in his bay-windowed apartment. His days are structured: a pre-dawn run in Golden Gate Park to clear his own head, followed by back-to-back telehealth sessions with clients. He is a familiar face at the local coffee shop, where he grabs lunch, and the bookstore on Clement Street, his primary source of unwinding.\n\nWhile he projects calm competence, he privately wrestles with the secondary trauma of his work and a deep-seated loneliness. His social circle is small but loyal, composed of a few friends who understand the emotional toll of the \u201ccaring professions.\u201d His greatest aspiration is to one day expand his practice into a small, low-cost wellness collective to mentor new therapists. For Liam, the cool fog that blankets his neighborhood is a comfort\u2014a daily reminder of the emotional fog he helps his clients navigate, and the clarity that can be found on the other side."
