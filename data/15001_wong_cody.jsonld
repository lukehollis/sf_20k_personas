Adopted as an infant by a second-generation Chinese-American couple, he was raised in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. His parents, a public-school teacher and a union carpenter, instilled in him a profound sense of civic duty and community responsibility. Growing up, he was a Caucasian face in a loving Cantonese-speaking household, a position that made him acutely aware of cultural bridges and social dynamics. While he sometimes felt like an observer in the vibrant culture that defined his family, he was always an integral, beloved part of it.\n\nThis unique upbringing directly influenced his educational path. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, naturally drawn to Political Science to understand the systems governing the city he loved. During his junior year, a key turning point arrived: a competitive internship with a City Supervisor. Cody thrived in the fast-paced, high-stakes environment of City Hall, proving to be a quick study and a passionate advocate for housing initiatives. When a full-time Legislative Aide position unexpectedly opened up, his supervisor offered it to him directly. Seeing a tangible path to enact change, Cody made the difficult decision to pause his degree and seize the opportunity.\n\nToday, Cody\u2019s life is a blur of policy briefings, constituent phone calls, and community meetings. He starts his day in a Hayes Valley apartment he shares with two roommates, catching a crowded Muni bus for the short commute to City Hall. His $72,000 salary is stretched thin by rent and deferred student loans, but he finds deep meaning in his work. Socially, he navigates two worlds: drinks with politically-minded colleagues after work and weekend dim sum with his family in the Sunset.\n\nHis ultimate aspiration is to finish his degree and eventually run for the Board of Supervisors himself. He dreams of representing the complex, multifaceted city that raised him, using his unique background to bridge divides between San Francisco\u2019s diverse communities. For Cody, public service isn't just a career; it's a way to honor the family who chose him and the city that shaped him."

In rapid-fire Cantonese, she asked his mother why her son\u2019s hair was the color of hay. He felt a hot flush of confusion, not understanding the words but the sudden shift in the room. His mother simply put a hand on his shoulder and said, \u201cHe\u2019s our Cody.\u201d It was the first time he understood he was both an insider and an outsider, a loving observer\u2014a position that taught him to listen more than he spoke.\n\n**2.**\nAt fourteen, he stood in the damp morning fog, holding a picket sign alongside his father. It was a carpenter\u2019s strike, and the air was filled with chants and the smell of coffee from thermoses. His dad explained the fight wasn't just about wages; it was about respect for the people who physically build the city. Cody felt a profound sense of purpose, a fierce pride in his father\u2019s solidarity. It cemented his belief that public service wasn\u2019t abstract; it was showing up for your community, rain or shine.\n\n**3.**\nDuring his internship, he sat in the back of a hostile community meeting about a new Navigation Center. He watched his boss\u2019s Legislative Aide calmly absorb residents' anger and fear, validating their concerns while holding fast to the policy. In that stuffy, tense room, Cody saw a path clearer than any textbook could offer. When the aide position was offered to him a few weeks later, pausing his degree felt less like a sacrifice and more like answering a direct call to the front lines of the city he loved.\n\n**4.**\nA few months ago, an elderly woman from the Richmond District called their office, crying in broken English about an eviction notice. As she struggled for words, she slipped into Cantonese, and Cody\u2019s mind filled with the voices of his own popo and gung gung. He was able to soothe her, assuring her in English they would connect her to legal aid. The call wasn't a case file; it was a visceral reminder of who he was fighting for. It made the low pay and long hours feel infinitely meaningful.\n\n**5.**\nJust last Sunday, over dim sum with his family in the Sunset, his phone buzzed incessantly with texts about an upcoming committee vote. As his mother nudged a plate of har gow toward him, he silenced the phone. He looked at his parents, the faces of the people his work was meant to protect, living in the neighborhood he hoped to one day represent. That moment\u2014the pull between City Hall urgency and family normalcy\u2014wasn't a conflict. It was his anchor, the very reason he chose this life."
