Born in the Sunset District to first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, he was given an anglicized name his parents hoped would pave a smoother path in America. His father worked long hours in a restaurant kitchen, his mother at a sewing machine in a small garment factory. Their hopes were singularly focused on David; he was to be the stable, successful professional they could never be. An observant and introspective child, David found his passion not in numbers, but in stories, losing himself in the history of civilizations at the local library.\n\nHe attended UC Berkeley, dutifully enrolling as a business major but secretly filling his electives with history courses. His Bachelor\u2019s degree, officially in Business Administration, felt like a forgery of his true interests. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s solidified his pragmatic path. Witnessing the financial ruin of overly ambitious peers, he accepted a junior analyst position at a downtown firm, choosing security over soulfulness. He discovered a knack for identifying patterns in market data, a skill that echoed his love for tracing historical trends, but it lacked the human element he craved.\n\nNow 44, the pandemic shifted his world inward. His firm went fully remote, and his commute became the zero-mile walk from his bedroom to his home office in his quiet Richmond District apartment. The constant presence of the neighborhood fog rolling past his window feels symbolic of his own life\u2014steady, muted, and slightly obscured. His daily routine is disciplined: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, followed by ten hours staring at spreadsheets and market reports. His social life has winnowed to weekly calls with his sister in San Diego and occasional dinners with a couple of old college friends.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to upend his life, but to finally merge its two halves. He has begun spending his weekends volunteering at the California Historical Society, archiving old photographs of the city. He aspires to one day write a book on the economic history of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, connecting the financial world he inhabits with the heritage he comes from. He hopes to find the narrative thread in his own life, proving that the sensible path and the passionate one can eventually lead to the same place."
