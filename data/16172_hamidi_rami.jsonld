Born in Homs, Syria, he immigrated to Fremont with his parents, a doctor and a teacher, at the age of seven. They settled in the East Bay\u2019s burgeoning Middle Eastern community, where Rami grew up straddling two worlds: the aromatic, communal warmth of his Syrian heritage at home and the fast-paced, individualistic culture of his American school. He saw firsthand the challenges his family and neighbors faced\u2014navigating bureaucracy, finding community, and preserving their identity.\n\nThis bicultural upbringing led him to study sociology at UC Berkeley, but a key turning point solidified his path. In 2011, as the Syrian Civil War erupted, the abstract news reports were a visceral reality for Rami. He felt a profound helplessness watching his birthplace crumble from afar, a feeling that galvanized him into action. He enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, determined to channel his empathy into tangible skills. He started as a caseworker for a youth advocacy non-profit, his calm demeanor and deep understanding making him a vital resource for immigrant and refugee teens.\n\nNow 43, Rami is the Clinical Program Director for a non-profit that provides integrated mental health and educational support. He has traded direct casework for the systemic challenges of grant writing, staff management, and program development, but his core mission remains. He lives in the Mission District with his partner of eight years, a landscape architect named Lena. His 2.8-mile bike commute is a cherished daily ritual, a quiet transition between his home life and the demanding, rewarding work of his clinic.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but pragmatic. He loves the city's tolerance and vibrant energy but is acutely aware of its deep inequities. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014to secure enough funding to expand his program\u2019s model, creating a replicable system of support for vulnerable youth. Rami Hamidi finds his purpose not in grand gestures, but in the steady, essential work of mending the city's social fabric, one life at a time."

He watched his father, a brilliant surgeon in Syria, stare at a simple renewal form with a look of quiet defeat. In that moment, seeing his powerful father made small by a wall of unfamiliar bureaucracy, Rami felt a hot surge of protective anger. It wasn\u2019t just about a form; it was about dignity. A silent vow formed in his young mind: he would learn the language of these systems, not just for his family, but for everyone who felt lost.\n\n2.\nIn 2011, scrolling through news reports was an abstract horror until he saw it: a photo of a bombed-out bakery on a familiar Homs street corner. He could almost smell the za'atar and cheese from the manakish his grandfather used to buy him there. The memory, so warm and vivid, crashed against the gray, dusty reality on his screen. The immense distance between Fremont and Homs collapsed into a single, sharp point of grief in his chest. That's when abstract empathy became a profound, personal calling to act.\n\n3.\nThe Somali teenager at the youth center had been silent for weeks. One afternoon, instead of asking about trauma, Rami simply mentioned how much he missed his mother\u2019s mloukhieh. The boy looked up, and for the first time, spoke. Not about the war or the journey, but about the specific way his grandmother in Mogadishu brewed tea with cardamom. In that small, shared moment of homesickness and sensory memory, Rami knew his own bicultural heart was his most essential tool for building trust.\n\n4.\nHe remembers an evening last spring, biking home through the Mission. The scent of bacon-wrapped hot dogs and the sound of cumbia from a taqueria filled the air. He turned a corner and saw a young man, a former client, panhandling. They made eye contact\u2014a brief, pained nod of recognition. The city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic joy and its deep, personal suffering, all within one block. The sight didn\u2019t defeat him; it focused him, quietly reinforcing the reason he rides this same path every single day.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, he was feeling overwhelmed by budget cuts when Lena brought him to the small garden she\u2019d cultivated on their fire escape. She pointed to a tough, scraggly sage plant. \"See?\" she said, \"It doesn't need much, it just needs consistency. It knows how to thrive here.\" Looking from the resilient plant to Lena\u2019s calm, steady face, Rami felt the anxiety in his chest loosen. Her love wasn't grand; it was sustainable. It was the quiet, grounding force that made his demanding work possible."
