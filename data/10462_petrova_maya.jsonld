Her parents, first-generation immigrants from the Philippines and Russia respectively, instilled in her a deep appreciation for both cultures \u2013 the warmth of Filipino hospitality and the resilience of Russian stoicism. Growing up, her apartment was a vibrant hub of multilingual conversations and the aroma of diverse cuisines. While not wealthy, her parents prioritized education and community involvement, often volunteering at local shelters. This early exposure to helping others ignited a spark in young Maya.\n\nHer educational journey led her to SF State, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Social Work. While challenging, the coursework resonated deeply with her inherent desire to understand and alleviate suffering. During her studies, she interned at a family support center in the Mission, solidifying her commitment to the field. Upon graduation, she landed a position as a medical social worker at a busy clinic in the Tenderloin, a demanding but incredibly rewarding role.\n\nA significant turning point occurred in her late twenties. Witnessing the systemic issues impacting her patients \u2013 lack of access to resources, housing insecurity, and mental health disparities \u2013 fueled her desire to make a more significant impact. She pursued additional training in medical social work and transitioned to her current role in a healthcare system that partners with local schools, allowing her to work with families navigating complex medical issues alongside educational challenges.\n\nMaya's life outside of work is interwoven with strong relationships. She maintains close ties to her parents, still living in the Outer Richmond, and enjoys regular dinners celebrating their shared heritage. Her circle of friends includes former classmates and colleagues, many working in similar helping professions. They often gather for potlucks, discussing their work, sharing stories, and providing each other with much-needed emotional support. She also volunteers at a local community garden, finding solace in the tactile work and the connection to nature.\n\nLooking ahead, Maya dreams of establishing a program focused on mental health support for immigrant families, recognizing the unique challenges they face. She also hopes to travel more, exploring her roots in the Philippines and Russia. Currently, her days are a balanced rhythm of cycling to work through Golden Gate Park, advocating for her patients, and finding moments of connection with loved ones and her community. San Francisco, with its tapestry of cultures and persistent social challenges, remains her beloved home \u2013 a place where she feels she can truly make a difference, one interaction at a time."
