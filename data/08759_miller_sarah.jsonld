Raised in the sprawling, meticulously planned suburbs of Sacramento, she grew up surrounded by newness\u2014new houses, new shopping centers, and a distinct lack of historical texture. Her parents, a practical engineer and a dental hygienist, encouraged stable career paths, puzzled by their daughter\u2019s fascination with old books, faded photographs, and the stories whispered by forgotten objects.\n\nHer true path revealed itself during a college internship at the San Francisco Historical Society. Tasked with digitizing a collection of letters from a Gold Rush-era merchant, Sarah felt the weight of the past come alive under her fingertips. The delicate paper, the elegant script\u2014it wasn't just data; it was a life. This experience propelled her to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) with a specialization in Digital Curation at UCLA.\n\nUpon graduating, she landed her ideal job: a remote position as a Digital Archivist for a New York-based arts foundation. This allowed her to return to the city that had captured her imagination. She settled into a classic Edwardian apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its peaceful, fog-laced streets. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her small kitchen to a desk in her bay window, where the rumbling N-Judah streetcar provides the soundtrack to her workday.\n\nSarah\u2019s days are a structured rhythm of metadata, digital migration, and online correspondence. Her social circle is small and intimate, comprised mostly of fellow academics and museum workers she meets for quiet dinners in the Mission or walks through the Botanical Garden. She finds San Francisco not in its boisterous nightlife, but in the layers of history she sees on her walks\u2014the ghost signs on old buildings, the changing storefronts, the enduring architecture.\n\nHer great ambition is a personal one. She has begun her own private project: a digital archive of the Inner Richmond, documenting its small businesses, oral histories of elderly residents, and architectural details before they vanish. For Sarah, fulfillment isn't about making history, but ensuring it\u2019s never lost."
