As the only son of immigrants who poured their life savings and relentless energy into their business, David inherited their work ethic but not their passion for pastry. He was a quiet, observant boy, more interested in the patterns of the world than the dusting of flour. His path seemed set for medicine, a stable and respectable career his parents heartily endorsed.\n\nThe turning point came during his undergraduate years at UC Davis. His favorite uncle, a man who worked two manual labor jobs, was diagnosed with late-stage type 2 diabetes, a condition exacerbated by a lack of access to preventative care and health education. Watching his family navigate the bewildering healthcare system, David saw the problem not as a single diagnosis, but as a systemic failure. This experience shifted his focus from treating individuals to understanding populations. He pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, specializing in epidemiology.\n\nNow 31, David lives a life of quiet containment in his Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bed to his desk, where he works remotely as a research assistant for a UCSF-affiliated health group. He spends his days immersed in datasets, searching for correlations between lifestyle, environment, and disease in vulnerable communities. His routine is methodical: strong coffee, hours of statistical analysis, a midday walk through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park to clear his head, and evenings often spent cooking the simple, healthy meals his research advocates for.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, revolving around a few close friends from his Berkeley grad program. While he values his focused work, a part of him yearns for more spontaneous connection beyond scheduled Zoom calls and the occasional awkward dating app meet-up. David dreams of one day leading his own research project, specifically focusing on health disparities within Asian-American immigrant communities\u2014a tribute to his uncle. He hopes to build a life in San Francisco that extends beyond his laptop screen, to find a balance where the data he analyzes translates into a richer, more connected human experience for himself and others."
