Her commute is a short flight of stairs from her small apartment down to the workshop floor, where the percussive rhythm of industrial sewing machines has been the soundtrack to her life since she was a teenager. Born in a small city in Guangdong, China, Mei Lin immigrated to the U.S. at 17 with her parents. Their dream was a humble one: to build a life through their own garment manufacturing business.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s formal education ended with her Chinese secondary school diploma. Upon arriving in San Francisco, there was no time for American high school or college applications. Her father, Bao, needed her hands and her sharp eye. She quickly mastered the overlock and single-needle machines, her youthful dexterity becoming a vital asset to the fledgling family business. Her path was set by duty, and for over a decade, she worked alongside her father, the hum of the machines a constant conversation between them.\n\nThe key turning point in her life was her father\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack five years ago. The tragedy cemented her role. Now, at 36, she runs the floor while her mother manages the books, their shared grief and responsibility a silent, binding contract. Her social life is modest, consisting mostly of shared meals with her mother and brief, friendly exchanges with the handful of other operators they employ.\n\nThough she is proud of upholding her father\u2019s legacy, a quiet dream has taken root in the solitude of her repetitive work. During her breaks, she scrolls through images of a different San Francisco\u2014one of art galleries in the Mission, pottery studios in Dogpatch, and sprawling green parks. She feels a pull toward ceramics, a desire to shape something from clay with her own hands, to create for beauty instead of utility.\n\nHer current life is a cycle of early mornings, long hours at the machine, and quiet evenings. But now, she secretly stows away a small portion of her earnings. Her aspiration isn't to leave the business, but to carve out a small piece of life that is entirely her own\u2014perhaps a weekend pottery class. It is a fragile hope, a future she is slowly stitching together, one hidden dollar at a time."
