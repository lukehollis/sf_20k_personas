The daughter of Indian immigrants, she grew up in Fremont, where her father, a hardware engineer, endured a grueling daily commute to Silicon Valley. She watched the exhaustion etch lines on his face, internalizing the idea that transportation wasn't just about getting from A to B; it was about the time, equity, and quality of life it either gave or stole. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a lucrative career in tech or medicine, Priya was drawn to the systems that governed daily life, earning her undergraduate degree in Public Policy at UC Davis.\n\nHer turning point came during a college internship with Sacramento Regional Transit. Witnessing firsthand how a well-planned bus route could connect a low-income senior to healthcare, she knew she\u2019d found her calling. This solidified her decision to pursue a Master of Public Administration at USC, focusing on urban planning and management. She purposefully returned to the Bay Area, aiming for the heart of its complex transit challenges: San Francisco.\n\nNow a Senior Program Manager at the SFMTA, Priya\u2019s life is an extension of her work. She lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood chosen for its robust Muni access. Her 3.8-mile commute on the 38R Geary Rapid is a daily field study, where she observes passenger flow, shelter conditions, and operator challenges. Her partner of four years, Alex, an architect, shares her passion for civic design, and their conversations often revolve around building a more human-centric city.\n\nEvenings consist of cooking, reading policy journals, or taking long walks through Golden Gate Park. Weekends are for the Clement Street Farmers' Market and exploring different neighborhoods via MUNI, constantly analyzing the system she\u2019s dedicated to improving. Priya\u2019s ambition isn't just to climb the ladder at SFMTA, but to one day lead a transformative project\u2014perhaps a new light rail line or a program that radically improves transit access for the city's most vulnerable residents. For her, a better San Francisco is one that moves for everyone, a conviction born from a childhood spent watching her father wait in traffic."

Her father would finally walk in, his shoulders perpetually slumped, the energy drained from him by the soul-crushing traffic on 880. He\u2019d manage a tired smile, but she saw the exhaustion etched around his eyes. In those silent moments, she learned that a commute wasn't a distance measured in miles, but a thief of time and spirit. That memory became the quiet engine driving her life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nDuring her Sacramento internship, she met Mrs. Gable, who depended on the Route 19 bus for her dialysis appointments. One afternoon, the elderly woman gripped Priya\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThis bus, honey, it\u2019s my lifeline.\u201d Suddenly, the abstract data on her spreadsheets had a face, a story, and a fragile human need. That single sentence solidified her calling, transforming a policy interest into a deeply personal mission to champion transit as a fundamental right.\n\n3.\nHer first day commuting to her SFMTA job, she stood at 25th and Geary waiting for the 38R. As the articulated bus hissed to a stop, a profound sense of belonging washed over her. This wasn't just a ride to work; it was her laboratory, her community, her responsibility. Finding a seat, she watched the city slide by, feeling not like a newcomer, but like a custodian finally arriving home to begin her true work.\n\n4.\nThey were walking near Stow Lake when Alex stopped, pointing to a worn path in the grass beside the paved walkway\u2014a desire line. \"People always find a more human route,\" he\u2019d mused. Priya felt a jolt of pure recognition. He saw what she saw: not a shortcut, but a story about intuitive design. In that shared observation, she felt the deep, grounding comfort of a partnership built on the same blueprint for a better world.\n\n5.\nAt a tense community meeting, an elderly woman tearfully described how a proposed route change would isolate her. Afterwards, Priya found her and just listened. She didn\u2019t offer policy jargon; she spoke of her father. A flicker of understanding passed between them, a moment of shared humanity. It was a humbling, visceral reminder that every line on her maps was a person\u2019s story, fortifying her resolve to fight for those the system too often forgets."
