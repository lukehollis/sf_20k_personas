The son of first-generation immigrants, Kevin\u2019s childhood was a blend of American cartoons and the persistent, comforting aroma of his mother\u2019s cooking. He and his sister spent their afternoons doing homework in a corner booth, their lives interwoven with the restaurant\u2019s daily rhythm. He never planned to inherit this life; his ambitions were pointed south towards San Jose State, where he was two years into a graphic design degree, dreaming of a career in digital art.\n\nThe turning point came abruptly during his junior year. His father suffered a major health scare, leaving him unable to manage the restaurant\u2019s demanding 16-hour days. Without hesitation, Kevin put his education on indefinite hold and returned home. What began as a temporary measure to help his mother soon became a permanent role. He learned the business from the inside out\u2014not from a textbook, but from mastering inventory, placating difficult customers, and earning the respect of the long-serving kitchen staff.\n\nNow 27, Kevin is a master of his small domain. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a flight of stairs from his small apartment above the restaurant. His days are a blur of pre-dawn market runs, managing lunch and dinner rushes, and closing up long after the last customers have gone. His social life is largely confined to sharing late-night drinks with his staff or catching up with the neighborhood regulars who have watched him grow up. A serious relationship ended a year ago, a casualty of his all-consuming schedule.\n\nWhile he is proud to uphold his parents' legacy, a quiet dream still flickers within him. He sketches new logos and modern menu layouts in a notebook he keeps under the counter. His aspiration isn't to escape, but to evolve. He hopes to one day transform Seoul Sunset, blending his parents' authentic flavors with his own modern, artistic vision, proving that he didn\u2019t just sacrifice his dream\u2014he reshaped it."
