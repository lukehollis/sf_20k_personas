            "value": "Ethan Sharma is a man defined by process. Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Fremont, he was the son of a pragmatic software engineer and a detail-oriented accountant who immigrated from Uttar Pradesh, India. They instilled in him the values of stability, logic, and a well-executed plan. While his peers dreamed of being astronauts, Ethan was fascinated by the intricate logistics of getting them there. This led him to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering, a field dedicated to optimizing complex systems.\n\nHis career was a steady, methodical ascent. He bypassed the volatile world of software startups for the tangible realm of hardware, finding his niche in tech manufacturing. As a Production Supervisor, he doesn\u2019t write code; he ensures the sleek, minimalist devices born from that code can actually be built at scale. He is the bridge between digital design and physical reality, a master of supply chains, quality control, and factory floor dynamics.\n\nThe key turning point in Ethan\u2019s life wasn\u2019t professional, but personal. The end of a five-year relationship two years ago left him unmoored. His ex-partner, a freelance artist, had lovingly called him \"beautifully predictable\" before leaving for someone who offered more spontaneity. The breakup was a system failure he couldn't optimize. It forced him to confront the fact that his meticulously planned life felt emotionally sterile.\n\nToday, Ethan lives in a clean, minimalist apartment in Mission Bay. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to peak efficiency; he logs into a global production dashboard from the same desk where he eats his breakfast. His days are a blur of video calls with factories in Asia and data analysis to pre-empt supply chain disruptions.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is largely professional. He lives in a neighborhood built for the industry that employs him but feels detached from the city\u2019s chaotic, vibrant soul. Lately, however, a new process has entered his life. On evenings and weekends, he has begun to practice woodworking. In the precise joinery and the scent of sawdust, he's finding a different kind of fulfillment. His dream is no longer just a flawless production line, but a small, quiet workshop of his own, where he can build something beautiful and lasting, one perfectly measured cut at a time."
