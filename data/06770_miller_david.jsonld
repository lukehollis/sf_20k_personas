He grew up in the shadow of shuttered steel mills, the son of a union mechanic and a school secretary. His formative years were marked by a pervasive sense of decline, a reality made painfully personal by his younger sister\u2019s struggle with opioid addiction, a battle she ultimately lost in her early twenties. This loss became the defining turning point of David\u2019s life, forging in him a quiet but steely resolve to fight the systemic failures that left people like his sister behind.\n\nHe fled the Midwest for college, eventually earning a Master of Public Health. He was drawn to San Francisco in the late 1990s, not by the dot-com boom, but by the city's legacy of community-led responses to the AIDS crisis. He saw a city that, despite its flaws, knew how to mobilize and care for its own. David started his career on the front lines, working in a Tenderloin clinic, his empathy and sharp intellect quickly setting him apart. He rose steadily through the ranks, his experience in the trenches giving him the credibility to lead and design programs that were practical, not just theoretical.\n\nNow, as the Director of Community Health Programs, his 0.0-mile commute means his world is both vast and incredibly small. His day consists of Zoom calls and data analysis from a meticulously organized home office overlooking his shared backyard garden. He lives with his partner of fifteen years, Julian, a landscape architect, and their rescue beagle, Harvey. His daily routine is anchored by his neighborhood: a morning coffee at Caf\u00e9 Flore, a walk through Dolores Park with Harvey, and grocery runs to the local market where the cashiers know his name.\n\nAt 50, David has no grand ambitions for wealth or power. His dream is to secure funding for a new fleet of mobile mental health clinics, bringing therapy and support directly to the city\u2019s unhoused populations. It\u2019s a continuation of the promise he made to himself decades ago: to build the safety nets that never existed for his sister, one program, one person at a time, in the city he now wholeheartedly calls home."
