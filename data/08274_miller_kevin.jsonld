Raised by a dental hygienist mother and a father who managed a chain of auto parts stores, his world was built on stability and sensible choices. Art was a poster on a classroom wall, not a career path. His quiet rebellion began not with loud music, but with library books on the Italian Renaissance.\n\nAt UC Santa Cruz, surrounded by redwoods and radical ideas, he shed his suburban skin. While his parents hoped for a business degree, Kevin found his calling in an Art History class. He fell in love not with creating art, but with decoding it\u2014understanding the context, the patronage, the stories hidden within the brushstrokes. He graduated with his Bachelor's in Art History, a degree that baffled his family.\n\nThe turning point came when he refused to move home after graduation. He spent months crashing on a friend\u2019s couch in Oakland, applying for dozens of unpaid internships before landing his current role: a live-in Research Assistant for a small, private foundation in Hayes Valley. The foundation is dedicated to preserving the work of an obscure mid-century Bay Area painter, and his 0.0-mile commute is a literal one; his small in-law apartment is on the ground floor of the Victorian that houses the archives.\n\nKevin\u2019s life is insular. He wakes, makes coffee, and walks into the next room to spend his days cataloging letters, digitizing slides, and tracing the provenance of forgotten paintings. His primary social contact is the artist\u2019s formidable 80-year-old widow, who is both his boss and a reluctant mentor. For social life, he occasionally meets a college friend for cheap beer in the Mission, but mostly keeps to himself.\n\nHe loves San Francisco from a slight remove\u2014the way the fog clings to the top of his building, the hum of the city he hears through his window. He dreams of becoming a respected curator, of one day putting together an exhibition that makes people see the world differently. He hopes to eventually break free from his monastic existence, to find a relationship and build a life beyond the archives. For now, Kevin is a quiet custodian of someone else\u2019s legacy, patiently waiting for the moment to begin his own."
