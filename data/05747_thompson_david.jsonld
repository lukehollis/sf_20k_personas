Raised by an accountant father and a high school teacher mother, his upbringing was stable, comfortable, and centered on the quiet expectation of achieving a similar middle-class life. He was a dutiful son and a good student, but a persistent, undefined restlessness hummed beneath the surface.\n\nThe turning point came during his undergraduate studies. A semester abroad in Santiago, Chile, where he volunteered with a community organizing group, shattered his comfortable worldview. He witnessed firsthand the stark lines drawn by social and economic inequality. This experience ignited a passion for social justice that rendered a conventional career path unthinkable. Upon returning, he finished his degree and immediately enrolled in a Master of Public Policy program, determined to understand the systems he now desperately wanted to change.\n\nDrawn by its reputation as a hub for progressive non-profits and social innovation, David and his long-term partner, Mateo, a landscape architect, moved to San Francisco a decade ago. David started as a case manager at a housing advocacy non-profit, working directly with clients facing eviction. He excelled, and his knack for seeing the bigger picture led to his promotion to Program Manager.\n\nNow, at 39, his life is deeply rooted in his Inner Sunset neighborhood. Since his work went fully remote, his commute is a short walk from his bedroom to the small office nook in his apartment. His days are a mix of grant writing, data analysis, and endless Zoom calls coordinating services for the city\u2019s unhoused population. He finds balance in routines: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, grabbing a coffee from his favorite spot on 9th Avenue, and evenings spent cooking with Mateo or hosting small dinners with their tight-knit circle of friends. His professional ambition isn't for wealth, but for scale\u2014to see the initiatives he manages make a tangible, lasting dent in the city\u2019s housing crisis. He dreams of a future where his work is no longer necessary."
