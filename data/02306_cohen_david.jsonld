Raised in a book-filled but emotionally reserved home in Brookline, Massachusetts, David was the son of two professors who valued intellectual debate over open affection. This environment cultivated his sharp mind but left him with a deep curiosity about the unspoken currents that governed his family. His path was irrevocably set during his undergraduate years at Brown when his younger sister's harrowing battle with an eating disorder exposed the limits of his family\u2019s analytical approach to a crisis of the soul. He felt powerless but was driven by a new purpose: to acquire the tools to truly help.\n\nHe moved west to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology at UC Berkeley, deliberately choosing the Bay Area\u2019s more expressive culture as an antidote to his staid upbringing. After graduating, he worked in community mental health in Oakland, treating severe trauma and addiction. The work was grueling but foundational, hardening his empathy into effective clinical skill. Eventually, he transitioned into private practice, establishing a respected office in San Francisco.\n\nThe key turning point in his recent life was the pandemic. Forced into telehealth, David discovered a surprising preference for the model. He sold his physical office and converted a room in his meticulously kept Noe Valley Victorian into a soundproofed, serene workspace. His commute is now a walk across the hall. His life is an integrated whole; he lives and works within the same peaceful walls, a reality he finds grounding rather than confining.\n\nHis days are structured and disciplined. Mornings begin with a brisk walk through the neighborhood with his bernedoodle, Gus, followed by back-to-back virtual sessions with clients ranging from tech executives to struggling artists. He is married to Maria, a landscape architect, and their partnership is a balance of shared silence and vibrant conversation. In the evenings, David decompresses by cooking elaborate meals, finding a meditative focus in the process. He and Maria have no children, a conscious choice that allows them freedom. His aspiration is no longer to build his practice, but to deepen his understanding, perhaps by writing a book that synthesizes his clinical insights on modern anxiety. San Francisco, for David, is the perfect container for this life\u2014a city of immense external pressures that fuels his work, and a home that provides the quiet sanctuary needed to process it all."
