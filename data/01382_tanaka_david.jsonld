His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this fact; he lives in the small two-bedroom apartment directly above the dining room, just as he has for most of his 47 years.\n\nHis upbringing was a sensory immersion in the family business. David\u2019s father, a quiet and demanding Nisei man, founded Kawa in the 1970s. David\u2019s childhood memories aren't of parks and playgrounds, but of the rhythmic chop of green onions, the steamy aroma of dashi, and the clatter of dishes being washed late into the night. He was his father\u2019s shadow, learning inventory, hospitality, and the precise temperature for frying tempura not through formal education, but through years of observation and duty.\n\nIn his late teens, David dreamed of escape. He saved money for a used camera, fantasizing about a life as a photojournalist, far from the endless cycle of lunch and dinner service. This dream, however, was a quiet rebellion that never truly launched. The turning point came when David was 25; his father suffered a major stroke, leaving him unable to continue working. The responsibility for Kawa, and for his aging parents, fell squarely on David\u2019s shoulders. He sold his camera gear to cover a sudden shortfall and never looked back.\n\nNow, David\u2019s life moves to the restaurant's rhythm. His day begins before sunrise, accepting deliveries in the alleyway. His social life consists of brief chats with longtime regulars and the familial camaraderie he shares with his small staff. Past relationships often withered, unable to compete with a business that was both his job and his home.\n\nHis quiet hope is not to leave, but to evolve. David dreams of subtly refining his father's recipes, earning a Bib Gourmand from the Michelin Guide\u2014a modern validation for a lifetime of traditional work. It\u2019s his way of honoring his father\u2019s legacy while finally making the restaurant, and his life, his own. He lives and breathes Japantown, a steadfast guardian of a small corner of his family's history, forever just a staircase away from his past and his future."
