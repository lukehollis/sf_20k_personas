Growing up with the last name Miller, she often felt she had to consciously claim her Latina identity, a dualism that bred in her a quiet determination and an ability to navigate different worlds with ease. Her parents, a nurse and a civil engineer, instilled a powerful work ethic, teaching her that success was built through structure and relentless effort.\n\nThis drive propelled her through UCLA and, subsequently, to Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business for her MBA. The Bay Area, with its intoxicating mix of innovation and ambition, felt like a natural fit. She was recruited straight into the high-stakes world of management consulting, a life of airports, boardrooms, and sterile hotel rooms. For two decades, Rebecca thrived on the pressure, embracing the relentless grind. Her world was a blur of slide decks and stakeholder meetings, her success measured in project deliverables and promotions. She became a Senior Manager, known for her sharp analysis and unflappable demeanor.\n\nThe turning point wasn't a single event, but a slow, creeping realization catalyzed by the global pandemic. Forced to work from her minimalist Noe Valley condo, the sudden stillness was jarring. Her 0.0-mile commute replaced frantic dashes to SFO with morning walks to the 24th Street cafes. For the first time, she truly inhabited her neighborhood, learning the names of the local bakers and appreciating the Victorian architecture on her daily jogs through the hills.\n\nNow, at 45, Rebecca\u2019s life is a study in controlled balance. Her days are still packed with demanding virtual meetings with clients across time zones, but they are bookended by personal rituals: tending to her balcony succulents, listening to podcasts on urban planning, and exploring new restaurants with a small, tight-knit circle of friends. Having spent years solving corporate problems, she finds herself dreaming of a new challenge\u2014pivoting her expertise to help local non-profits or mentoring young, first-generation women entering the business world. She has built a successful career in San Francisco; now, she aspires to build a meaningful life there, too."
