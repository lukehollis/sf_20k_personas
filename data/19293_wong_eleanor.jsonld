Born and raised in the Richmond District, she was the only child of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery. Her childhood was a study in contrasts: the fragrant chaos of her parents\u2019 store versus the quiet, structured world of the public library, where she sought refuge and found her calling. Books were gateways, and the card catalog was a map to infinite worlds.\n\nHer path seemed set when she enrolled at UC Berkeley, eventually earning a Master of Library and Information Science. She began her career at a university library, meticulously cataloging rare texts. However, as the dot-com boom reshaped the Bay Area in the late '90s, Eleanor saw that the future of information wasn't on shelves but on screens. This realization was her pivotal turning point. She leveraged her expertise in organization and data retrieval, pivoting into the nascent field of information architecture. She was one of the few who could speak both languages: the meticulous discipline of library science and the dynamic potential of the digital world. Her journey led her through several tech firms, culminating in her current role as a Director of Content Strategy.\n\nNow 50 and amicably divorced for three years, Eleanor lives a life of curated intention in her Hayes Valley apartment. Her daily routine begins with a strong cup of tea and the MUNI ride downtown, a 2.8-mile journey that cuts through the city\u2019s heart. Her career is demanding but fulfilling, a puzzle of data and user experience she still loves to solve.\n\nSan Francisco is not just her address; it\u2019s her anchor. She has witnessed its many reinventions, from the grit of her youth to its current tech-driven gleam. Evenings are for her monthly book club with old friends, a pottery class that grounds her in the tactile world, or simply reading by her large window overlooking the city lights. Her aspirations are no longer about climbing a career ladder but about cultivating meaning. She dreams of mentoring young women entering the tech field and plans to use her generous travel-time to visit the world's great historical libraries\u2014not as a tourist, but as a pilgrim returning to her roots."

She\u2019d slip away to the Parkside Library, tracing the embossed letters on book spines. One afternoon, she pulled out a dusty card from the catalog, its typed letters a perfect, orderly promise. In that quiet, sun-dusted silence, holding the key to another world, she felt a sense of belonging that the store\u2019s loving chaos could never provide. It was the moment she fell in love not with stories, but with their structure.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998. In the hushed halls of the university library, a student asked for a specific trade publication. Eleanor knew exactly where it was. But the student impatiently tapped on a laptop, pulling up the article on a clunky website called AltaVista. The screen\u2019s glow felt like a challenge to her whole world. A jolt of terror and exhilarating foresight ran through her. In that instant, she knew the card catalog was a relic. She had to learn the language of this new world, or be archived herself.\n\n3.\nYears after her parents sold the store, she took a walk through the old neighborhood. Where the bins of bok choy once stood, a minimalist coffee shop now served oat milk lattes. The scent of star anise was replaced by roasted espresso beans. It wasn't anger she felt, but a profound, bittersweet pang of nostalgia. The city had shed another skin, just as she had. The memory cemented her identity as a true native: someone who accepts the city\u2019s constant reinvention because she has had to do the same.\n\n4.\nThe divorce wasn't a single fight, but a quiet conversation over tea three years ago. They sat in their perfectly designed living room, and Eleanor realized they had built two beautiful, separate lives under one roof. There were no harsh words, just the deep, aching sadness of closing a beloved book you know you\u2019ll never reread. That respectful ending gave her the courage to curate a life based not on a shared future, but on her own singular, intentional present. It was a lesson in letting go with grace.\n\n5.\nJust last year, in her evening pottery class, her hands deep in wet clay, she looked out the window at the glowing Salesforce Tower. She saw not just a building, but a generation of young women navigating its digital halls. A sudden, quiet clarity washed over her. She could help guide them, grounding them with foundational principles, just as her hands were shaping the spinning clay. It was no longer about climbing, but about creating a legacy\u2014a new kind of catalog, this time of people."
