Born to a Filipino immigrant mother who worked as a nurse and an Irish-American father who was a union carpenter, she grew up in the fog-laced streets of the Excelsior District. Her childhood was a blend of vibrant Filipino community gatherings and her father\u2019s practical, grounded perspective on the city\u2019s bones. She watched firsthand as development reshaped neighborhoods, often at the expense of green spaces and community character, planting the seed for her future career.\n\nHer path was solidified at UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Urban Planning. She was fascinated not just by maps and zoning laws, but by the human and environmental soul of a city. After graduating in the early 90s, she began her career as a city planner, but grew disillusioned with the slow pace of bureaucracy. A turning point came when she worked on a controversial waterfront development project, realizing her true passion was in advocacy and mitigation. She transitioned to the private sector, finding her niche in environmental consulting, where she could directly influence projects to be more sustainable.\n\nNow a Principal Environmental Consultant, Alina is a respected authority on green building and habitat restoration. Her most significant personal turning point was an amicable divorce a decade ago, which, while painful, allowed her to pour her energy into her career and cultivate a life of peaceful independence.\n\nToday, Alina lives in a minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. Her 1.2-mile walk to her Financial District office is a cherished daily ritual, a ground-level observation of the city\u2019s pulse. Her evenings are often spent with a small circle of close friends, sharing wine and conversation, or tending to her balcony garden. Having witnessed San Francisco\u2019s booms and busts, her dream is no longer about climbing a ladder, but about leaving a legacy. She aspires to mentor young planners and influence city policy, ensuring that the San Francisco of the future remains a livable, breathable city for everyone, not just for those who can afford the view."

She was ten, clutching her father's calloused hand, watching the dusty ground where she\u2019d hunted for roly-polies disappear. He told her it was progress, building homes. But all she felt was a hot, confusing anger. It wasn\u2019t just dirt and weeds; it was a world. That day, a quiet vow formed within her: she would learn to save the small, wild places before they were gone.\n\n2.\nIt was a community hearing in the mid-90s, her city planner badge feeling heavy on her blazer. Under fluorescent lights, an old woman spoke of the shorebirds that visited the waterfront plot daily. Her testimony was dismissed with a polite, bureaucratic nod. Alina stared at the pristine architectural model on the table, a monument to everything they were ignoring. The gap between the city\u2019s process and its soul felt cavernous. She knew then she couldn't just draw the lines on the map; she had to fight for what lived within them.\n\n3.\nA few months after the boxes were unpacked and the silence in her new Hayes Valley condo became a comfort, not a void. A single, fiery orange California poppy she\u2019d planted in a pot bloomed. She stood on her balcony, a glass of wine in hand, watching the city lights blur. It wasn't a grand victory, but a quiet, profound one. This space, this life, this small, resilient bloom\u2014it was entirely hers. The pain of her amicable divorce had finally given way to peace.\n\n4.\nYears ago, she'd fought to have a forgotten creek daylighted as part of a tech campus development. The client called it an expensive hassle. Last spring, she walked the finished path. She saw office workers eating lunch by the babbling water, native mule's ears thriving on the banks. It was the antithesis of the bureaucratic hearings of her past. This was tangible, living proof that development and nature could coexist. It was the moment her work finally felt like restoration, not just mitigation.\n\n5.\nJust last year, over coffee, a young Berkeley grad showed Alina her thesis on creating wildlife corridors in the Sunset District. The student\u2019s fierce, hopeful energy was a mirror of her own past. As she listened, Alina felt a profound shift. Her ambition was no longer about winning a project or proving a point. It was about passing the torch, ensuring this fire for a greener, more humane city would continue to burn brightly long after she was gone. Her legacy wouldn't be in buildings, but in people."
