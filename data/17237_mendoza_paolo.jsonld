The son of Filipino immigrants, he grew up in the fog-shrouded neighborhoods of Daly City, just south of San Francisco. His mother, a registered nurse, worked long shifts at Seton Medical Center, often returning home with stories that spoke not just of physical ailments, but of the systemic struggles her patients faced\u2014language barriers, poverty, and lack of support. These dinner-table discussions planted the seed for Paolo\u2019s future. He saw that true healing required more than just medicine.\n\nWhile his peers at San Jose State University chased tech dreams, Paolo was drawn to social sciences. A volunteer position at a youth shelter during his junior year was his turning point. He witnessed the profound impact that a single, caring adult could have, and his path was set. He went on to earn his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on child and family services.\n\nNow 44, Paolo is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a non-profit that partners with San Francisco schools and community clinics. He is the calm voice for families in crisis, the steady hand guiding teenagers through the labyrinthine public health system. His work is emotionally taxing, dealing with trauma, housing insecurity, and mental health challenges daily.\n\nTo preserve his own well-being, Paolo has built a life of intentional calm. He lives with his partner of twelve years, Alex, a graphic designer, in a cozy Hayes Valley apartment. His most cherished ritual is his 1.2-mile walk to his office near the Civic Center. This daily commute is his buffer zone, a time to process the morning\u2019s headlines and prepare for the day\u2019s cases, and on the way home, to shed their emotional weight.\n\nPaolo\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but pragmatic. He loves the city's vibrant culture and progressive ideals but is painfully aware of the inequality he confronts in his work. His dream isn't one of wealth, but of sustainability. He hopes to one day develop a mentorship program for new social workers, helping them navigate the burnout that plagues his profession, ensuring that the city\u2019s most vulnerable will always have someone to turn to."

His mother, home from her nursing shift at Seton, described an elderly Filipino patient who kept missing appointments. It wasn't dementia; it was pride. The woman was too ashamed to tell her children she couldn't afford the MUNI fare. In that moment, Paolo understood that poverty was a sickness, too, and that true care meant seeing the whole person, not just the chart. It was the first seed of his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, volunteering at a San Jose youth shelter, he met a teen who hadn\u2019t spoken in days. Paolo didn\u2019t push. He just sat nearby, doing his own reading. Finally, the boy looked up and quietly asked what comic book he was reading. It wasn't a dramatic confession, but a simple, human connection that broke the silence. Paolo felt the immense power of just being present. He wasn't there to fix the boy; he was there to be a steady, safe space. His future path was set.\n\n3.\nHe remembers standing in the rain on Mission Street in his late twenties, feeling utterly defeated. A family he\u2019d worked with for months, a family he thought he could help stabilize, had just been evicted. The bureaucratic gears had ground them down, and him with them. The thought of quitting was a physical relief, a tempting escape from the vicarious trauma. He didn\u2019t quit, but the memory forged his resolve to one day protect new social workers from that same crushing weight.\n\n4.\nAbout eight years ago, after a devastating child welfare case, he walked into his Hayes Valley apartment feeling hollowed out. His partner, Alex, took one look at his face, didn\u2019t pry, but simply put on a quiet record and handed him a warm mug of tea. They sat in a comfortable silence that felt more restorative than any conversation. In that quiet act of care, Paolo felt his emotional armor dissolve, anchored by the sanctuary they had intentionally built together.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, on his walk home from the Civic Center, the details of a grim housing case replayed in his mind. He felt the city\u2019s failures acutely. But as he passed the SFJAZZ Center, a soaring saxophone solo spilled out from an open door, a moment of unexpected, defiant beauty. It was a sound that existed alongside all the pain. That brief melody was a reminder of why he stayed\u2014for the city's imperfect, resilient, and achingly human heart."
