            "value": "Rohan Sharma is a product of the Silicon Valley dream, though not in the way most imagine. Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants, his father a software architect and his mother a lab technician, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a quiet suburban hum of high expectations and academic pressure. While his friends were obsessed with coding, Rohan was fascinated by the physical world. A pivotal memory is dismantling the family\u2019s old VCR at age nine. Instead of scolding him, his engineer-minded father sat with him for hours, patiently explaining how each gear and circuit board worked as they reassembled it. This moment cemented his path.\n\nHe pursued Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly, embracing its \"learn by doing\" philosophy. While many of his peers were drawn to pure software, Rohan was captivated by robotics and process automation. He earned his Master\u2019s in Manufacturing Systems Engineering from Stanford, focusing on creating efficient, ethical supply chains. He now works as a Manufacturing Engineer for a company designing smart home robotics. His role is a hybrid one; most days are spent working from his meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment, but a couple of times a week, he\u2019ll visit the company's R&D lab in the Dogpatch to oversee prototype assembly lines.\n\nAt 32, Rohan\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. Mornings start with pour-over coffee while he coordinates with overseas suppliers. Afternoons are for design simulations and problem-solving. He de-stresses with runs through the Panhandle or sessions at Dogpatch Boulders, enjoying the physical problem-solving of a climbing route. Recently out of a long-term relationship, his social life revolves around a tight-knit group of college and work friends.\n\nRohan loves San Francisco for its density of ideas. He can spend his day designing a robotic arm and his evening at a jazz club or a pop-up dinner. His dream is to eventually launch his own venture: a small-scale, sustainable hardware company that utilizes local 3D printing and recycled materials, moving away from the mass-manufacturing models he currently works to optimize. He\u2019s not just passing through the city for a tech salary; he\u2019s here to build something tangible, a future as well-engineered as the machines he helps create."
