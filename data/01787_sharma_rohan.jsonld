Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants, his father a software architect and his mother a lab technician, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a quiet suburban hum of high expectations and academic pressure. While his friends were obsessed with coding, Rohan was fascinated by the physical world. A pivotal memory is dismantling the family\u2019s old VCR at age nine. Instead of scolding him, his engineer-minded father sat with him for hours, patiently explaining how each gear and circuit board worked as they reassembled it. This moment cemented his path.\n\nHe pursued Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly, embracing its \"learn by doing\" philosophy. While many of his peers were drawn to pure software, Rohan was captivated by robotics and process automation. He earned his Master\u2019s in Manufacturing Systems Engineering from Stanford, focusing on creating efficient, ethical supply chains. He now works as a Manufacturing Engineer for a company designing smart home robotics. His role is a hybrid one; most days are spent working from his meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment, but a couple of times a week, he\u2019ll visit the company's R&D lab in the Dogpatch to oversee prototype assembly lines.\n\nAt 32, Rohan\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. Mornings start with pour-over coffee while he coordinates with overseas suppliers. Afternoons are for design simulations and problem-solving. He de-stresses with runs through the Panhandle or sessions at Dogpatch Boulders, enjoying the physical problem-solving of a climbing route. Recently out of a long-term relationship, his social life revolves around a tight-knit group of college and work friends.\n\nRohan loves San Francisco for its density of ideas. He can spend his day designing a robotic arm and his evening at a jazz club or a pop-up dinner. His dream is to eventually launch his own venture: a small-scale, sustainable hardware company that utilizes local 3D printing and recycled materials, moving away from the mass-manufacturing models he currently works to optimize. He\u2019s not just passing through the city for a tech salary; he\u2019s here to build something tangible, a future as well-engineered as the machines he helps create."

His father wasn't angry, but fascinated. Instead of a scolding, Rohan got a lesson, his dad\u2019s calloused finger tracing a circuit path, explaining the logic of each spinning gear. It wasn\u2019t just about fixing something broken; it was the sudden, profound understanding that the world was a puzzle he could take apart and put back together. That day, code felt abstract, but this\u2014this was real.\n\n2.\nThe Cal Poly machine shop smelled of ozone and hot metal. It was 3 AM, and their senior project, a sorting robot, kept jamming. His teammates were furiously debugging code, but Rohan saw the flaw elsewhere. Ignoring their protests, he grabbed a file and gently beveled the edge of the aluminum chute. On the next run, the pucks slid through perfectly. The raw satisfaction of that physical fix\u2014a simple, tangible solution a thousand lines of code couldn't see\u2014felt more triumphant than any A+ he\u2019d ever earned.\n\n3.\nStanding in his empty Hayes Valley apartment for the first time, the city noise felt like a hum of potential. He looked out his window not at a landmark, but at a tangle of fire escapes, rooftops, and water towers\u2014a complex, layered system. After years of structured suburbia and a sterile Stanford campus, this felt like coming home. San Francisco wasn't just a place to work; it was a machine he could finally see himself as a vital, integrated part of. He felt a quiet click of belonging.\n\n4.\nHis fingers, raw and chalky, slipped off the bouldering hold for the third time. The gym's noise faded as he hung there, the emotional static from his recent breakup clouding his focus. He dropped to the mat, took a breath, and looked again. It wasn't about strength; it was a sequence, a physical problem to be solved. He visualized the movement\u2014hip to the wall, right foot high\u2014and on the next attempt, it flowed. That small victory felt monumental, a moment of pure, physical clarity that silenced everything else.\n\n5.\nIt was a sourcing trip to a recycling plant that truly changed him. Standing before a mountain of discarded phones and smart devices\u2014some just a year or two old\u2014he felt a sickening complicity. He was an expert at optimizing the very systems that created this electronic graveyard. The sheer scale of the waste wasn't an abstraction on a spreadsheet; it was a physical monument to inefficiency. In that moment, his vague dream of a sustainable hardware company became an absolute, driving necessity."
