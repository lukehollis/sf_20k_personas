He was raised in Oakland, the son of a Colombian immigrant mother who ran a small catering business from their kitchen and an Italian-American father, a proud union carpenter. His childhood was a vibrant mix of cumbia and classic rock, arepas and pasta. From a young age, Mateo watched his parents navigate the labyrinth of city permits, labor disputes, and the economic anxieties that rippled through their working-class neighborhood. This instilled in him a deep conviction that policy wasn't abstract; it was the force that determined if his mother\u2019s business could expand or if his father\u2019s crew had work.\n\nHis path was set during the 2008 recession. Seeing families lose their homes fueled his drive to understand the systems that governed their lives. He attended UC Berkeley, working his way through college before earning a Master\u2019s in Public Policy from the Goldman School. He chose public service over more lucrative private-sector offers, starting as a junior aide and diligently working his way up. Now, as a Senior Legislative Aide, he spends his days drafting legislation on housing, transit, and small business support\u2014the very issues that shaped his youth.\n\nToday, Mateo lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood that reminds him of home but also serves as a constant, visceral reminder of the city's affordability crisis. His 3.5-mile commute on the J Church streetcar is his time to decompress, listening to policy podcasts or simply watching the city wake up. Evenings are often spent at late community meetings, but he cherishes the moments he can share a bottle of wine with his partner, Lena, a public school teacher, or play soccer with friends at Dolores Park.\n\nMateo\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city not as a tech playground, but as a complex organism of interconnected communities. His quiet aspiration, the one he shares only with Lena, is to one day run for a seat on the Board of Supervisors himself. He doesn't just want to advise on policy; he wants to be the one fighting for the city that his parents, and so many like them, helped build."

But that day, the smell was soured by the sight of her staring at a letter from the county, her shoulders slumped in defeat over a permit violation. His father\u2019s hand, calloused from his tools, rested on her back. Mateo felt a hot, helpless anger. Policy wasn\u2019t a word in a textbook; it was a piece of paper that could silence the sizzle of his mother\u2019s stove. It was the moment he knew he had to understand the rules.\n\n2.\nIn late 2008, the Ramirez family\u2019s house two doors down went quiet. He watched from his window as they packed a U-Haul, their daughter clutching the soccer ball they used to kick around. The foreclosure sign felt like a physical blow to the block. It wasn't an economic statistic; it was the empty space where his neighbors used to be. That hollowed-out feeling cemented his path to UC Berkeley. He wasn\u2019t just going to college; he was going to learn how to fight back for families like the Ramirezes.\n\n3.\nHis first year as a junior aide, he sat in the back of a stuffy community room in the Excelsior, taking notes. An elderly Filipino woman, gripping the microphone stand, spoke tearfully about her landlord doubling the rent on her small shop. Her voice cracked, but her dignity was absolute. In that moment, the spreadsheets and policy memos on his desk transformed into her face. This was the work. It wasn't about politics; it was about protecting the city's soul, one person, one small business at a time.\n\n4.\nIt was a warm evening a few years ago. He and Lena sat on the fire escape of their Mission apartment, sharing a bottle of wine and watching the city lights flicker on. With his heart pounding, he finally confessed his quiet dream of running for Supervisor. He expected a practical discussion, but instead, Lena just squeezed his hand and said, \u201cOf course you will. They need you.\u201d Her immediate, unwavering belief made a distant ambition feel solid, tangible, and suddenly, incredibly urgent.\n\n5.\nMost mornings on the J Church, he watches the city wake up. One day, the streetcar lurched to a stop and he saw a construction crew\u2014men like his father\u2014sharing coffee from a thermos, laughing. Across the street, the owner of a small bakery swept her sidewalk. In that brief tableau, he saw the city he fights for: not the headlines, but the people who build it, feed it, and keep it going. The commute isn't just a ride; it's a daily recommitment to them."
