He grew up in the quiet, manicured suburbs of Palo Alto, the only child of a software engineer and a high school history teacher. His upbringing was one of intellectual curiosity and civic responsibility, where dinner table conversations often revolved around current events and the mechanics of societal progress. This environment instilled in him a belief that complex problems could be solved with enough data, empathy, and well-designed systems.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line north. He attended UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree in Political Science, where the campus's activist spirit sharpened his focus from abstract theory to tangible urban issues. It was an internship with a local housing nonprofit in Oakland that cemented his path. For the first time, he saw how policy decisions made in distant government buildings directly impacted families' access to shelter and stability. This experience propelled him to pursue a Master of Public Policy, also at Berkeley, determined to work from within the system.\n\nUpon graduating, David accepted a junior analyst position with the City and County of San Francisco and never left. Over two decades, he has steadily worked his way up to a senior policy analyst role, focusing on transportation and infrastructure. His key turning point was helping draft the early framework for the city\u2019s bike lane expansion in the late 2000s. Seeing the painted lanes appear on streets he walked every day was a profound validation of his quiet, meticulous work.\n\nNow 45 and single after a long-term relationship ended amicably a few years prior, David\u2019s life is rooted in his Hayes Valley apartment. The pandemic solidified his remote work status, shrinking his world to a few blocks but deepening his connection to his neighborhood. His day begins with a coffee from a local cafe, followed by hours at his desk, analyzing traffic flow data and drafting policy memos. He breaks for lunch with a walk through Patricia's Green, observing the very public life he works to organize.\n\nHis social life is small but solid, consisting of a few colleagues and old university friends. His hope isn't for wealth or power, but for something more lasting: to one day ride a new light-rail line he helped plan, a tangible legacy of a better-functioning, more equitable San Francisco."
