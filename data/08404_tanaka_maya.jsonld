A third-generation Californian raised in the quiet suburbs of San Jose, she was the pragmatic daughter of a civil engineer and a high school math teacher. Her upbringing was one of stability, order, and the gentle expectation that she would follow a similar, sensible path. She obliged, at first, enrolling at UC Santa Cruz and earning a bachelor's degree in Sociology, fascinated by the patterns that govern human behavior.\n\nThe turning point came during her senior year. While her peers planned for grad school or non-profit work, Maya felt a disconnect between sociological theory and tangible impact. She discovered a passion for statistics in a required course, realizing she preferred finding stories in numbers rather than texts. After graduating, she completed an intensive data analytics bootcamp, translating her understanding of social systems into the language of code and databases. This pivot felt less like a betrayal of her degree and more like its logical, modern conclusion.\n\nNow 28, Maya lives and works in a sunny one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet start to the day; she trades a crowded BART train for a walk to a local panaderia for coffee and a pastry before logging on. As a data analyst for a major fintech company, she spends her days wrangling spreadsheets and building visualizations, her mind immersed in a world of abstract figures.\n\nTo counteract the digital isolation, her life outside of work is deliberately analog. She is a regular at Mission Cliffs climbing gym, finding focus on the holds, and has a small circle of close friends she meets for trivia nights or Dolores Park picnics. She loves the Mission for its vibrant murals and rich history, even as she feels a quiet guilt about being part of the tech wave changing it.\n\nMaya\u2019s dream is to bridge the two halves of her life. She aspires to eventually use her data skills for social good, perhaps for a housing advocacy group or an urban planning non-profit. She wants to use her analytical mind not just to optimize revenue streams, but to understand and improve the complex, beautiful, and chaotic city she now calls home."
