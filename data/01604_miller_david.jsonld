The son of a transient linguistics professor and a librarian, David\u2019s upbringing was a patchwork of university towns across the Midwest. He never belonged to one place, fostering a chameleon-like ability to adapt and a quiet self-reliance. While his parents worshipped the written word, David found his language in the structured logic of early computer systems. He spent his teens deconstructing and rebuilding desktop towers, finding solace in the clean binary of a world he could control.\n\nHe eschewed a traditional university path, seeing it as four more years of the academic transient life he\u2019d always known. Instead, he built a career from the ground up, starting with freelance tech support. The defining turning point came when his mother faced a prolonged illness. David witnessed firsthand the frustrating tangle of outdated hospital software and lost digital records. The experience ignited a new purpose: to fix the broken digital plumbing of the systems meant to heal people. He earned certifications online, specializing in healthcare IT, and transformed his raw talent into a focused, valuable profession.\n\nDrawn to the Bay Area's nexus of technology and progressive thinking during the late 2000s, David found a home. He settled in the Inner Richmond for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its calmer, residential feel. His days are structured by a disciplined routine. As a remote Healthcare IT Support Specialist, his commute is a zero-mile walk from his bed to his desk. He troubleshoots network errors for a hospital system on the East Coast, his mornings synced to their time zone. Afternoons are his own, usually spent on long, meditative walks through the park or browsing the dusty shelves of Green Apple Books.\n\nHis social circle is small but sturdy, comprised of a few friends from a long-running board game group. Though content in his quiet life, David dreams of leveraging his skills more directly. He aspires to volunteer his expertise to build a secure patient management system for a local free clinic, a tangible way to connect his work back to the community he now calls home. For David, success isn\u2019t about climbing a corporate ladder, but about achieving a state of quiet competence and meaningful contribution."
