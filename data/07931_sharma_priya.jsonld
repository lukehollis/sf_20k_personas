Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants, she was raised in a home that smelled of cardamom and ambition. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a homemaker who championed education, envisioned a future for Priya in medicine or engineering. Priya, however, was always more fascinated by the systems *behind* the information\u2014the quiet logic of libraries and the elegant structure of language.\n\nWhile her parents celebrated her acceptance to UC Berkeley, they were quietly puzzled by her choice to major in Linguistics. This was the first of many decisions where Priya followed her own distinct path. After graduation, she pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, a degree that seemed archaic to her tech-centric family but felt like a key to unlocking the world for her. Her early career was spent organizing archives at a university library, a role she found deeply satisfying. The turning point came a decade ago when a burgeoning tech startup, drowning in its own disorganized data, headhunted her. They didn't need a coder; they needed an architect of knowledge.\n\nNow 42, Priya is a Senior Information Specialist, working remotely from her serene Cole Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a deliberate daily routine: a morning walk to Reverie Cafe for an oat milk latte, hours of focused work creating taxonomies and knowledge management systems for her company, and an evening spent with her book club or tending to her balcony garden. A significant breakup in her late thirties prompted her to buy this condo, cementing her identity as a self-reliant San Franciscan.\n\nHer connection to the city isn't rooted in its nightlife or hustle, but in its neighborhoods and proximity to nature. Weekends are for hiking trips in Marin with a close-knit group of friends or volunteering at the San Francisco Public Library. Her deepest aspiration is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder, but about synthesis. Priya dreams of taking a sabbatical to write a book on the philosophy of information, exploring how we organize our digital lives. For her, San Francisco is the perfect backdrop\u2014a city of constant innovation where she has carved out a space of thoughtful, structured peace."
