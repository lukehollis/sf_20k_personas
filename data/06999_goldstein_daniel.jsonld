            "value": "Daniel Goldstein was supposed to follow the script. Raised in an affluent Millbrae household by a doctor and a lawyer, his path was pre-paved: a good university, a professional degree, and a respectable career. He enrolled in Business Administration at San Francisco State, dutifully attending classes that felt abstract and disconnected from the world. To pay for his apartment and social life, he took a part-time job as a busser at a bustling Italian restaurant in North Beach. That was the turning point. He fell in love not with business theory, but with the controlled chaos of the dinner rush, the camaraderie of the kitchen staff, and the immediate, tangible satisfaction of a well-run service.\n\nAfter two years, he dropped out of college, a decision that caused a significant rift with his family. Daniel, however, had found his classroom. He worked his way up with relentless energy: from server to bartender, absorbing every detail about inventory, scheduling, and managing personalities. His talent for de-escalating conflicts with demanding patrons and motivating a tired team became his signature skill. Now, at 32, he is the respected General Manager of \"Vero,\" a chic and perennially busy Hayes Valley restaurant.\n\nHis life is intrinsically woven into his work. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small, modern apartment directly above the restaurant, an umbilical cord to his profession. His day begins not with an alarm clock, but with the distant clatter of the prep cooks arriving downstairs. His social circle is his \"work family\"\u2014the chefs, servers, and sommeliers with whom he shares post-shift drinks and gossips about industry news. The neighborhood is his world; he knows the owner of the corner market by name and gets his morning coffee from the barista who is also one of his regulars.\n\nThough proud of his success at Vero, Daniel dreams of ownership. He diligently sets aside a portion of his salary, his eyes on a small, shuttered space he\u2019s spotted in the Outer Richmond. His vision isn\u2019t another trendy hotspot, but a cozy, unpretentious neighborhood bistro\u2014a place built on his own terms, reflecting the grit and passion he discovered all those years ago when he traded a diploma for an apron."
