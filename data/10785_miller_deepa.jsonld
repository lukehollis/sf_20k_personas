Born and raised in the Richmond District, she is the daughter of an Indian immigrant father, a retired engineer, and a Caucasian mother, a former public-school teacher. Their interfaith marriage, though initially met with some familial skepticism, instilled in Deepa a strong sense of cultural understanding and the importance of bridging divides.  Growing up surrounded by the diverse communities of the Richmond fueled her early passion for helping others.\n\nHer educational journey began at UC Berkeley, where a transformative introductory sociology class ignited her drive to effect social change. She pursued a master's in social work, specializing in clinical practice, at San Francisco State University, recognizing the systemic barriers faced by vulnerable populations in her own city. Her career path led her through various non-profits focusing on youth development before she landed a position as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the public-school system. This role allows her to work directly with students facing challenges related to trauma, mental health, and socioeconomic disparities.\n\nA key turning point was witnessing the profound impact of adequate social services on a struggling student's life; it solidified her conviction in the power of her profession. Deepa\u2019s personal life is anchored by her strong friendships forged over years in different San Francisco neighborhoods, from college days in the Inner Sunset to evenings in the Mission catching live music. She is also close to her parents, who still reside in the Richmond, and her younger brother, a tech worker in the South Bay.\n\nDeepa currently lives in a cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she cherishes for its blend of cultural authenticity and quiet residential streets. Her mornings begin with the predictable rumble of the 38 Geary bus, her daily commute a familiar ritual. She enjoys evenings exploring Golden Gate Park or trying new restaurants with friends. Her professional aspirations include advocating for increased mental health resources in schools and potentially opening a small private practice focused on immigrant and first-generation clients. Deepa dreams of a more equitable San Francisco, where all residents have the support they need to thrive. Her life is a testament to her dedication to serving her community, one counseling session and bus ride at a time."

This sensory mix, unique to her childhood, was a constant reminder of her family's diverse roots and the beauty of two cultures intertwined. It fostered an early appreciation for bridging differences. (Childhood)\n\n2. Sitting in that first Berkeley sociology lecture, the professor's words about systemic inequality felt like a lightning strike. It wasn\u2019t just academic; it was a visceral understanding of why some kids she knew faced harder struggles. It crystallized her desire to turn empathy into action. (College)\n\n3. The quiet gratitude in a student's eyes after their family finally got access to essential services she helped them navigate. Seeing that tangible relief, that glimmer of hope, solidified her belief in the vital power of her social work. It was a profound validation of her career path. (Early Career)\n\n4. Late nights talking on park benches in the Inner Sunset with friends, sharing fears and dreams under the fog-filtered streetlights. These conversations, built on trust and shared experiences, formed the bedrock of lasting friendships that continue to anchor her. (College Years/Early Adulthood)\n\n5. The familiar rumble of the 38 Geary bus each morning, a consistent rhythm in the ever-changing city. It's more than just transportation; it\u2019s a daily reconnection with the vibrant pulse of her neighborhood and her work serving its residents. It reinforces her sense of belonging and purpose.
