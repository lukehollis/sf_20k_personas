The son of a pragmatic software engineer from Mumbai and a thoughtful history teacher from Sacramento, he grew up navigating the cultural confluence of his family\u2019s suburban home. His father\u2019s surname felt like a constant, quiet question mark next to his South Asian features. This dual perspective made him a natural observer, more comfortable analyzing situations than being at the center of them.\n\nThe turning point came at seventeen when his maternal grandmother in India passed away from complications of diabetes, a manageable disease that became fatal due to inconsistent access to quality care. The injustice of it\u2014a life lost not to an incurable illness but to systemic failure\u2014ignited a quiet fury in him. It channeled his analytical mind away from abstract sciences and towards the human element of data. He pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Public Health at UC Davis, followed by a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Epidemiology from a Bay Area university, which brought him to San Francisco.\n\nNow 24, Rohan works as a Research Analyst from his small, tidy apartment in the Duboce Triangle. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured by data sets and virtual meetings. He spends hours dissecting health disparities in different populations, his work a direct echo of the personal tragedy that shaped his career path. His daily routine is solitary: a morning run through the Panhandle, hours immersed in spreadsheets, and an evening walk to a local market, often with headphones playing podcasts on urban policy.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is more academic than social. He sees the city as a living laboratory, observing the stark wellness gaps between the Tenderloin and Pacific Heights on his weekend walks. While professionally fulfilled, his social life is still developing; his primary connections are a few friends from his graduate program. Rohan\u2019s dream is to see his research translate into tangible policy changes that improve healthcare access for vulnerable communities. Privately, he hopes to build a life in San Francisco that is as connected and vibrant as the data he strives to understand, to finally close the distance between observing the community and being truly part of it."
