The only child of pragmatic immigrants from Hong Kong, her father an engineer and her mother a meticulous seamstress, Mei-ling\u2019s childhood was a study in quiet observation. While her parents envisioned a stable future for her in medicine or law, she was drawn to the subtle artistry in her mother\u2019s patterns and the stark geometry of the city's architecture.\n\nHer time at UC Berkeley was a quiet rebellion. Publicly enrolled in economics to appease her family, she secretly devoured art history courses. The vibrant, often confrontational art of the Bay Area spoke to her more than any economic theory. This passion culminated in a fateful decision: she abandoned her parents\u2019 path and pursued a Master\u2019s in Curatorial Studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The move caused a rift with her father that took years to heal, but it solidified her identity.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, Mei-ling climbed the gallery ladder with a fierce, focused energy. The turning point arrived a decade ago when the small, respected SoMa gallery where she worked faced closure. Its aging owner, her mentor, was ready to retire. In a move of staggering risk and faith, Mei-ling poured her life savings and secured loans from patrons to buy the gallery, renaming it \"Vessel Contemporary.\" To make it work, she moved into the small apartment above the exhibition space, making her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nNow 52, Mei-ling\u2019s life is inextricably woven into her work. Her apartment is a minimalist sanctuary, a stark contrast to the challenging art she champions below. Mornings are for coffee and emails overlooking the silent gallery, while days are a whirlwind of artist studio visits, patron lunches, and meticulous installation planning. She is single, her great loves having been the art she nurtures and the artists she discovers. Her social circle is a tight-knit community of collectors, critics, and the artists who have become her chosen family. San Francisco is not just her home; it is her canvas and her cause. Her dream is to ensure that in a city increasingly defined by code, the vital, unpredictable language of art continues to have a place to speak."
