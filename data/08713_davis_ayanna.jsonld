Raised in Oakland by a pragmatic family\u2014a teacher mother and a postal worker father\u2014she was taught the value of stability. Art was a decoration, not a career. Yet, it was the vibrant murals of the East Bay and school trips to SFMOMA that truly captivated her. Bucking expectations, she crossed the bridge for college, enrolling at San Francisco State University. She majored in Communications, a practical compromise, but her heart was in her Art History minor.\n\nAfter graduating, she landed a marketing job at a downtown tech firm, embracing the predictable salary and routine her parents approved of. For nearly a decade, she crafted campaigns for software nobody seemed passionate about. The work was hollow. The turning point came not as an epiphany, but as a layoff during a market downturn. At 32, adrift and disillusioned, Ayanna saw it as a sign. She took a significant pay cut to accept an entry-level position at a small, beloved Mission District theater company. It felt like coming home.\n\nNow 41, Ayanna is the Marketing Coordinator for a respected arts nonprofit. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a peaceful haven from the city's frantic energy. Her commute is zero miles; she works from her bright, plant-filled living room, coordinating social media campaigns and writing press releases that champion emerging local artists. Her life is woven into the neighborhood's fabric: morning coffee from a Clement Street cafe, afternoon walks through the Presidio, and weekends spent exploring the de Young Museum. Her friends are a tight-knit circle of fellow arts administrators, curators, and creators who understand the unique rewards and sacrifices of their field.\n\nAyanna\u2019s dream is to become a Marketing Director, to have a seat at the table where programming decisions are made. She envisions a future where she can launch initiatives that give a platform to the city\u2019s most marginalized voices. On quiet evenings, she sometimes pulls out her old film camera, a relic from her college days, and feels the flicker of a personal ambition: to not just market art, but to create it once again."
