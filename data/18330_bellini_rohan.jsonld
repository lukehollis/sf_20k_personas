Born in Fremont to a first-generation Indian mother, a dedicated nurse, and a second-generation Italian-American father, the head chef at a beloved San Jose trattoria, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a vibrant mix of cultures. He grew up understanding both the precise comfort of a well-made dal and the boisterous joy of a Sunday pasta dinner. It was watching his mother, however, navigate the bureaucratic and often inequitable healthcare system for her patients that planted the seed for his own path. He saw her frustration not with the individuals, but with the systemic barriers to wellness.\n\nHe pursued a Public Health degree at UC Davis, initially drawn to the data and policy aspects. A key turning point came during his junior year while volunteering at a community clinic in Sacramento. He spent weeks helping uninsured families access basic nutritional counseling and teen health services, realizing that policy papers meant little without effective, on-the-ground programs. This experience solidified his calling: to bridge the gap between policy and people. After graduating, he moved to San Francisco, drawn to its concentration of mission-driven non-profits.\n\nNow 32, Rohan is a Program Manager for a large non-profit, overseeing health and wellness initiatives in public schools. His days are a mix of grant writing, school site visits, and mentoring a team of health educators. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in NoPa, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its vibrant mix of old-school diners and trendy coffee shops. His 2.5-mile commute on the 21-Hayes bus is his dedicated podcast time, catching up on urban policy and public health journals.\n\nHis personal life is grounded. He and his partner, Maya, a landscape architect, share a love for urban hiking and exploring the city\u2019s diverse culinary scene, a nod to his father\u2019s legacy. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of vast wealth, but of scalable impact. He hopes to eventually become a director, shaping city-wide youth wellness strategies. He feels a deep, if sometimes complicated, love for San Francisco\u2014a city of immense beauty and glaring disparity. For Rohan, living here isn\u2019t just about a career; it\u2019s about being part of the ongoing, challenging work of making the city better for everyone."

His mother was on the phone, her voice calm but firm, fighting an insurance company over a patient's prescription. He\u2019d never forget the look on her face: a quiet fury not at a person, but at a broken system. In that moment, he saw her work wasn't just a job; it was a righteous battle fought with compassion and paperwork. That\u2019s when he first understood that caring for people meant fighting for them.\n\n2.\nThe pamphlet was dense, full of clinical terms. Rohan, then 21 and volunteering at the Sacramento clinic, watched a mother try to decipher the nutritional guide for her newly diabetic son. He found a simple, illustrated version in Spanish in a back-office drawer and handed it to her. The wave of relief that washed over her face was a physical force, a current of purpose that his policy textbooks had never given him. It was the moment the abstract idea of \"access\" became the tangible act of \"helping.\"\n\n3.\nHis first week on the job, riding the 21-Hayes home, he felt a surge of triumphant belonging. Through the foggy glass, he saw the majestic cypress trees of the Panhandle. Then, his eyes fell on a woman near the front, muttering in profound distress, her need as vast and visible as the park. The city\u2019s beauty and its pain hit him at once, a gut-punch of reality. This, he realized, was the work: holding both the beauty and the brokenness, and refusing to look away from either.\n\n4.\nIt was a blustery afternoon at the Lands End labyrinth two years ago. As they walked, Maya pointed out the restored coastal scrub, explaining the delicate work of healing an ecosystem. Rohan saw the parallel instantly. He managed programs to heal human systems; she coaxed life back into the land. Looking from the Golden Gate Bridge to her face, he felt a quiet, powerful click. His love for the city and his love for her were intertwined, both rooted in the patient work of making things whole again.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a site visit at a middle school, he watched a health educator he\u2019d mentored lead a session on anxiety. Rohan stayed in the back, observing. A notoriously shy seventh-grader, a boy who barely spoke in class, raised his hand and haltingly described the knot in his stomach before tests. In the affirming nods of the other students, Rohan saw his grant proposals and strategy meetings made real. It was a quiet, fierce pride\u2014the feeling of a single, crucial connection being forged in a system he was helping to build."
