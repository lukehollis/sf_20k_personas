            "value": "David Wong is as San Franciscan as the fog rolling through the Richmond District, the neighborhood where he was born and still lives. The only child of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store on Clement Street, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American aspiration. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a practical career in business or engineering, David\u2019s passion was for stories. He defied their gentle expectations and enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Comparative Literature.\n\nHis post-college years were a drift. David worked at a bookstore, wrote freelance articles for local zines, and felt the immense pressure of San Francisco\u2019s cost of living. The literary life he envisioned felt perpetually out of reach. In his late twenties, a friend referred him for a content writing gig at a burgeoning tech startup. He discovered his knack for storytelling could be monetized in the world of marketing. He wasn\u2019t passionate about software, but he was good at crafting a narrative around it. He found a stable, if unexciting, niche and settled into a career as a Marketing Coordinator.\n\nThe key turning point in David\u2019s life came five years ago with the passing of his father. He and his widowed mother decided to keep the family home, converting the lower in-law unit for her while he took the main house. This event cemented his place in the city, freeing him from the renter\u2019s anxieties that plagued his peers.\n\nToday, David\u2019s 0.0-mile commute defines his rhythm. His day begins with coffee from a local cafe, followed by hours of remote work from his spare bedroom office. He\u2019s a familiar face in Golden Gate Park, where he takes long afternoon walks to clear his head. His social life is small but deep: weekly dim sum with his mother, and bi-monthly drinks with a handful of friends from college. He feels a profound connection to the Richmond\u2019s quiet streets, the family-owned bakeries, and the scent of the ocean on the wind. At 40, he is content but harbors a quiet dream: to finally write that novel, a story about his family, their grocery store, and the ever-changing soul of his hometown."
