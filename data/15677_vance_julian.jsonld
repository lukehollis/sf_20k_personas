Growing up in a landscape dominated by strip malls and six-lane roads, his childhood was a series of car rides between homogenous subdivisions. The lack of a true, walkable center instilled in him a deep yearning for community and place. This reaction against his upbringing propelled him to UC Berkeley for his graduate degree in Urban Planning, where the vibrant, human-scale cities of the Bay Area felt like a revelation.\n\nHis career began in the trenches of municipal government, learning the frustrating but necessary dance of zoning laws and community board meetings. The 2008 financial crisis was a turning point. Seeing ambitious, well-designed projects shelved for speculative, soulless developments hardened his resolve. He transitioned to the private sector, joining a prestigious San Francisco firm where he believed he could influence projects from the inside. Now a Principal Planner, Julian specializes in transit-oriented development and public space revitalization, earning a comfortable living shaping the city he adopted.\n\nHome is a tastefully restored Edwardian flat in Hayes Valley, shared with his partner, Clara, a director at an environmental nonprofit. His 3.8-mile commute is a daily ritual of observation. He forgoes headphones on the Muni bus, preferring to absorb the city\u2019s rhythm, mentally noting the success of a new bike lane or the failure of a poorly placed bus shelter. Evenings often involve quiet dinners with Clara, debating housing policy and climate resilience, or walks to their favorite neighborhood wine bar.\n\nJulian\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city as a complex organism he is tasked with helping to heal and grow. His greatest aspiration isn\u2019t to design a single landmark tower, but to see a neighborhood plan he authored\u2014one that prioritizes green space, affordability, and walkability\u2014come to fruition and thrive for generations. He still feels the ghost of that Phoenix sprawl, a constant reminder of what he works to prevent. For Julian, every public plaza and protected bike lane is a quiet victory in his lifelong quest to build a more connected world."

Walking through North Berkeley\u2019s Gourmet Ghetto, the scent of fresh bread from The Cheeseboard Collective mixed with the murmur of a dozen different conversations. No one was in a car. He felt a profound, almost dizzying sense of arrival, the antidote to a thousand air-conditioned drives past Phoenix strip malls. This feeling\u2014of vibrant, human-scale life\u2014wasn't an academic concept anymore. It was a tangible future he had to help build.\n\n2.\nThe Mission Creek Commons project was a gut punch. In 2008, he had the plans pinned above his dreary municipal cubicle: affordable units, a community garden, a daycare. Then the crash hit. The city sold the land to a developer who threw up a gray stucco box with tiny windows and zero public space. Julian watched it being built on his commute, a monument to compromised ideals. That bitterness didn't break him; it hardened him, convincing him that real influence wasn\u2019t in public hearings but in the private boardrooms where the deals were made.\n\n3.\nHe\u2019ll never forget the first time he saw a family use the protected bike lane on Valencia that his firm had spent two years fighting for. From his seat on the 14-Mission bus, he watched a father pedal calmly while his young daughter, maybe six years old, followed on her scooter, completely safe from traffic. The father\u2019s shoulders were relaxed, not tensed with fear. It was a small, fleeting scene, a quiet victory. To Julian, it felt more significant and lasting than any skyscraper he could ever help design.\n\n4.\nOne warm evening last summer, he and Clara were walking home from their favorite wine bar. As they passed the Proxy walk-in theater, a crowd was gathered, laughing at an old film projected onto the shipping container wall. He\u2019d advocated for that interim use permit, arguing for activation over vacancy. Clara squeezed his hand, her knowing smile reflecting the soft projector light. In that moment, his professional and personal worlds merged perfectly. This, he thought\u2014building a life and a city you love, with the person you love\u2014this was the entire point.\n\n5.\nAbout a year ago, a weekend errand took him to a big-box store near the Cow Palace. Trapped in the vast parking lot, surrounded by an ocean of asphalt shimmering under the sun, he felt a phantom heat wash over him\u2014the dry, oppressive heat of a Phoenix childhood. For a disorienting second, he couldn\u2019t tell the difference. The sight of the endless, characterless sprawl filled him with the old, familiar emptiness. The feeling wasn't nostalgia; it was fuel, a visceral reminder of the ghost he was still working so hard to banish."
