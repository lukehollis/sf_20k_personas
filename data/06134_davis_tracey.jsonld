            "value": "Tracey Davis is part of the invisible bedrock that keeps San Francisco running. Born and raised just over the city line in Daly City, she grew up viewing San Francisco as a glittering, slightly chaotic world next door. Her father was a union plumber and her mother a homemaker; their lives were defined by practicality and stability, values they instilled in Tracey. She was never one for grand ambitions, preferring the comfort of a predictable path.\n\nAfter high school, she enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Office Administration. The degree was a tool, not a passion, designed to secure a steady job with benefits. Her break came in her early twenties when a temp position in the city\u2019s Department of Public Works became permanent. For nearly thirty years, Tracey has been an administrative assistant there. She has outlasted four mayors, countless supervisors, and the entire dot-com boom and bust. She is the institutional memory of her division, the person who knows which archaic form is needed for a tree-planting permit or who to call when a street-sweeping schedule goes haywire.\n\nHer personal life has been similarly quiet. A brief marriage in her late twenties ended amicably, leaving her with a sense of self-reliance she has carried since. The most significant turning point in her life was the city-wide shift to remote work. Her 0.0-mile commute now consists of walking from her bedroom to a small desk in the corner of her Inner Richmond apartment. She misses the low-grade chatter of the office and the shared camaraderie over stale coffee, connections now reduced to Microsoft Teams messages.\n\nHer days follow a comfortable rhythm: processing digital paperwork, a lunchtime walk to a favorite bakery on Clement Street, and evenings with her cat and a library book. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of nightlife or tech innovation, but of infrastructure and deep-rooted familiarity. She dreams not of changing the world, but of a quiet retirement, perhaps taking a cross-country train trip. Her greatest hope is simply for the city she has served her entire adult life to find its footing again, one repaired sidewalk and unclogged drain at a time."
