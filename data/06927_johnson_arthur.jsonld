            "value": "Arthur Johnson exists as the steady, beating heart of the Nob Hill luxury apartment building he calls home. Raised in a small, working-class town in Ohio, his future once seemed straightforward: follow in his father\u2019s footsteps as a mechanic. He was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling in a state school with vague engineering ambitions, but his academic journey was cut short after three semesters when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. Arthur returned home, trading textbooks for tool belts to support his family, and never looked back.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in his late twenties, following a girlfriend who was chasing a tech dream. The relationship dissolved within a year, but Arthur, surprisingly, found his footing. The city\u2019s constant need for skilled, reliable tradespeople meant he was never out of work. He started as a general handyman, his reputation for fixing what others couldn't growing with each job. His big break came when he was hired onto the maintenance staff of his current building. Over a decade, he rose from technician to manager, and when the live-in facilities manager position opened up, he was the only logical choice.\n\nNow, at 49, Arthur\u2019s life is his work. His commute is a 30-second elevator ride from his modest one-bedroom apartment to the basement office. He is a ghost in the machine of 200 lives, knowing who\u2019s having plumbing issues, whose dog barks too much, and which elevator motor has a particular whine before it acts up. His social life is sparse; a quiet divorce years ago taught him that being on-call 24/7 left little room for a partner. His connections are the doormen he shares a nod with, the residents who offer a polite hello, and the bartender at a nearby pub where he watches the Giants play.\n\nArthur feels a quiet pride in his domain, a concrete and steel kingdom he keeps humming. He holds no grand aspirations for wealth, but deep down, he nurtures a dream of saving enough to buy a small house in Sonoma, a place with a yard where the only thing he\u2019d have to fix is his own screen door."
