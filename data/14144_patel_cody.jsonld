He grew up in Daly City, the only child of a single mother who worked two jobs to keep them afloat. The name Patel comes from his stepfather, Raj, a kind electrician who entered his life when Cody was eight. While Cody never clicked with textbooks, he flourished under Raj\u2019s tutelage, learning to diagnose wiring problems and fix leaky pipes. This hands-on education in how the world *works* became the foundation of his life.\n\nAfter graduating high school with a GED, Cody felt adrift. He bypassed college, opting instead for a series of maintenance jobs. His turning point came at 24, working as a handyman for a biotech research firm in Mission Bay. A meticulous and insightful supervisor saw his potential, noting Cody\u2019s knack for pre-empting problems, not just fixing them. She mentored him, pushing him to get certifications in HVAC and building management. Over a decade, Cody climbed the ranks through sheer competence and reliability, eventually becoming the Facilities Manager for the entire campus. He now oversees the complex systems\u2014from sensitive lab ventilation to seismic retrofitting\u2014that allow brilliant scientists to do their work, a role he takes immense pride in.\n\nCody lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His day begins before sunrise, catching the 38R Geary bus for the short commute. His life is structured and methodical. He finds satisfaction in a perfectly balanced HVAC system and a smoothly executed emergency drill. His social life is small but solid, centered on a few old friends, Giants games, and a weekly trivia night at a neighborhood pub. He is quietly content but not complacent. His primary dream is to leverage his steady income and save enough for a down payment on a small condo, perhaps in the same neighborhood. For Cody, ownership isn't about status; it\u2019s the ultimate expression of the stability and self-reliance his stepfather taught him all those years ago in their garage."

Raj patiently traced the wiring, explaining the flow of current like it was a story. He let Cody hold the soldering iron, guiding his hand to mend the frayed connection. When the lamp flickered on, the warm glow felt like a secret he\u2019d been let in on. It was the first time he understood that you could know how the world worked without ever opening a book.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he stood in a friend\u2019s backyard during a going-away party for college. Surrounded by talk of majors and dorm life, he felt a profound sense of being other. It wasn\u2019t envy, but a hollow feeling of being unequipped for the path everyone else was on. Gripping a beer bottle, he watched the fog roll over Daly City and felt a quiet, hard resolve form in his gut: he would have to build his future differently, with tools instead of textbooks.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-five when his supervisor, Anya, stopped him in a hallway at the biotech firm. He\u2019d stayed late to replace a fan coil he\u2019d heard making a noise, even though it wasn\u2019t on his work order. \"You don't just fix things, Cody,\" she said, her expression serious. \"You hear the problem before it happens.\" That simple observation changed everything. It wasn't just about being a good worker; it was the first time someone recognized his intuition as a form of intelligence.\n\n4.\nLast year, an alarm blared at 2 a.m. The cooling system for a lab containing years of cancer research was failing. On the empty campus, under the hum of emergency lights, he traced the failure to a single, obscure relay switch. His hands worked surely, rerouting the connection. As the system whirred back to life, he watched the sunrise over Mission Bay, filled with a profound, unspoken pride. He wasn't a scientist, but he was the bedrock they built their miracles upon.\n\n5.\nRiding the 38R Geary home last Tuesday, he saw a \"Sale Pending\" sign on a small condo building. He found himself mentally mapping its infrastructure\u2014the water mains, the electrical panels, the HVAC units on the roof. The dream of owning a place wasn't about the address. It was about the deep satisfaction of knowing he could diagnose, maintain, and truly care for his own small piece of the world, making it stable and secure. It was the ultimate homage to Raj."
