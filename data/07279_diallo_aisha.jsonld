Born in Oakland to Senegalese parents who were visiting professors at UC Berkeley, Aisha grew up in a home that was a crucible of intellectual debate and vibrant West African culture. Her father taught post-colonial literature, her mother, sociology. Their home was filled with books, textiles, and a constant stream of academics and artists. While her parents pushed for a traditional academic path, Aisha was always drawn to the visual language of her heritage and the burgeoning Oakland arts scene.\n\nThis passion led her to pursue a Master of Fine Arts in Curatorial Practice at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco. Her early career was promising, with positions at SFMOMA and other venerated institutions. However, she grew disillusioned with the slow pace of change and the institutional gatekeeping that often left daring, diverse voices on the periphery. The turning point came when a museum she worked for acquired a stunning piece by a young Black sculptor, only to relegate it to long-term storage. That night, she drafted the business plan for her own gallery.\n\nToday, at 43, Aisha is the formidable owner and Senior Curator of *Diallo Contemporary*, a respected gallery housed in a converted warehouse in the Dogpatch neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from her upstairs loft down to the expansive, light-filled gallery floor. Her life and work are seamlessly integrated. Mornings are for coffee and correspondence, afternoons for studio visits and liaising with collectors, and evenings often host openings or intimate dinners with artists.\n\nWhile her career is her life's central pillar, she maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow gallerists, artists, and a few old confidantes from her university days. She is fiercely devoted to her brother and his family, who still live in Oakland. Aisha\u2019s dream is to establish an endowment for her gallery, ensuring it remains a sanctuary for underrepresented artists long after she\u2019s gone. For her, San Francisco is not just a city; it\u2019s a canvas, and she is dedicated to adding new, vital colors to its landscape."
