Born and raised in Sacramento, she was the daughter of a practical CPA and a no-nonsense elementary school teacher who hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career. Naomi, however, was drawn to aesthetics\u2014the way light hit old buildings, the narrative held within a painting. She escaped to San Francisco for college, enrolling at SF State and choosing Art History, a degree that felt like a quiet rebellion against her pragmatic upbringing.\n\nAfter graduating, she felt unmoored. Her degree didn't translate into a clear career path, and for a few years, she drifted between barista jobs and gallery assistant gigs. The turning point came at 28 when she answered a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window of a small Hayes Valley boutique called \"Cypress & Cloth.\" She discovered her academic eye for curation and composition was perfectly suited to retail. She could tell a story with a rack of clothes and a collection of handmade jewelry. The original owner, impressed by her talent and dedication, eventually promoted her to manager and offered her the coveted one-bedroom apartment above the shop.\n\nThat apartment became her anchor. It saw her through a decade-long relationship that ultimately unraveled in her late thirties, leaving her heartbroken but more deeply rooted in the life she had built for herself. The boutique wasn\u2019t just a job; it was her living room, her community hub. Her commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs, her mornings spent with a coffee in her bay window, watching the neighborhood wake up.\n\nNow at 48, Naomi is a fixture of Hayes Valley. She knows the local designers by name and the coffee orders of her regulars. Her social life is woven into the neighborhood fabric\u2014dinners at Absinthe, walks through Patricia's Green. While she's watched the city transform around her, her world has remained a constant, curated sanctuary. Her modest dream isn't of expansion or wealth, but of preservation: to one day buy Cypress & Cloth herself, ensuring her small, beautiful corner of San Francisco endures."
