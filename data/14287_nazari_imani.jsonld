Raised in a working-class Oakland family, her father a city bus driver and her mother a high school math teacher, she was instilled with a deep appreciation for both community and structure. While her parents encouraged her education, they were wary of her early love for the arts, viewing it as an unstable path. Imani, however, saw art not as a luxury, but as the lifeblood of the culture that surrounded her.\n\nHer turning point came during her undergraduate studies in Art History at UC Berkeley. She watched brilliant, visionary friends struggle to make a living and realized her calling wasn't just to appreciate art, but to build the systems that support it. This led her to pursue a graduate degree in Arts Administration at USC, a pragmatic pivot that gave her the business acumen to champion the creativity she so admired.\n\nAfter grad school, she returned to the Bay Area, choosing the dynamic, complicated heart of San Francisco over her Oakland roots. She methodically built her career, starting in grant writing and moving up through the ranks of various non-profits. Her big break came five years ago when she was appointed Director of Programs at a major foundation that bridges tech philanthropy with underrepresented artists.\n\nNow 40, Imani\u2019s life is established and intentional. She kept the surname of her ex-husband after an amicable divorce, a partnership that taught her much about herself but ultimately ended as their paths diverged. Her daily routine begins in her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, filled with works by local artists she\u2019s supported. She takes the MUNI bus downtown, a 4.5-mile journey she uses to listen to podcasts or simply watch the city wake up. Her days are a whirlwind of meetings, budget reviews, and studio visits, acting as a cultural steward in a city grappling with its identity.\n\nImani\u2019s deepest aspiration is to launch a fellowship program that becomes a career-defining launchpad for Black and Indigenous artists. She feels a profound connection to San Francisco\u2014its beauty, its intellectual energy, and its stark inequalities. She sees her work as a form of activism, ensuring that as the city evolves, its soul, expressed through its art, isn't left behind."

Watching the city unfold through the vast windshield, she didn't just see streets; she saw a complex, interconnected system of people. It was her first lesson in community infrastructure. The memory grounds her daily commute, a quiet homage to the man who taught her that a city is defined by how it moves and cares for its people.\n\n2.\nIt was the smell of turpentine and desperation in her friend\u2019s Berkeley studio that changed everything. Daniel had just mounted a blistering senior show, but an eviction notice was tacked by the door. At 21, she felt a profound, useless rage. The world lauded his vision but wouldn\u2019t pay his rent. In that moment, her focus shifted forever. She wouldn\u2019t just appreciate art; she would build the systems that kept it alive. It was the birth of her pragmatism, a promise made to his immense, struggling talent.\n\n3.\nThe glow of her monitor in the otherwise dark non-profit office, around age 28. It was her first big grant proposal, written alone, late into many nights. When the confirmation email finally landed with a simple \"FUNDED,\" a quiet, electric thrill shot through her. It wasn\u2019t a creative act, but it enabled countless others. That email was proof: her spreadsheets and narratives were a different kind of canvas, one that could build a foundation for someone else's masterpiece. The feeling was pure, unadulterated validation.\n\n4.\nShe was 36, sitting across from her husband at a quiet cafe, divorce papers resting between their coffee cups. There were no tears, only a gentle finality. He asked if she\u2019d change her name. Imani realized \"Nazari\" no longer felt like his name, but hers. It was the name she had built her career with, the name on grants that had funded futures. Keeping it wasn\u2019t about holding on; it was an acknowledgment of the person she had become during their time together\u2014strong and entirely her own.\n\n5.\nLast year, standing in a small studio in the Mission, the smell of sage and oil paint in the air. A young Ohlone artist showed Imani her canvases, explaining how each brushstroke was an act of reclaiming land and story. Looking from the vibrant paintings to the luxury condos visible through the window, Imani felt the city\u2019s profound contradiction in her bones. This was the fight. Her work wasn\u2019t about philanthropy; it was about funding cultural survival. The memory is the fuel for her fellowship idea\u2014a vital, urgent necessity."
