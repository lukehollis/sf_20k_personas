The only child of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, she grew up translating not just language, but cultures. Her parents, running a small grocery store, instilled in her a formidable work ethic, hoping she\u2019d pursue medicine or engineering. Priya, however, was drawn to the subtle, often unspoken, struggles she witnessed in her community\u2014the stress of assimilation, the silent grief, the difficulty in accessing help.\n\nHer path became clear during her undergraduate years at UC Berkeley. When her father suffered a major heart attack, Priya became the family\u2019s primary advocate, navigating the bewildering healthcare system. She saw firsthand how cultural nuances were lost on overworked staff, leading to frustration and fear. This experience was her turning point. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master of Social Work (MSW) to become the bridge she wished her family had.\n\nFor two decades, Priya has worked as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, specializing in supporting patients and families coping with chronic illness and end-of-life care. Her calm demeanor and deep empathy made her an invaluable hospital asset. A marriage in her late twenties ended amicably, unable to withstand the profound emotional weight of her work; she remains close with her ex-husband and co-parents their daughter, Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA.\n\nToday, at 49, Priya\u2019s life is centered in her cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. The pandemic shifted her practice entirely to telehealth, reducing her commute to zero. Her days are structured: a morning walk to Dolores Park with a thermos of chai, followed by back-to-back video sessions from a carefully curated corner of her living room. Priya loves the Mission\u2019s vibrant energy, a constant, colorful counterpoint to the quiet intensity of her work. Evenings are for herself\u2014experimenting with her mother\u2019s recipes or losing herself in historical fiction. Her dream is no longer about career advancement, but about synthesis: she hopes to write a practical guide for healthcare providers on delivering culturally competent care to South Asian families, turning her life\u2019s work of translation into a lasting resource."

A kind, rushed nurse offered a generic pamphlet on cardiac care, the words meaningless against her mother\u2019s silent, desperate prayers. A hot surge of frustration and purpose flooded her. She saw the chasm between care and culture, and knew she had to spend her life building a bridge across it. That moment, at nineteen, wasn't a choice; it was the crystallization of her entire existence into a single, unshakable calling.\n\n2.\nAt ten, she leaned against a sack of basmati rice in her parents' Fremont store. An elderly auntie, a regular, tried to ask a new cashier for masoor dal, her gestures small and uncertain. The cashier just looked confused. Priya stepped forward, her voice clear, translating the simple request. She felt a swell of quiet importance, but also a pang of sadness for the auntie's vulnerability. It was the first time she understood that translation wasn't just about words, but about preserving dignity.\n\n3.\nIn her early forties, she sat with a dying Cantonese patient. His son, a successful lawyer, stood stiffly by the bed, trapped between American expressiveness and his father\u2019s stoic expectations. Priya gently placed a warm cloth on the father\u2019s brow, simply saying to the son, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to just be here with him. Silence is a language, too.\u201d The son\u2019s shoulders finally slumped in relief, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek. In that shared silence, Priya felt the profound, draining privilege of her work.\n\n4.\nAt Maya\u2019s high school graduation two years ago, she caught her ex-husband Mark\u2019s eye across the crowded lawn. He gave Maya the exact same look of overwhelming pride that Priya felt swelling in her own chest. The weight of her work had fractured their marriage, but in that shared glance, she saw what they had successfully built: a family rooted not in obligation, but in a resilient, redefined love. It was a quiet, profound validation of the difficult choices they had made.\n\n5.\nJust last month, sipping chai on her morning walk, she watched the fog burn off the palms in Dolores Park. For twenty years, she had absorbed others\u2019 stories, translating their pain and fear one-on-one. But there, in the quiet morning light, a new imperative settled over her. It was time to translate her own experience\u2014not just for one family at a time, but for everyone. The idea for the book arrived not as a lightning bolt, but as a calm, clear sunrise."
