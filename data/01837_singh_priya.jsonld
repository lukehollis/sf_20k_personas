The only child of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, she grew up translating not just language, but cultures. Her parents, running a small grocery store, instilled in her a formidable work ethic, hoping she\u2019d pursue medicine or engineering. Priya, however, was drawn to the subtle, often unspoken, struggles she witnessed in her community\u2014the stress of assimilation, the silent grief, the difficulty in accessing help.\n\nHer path became clear during her undergraduate years at UC Berkeley. When her father suffered a major heart attack, Priya became the family\u2019s primary advocate, navigating the bewildering healthcare system. She saw firsthand how cultural nuances were lost on overworked staff, leading to frustration and fear. This experience was her turning point. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master of Social Work (MSW) to become the bridge she wished her family had.\n\nFor two decades, Priya has worked as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, specializing in supporting patients and families coping with chronic illness and end-of-life care. Her calm demeanor and deep empathy made her an invaluable hospital asset. A marriage in her late twenties ended amicably, unable to withstand the profound emotional weight of her work; she remains close with her ex-husband and co-parents their daughter, Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA.\n\nToday, at 49, Priya\u2019s life is centered in her cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. The pandemic shifted her practice entirely to telehealth, reducing her commute to zero. Her days are structured: a morning walk to Dolores Park with a thermos of chai, followed by back-to-back video sessions from a carefully curated corner of her living room. Priya loves the Mission\u2019s vibrant energy, a constant, colorful counterpoint to the quiet intensity of her work. Evenings are for herself\u2014experimenting with her mother\u2019s recipes or losing herself in historical fiction. Her dream is no longer about career advancement, but about synthesis: she hopes to write a practical guide for healthcare providers on delivering culturally competent care to South Asian families, turning her life\u2019s work of translation into a lasting resource."
