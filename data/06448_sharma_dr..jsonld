The daughter of a pragmatic software engineer and a detail-oriented pharmacist, Anya grew up steeped in the immigrant dream of stable, high-achieving careers. Her parents, who had left New Delhi for Silicon Valley, envisioned a future in medicine or tech for their daughter. But Anya was always more captivated by the unspoken anxieties of her peers and the hidden struggles of her younger brother, Rohan, whose undiagnosed ADHD made his childhood a confusing and frustrating experience.\n\nCompelled by a desire to understand the \"why\" behind a child\u2019s behavior, Anya diverged from her parents\u2019 prescribed path. She pursued a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology at UC Berkeley, specializing in childhood developmental disorders. The move from the manicured lawns of Cupertino to the vibrant, chaotic energy of San Francisco was a pivotal act of independence. After completing her residency at UCSF, she took a significant leap of faith, channeling her savings into establishing her own private practice.\n\nNow 37, Anya\u2019s life is centered in her charming Noe Valley Edwardian flat, where a converted ground-floor unit serves as her office. This setup gives her a \"commute\" of zero miles but requires disciplined boundaries. Her days start with a walk to a local coffee shop, followed by sessions with children navigating everything from anxiety to the unique pressures of growing up in a high-strung city. She sees her work as helping families find a common language. Her relationship with her own family has evolved into one of mutual respect; they may not fully grasp her work, but they see the profound impact she has.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and a book club that talks more about life than literature. She is single and navigates the city's complex dating scene with a mix of optimism and psychological insight. Anya\u2019s deepest aspiration is to write a book for parents, demystifying child psychology and offering the practical guidance her own parents never had. She feels deeply rooted in San Francisco, finding purpose in tending to the emotional well-being of its youngest, most vulnerable residents, one child at a time."
