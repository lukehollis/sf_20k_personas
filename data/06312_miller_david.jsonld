The son of a pragmatic accountant and a high school librarian, his early fascination with art was seen as a charming but impractical hobby. He found his escape not in sports, but in the pages of art history books his mother would bring home, worlds away from his Midwestern reality.\n\nHis educational journey was a quiet rebellion. He traded Ohio for the University of Michigan, initially as an English major, before an elective on modernism ignited his true passion. He plunged into art history, culminating in a Master's in Curatorial Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His early career was a trial by fire in the cutthroat New York gallery scene, where he learned to balance artistic integrity with commercial viability, working his way up from shipping crates to assistant director.\n\nThe turning point came at 32. Burnt out by New York\u2019s relentless pace, he received an offer to take over a respected but financially struggling gallery in San Francisco. The owner, a mentor from his early days, saw in David the blend of sharp intellect and genuine passion needed for a revival. He seized the chance, trading the vertical intensity of Manhattan for the innovative, horizontal sprawl of the Bay Area.\n\nNow, at 42, David\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. He lives in a minimalist loft directly above his gallery, Miller Contemporary, in a quiet, arts-focused corner of SoMa. His 0.0-mile commute is a single flight of stairs. His days begin with coffee overlooking the pristine white walls below, and are a blur of artist studio visits, client meetings, and the meticulous planning of his next exhibition. His social life revolves around this world; his closest friends are the artists he represents and the collectors who believe in his vision. A past long-term relationship ended due to his all-consuming dedication, a sacrifice he simultaneously regrets and understands.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is no longer about climbing a ladder, but building a legacy. He dreams of discovering and nurturing a generation-defining artist from the Bay Area, cementing his gallery's reputation as a vital cultural institution. He found his true canvas not on a wall, but in San Francisco itself\u2014a city that, like the art he champions, is always reinventing what\u2019s possible."
