The only child of pragmatic Taiwanese immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a bookkeeper mother\u2014her upbringing was a study in stability and expectation. Art was a decoration, not a career. To appease them, she pursued a Communications degree at UC Davis, a practical choice that felt like a responsible compromise.\n\nThe turning point came during a summer internship she took on a whim at a small, scrappy theater company in the Mission District. Surrounded by chaotic genius, impossible deadlines, and unfiltered passion, Sarah discovered her true talent: she was the eye of the storm. While artists dreamed, she built schedules, managed budgets, and translated abstract visions into tangible reality. She thrived on making the impossible happen.\n\nAfter graduation, she shunned corporate offers, instead taking low-paying gigs that immersed her in San Francisco's vibrant arts scene. She worked her way up from assistant stage manager to event coordinator for arts festivals, finally landing her current role as a Production Manager for a prominent arts organization. Her name became synonymous with calm competence, the person you called when a high-concept installation needed to be built on a pier in a week.\n\nNow 43, Sarah lives in a converted live/work loft in the Dogpatch, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her coffee maker to the desk in her light-filled living space. Her days are a flurry of Zoom calls with artists, site visits to galleries, and meticulous spreadsheet management. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; her closest friends are curators, lighting designers, and sculptors she\u2019s collaborated with for years.\n\nThough fulfilled, she dreams of more. Her ultimate goal is to launch and direct her own city-wide public art festival, a project that would bring groundbreaking art into every neighborhood, making it accessible to all. For Sarah, San Francisco is not just a home; it's her canvas, and she is one of the essential, unseen hands ensuring its cultural vibrancy continues to be painted."
