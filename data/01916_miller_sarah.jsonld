Raised in the tree-lined, academic bubble of Ann Arbor, Michigan, she was the only child of a history professor and a university librarian. Her childhood home was a sanctuary of books and quiet contemplation, where dinner conversations revolved around historical narratives and the structure of information. This upbringing instilled in her a deep appreciation for finding the story hidden within complex systems.\n\nWhen she attended the University of Michigan, she naturally gravitated towards Sociology, fascinated by the invisible forces that shape human behavior. However, upon graduating, she found the path for a sociology major to be nebulously academic. A pragmatic streak, coupled with the looming reality of student loans, led her to a six-month data analytics bootcamp. It was a revelation. She discovered she could apply her sociological lens to data sets, uncovering the human stories behind user clicks and market trends.\n\nThis new skill set landed her a fully remote position with a San Francisco-based tech firm. Though she could have worked from anywhere, the allure of being at the industry's epicenter was too strong to ignore. She packed two suitcases and moved into a small but sunny one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nNow 26, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by the 0.0-mile commute from her bed to her desk. Her mornings begin not with a frantic rush, but with a walk to a local bakery on Clement Street for a coffee and croissant, followed by a run through the foggy trails of Golden Gate Park. Her days are a blur of SQL queries, data visualizations, and Slack notifications, but she finds satisfaction in bringing clarity to chaos. Her evenings are for disconnecting\u2014either cooking with produce from the local markets, meeting a small circle of friends for dim sum, or losing herself in a novel, a habit inherited from her parents.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She feels like a resident of the Inner Richmond more than a citizen of the city at large. While she appreciates her stable tech career, her dream is to eventually pivot. She aspires to use her data skills for a non-profit or a civic organization, analyzing patterns not to increase profit, but to address social inequities\u2014finally bridging the world of her parents with the one she has built for herself."
