The son of a pragmatic Filipino-American mail carrier and a resilient Chinese-American seamstress, Marco grew up navigating the nuances of two distinct cultures under one roof. His childhood was a blend of boisterous family parties, the quiet diligence of his mother at her sewing machine, and weekend basketball games at the local park.\n\nHis calling was not a sudden revelation but a slow burn, ignited by the defining crisis of his youth. As a teenager in the late 1980s, he watched with a mix of fear and compassion as the AIDS epidemic devastated his city. He saw how community organizations, often underfunded and overlooked, stepped into the void left by official indifference. This grassroots activism became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work. He pursued an undergraduate degree at San Francisco State University, followed by an MPH in Public Health Administration from UC Berkeley.\n\nMarco began his career as an outreach worker in the Mission District, connecting non-English speaking families with vital health services. Over two decades, his dedication and strategic mind saw him rise through the ranks. Now, as Director of Community Health Programs, he oversees initiatives that support thousands, from school-based mental health services to vaccination clinics for the elderly.\n\nHe shares a lovingly restored Victorian flat in Noe Valley with his partner of 20 years, David, a landscape architect. Their life is a comfortable rhythm. Marco\u2019s 4.8-mile commute on the J-Church Muni line is his time for quiet reflection, watching the city wake up. Evenings involve cooking together, and weekends are for hiking with their rescue terrier on Mount Sutro or browsing the Alemany Farmers' Market.\n\nAt 52, Marco feels the weight and wisdom of his years in the city. He sees the staggering wealth and the persistent inequality with clear eyes. His aspiration isn't to leave, but to dig in deeper. He dreams of securing a permanent endowment for a youth wellness center in the Bayview, ensuring its future long after he retires. For Marco, San Francisco is not just a place to live; it is the community he has spent his entire life fighting for and nurturing."

Around nine, his father already asleep before his early mail route, his mother would still be working at the dining table. He\u2019d watch her nimble fingers guide a shimmering piece of fabric\u2014a barong for his uncle\u2014under the needle\u2019s dance. It wasn\u2019t a sacrifice discussed, but a quiet, powerful act of love and resilience. He learned then that the most profound forms of care are often the most diligent and unspoken.\n\n2.\nHe was seventeen, standing before the AIDS Memorial Quilt at Civic Center. It was the name \u201cBobby,\u201d stitched next to a faded Lakers jersey on one panel, that broke him. It wasn't an abstract tragedy anymore; it was somebody\u2019s son. He felt a profound, aching grief, but also a fierce admiration for the community that refused to let these lives be forgotten. In those stitches of love and defiance, he saw how everyday people could build a safety net where institutions had failed, finding the blueprint for his own life.\n\n3.\nFresh out of SF State, he\u2019d spent weeks trying to get a newly-arrived Guatemalan grandmother in the Mission enrolled in a health plan for her grandkids. The paperwork was a fortress. The day the approval letter arrived, she grasped his hands, tears in her eyes, and said \u201cGracias, mijo,\u201d with such heartfelt relief. In that moment, he felt the immense weight of the system and the life-changing power of one small, persistent act of advocacy. It was no longer a job; it was a calling.\n\n4.\nHe recalls the day he and David got the keys to the Noe Valley flat. It was a wreck, and Marco saw only the overwhelming work. But David, sketching a garden on a napkin, saw the \u201cbones\u201d of their future. That evening, covered in dust, they shared a pizza on the floor, their laughter echoing in the empty rooms. It was the first time a place felt less like a residence and more like a shared dream they were building together, board by board.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a pop-up clinic in Bayview, a high schooler told him she just wished there was a place \"to breathe\" after school, somewhere safe that wasn't home or the street. Her simple wish struck him to the core. It wasn\u2019t about another program; it was about permanence. Looking at the temporary clinic being packed away, a new resolve hardened within him. He wouldn\u2019t just serve this community; he would build something for it that would last long after he was gone."
