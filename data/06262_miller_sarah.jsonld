            "value": "Sarah Miller is a San Franciscan in a way that is becoming increasingly rare: by birth. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond, she was the daughter of a union carpenter and a public librarian, who instilled in her a deep appreciation for things built to last and the stories they hold. The city wasn't a destination for her; it was the bedrock of her identity, a landscape of familiar hills and the steady, melancholic song of foghorns.\n\nHer educational journey began with a practical choice. Heeding her parents\u2019 advice to secure a stable future, she earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration from San Francisco State University. Sarah spent five years in the soulless hum of a downtown marketing firm, creating campaigns for products she didn\u2019t care about. The turning point came not as an epiphany, but as a slow-dawning realization during volunteer weekends at a local community center\u2019s daycare. The unfiltered joy and monumental importance of a child learning to share a crayon felt infinitely more meaningful than any quarterly report.\n\nAt 29, she quit her job, enrolled in an early childhood education certificate program, and never looked back. After working in a few larger preschools, she dreamed of creating her own nurturing space. Using a small inheritance from her parents, she managed to buy a modest live/work duplex in the Inner Sunset in the late 1990s, just before the market became truly unattainable.\n\nToday, her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of stairs. She lives above the \u201cSunset Sprouts Preschool,\u201d the small, licensed school she runs from her ground floor. Her days are a whirlwind of finger paint, story time, scraped knees, and navigating the epic emotions of three-year-olds. She is divorced, a brief and youthful marriage to a man who couldn't understand her career change, but she is far from lonely. Her life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood families, her social circle a tight-knit group of fellow teachers and local shop owners. Her greatest hope is simple: to be able to afford to stay. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to continue cultivating a small patch of kindness and curiosity in the city that raised her, a quiet anchor in a sea of constant change."
