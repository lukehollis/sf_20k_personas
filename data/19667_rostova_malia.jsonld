Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, she is the daughter of a stoic Russian fisherman, Alexei, who fled the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and a warm, vibrant Filipina-American nurse's aide, Delia. Her childhood was a blend of two worlds: chilly evenings spent listening to her father\u2019s hushed stories of St. Petersburg and bustling family gatherings filled with the aroma of her mother's lumpia. They were a working-class family, their love for each other as constant as the sound of the foghorns.\n\nA four-year university was never a practical option. After high school, Malia's path was crystallized by a turning point: her father\u2019s sudden heart attack. While he recovered, Malia witnessed firsthand the chaotic, intimidating nature of the healthcare system. She wasn't drawn to the clinical work but to the profound need for guidance and compassion. This inspired her to earn a Medical Assistant certification, a direct route to helping others navigate that same complex world.\n\nShe began her career doing intake at a community clinic, but her exceptional organizational skills and innate empathy saw her rise. Now, at 40, she is a Patient Care Coordinator at UCSF, a job that perfectly suits her temperament. She is the calm, steady hand for patients overwhelmed by diagnoses and scheduling, a role she finds deeply meaningful.\n\nMalia lives alone in a cherished rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 3.8-mile commute on the N-Judah is a time for reflection, watching the city wake up. Her lifestyle is modest but rich. Weekends are for long walks in Golden Gate Park, exploring the dim sum spots on Irving Street with a tight-knit circle of friends, or tending to the collection of succulents on her windowsill.\n\nHer dream isn't one of wealth, but of security and connection. She hopes to one day save enough to take her mother on a trip to the Philippines and to finally visit the St. Petersburg her father described but never returned to. For Malia, success is found in her quiet competence, her deep roots in the city, and the daily act of bringing a small measure of order and kindness to those in need."

He didn\u2019t seem to mind the cold, his quiet voice weaving a story about the frozen Neva River in St. Petersburg. Malia felt the chill of the Pacific spray and the phantom cold of a city she\u2019d never seen. The memory became the foundation of her quiet nature, a simultaneous love for the city\u2019s gray moods and a longing for a place known only through stories.\n\n2.  The small Outer Richmond apartment would shrink during family parties, becoming a loud, warm haven thick with the scent of her mother Delia\u2019s cooking. At age ten, her mother guided her small hands, showing her the precise, loving fold of a lumpia wrapper. It was a lesson in care and patience. That feeling\u2014of creating comfort and nourishment with her own hands, of welcoming everyone into a circle of warmth\u2014is a feeling she has chased ever since, both in her kitchen and in her career.\n\n3.  The hospital waiting room was brutally bright, the air sterile and tense. She was nineteen, watching her mother try to decipher a doctor's rushed, clinical explanation of her father's heart attack. Malia felt a surge of protective anger, not at the doctor, but at the system itself\u2014the cold chaos that swallowed families whole. In that moment of helplessness, her purpose crystallized. She would not be a clinician, but a guide; a calm voice in the frightening noise of healthcare.\n\n4.  A few years into her job at UCSF, an elderly man sat at her desk, weeping silently over a stack of confusing appointment slips. Malia took them, speaking softly as she organized everything into a simple, color-coded folder. When she finished, the man looked at her, his fear replaced by a flicker of hope. In his profound relief, Malia felt a quiet, powerful click. This was it. This was the work of turning her family's old pain into someone else's peace of mind.\n\n5.  On her first morning in the Inner Sunset apartment, the 6 a.m. rumble of the N-Judah was a comforting promise. She was thirty-two. After years of saving, this small, rent-controlled space was hers. She placed a single succulent on the windowsill and watched the light catch the fog drifting around Sutro Tower. It wasn\u2019t wealth, but it was security. It was the profound, grounding peace of having planted her own roots deep into the city that had always held her."
