Born to an American cultural anthropologist father and an Indian textile artist mother, his childhood was a vibrant blend of Berkeley intellectualism and the rich traditions of his mother\u2019s heritage. His home was filled with books on social theory, the smell of cardamom tea, and colorful fabrics destined for galleries. This upbringing fostered in him a quiet, observant nature and a deep appreciation for the stories objects and people carry.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's degree in Cultural Anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, hoping to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. However, the romantic ideals of academia quickly collided with the reality of San Francisco rent. After graduating, he took what he assumed was a temporary job at a high-end, independent home goods store in Hayes Valley, a place specializing in artisan ceramics and ethically sourced textiles. To his surprise, he thrived. His academic background gave him a unique ability to connect with customers, explaining the cultural significance of a Japanese glaze or the weaving technique of a Peruvian throw.\n\nA key turning point came when the store's owner offered him the Assistant Manager position, which included the rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop. The \"0.0 mile commute\" wasn't just convenient; it cemented his place in the neighborhood. His life became woven into the fabric of Hayes Valley. His days start with a coffee from the cafe next door and end with a drink at the corner bar with other local workers. He knows the delivery drivers by name and the shopping habits of his regulars.\n\nAt 27, Ravi has found an unexpected peace. While a part of him still mourns the academic life he envisioned, his aspirations have shifted. He no longer sees retail as a compromise but as a modern form of curation. His dream is to one day own a similar store, a space that reflects his unique bicultural identity\u2014a curated collection of global crafts that tells a story, much like his own."
