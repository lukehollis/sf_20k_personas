His upbringing in their small, rent-controlled Inner Richmond apartment was quiet and insular. His mother battled a degenerative illness for most of his childhood, and Alexei became her primary caregiver by his early teens. Traditional high school was impossible; he completed his diploma through an accredited online program, his studies punctuated by doctor\u2019s appointments and managing medication schedules. His world was the two-block radius around their apartment, the foggy expanse of Golden Gate Park his only real escape.\n\nWhen his mother passed away two years ago, Alexei was left with the apartment\u2014a quiet inheritance of fog and rent control\u2014and a profound sense of inertia. Needing stable, non-demanding work, he found a remote position as a data entry clerk for a logistics company with no central office. His commute is the ten steps from his bed to his desk. His life is governed by spreadsheets and the rhythmic click of his keyboard, a digital drone that fills the silence his mother left behind. He is efficient and anonymous, a perfect ghost in the corporate machine.\n\nNow at 25, Alexei feels the walls of his routine closing in. His social life exists primarily in online gaming forums. His daily walk through the Japanese Tea Garden or along Ocean Beach is a solitary ritual, where he observes the vibrant life of the city as if watching it through a screen. He sees friends laughing over dim sum on Clement Street and feels a pang of longing for a connection he doesn't know how to initiate.\n\nA quiet rebellion is brewing within him. He has started researching night classes at City College, not for a degree, but for the experience. He lingers on descriptions for photography, creative writing, or even a basic coding class\u2014anything that would force him out of his apartment and into a room with other people. His dream isn't grand; it's simply to stop being an observer in his own city and start building a life that exists beyond his front door."
