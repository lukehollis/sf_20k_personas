Born in Fremont to Punjabi Sikh immigrants, his childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s pragmatic mechanical knowledge and his mother's insistence on cultural tradition\u2014so much so that she gave him her own surname, Kaur, a quiet matriarchal stamp on his identity. While other kids were chasing academic prestige, Rohan was disassembling radios and VCRs, more comfortable with a soldering iron than a textbook.\n\nThe dot-com bust of the early 2000s was his turning point. As he watched speculative tech companies evaporate, he noticed that the physical hardware\u2014the servers, the routers, the networks\u2014remained. This tangible reality shaped his path. He bypassed a four-year university, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology from a community college. It was a practical choice for a practical man. He started by fixing office PCs and gradually built a reputation for troubleshooting the complex server racks and network arrays that form the city's digital backbone.\n\nNow 41, Rohan lives a life of calculated proximity in a SOMA loft. His 0.0-mile commute is no error; his work orders arrive via a dispatch app, and his \"field\" is the dense cluster of data centers and corporate HQs within walking distance. He is the ghost in the machine, the technician who slips into server rooms to keep the cloud afloat. His apartment is a testament to his personality: impeccably organized tools, stacks of vintage audio equipment, and the faint, pleasant smell of contact cleaner.\n\nSocially, Rohan is an observer. He prefers the quiet camaraderie of a shared project with another technician over the performative networking of tech mixers. His relationships are few but deep, built on loyalty rather than convenience. His dream isn't to launch a startup, but to perfect a custom-built, vacuum-tube hi-fi amplifier\u2014a masterpiece of analog engineering. Rohan Kaur is an analog man in a digital world; a vital, unseen part of San Francisco who finds meaning not in the ephemeral code, but in the circuits and wires that give it a place to live."
