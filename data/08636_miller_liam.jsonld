Born to a third-generation Japanese-American artist from San Jose and an Irish-American journalist from Boston, he grew up in the quiet island suburb of Alameda. His childhood was a blend of his mother\u2019s serene watercolor painting and stories of internment camps, and his father\u2019s boisterous love for storytelling and Boston sports. This dual heritage made him a quiet observer, always trying to understand the systems\u2014both cultural and logical\u2014that governed the world around him.\n\nHis intellectual curiosity led him to UC Santa Cruz, where he pursued a degree in Cognitive Science. He was less interested in pure coding and more fascinated by the intersection of the human mind and technology. After graduating, his goal was singular: to live in San Francisco, the city his parents had always spoken of with a mix of reverence and nostalgia. He landed a pragmatic entry-level job as an IT Support Specialist for a mid-size tech company, a role that offered the stability and, crucially, the remote work policy he needed to afford city life.\n\nThe 0.0-mile commute defines Liam\u2019s existence. He lives in a shared three-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, his life contained within a twenty-block radius. A typical day begins with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by hours spent solving technical issues for unseen colleagues over Slack and Zoom. His connection to San Francisco isn't through a bustling downtown office, but through the foggy expanse of Golden Gate Park, the dumpling shops on Clement Street, and the familiar faces at his local bookstore. His social life is small but meaningful, revolving around his two roommates and a bi-weekly online Dungeons & Dragons campaign.\n\nWhile the IT job pays the rent, it\u2019s merely a stepping stone. Liam\u2019s true ambition is to become a UX Designer. His evenings are spent hunched over his personal laptop, teaching himself Figma and building a portfolio. He dreams of creating intuitive, human-centered technology, bridging the gap between people and the digital tools they use\u2014a career that feels like the perfect synthesis of his unique upbringing and education."
