Raised by a high school history teacher and an accountant, her childhood was one of practicality, community potlucks, and a deep appreciation for the public library. While her parents valued tangible numbers and historical facts, Sarah was drawn to the systems behind them\u2014the Dewey Decimal System, the narrative structures in novels. This led her to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), believing her future was in curating knowledge within the quiet halls of academia.\n\nHer first job as a digital archivist at a university was fulfilling but slow. She watched as the tech world outside began harnessing information on a scale she could only dream of. The turning point came during a project to digitize a fragile collection of manuscripts. She realized her skills in classification, metadata, and information retrieval were the very foundation of data science. Spurred by this revelation, she spent a year of nights and weekends teaching herself SQL, Python, and data visualization, translating her love for organized information into the language of tech.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco nine years ago for a junior analyst role, leaving behind the predictable comfort of the Midwest for a city that buzzed with chaotic potential. Today, at 37, she\u2019s a senior data analyst for a prominent tech firm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic norm she has fully embraced. Her workday unfolds in a bright, bay-windowed apartment in NOPA, where she finds patterns in user behavior data.\n\nHer lifestyle is a curated balance. Mornings often start with a run through the Panhandle, followed by focused work until she breaks for a late lunch. Evenings are for a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow transplants met through a hiking group and a book club. Sarah loves San Francisco for its access to nature and intellectual energy, yet she engages with it on her own terms, preferring the quiet of the Inner Richmond's dim sum parlors to the downtown nightlife. Having achieved career stability, her aspirations are turning inward. She dreams of leading a data ethics team and, more privately, of building a long-term partnership as stable and comforting as the library stacks she once called home."
