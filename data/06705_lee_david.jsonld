The son of first-generation immigrants who ran a successful Cantonese restaurant, David was groomed for a life of practical, profitable work. He dutifully earned a Business degree from SF State, his artistic inclinations relegated to a private sketchbook he kept hidden. For a decade, he worked in logistics for a Bay Area shipping company, his days a grayscale of spreadsheets and conference calls that slowly eroded his spirit.\n\nThe turning point came not with a bang, but with a layoff during a corporate restructuring. Adrift at 34, David started volunteering at a community center in the Mission, primarily to fill the silence. He found himself drawn to the chaotic, vibrant children\u2019s art room. Watching a four-year-old mix purple and yellow with uninhibited joy, he felt a profound sense of recognition. This was where he belonged. He cashed in a portion of his savings and enrolled in an Early Childhood Education program.\n\nHis career change strained his relationship with his father, who saw it as a profound failure. Yet, David had never felt more successful. He found a position as an arts teacher at \"Peque\u00f1os Picassos,\" a small, progressive preschool on the ground floor of a classic Mission apartment building. The job came with an unusual perk: a rent-stabilized one-bedroom unit on the third floor. His commute is a 30-second walk downstairs.\n\nNow 44, David\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of his neighborhood. His days are a whirlwind of tiny hands exploring clay, the smell of tempera paint, and the sound of joyous discovery. Evenings are quiet; he sketches the VIEW from his window, reads at a local cafe, or meets his small circle of friends\u2014mostly other educators and local artists\u2014for tacos. The frayed relationship with his father has softened into a quiet, if distant, acceptance.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is not to be wealthy but to be impactful. He hopes to one day secure a grant to create a free, weekend art program for local kids, a true community studio. He found his version of success not in a Financial District high-rise, but in a classroom filled with color, two floors below the small apartment he calls home."
