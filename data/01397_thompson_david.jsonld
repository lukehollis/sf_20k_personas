Hailing from a stifling, small town in the Midwest, his upbringing was defined by the unspoken tension of being different. His family, deeply rooted in conservative values, responded to his coming out at seventeen with a cold, quiet rejection. Lacking a support system and seeing no future for himself there, David bought a one-way bus ticket to San Francisco the week after his high school graduation, viewing the city as a distant, glittering promise of acceptance.\n\nHis first few years in the city were a harsh education in their own right. He navigated precarious housing, worked a string of dead-end service jobs, and learned the isolation that can exist even in a crowded city. The turning point came when he stumbled into an LGBTQ+ youth center in the Mission, initially seeking a hot meal and a safe place to rest. He found something more: a community. He started as a beneficiary of their services, then became a passionate volunteer, his lived experience resonating powerfully with the teens who walked through the door.\n\nLacking a college degree, David\u2019s career was built on grit, empathy, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the resources available to at-risk youth. He worked his way up from outreach worker to case manager, eventually earning the trust of the board and staff to become the Program Director. His 0.0-mile commute is a reality of his life; he lives in a small apartment directly above the center, making him a constant, stabilizing presence. His life and work are completely intertwined. His closest friends are former colleagues and the successful adults who once were kids in his program.\n\nAt 43, David\u2019s dream is not for himself, but for the institution he\u2019s built. He aspires to secure enough funding to purchase the building and expand their services to include transitional housing. For David, San Francisco is not just a city; it is his sanctuary and his life\u2019s work. He is the person he so desperately needed when he was a scared teenager, ensuring the light of hope he once sought now burns brightly for others."
