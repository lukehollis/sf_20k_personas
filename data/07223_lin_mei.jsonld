Born and raised in Daly City to immigrant parents who ran a bustling laundromat, her childhood was defined by the virtues of practicality and hard work. They envisioned a stable future for her, pushing her toward a nursing degree at Skyline College. Mei, however, felt a profound disconnect in the sterile classrooms, her hands itching to build and create rather than simply follow procedures.\n\nThe turning point came during her second year. On a whim, she visited a community makerspace in San Francisco and was instantly captivated. The scent of laser-cut wood and the intricate dance of 3D printers felt more like home than any lecture hall. She spent every spare moment there, absorbing skills in digital fabrication and design. After a difficult conversation with her disappointed parents, she dropped out of college, trading the promise of a stable nursing career for the uncertainty of a passion.\n\nHer dedication paid off. The owner of a small, innovative manufacturing studio, which produced custom prototypes for biotech startups, noticed her talent and offered her a position as a Production Technician. The job came with a rare San Francisco perk: a small, subsidized loft apartment directly above the workshop, explaining her zero-mile commute.\n\nHer days are a focused rhythm of calibrating machines, refining complex client models, and troubleshooting production runs. Evenings are her own. After the workshop officially closes, she uses the equipment to work on her personal projects: intricate, kinetic sculptures made from metal and recycled plastics. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of the handful of other artists and engineers who share the building.\n\nWhile she maintains a dutiful, if slightly distant, relationship with her family, Mei feels her true self in the city\u2019s industrial heart. She finds beauty in the grit of her neighborhood, a stark contrast to the manicured lawns of her youth. Her dream is to one day transition from technician to designer, launching her own line of artistic functional objects. For now, she is content, living and breathing her craft, a quiet creator shaping her future, one millimeter at a time."
