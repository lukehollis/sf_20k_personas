Adopted from South Korea as an infant by a loving Irish-American couple, she grew up with the Sullivan name, Sunday roasts, and a deep, unspoken curiosity about the face she saw in the mirror. Her parents, a plumber and a librarian, gave her a stable, affectionate home, always encouraging the quiet compassion that seemed innate to her. This empathy, fueled by her own questions of belonging, guided her to SF State to study social work.\n\nHer path, however, was rerouted during her junior year. When her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, Jessica made the difficult choice to leave school and become her primary caregiver. For five years, she managed appointments, medications, and the slow, heartbreaking process of saying goodbye. The experience was draining but solidified her life's purpose. It was no longer an academic pursuit; it was a calling forged in sacrifice.\n\nNow 36, Jessica lives a deliberately simple life in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is a short Muni ride on the 38-Geary to the nonprofit where she works as a Social and Human Service Assistant. She\u2019s the vital link between licensed social workers and the families they serve\u2014scheduling appointments, connecting clients with food banks, and offering a calm, steady presence. The $72,000 salary requires careful budgeting, but living without a car and finding joy in walks through Golden Gate Park makes it manageable.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of former colleagues and a friend from her brief time at SF State. Her adoptive father, now widowed, remains her anchor. While content, Jessica harbors a persistent dream: to finish her degree online and become a fully licensed clinical social worker. Alongside that professional goal is a more personal one\u2014to one day visit Seoul, not to find her birth family, but to simply walk the streets and feel a connection to the part of her story she\u2019s never known."

Her friend\u2019s grandmother, a woman of few English words, pressed a piece of warm, sweet honey rice cake into her hand. Jessica remembers the sticky, comforting texture and the woman\u2019s kind eyes. It wasn't sadness she felt, but a profound, nameless curiosity\u2014the first quiet ache of a story she didn't know, a taste of a home she\u2019d never seen.\n\n***\n\n2.\nShe was twenty-four, two years into caregiving. Her mom, having been silent and distant all morning, suddenly looked at Jessica with complete confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s so kind of you to visit,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice thin, \u201cbut I\u2019m waiting for my daughter.\u201d The words struck Jessica with the force of a physical blow. In that moment of being erased, her love for her mother became fiercely protective. It was no longer a duty; it was an act of bearing witness for them both.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe first Thanksgiving after her mother passed, her dad tried to make the traditional prime rib. He pulled the roasting pan from the oven, revealing a plume of black smoke and charred potatoes. They stared at the disaster, and then a laugh escaped her father, which triggered one from her. The laughter cracked open into tears, and they stood in the smoky kitchen, holding each other. It wasn\u2019t just grief; it was the quiet, resilient beginning of a new kind of family\u2014just the two of them, anchored together.\n\n***\n\n4.\nLast year, a frantic mother called the nonprofit, her voice fraying as she described facing eviction. For three hours, Jessica navigated automated systems and transfers, finally securing a one-night emergency housing voucher. The next day, the woman texted a blurry photo of her two children asleep under a thin hotel blanket. Jessica saved the picture. It was proof that her quiet, often invisible work was the foundation a family could rest on, if only for a night. That feeling of purpose made the tight budget worth it.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a recent foggy Saturday, she was walking through the Japanese Tea Garden. She watched an elderly couple pause by the koi pond, their stillness a comfort against the mist. For the first time, looking at faces that mirrored her own, she didn't feel a pang of otherness or a question of belonging. She felt a quiet pull, a simple desire. The dream of walking through Seoul solidified then, not as a search for family, but as a pilgrimage to another garden, another pond, another part of herself."
