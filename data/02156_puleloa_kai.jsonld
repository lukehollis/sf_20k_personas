Raised on the principle of *k\u014dkua* (to help), instilled by his elders, he grew up in a tight-knit community where everyone\u2019s well-being was a shared responsibility. While his parents encouraged him to seek opportunities on the mainland, it was the quiet strength of his *T\u016bt\u016b* (grandmother), who seemed to carry the worries of the entire neighborhood, that shaped his path.\n\nFeeling a pull to understand the systemic roots of struggle he witnessed, Kai left the islands for UC Berkeley's Master of Social Work program. The transition was a profound culture shock\u2014the frantic pace of the Bay Area felt a world away from the communal rhythms of Hilo. It was during a grueling internship at a San Francisco hospital that he found his calling. He saw how a sudden medical diagnosis could shatter a family, and he discovered a deep capacity within himself to be a calm, grounding presence in that chaos.\n\nNow 29, Kai is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in healthcare. His commute is a walk from his bedroom to his living room in his small Inner Sunset apartment. From a meticulously organized desk overlooking the fog-strewn street, he conducts back-to-back telehealth sessions, providing counseling to patients and families navigating chronic illness, trauma, and end-of-life decisions.\n\nHis days are emotionally taxing. To decompress, he relies on routine: an early morning run in Golden Gate Park, the cold air a welcome shock, followed by an evening spent strumming his ukulele, the familiar melodies a tether to his heritage. San Francisco is a city of chosen family for him\u2014a small group of friends from grad school and his outrigger canoe club. Yet, the ache for home, for the scent of rain on plumeria, is a constant, gentle hum beneath the surface of his life. His ultimate dream is to bridge his two worlds, aspiring to one day use his clinical expertise to develop telehealth initiatives specifically tailored to the unique mental health needs of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities, bringing his spirit of *k\u014dkua* full circle."

A neighbor\u2019s roof was leaking, and his T\u016bt\u016b was on the phone, not with a roofer, but with uncles and cousins. Kai\u2019s job was to carry a basket of mangoes next door. He saw his grandmother orchestrate this quiet symphony of care and realized *k\u014dkua* wasn't a word; it was the natural rhythm of life. It planted the seed that his purpose was to ease the burdens of others, not as a job, but as a way of being.\n\n2.\nAt 24, the fluorescent lights of the SF General Hospital emergency room felt like a different planet. An elderly Chinese man had just received a terminal diagnosis, and his daughter stood frozen, lost in the chaotic shuffle. Kai, just an intern, simply pulled up a chair and sat with her in the hallway, saying nothing. In the quiet solidarity of that moment, he felt his own frantic energy settle. He learned then that his most profound skill wasn't knowledge, but his capacity to be a calm presence in an overwhelming storm.\n\n3.\nThe first time he joined the outrigger canoe club, the shock of the cold Bay water was jarring. But then the paddling started. The rhythmic pull, the unified grunts, the call of the steersman\u2014it was a familiar language. Gliding past Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge shrouded in fog, he felt a powerful harmony between his past and present. This wasn't just a sport; it was building a new paddling *\u02bbohana* (family) that made San Francisco finally start to feel like a home he had chosen, not just landed in.\n\n4.\nLast year, he facilitated a telehealth call where a son, stuck on the East Coast, said a final goodbye to his father in hospice. Kai sat in his quiet Inner Sunset apartment, a silent, digital witness to the most intimate of heartbreaks. When the call ended, the silence in his living room was immense, filled with the weight of that sacred, pixelated farewell. The experience solidified the profound responsibility of his work and the absolute necessity of his evening ukulele practice to process the ghosts he helps carry.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after a draining day of sessions, he was strumming an old song from home. The simple melody felt like a direct line to his T\u016bt\u016b\u2019s l\u0101nai. Staring at his blank computer screen, a profound thought struck him: this screen wasn't just a window into SF homes, it could be a bridge across the Pacific. The vague longing to help his community crystallized into a clear mission\u2014to use this technology to bring the spirit of *k\u014dkua* to the people he came from, completing the circle."
