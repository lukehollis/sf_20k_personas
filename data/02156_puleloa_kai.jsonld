Raised on the principle of *k\u014dkua* (to help), instilled by his elders, he grew up in a tight-knit community where everyone\u2019s well-being was a shared responsibility. While his parents encouraged him to seek opportunities on the mainland, it was the quiet strength of his *T\u016bt\u016b* (grandmother), who seemed to carry the worries of the entire neighborhood, that shaped his path.\n\nFeeling a pull to understand the systemic roots of struggle he witnessed, Kai left the islands for UC Berkeley's Master of Social Work program. The transition was a profound culture shock\u2014the frantic pace of the Bay Area felt a world away from the communal rhythms of Hilo. It was during a grueling internship at a San Francisco hospital that he found his calling. He saw how a sudden medical diagnosis could shatter a family, and he discovered a deep capacity within himself to be a calm, grounding presence in that chaos.\n\nNow 29, Kai is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in healthcare. His commute is a walk from his bedroom to his living room in his small Inner Sunset apartment. From a meticulously organized desk overlooking the fog-strewn street, he conducts back-to-back telehealth sessions, providing counseling to patients and families navigating chronic illness, trauma, and end-of-life decisions.\n\nHis days are emotionally taxing. To decompress, he relies on routine: an early morning run in Golden Gate Park, the cold air a welcome shock, followed by an evening spent strumming his ukulele, the familiar melodies a tether to his heritage. San Francisco is a city of chosen family for him\u2014a small group of friends from grad school and his outrigger canoe club. Yet, the ache for home, for the scent of rain on plumeria, is a constant, gentle hum beneath the surface of his life. His ultimate dream is to bridge his two worlds, aspiring to one day use his clinical expertise to develop telehealth initiatives specifically tailored to the unique mental health needs of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities, bringing his spirit of *k\u014dkua* full circle."
