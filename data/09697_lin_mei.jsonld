Her parents, Taiwanese immigrants who ran a successful neighborhood grocery store, instilled in her a strong work ethic and an appreciation for tradition, though their focus was primarily on practicality over artistry.  While her siblings gravitated towards business and technology, Mei found solace and fascination within the bound pages of art history books, often escaping the demands of the store to visit the Legion of Honor and the de Young Museum on school trips \u2013 early glimmers of her future calling.\n\nHer thirst for knowledge led her to obtain a Bachelor's in Art History from UC Berkeley, a truly transformative period where she not only deepened her academic understanding but also forged lifelong friendships with fellow art enthusiasts. After graduation, a series of entry-level museum roles in curatorial support and research provided valuable hands-on experience. A pivotal moment came during her late twenties when she was offered a junior curator position at a renowned museum in the city. This opportunity, though demanding, allowed her to hone her curatorial skills and develop exhibitions that resonated with diverse audiences.\n\nNow a seasoned Museum Curator earning $85,000 a year, Mei's professional life is dedicated to bringing art to the public. Her relationships are primarily with colleagues and former classmates who share her passion. She remains close with her family, though their conversations often revolve around their grocery business rather than her latest exhibition. Her daily commute is a familiar rhythm aboard the Muni, a time she often uses to gather her thoughts before entering the vibrant world of the museum.\n\nLiving in a compact but comfortable apartment in the Richmond District, Mei appreciates the neighborhood's quiet residential streets and proximity to both the Golden Gate Park and the coastline. Her current lifestyle is characterized by long hours at the museum, balancing administrative tasks with research and exhibition planning.\n\nMei dreams of curating a groundbreaking exhibition showcasing contemporary Asian Pacific Islander art, a project she hopes will elevate underrepresented voices and perspectives. She also quietly harbors a desire to pursue a Master's degree to further specialize in a particular artistic period. San Francisco, with its rich artistic landscape and diverse community, feels like her true home, a place where her love for art can flourish and connect with others."

            "value": "1. The hushed grandeur of the Legion of Honor, the first time she saw a real Monet. The vibrant colors on the canvas pulsed with a life the reproductions in her books couldn't capture. A quiet awe settled over young Mei, a seed planted that would blossom into a lifelong pursuit of beauty and meaning beyond the practical world of her parents' store. It was a silent revelation in her early teens.\n\n2. Sharing cheap ramen and late-night critiques of Renaissance paintings with her Berkeley classmates. Laughter echoed through the cramped apartment, fueled by caffeine and shared passion. This camaraderie proved transformative; it validated her unconventional path and forged bonds with kindred spirits who understood the language of art. These friendships bloomed during her early twenties.\n\n3. Standing before a completed exhibition she had curated, the vibrant colors and stories she had woven together finally brought to life for the public. A wave of immense satisfaction, a quiet triumph, washed over her. This project, years in the making in her late twenties, solidified her conviction that art could connect and move people, affirming her place in this world.\n\n4. A hushed phone call with her mother, detailing a particularly challenging budget negotiation for an exhibition. Her mother, pragmatic as ever, simply listened, then offered a quiet word of encouragement, grounded in the resilience learned running their business. In that moment, the gap between their worlds narrowed, a comforting bridge built on unspoken love and mutual respect, a connection felt deeply in her late thirties.\n\n5. Riding the Muni home after a long day, watching the city lights blur past, a sense of belonging settled within her. This vibrant, complex city, where art flourished and diverse stories intersected, felt not just where she lived, but who she was. San Francisco, with its familiar rhythms, had become an extension of her identity, a feeling that deepened in her early forties."
