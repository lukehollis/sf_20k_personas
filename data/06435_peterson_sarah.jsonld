The daughter of second-generation Korean-American parents, she was raised in a household that prioritized assimilation and tangible success. Her parents, who had adopted the distinctly Anglo surname \u201cPeterson,\u201d pushed her toward a lucrative career in law, viewing it as the pinnacle of the American dream they had worked so tirelessly for. But Sarah witnessed the unspoken emotional toll of their ambition\u2014a quiet strain that fueled her fascination with the connections people forge and fumble.\n\nHer turning point came during her senior year at UCLA. While her friends studied for the LSAT, Sarah found herself volunteering at a campus peer counseling center. Listening to the struggles of her fellow students felt more urgent and real than any legal precedent. Rejecting her parents\u2019 path, she enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program, a decision that created a temporary rift but ultimately defined her independence. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she works for a major healthcare provider, conducting all her sessions via telehealth.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute means her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond is both a sanctuary and an office. Her days are a structured rhythm of video calls, helping patients navigate chronic illness, grief, and medical anxiety. To decompress from the emotional weight of her work, she takes long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace under the cypress trees. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, often meeting for dim sum on Clement Street or throwing pottery at a nearby studio.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal. Living in the Inner Richmond is a quiet, ongoing reclamation of the Asian heritage her parents downplayed. She feels more herself here than anywhere else. Her ultimate dream is to open a small, private practice specializing in culturally competent therapy for the AAPI community, helping other families bridge the same generational and emotional gaps she navigated herself. For Sarah, her work isn't just a profession; it's a way of healing the past, one conversation at a time."
