            "value": "Mateo Rivera is a son of the Mission District, born and raised in the vibrant, mural-lined streets his parents first called home after immigrating from Oaxaca, Mexico. His childhood smelled of cumin and fresh-baked bread from his family\u2019s small corner store, La Esperanza. It was there, stacking cans and making change for neighbors, that he learned the rhythms of retail and the importance of community. He was the first in his family to go to college, enrolling at City College of San Francisco with dreams of becoming a graphic designer, a world away from the family business.\n\nHis life pivoted sharply at twenty-one when his father suffered a major stroke. The family\u2019s stability was threatened, and Mateo, feeling the weight of filial duty, switched his major. He earned his Associate's degree in Business Administration, a practical choice to help manage La Esperanza. For five years, he put his own dreams aside, modernizing the store\u2019s inventory system and building a website. After his father passed, his mother decided to sell the shop and retire.\n\nWith his small inheritance, Mateo chose not to leave the life he knew, but to reinvent it. He leased a small storefront on a bustling Mission street, with a small apartment right above it\u2014his 0.0-mile commute. He opened \u201cAlba,\u201d a curated menswear and artisan goods boutique that blended modern San Francisco style with handcrafted items he sourced from Latin American artists.\n\nNow 32, Mateo\u2019s life is his store. His days start with coffee from the cafe next door and end with him locking the front gate long after the sun has set. He knows every shop owner on his block, and his customers are his community. While he has many friends, his dedication makes deep romantic relationships a challenge. He is proud of what he\u2019s built, a tribute to his parents' hard work but in his own voice. His dream is to make Alba a neighborhood institution, stable enough to hire a full-time manager so he can finally take a real vacation\u2014perhaps a month in Oaxaca, not to source products, but to simply reconnect with the land his story began in."
