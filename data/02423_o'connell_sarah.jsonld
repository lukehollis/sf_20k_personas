Growing up as the overlooked middle child in a bustling Sacramento suburb, she became a keen student of family dynamics. While her older brother commanded attention and her younger sister charmed, Sarah learned to listen, developing a deep empathy for the unspoken needs of others. This innate skill led her to UC Santa Cruz for a bachelor's in Psychology, where she explored the theories behind the feelings she had long intuited.\n\nHer pivotal moment came during her Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. An internship placed her in an under-resourced middle school, where she was confronted with the raw, complex realities of adolescent trauma, poverty, and anxiety. It was there, amidst the chaos of crowded hallways, that her purpose solidified. She wasn't just an observer anymore; she was a necessary advocate, a safe space. After earning her MSW, she pursued the rigorous process of licensure, becoming an LCSW specializing in school-based mental health.\n\nNow 30, Sarah\u2019s life is contained within the fog-kissed streets of San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern healthcare landscape; she works entirely from a corner of her light-filled apartment, providing telehealth therapy to students across the city. Her days are structured by virtual sessions, where she offers a crucial emotional lifeline through a screen. To decompress from the weight of her work, she relies on ritual: long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, browsing the quiet shelves of local bookstores, and meeting her small, close-knit circle of friends\u2014mostly fellow therapists\u2014for dim sum on Clement Street.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of quiet purpose. She feels intrinsically part of the city\u2019s social fabric, even if her contribution is made from her own home. Her dream is to eventually develop a preventative mental wellness program for elementary school students, addressing issues before they escalate. Personally, she hopes to find a relationship built on the same mutual support she offers her clients, and to continue mastering the delicate balance of caring for an entire community while still saving enough of herself for the woman in the mirror."
