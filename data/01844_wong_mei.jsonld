The daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, perpetually steamy laundromat in the Richmond District, Mei\u2019s upbringing was defined by pragmatism and the hum of working machinery. While her friends dreamed of liberal arts degrees, Mei was fascinated by her father\u2019s ability to coax another year of life out of a failing washing machine with just a wrench and sheer willpower. She saw beauty in function, a value that shaped her future.\n\nForegoing the path to a four-year university and its associated debt, Mei enrolled at City College of San Francisco. It was a practical decision. She earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Electronics Technology, finding a deep satisfaction in the clean logic of circuit boards and schematics. This degree became her entry into the hidden, blue-collar heart of the tech industry. She wasn\u2019t coding apps; she was building the physical hardware that powered them.\n\nHer key turning point came three years ago. After a series of contract jobs, she landed a permanent position as a Manufacturing Technician at a boutique firm that assembles high-end medical robotics. The company operated out of a renovated warehouse, and the definitive perk was one of the building\u2019s few subsidized live-work lofts. Seizing the opportunity to escape San Francisco\u2019s ruthless housing market was a no-brainer. Her commute became a thirty-second walk.\n\nMei\u2019s life is one of meticulous routine. Mornings begin not with a drive, but with the process of gowning up for the cleanroom. Her days are spent under magnifying lamps, her hands steady as she works on intricate components. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of a few colleagues and a childhood friend. She is close with her younger brother, a software engineer at a large downtown firm, and they share a quiet, sibling rivalry over whose work is more \"real.\"\n\nThough content, Mei aspires for more than just stability. She dreams of becoming a lead technician, of mastering the most complex diagnostic equipment in her lab. Her ultimate goal is to save enough for a down payment on a small condo in the Sunset, a place truly her own, where the line between home and work is finally, definitively drawn. She is a native San Franciscan who loves the city not for its glamour, but for its foggy mornings and the tangible satisfaction of building something with her own two hands."
