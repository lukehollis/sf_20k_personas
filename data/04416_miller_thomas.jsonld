Adopted as an infant by a loving, white middle-class couple, he was raised in the quiet suburbs of Marin County. While his parents, a teacher and a librarian, gave him a world of books and support, he grew up with a quiet, persistent sense of displacement\u2014a loving outsider in his own family and community. This feeling became the seed of his life's work.\n\nHis undergraduate years at UC Davis were academically aimless until a volunteer position with a refugee resettlement agency ignited a sense of purpose. He saw in the eyes of newly arrived families a reflection of his own search for belonging. This experience became his true north, leading him to San Francisco to pursue a Master of Social Work at SF State. He fell in love with the city's mosaic of cultures and its embrace of chosen families. He never left.\n\nThe past two decades have been a steady climb through the city\u2019s nonprofit sector. Starting as a case manager, his empathy and sharp administrative skills saw him rise to his current role as a Program Director. He now develops and oversees programs that provide mentorship and resources for at-risk youth and new immigrant families.\n\nAt 41, Thomas\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his work-from-home office is his bay window, overlooking the fog rolling in from the ocean. His days are a mix of grant writing, Zoom meetings with his team, and long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. His social life is a tight-knit circle, including his partner David, a landscape architect, and friends met through activism and years of shared apartment potlucks.\n\nHis dream is not one of wealth, but of impact. He hopes to launch a new, city-wide mentorship initiative connecting older generations of immigrants with new arrivals. On a more personal note, he\u2019s saving for a trip to South Korea\u2014not to search for his birth parents, but to finally connect with the culture of his birth on his own terms, bridging the final gap in his own story."

He looked at his smiling mother and father, their kind, blue eyes crinkling, then at his own reflection in the photographer's lens. It was the first time he consciously saw himself as a separate piece\u2014a beloved, dark-haired boy grafted onto a family tree of fair-haired people. It wasn't sadness he felt, but a profound, quiet sense of loving displacement that would silently shape the questions he\u2019d spend his life trying to answer.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent lights of the UC Davis volunteer office hummed. He was 20, helping a Vietnamese mother fill out a housing form, her young son clinging to her leg. She looked at him with an exhaustion and hope he recognized deep in his bones. In that moment of shared, unspoken understanding\u2014the search for a place to simply be\u2014his academic aimlessness vanished. It was an electric shock of purpose, realizing his own search for belonging could be used to help build a home for others.\n\n3.\nHis first \"Friendsgiving\" in a cramped SF State-era apartment felt like a revelation. The air was a mix of roasting garlic, kimchi, and tamales. Around a mismatched table sat people from every background, a chosen family forged over shared rent and late-night talks. No one asked where he was *really* from; he was just Thomas. As he took a bite of someone\u2019s grandmother\u2019s recipe, a deep, foundational loneliness he hadn\u2019t even realized he carried finally dissolved. He was home.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the day a teenage girl he mentored, a recent immigrant from Guatemala, called him sobbing with joy. She\u2019d gotten a full scholarship to college. He had spent years helping her navigate school systems and believe in her own potential. Her victory felt more significant than any promotion he\u2019d ever received. It was the crystallization of his life\u2019s work: not just helping one person, but creating a ripple of stability that would echo through a family for generations.\n\n5.\nJust last fall, walking with David through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. His partner was describing the architecture of the Dutch windmills when Thomas finally said it aloud: \"I'm saving to go to South Korea.\" David didn't ask why. He just squeezed his hand and said, \"I can't wait to see your pictures.\" In that simple, grounding moment of acceptance, the trip transformed from a search for origins into a celebration of his own, complete life\u2014a journey he was finally ready to take for himself."
