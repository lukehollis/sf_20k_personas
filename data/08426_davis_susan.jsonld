Born in Daly City to a Filipina immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father who worked at the Presidio, Susan grew up in a home filled with the aromas of both adobo and corned beef, a blend of cultures that felt entirely normal. She was a practical, observant child, absorbing her mother\u2019s resilience and her father\u2019s quiet sense of duty.\n\nHer journey after high school began with promise at City College of San Francisco, where she vaguely studied business administration. But her path veered when her father passed away unexpectedly. At 21, the need for a steady paycheck overshadowed the luxury of education. Susan left school and took a series of temp jobs, her sharp organizational skills making her a reliable, if unseen, cog in various downtown offices. In her late twenties, she landed a permanent position as an Administrative Assistant for the Department of Public Works. It wasn\u2019t a dream, but it was security\u2014a union job with a pension, a rarity that she clung to as the city around her transformed with tech booms and busts.\n\nA long-term relationship in her thirties defined a major turning point. Her partner, a graphic designer, wanted to move to Portland for a more affordable, creative life. For Susan, leaving San Francisco was unthinkable. Her aging mother, her job, and the very fabric of her identity were woven into the city\u2019s grid. They parted ways amicably, but the event solidified her resolve: she was a San Franciscan, for better or worse.\n\nNow 54, Susan\u2019s life operates within the cozy confines of her rent-controlled Inner Sunset apartment, where she has worked remotely since the pandemic. Her commute is a 10-foot walk from her bedroom to her desk. Her days are a routine of processing permits, scheduling maintenance crews via email, and participating in an endless stream of Teams meetings. Her social circle is small but deep: a weekly phone call with her mother in Pacifica and a monthly dinner with two other veteran city employees.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. It\u2019s the N Judah train rumbling past her window, the familiar greeting from the owner of the corner market, and long, meditative walks through the nearby Golden Gate Park. Susan isn\u2019t chasing a new career or a dramatic life change. Her quiet aspiration is to finally finish her associate\u2019s degree online\u2014not for advancement, but for the simple satisfaction of completing what she started over three decades ago. It\u2019s a dream that, much like her life, is modest, steadfast, and entirely her own."
