Raised in the beige, car-dependent landscape of Roseville, a suburb of Sacramento, she spent her adolescence feeling trapped by the necessity of a driver's license. The daughter of a pragmatic accountant and a real estate agent, her fascination with walkable cities and public transit was a source of gentle family confusion. For Eleanor, the rattling journey of a light rail train into the city was a thrilling escape, a promise of a more connected, less isolated way of living.\n\nThis fascination became a focused ambition. She pursued an undergraduate degree at UCLA, where the city\u2019s legendary gridlock served as a daily case study in everything she wanted to fix. A semester abroad in Amsterdam was a critical turning point, revealing a world where bicycles and trams created a vibrant urban fabric. She returned home with absolute clarity, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Urban and Regional Planning program. Upon graduating, she accepted a coveted position as a Transportation Planner with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA).\n\nNow, at 24, Eleanor embodies her professional principles. She purposefully chose a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate move that places her within a ten-minute walk of her Civic Center office, rendering her official commute nonexistent. Her days are a mix of data analysis, GIS mapping for proposed bike lanes, and attending public feedback meetings. Her social life is intertwined with her work; her closest friends are fellow planners and policy wonks she met in grad school. Evenings are often spent walking to a new restaurant or taking the J-Church line to Dolores Park.\n\nEleanor\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She sees the city not just as her home, but as a living laboratory and a personal project. Her dream isn\u2019t wealth or status, but impact: to one day walk down a street like Valencia or Geary and see a dedicated bus lane or a protected intersection she helped design, knowing she made a tangible contribution to the city\u2019s flow and safety. Her aspiration is to live in the kind of city she actively works to create."
