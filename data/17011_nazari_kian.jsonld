His parents, both engineers, left Tehran for San Jose in the early 1990s, building a life of suburban stability for Kian and his older sister. They provided everything except the vocabulary for the quiet grief of displacement. Growing up, Kian was a sensitive observer, acutely aware of the unspoken sadness in his home. While his parents championed practical careers, he was drawn to the space between words, the emotional landscape his family so carefully avoided. This pull became his calling.\n\nHis educational journey was a quiet act of rebellion. After earning a B.A. in Psychology from UC Davis, he moved to San Francisco for his graduate degree in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco. The city, with its embrace of complex identities, felt like an exhalation. He had spent years feeling not quite Iranian enough for his extended family and not quite American enough at school; in SF, that nuance was a strength. The turning point came during his internship at a family resource center, where he counseled a teenager struggling to communicate with her immigrant grandparents. In their dynamic, he saw his own family\u2019s echoes and knew he had found his life\u2019s work.\n\nNow an LMFT, Kian works for a community health organization serving low-income families in the Mission District. His days are a mix of intense sessions, paperwork, and the deep satisfaction of helping others build bridges he wishes his own family had. His 2.8-mile bike commute from his small Inner Richmond apartment is a cherished ritual, a mental buffer between his professional and personal life. The ride through Golden Gate Park allows him to process the day's events.\n\nHis social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from grad school, his chosen family. They share potlucks, go on weekend hikes in the Headlands, and dissect their lives over beers at local pubs. Kian is deeply rooted in his neighborhood, a regular at his local coffee shop and the corner grocery store. His dream isn\u2019t wealth, but to one day open a small, sliding-scale private practice specializing in therapy for bicultural and immigrant families. He hopes to give others the tools to voice their own stories, an act of healing for both his clients and himself."

He saw his mother staring at a faded photo from Tehran, her thumb tracing the edge of a face he didn't know. She wasn\u2019t crying, but the silence in the room was heavier than any sound. He felt a deep, unnamed ache, a sorrow he\u2019d inherited but couldn\u2019t name. It was the first time he understood that some emotions lived only in the shadows, shaping his lifelong quest to bring them into the light.\n\n2.\nDuring his internship, a 16-year-old girl wept, describing her grandparents. \u201cThey love me, I know they do,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like there\u2019s a wall of glass between us.\u201d The phrase struck Kian like a tuning fork, vibrating with the unspoken truth of his own family. In that moment, his professional interest became a profound personal calling. He wasn't just helping her; he was finally building a vocabulary for his own quiet grief and the grief of countless others.\n\n3.\nHis first week of grad school, he walked down Valencia Street, overwhelmed. It wasn't the crowds, but the soundscape: Spanish, English, and then, a snippet of Farsi from a couple ahead. No one turned to stare; it was just one thread in the city's tapestry. For the first time, the hyphen in \"Iranian-American\" didn't feel like a fault line but a bridge. That feeling of anonymous belonging, of his complexity being normal, was the exhalation he didn't know he'd been holding.\n\n4.\nAfter a session heavy with a family\u2019s trauma, he pedaled into Golden Gate Park. The evening fog was rolling in, softening the edges of the cypress trees. As his lungs burned and the cool air hit his face, he felt the weight of the day loosen its grip. This ritual\u2014the physical effort, the quiet beauty\u2014became his essential tool for self-preservation. It taught him he had to metabolize the pain of others without letting it consume him, a lesson he learned on his bike, a few years into his career.\n\n5.\nAt a potluck last spring, a friend from his grad school cohort caught his eye. \u201cThat case you mentioned last week,\u201d she asked quietly, \u201chow are *you* sitting with it?\u201d The simple, direct question was everything his family\u2019s love, for all its strength, could never offer. In that moment of being truly seen, he felt the deep, anchoring roots of his chosen family\u2014a support system built not on blood, but on shared understanding and the courage to ask the hard questions."
