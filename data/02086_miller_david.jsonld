            "value": "David Miller\u2019s calm demeanor as a therapist is a peace he conscientiously built, not one he inherited. Raised in the quiet suburbs of Sacramento, his childhood home was a battlefield of unspoken anxieties. His mother wrestled with a deep, undiagnosed depression that blanketed the house in a perpetual gloom, while his father, a stoic engineer, treated emotions as design flaws to be ignored. David, by necessity, became the family\u2019s emotional barometer, learning to read subtle shifts in tone and mood, a skill that would later define his career.\n\nHis escape was UC Davis, where he initially pursued political science, thinking he could fix the world\u2019s larger systems. The real turning point came during his junior year when his mother had a severe breakdown, forcing the family\u2019s hidden struggles into the open. Confronting this crisis head-on, David realized his true calling wasn't in policy, but in helping individuals navigate their internal chaos. He switched his focus, eventually earning his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, drawn to the Bay Area's progressive approach to mental health.\n\nHis early career was a crucible. As an LCSW at a major San Francisco hospital, he worked with patients facing catastrophic illness, trauma, and systemic neglect. While deeply rewarding, the relentless exposure to suffering led to profound burnout. This crisis prompted him to leave the hospital system and establish his own private practice.\n\nNow, at 41, David\u2019s life is a study in intentional tranquility. He works exclusively from his quiet Inner Sunset apartment, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his kitchen to his home office. His days are structured around telehealth sessions, where he helps clients navigate their own struggles. Mornings often begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, his sanctuary from the city's frenetic energy. He has a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly former colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their field. While he hopes for a lasting romantic partnership, he is content in his cultivated solitude. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to fix the world, but to offer a calm, steady space for others to begin healing themselves, a service he wishes someone could have offered his family all those years ago."
