Raised in a quiet, working-class Chicago neighborhood, she was the daughter of a high school history teacher and a meticulous bookkeeper. Her childhood was spent not in playgrounds, but in the hushed aisles of public libraries, where her father\u2019s love for the past and her mother\u2019s gift for order converged within her. She found comfort in the Dewy Decimal System and the tangible weight of history held in bound volumes.\n\nThis passion led her to the University of Illinois for her Master's in Library and Information Science. While her peers were drawn to corporate or academic tracks, Sonja was fascinated by the impending \u201cdigital dark age\u201d\u2014the risk of losing a generation\u2019s worth of history to obsolete file formats and server crashes. A posting for a Lead Digital Archivist at a major San Francisco museum felt like a calling. It was not just a job; it was a mission.\n\nThe move west eight years ago was a profound turning point. Leaving behind the predictable grid of Chicago and the comfortable familiarity of her family, she arrived in a city of chaotic beauty and constant change. Her first few years were dedicated to her work, building a robust digital preservation program from the ground up. She became the guardian of Bay Area ephemera, from digitized zines of the 90s punk scene to the oral histories of Dot-com boom veterans.\n\nToday, Sonja lives a deliberately curated life in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a Muni ride across the city, a physical book always in hand\u2014a small rebellion against the digital world she expertly manages. Her apartment, filled with carefully chosen second-hand furniture and thriving plants, is her sanctuary. Her social circle is small but deep, built around a shared love for art films, long walks through Golden Gate Park, and a fiercely competitive book club.\n\nSonja\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of a professional custodian. She sees the city as a living archive and feels a deep responsibility to preserve its stories. Her dream is to one day lead a project that digitizes the complete history of the city's LGBTQ+ movement. While she hopes for a lasting partnership, she is content building a life on her own terms, finding a quiet, profound purpose in ensuring the past has a future."
