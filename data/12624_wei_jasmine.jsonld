The daughter of two first-generation Taiwanese engineers in Cupertino, her childhood was a structured world of math tutors, piano lessons, and the ambient pressure to excel in a STEM field. While she was a dutiful daughter, she found her only true release in dance, a discipline where she felt the connection between emotion and physical expression, even if she couldn't yet articulate it.\n\nHer turning point came during her undergraduate years at UC Berkeley. Surrounded by brilliant peers running on caffeine and anxiety, she saw the immense emotional cost of the Bay Area\u2019s achievement culture. This firsthand observation of burnout felt more compelling than any business lecture. Rejecting the path laid out for her, she pursued a Master\u2019s in Counseling Psychology, eventually specializing in somatic therapy\u2014a field that finally gave a name to what she had always understood through dance: that trauma and stress live in the body.\n\nNow 38, Jasmine has carved out a unique professional niche. She runs a private somatic therapy practice from a calming, light-filled office in Hayes Valley, helping individuals process trauma through breathwork and movement. Two days a week, she pivots, consulting for tech companies on corporate wellness. It\u2019s a pragmatic compromise; she uses the corporate income to subsidize her private practice, bringing mindfulness to the very culture she once sought to escape.\n\nHer life is centered in her Inner Richmond apartment, a space she shares with her partner, a landscape architect. Her daily MUNI ride on the N-Judah is a cherished ritual, a time to read or simply watch the city wake up. Mornings often start with a walk in Golden Gate Park, grounding herself before she holds space for others. Her San Francisco is not the city of frantic IPOs, but of foggy park mornings, diverse neighborhood restaurants, and a close-knit circle of friends who prioritize connection over networking. Jasmine\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to scale a business, but to deepen her impact\u2014perhaps by opening a small wellness collective that makes holistic care more accessible, creating a sanctuary of slowness in the heart of a city that never stops moving."

Her body moved in a way she hadn't planned\u2014a surge of unnamable sadness and teenage frustration finding form in her limbs. It wasn't about performance; it was about release. In that sweaty, sunlit moment of pure expression, she first understood that her body had a language her mind couldn't yet speak. This truth became the seed of her life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in UC Berkeley's Moffitt Library during her sophomore finals week. She found her roommate, a brilliant coding prodigy, silently crying, her body clenched over her laptop. The bug wasn't the issue; it was the crushing weight of expectation. Seeing that raw, physical manifestation of burnout\u2014the hunched shoulders, the shallow breath\u2014was more compelling than any business lecture. Her path veered that night. She knew she wasn't meant to build the machine, but to help the person breaking under its pressure.\n\n3.\nHer first year in private practice, around age 32. A client, frozen by grief, had been circling his pain for weeks. She gently guided him through a simple grounding exercise, asking him to notice the tension in his chest. Suddenly, a sob escaped him\u2014a ragged, long-held sound that shook his entire frame as he finally connected thought to feeling. It was the body speaking its truth. For Jasmine, it was a moment of profound, humbling validation, affirming her rebellion was not an escape, but a true calling.\n\n4.\nA few years after moving to the Inner Richmond, she was walking with her partner through Golden Gate Park on a thick, foggy morning. The eucalyptus scent was heavy, muffling the city\u2019s roar to a whisper. He pointed out the intricate structure of a dew-covered fern. In that quiet, shared observation, a profound sense of peace settled in her. This was it. Not a frantic achievement, but this gentle slowness, this deep belonging. This was the version of success she had chosen for herself, right here in the fog.\n\n5.\nLast year, standing in a sterile, glass-walled conference room at a flashy tech campus, a wave of irony hit her. But as she guided the stressed-out engineers through a breathing exercise, she saw one young woman\u2019s shoulders, which had been up by her ears, drop a full inch. The tension in her jaw softened. It was a fleeting, almost imperceptible shift, but Jasmine saw it. She realized she wasn't just compromising; she was planting a small seed of sanctuary inside the very culture she once fled."
