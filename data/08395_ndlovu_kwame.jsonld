His name, a legacy from his Afro-Panamanian father whose own roots trace back to Jamaican canal workers, often causes people to stumble when they learn he identifies as Latino. Growing up in Oakland\u2019s vibrant, yet challenging, Fruitvale district, his world was a rich tapestry of his mother\u2019s Dominican Spanish, the aroma of sancocho, and the resilient spirit of a working-class immigrant community. He watched his parents work grueling jobs, their fatigue a silent testament to the American Dream\u2019s high cost. It was in translating for his elders at clinics and navigating bureaucratic paperwork that Kwame first felt the pull toward advocacy. He saw how stress, poverty, and cultural dislocation manifested as physical and emotional ailments, often unaddressed.\n\nThis early exposure to systemic struggle fueled his educational path. He earned his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley before pursuing a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. A key turning point was an internship at a community health center in the Mission District, where he worked with a supervisor who showed him how culturally competent therapy could empower individuals to reclaim their narratives. The experience solidified his calling. After earning his MSW, he diligently completed his clinical hours and passed the rigorous exam to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).\n\nNow 29, Kwame lives and works from his small apartment in the Inner Richmond. The pandemic shifted his role at a major San Francisco hospital almost entirely to telehealth, reducing his commute to zero. His days consist of back-to-back video sessions, providing crucial mental health support to patients grappling with chronic illness, anxiety, and trauma. To decompress, he runs through Golden Gate Park, the fog-dampened air a balm for the second-hand stress he absorbs. His social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow social workers and friends from grad school, often meeting for dim sum on Clement Street or for volleyball at Ocean Beach.\n\nKwame\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of both appreciation and concern. He loves its progressive ideals but sees the glaring disparities every day in his work. His dream is to eventually open a small private practice or non-profit dedicated to serving the Bay Area's Afro-Latino and Black immigrant communities, creating a space where people who look and sound like his parents can find healing and be truly understood."
