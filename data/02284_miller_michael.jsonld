Raised in working-class Daly City, son of a city bus driver and a receptionist, Michael\u2019s world was one of practicality. He was the kid who took apart the family VCR and actually put it back together, better than before. A four-year university felt like a different universe; instead, he earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Building Management Technology from a community college, a credential that was as unglamorous as it was useful.\n\nHis career began in the boiler rooms and on the rooftops of older downtown buildings. He was reliable, sharp, and could diagnose a failing electrical system by sound alone. The turning point came a decade ago after a quiet divorce left him adrift. The offer from a rapidly expanding tech company in Mission Bay was unconventional: a generous salary for a Facilities Maintenance Manager and a clean, modern one-bedroom apartment on the top floor of their new campus. His 0.0-mile commute was born out of convenience and a need for a clean break.\n\nNow, at 43, Michael lives a life of surreal duality. By day, he is the indispensable wizard of the physical plant, managing a team of technicians and contractors who keep the gleaming campus operational for its young, ambitious workforce. He\u2019s respected, but seen as part of the building\u2019s infrastructure, a friendly but distant figure they call when a smart window glitches.\n\nAt night, the campus becomes his private kingdom. He walks the silent, empty halls, the colorful beanbag chairs and whiteboard walls feeling like a museum to a culture he observes but doesn't belong to. His social life exists outside this tech bubble; he has a steady, comfortable relationship with a nurse he met at a Giants game, their dates taking place in the old-school bars of North Beach, far from the world of IPOs. Michael\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup, but to save enough to buy a small duplex in the Sunset, a place with a yard where he can fix his own leaky faucets and finally have a commute again."
