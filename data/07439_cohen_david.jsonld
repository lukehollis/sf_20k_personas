Raised in the sprawling, sun-baked suburbs of Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley, he was the quiet, observant son of a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing but fretful preschool teacher mother. They hoped he\u2019d pursue law, a career of clear rules and tangible success. But David was always drawn to the unspoken currents in a room, the emotions people tried to hide.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year at UCLA. His beloved grandmother was diagnosed with a fast-moving cancer, and David witnessed the family's raw, chaotic grief. The one stabilizing force was a hospital social worker, a calm, compassionate woman who navigated the labyrinth of healthcare options and, more importantly, provided a space for his family to process their fear. In that sterile hospital hallway, David found his calling. He abandoned his political science major and aimed for a Master of Social Work, earning his degree from UC Berkeley, which brought him to the Bay Area for good.\n\nFor nearly two decades, David worked in the trenches of San Francisco healthcare, first in the emergency department at SF General and later in the oncology wing at a major hospital. The work was grueling, a daily immersion in trauma and loss that he learned to compartmentalize but never fully shake. When the pandemic normalized telehealth, he saw an opportunity. He transitioned to a fully remote role, providing therapy and resource navigation from the quiet of his second bedroom.\n\nNow, at 44, his life is contained within his foggy Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse. His day begins with a walk in Golden Gate Park, a necessary ritual to clear his head before logging on to face a day of virtual sessions with patients grappling with illness and end-of-life decisions. After a long-term relationship ended two years ago, his social life is small but solid: a weekly dinner with two old friends, occasional Giants games. His hope is not for grandeur, but for balance. He dreams of finding a new partnership built on quiet understanding and, someday, finally mastering the chords on the dusty acoustic guitar leaning in the corner of his living room, a tangible act of creation in a life spent managing deconstruction."
