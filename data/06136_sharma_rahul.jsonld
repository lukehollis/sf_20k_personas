The eldest son of Indian immigrants, Rahul was pushed towards a stable, respectable career in engineering. He dutifully enrolled at San Jose State University, his days a blur of calculus and coding labs he felt little passion for. He was playing a part, not living a life.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year when his father, a taxi driver, suffered a back injury that left him unable to work for months. Suddenly, the family\u2019s precarious financial stability crumbled. Without a second thought, Rahul dropped out of college and took a full-time job at a retail clothing store in the local mall. It was meant to be temporary, but he discovered an unexpected talent for the work. He had a natural ease with customers and a sharp eye for merchandising. Within three years, he had worked his way up from stockroom associate to assistant manager.\n\nThe offer to manage a new boutique in San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley was his ticket to independence. Now 25, his life is defined by a 0.0-mile commute; he lives in a small apartment directly above the shop he runs. His days are a whirlwind of inventory management, staff scheduling, and building relationships with the neighborhood regulars. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of colleagues and other local business owners who share a bond forged over late-night closings and shared frustrations.\n\nThough proud of his self-made success, Rahul carries a quiet insecurity about his unfinished degree, especially in a city obsessed with credentials. He dreams of a future where the name above the door is his own\u2014perhaps a curated shop that blends modern design with handcrafted goods from India. For now, he finds contentment in the city\u2019s rhythm, feeling more a part of San Francisco\u2019s fabric than he ever did in a college lecture hall. He is a provider, a manager, and a resident building his own version of the dream his parents had for him."
