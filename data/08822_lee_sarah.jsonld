Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she is the only child of hardworking Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small neighborhood laundromat. Her childhood was filled with the scents of steam and detergent, and the constant, quiet diligence of her parents taught her the value of meticulous care and a strong work ethic.\n\nWhile her parents hoped she would pursue a more stable profession, Sarah was drawn to the expressive world of fashion. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Fashion Merchandising. Her career began on the bustling sales floor of a Union Square department store. There, she discovered a natural talent for understanding not just clothes, but the people who wore them. She could intuit a client\u2019s needs before they spoke, building a loyal following that valued her honest, discerning eye.\n\nA key turning point came in her early thirties. Her marriage dissolved over a fundamental disagreement: her ex-husband wanted a quiet suburban life, while Sarah\u2019s ambition was inextricably tied to the city\u2019s vibrant pulse. Choosing her career was choosing herself. She poured her energy into her work, moving from large retailers to smaller, more exclusive boutiques, eventually being handpicked to manage Aura.\n\nNow at 51, Sarah\u2019s life is a curated collection, much like the racks in her store. She lives simply and elegantly in the apartment above the shop, a perk of her position. Her daily routine is a neighborhood ritual: a morning espresso from the cafe next door, chats with other local shop owners, and evenings spent with her cat, Jasper, and a good book. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few longtime friends and former clients.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she has witnessed its many transformations without ever wanting to leave. While she is content, a quiet dream simmers. She aspires to one day open her own small boutique, a culmination of her life\u2019s experience\u2014a space that is entirely her own vision, perhaps back in the quiet avenues of the Sunset, bringing her journey full circle."
