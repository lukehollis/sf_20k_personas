The only son of Iranian immigrants who settled in San Jose in the late 1980s, Kian grew up surrounded by the sprawling, car-dependent landscape of Silicon Valley. His father, an electrical engineer, and his mother, a pharmacist, instilled in him a deep respect for education and precision. Yet, Kian felt a disconnect from his suburban environment; the endless cul-de-sacs and reliance on highways felt isolating and inefficient.\n\nHis turning point came during a semester abroad in Copenhagen while studying at UC Davis. He was mesmerized by a city built for people, not just cars. The seamless integration of cycling infrastructure and public transit was a revelation, sparking a passion that would define his future. He returned to California with a mission, promptly enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Urban Planning program.\n\nNow, Kian works as a Transportation Planner for a private consulting firm in San Francisco's Financial District. His days are spent analyzing traffic data, modeling pedestrian flow, and designing protected bike lanes and more efficient bus routes for city projects. He sees his work as a tangible way to correct the suburban mistakes of his youth.\n\nKian lives his philosophy. His home is a one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood he loves for its chaotic vibrancy and walkability. His 2.8-mile commute is a daily joy on his well-maintained road bike, a journey through the city\u2019s complex, living fabric. His social life is woven from a close-knit group of grad school friends and his climbing partners at Mission Cliffs. He's currently single, finding the San Francisco dating scene a puzzle he hasn't quite solved.\n\nKian\u2019s dream is to one day lead a transformative public project, like a new BART line or a city-wide network of \u201cslow streets.\u201d He feels an intense connection to San Francisco\u2014not as a native, but as a dedicated specialist who sees its flaws and believes wholeheartedly in his ability to help shape its future into a more sustainable, equitable, and connected place for everyone."

His mom was stuck in traffic, and the nearest bus stop was a two-mile walk across a highway overpass. He felt a profound sense of powerlessness, a prisoner of pavement and poor planning. That feeling of being trapped by design\u2014the quiet, isolating inefficiency of it all\u2014became the problem he would dedicate his life to solving, long before he even had a name for it.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the first morning he rented a bike in Copenhagen. The air was crisp. The dominant sound wasn't cars, but the gentle whir of hundreds of chains, a river of people flowing effortlessly. It wasn't just transit; it was the city's lifeblood, a system built on trust and human scale. In that moment of seamless, silent motion, his future clicked into place. The suburban isolation of his youth felt like a solvable equation for the first time. He had found his purpose.\n\n3.\nIt was six months after the paint dried on his first solo project: a protected bike lane on Folsom. He was riding home when he saw a father teaching his young daughter to ride in it. Safe from the rush of traffic, her small bike wobbled but held its line. Kian felt a warmth spread through his chest, a feeling more potent than any data model. He hadn't just rerouted traffic; he'd created a tiny pocket of safety and freedom. It was a tangible correction, a small piece of his vision made real.\n\n4.\nOne warm Thursday last summer, his bike had a flat, so he walked home through the Mission. The air was thick with the smell of grilling bacon-wrapped hot dogs and the sound of cumbia blasting from a storefront. He navigated past muralists, families with strollers, and old men playing dominoes. It was inefficient, chaotic, and gloriously human. He felt an overwhelming sense of belonging\u2014not as a planner analyzing a system, but as a resident simply living inside its messy, vibrant, beating heart.\n\n5.\nHe was at Mission Cliffs, staring at a bouldering problem he\u2019d been failing for weeks. His planner's mind tried to deconstruct it, to find the most efficient sequence, but his body just kept peeling off the wall. Frustrated, he dropped to the mat and watched his partner flow through it using a counter-intuitive beta. It was a lesson in humility. He realized some complex systems\u2014like rock faces, or a city, or even dating\u2014can\u2019t always be solved by sheer logic alone; they demand instinct and a different kind of patience."
