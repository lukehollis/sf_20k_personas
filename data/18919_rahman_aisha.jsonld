The daughter of disciplined Bangladeshi immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised with the expectation that she would follow her engineer father into a stable, lucrative STEM field. Her mother, a gifted textile artist whose talents were confined to the home, secretly nurtured Aisha\u2019s creative spark. While her peers were in coding camps, Aisha was creating elaborate zines and exploring the nascent culture of early internet bulletin board systems, fascinated by how people connected through digital artifacts.\n\nThis duality defined her education. She appeased her parents with a Computer Science minor at UC Santa Cruz but followed her heart with an Art History major. This led to a Master of Fine Arts in Digital Media, a degree her parents found baffling. Aisha rode the first dot-com wave, designing user interfaces for flashy, ephemeral startups. The 2000 bust was her turning point. Burnt out by the relentless focus on profit, she took a significant pay cut for an entry-level web role at the de Young Museum, finally uniting her two passions. Over two decades, she meticulously worked her way up, pioneering the museum\u2019s digital strategy from a static website to the immersive, interactive experience she now directs.\n\nToday, Aisha lives a curated life in a minimalist Hayes Valley condo, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to her focused, remote-work lifestyle. Her days begin with a walk to Ritual Coffee and end either at a gallery opening, an SFJAZZ performance, or quietly at home with a book. Though she has a close-knit circle of friends from the art and tech worlds, she cherishes her independence, having prioritized her career over long-term partnership. San Francisco is not just her home; it's her canvas and her community. Her ambition is no longer about climbing a ladder, but digging deeper: using technology not as a novelty, but as a tool to provoke emotion and make art profoundly accessible to a generation that lives through a screen."
