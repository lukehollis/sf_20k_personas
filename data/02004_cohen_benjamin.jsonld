Raised in the manicured suburbs of Scarsdale, New York, by a lawyer father and a CPA mother, his childhood was a structured system of piano lessons, soccer practice, and logical reasoning. He was the kid who organized his LEGOs by color and function, finding deep satisfaction in creating efficient, harmonious structures. This innate drive led him to pursue an engineering degree at Cornell, where he excelled but felt a growing disconnect from the East Coast\u2019s traditional career tracks of finance and law.\n\nThe turning point was a soul-crushing summer internship at a monolithic Wall Street firm, where he witnessed colossal inefficiency masquerading as prestige. He realized he didn\u2019t want to be a cog in an old machine; he wanted to design better ones. This epiphany propelled him west to Stanford for a Master's in Industrial & Systems Engineering, where the promise of Silicon Valley felt like a meritocratic frontier.\n\nNow 34, Ben has carved out a niche as a Process Improvement Engineer for a major tech company. His 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of his life. From his meticulously organized apartment in NoPa (North of the Panhandle), he optimizes workflows and streamlines digital architecture. His day is a well-oiled routine: coffee from a local roaster on Divisadero, a deep work block until noon, followed by a cathartic run through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nHis social life, however, defies optimization. A recent breakup with Clara, a graphic designer whose spontaneity both thrilled and baffled him, left him introspective. He finds a deep irony in his ability to perfect complex corporate systems while struggling with the unpredictable variables of human connection. He navigates the dating apps with a systems-analyst mindset, trying to find patterns in a sea of chaotic data.\n\nBen loves his neighborhood\u2019s energy\u2014the blend of old Victorian architecture with vibrant new restaurants. His aspiration isn't just to climb the corporate ladder, but to apply his improvement ethos to himself. He dreams of building a genuine partnership, a system of two that is less about perfect efficiency and more about resilient, joyful, and beautifully imperfect collaboration."
