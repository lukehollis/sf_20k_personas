Raised by a civil engineer father and a librarian mother, her childhood was a masterclass in order, logic, and the quiet power of well-organized public resources. While she appreciated the stability, a yearning for a more dynamic, complex landscape pulled her west. A graduate degree in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley was her one-way ticket, trading flat landscapes for fault lines and midwestern pragmatism for Californian idealism.\n\nShe began her career with a junior role at a regional transit authority before landing her current position as a Transportation Planner for the San Francisco government. Over two decades, she has become an institutional memory for the city's circulatory system. A key turning point was her instrumental role in the planning and implementation of a major bus rapid transit corridor, a bruising, multi-year battle of community meetings and bureaucratic hurdles that left her exhausted but deeply proud.\n\nAt 46, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her Hayes Valley condo, the \"0.0 miles\" commute a post-pandemic norm she has embraced. Her days begin with a walk with her rescue terrier, Muni, to a local coffee shop before she settles into her home office. A long-term relationship that ended in her mid-thirties cemented the city, not a person, as her primary partner. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of fellow policy wonks and old friends from grad school, with whom she enjoys hikes in the Presidio and dinners in the Mission.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is academic, professional, and deeply personal. She sees the city not just in its landmarks, but in its traffic flow data, pedestrian counts, and desire lines carved into grassy parks. Her quiet aspiration is to see one more transformative project through to completion\u2014perhaps a new light rail extension or a revolutionary congestion pricing plan. She doesn't just live in San Francisco; she metabolizes its rhythms and challenges, hoping to leave its pathways a little more logical, a little more efficient than she found them."
