Born in Oakland to first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store, his childhood was a blur of stocking shelves and translating for customers after school. He absorbed his parents' tireless work ethic, viewing it as the only path to stability. With their encouragement, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, aiming for a business degree that felt more like a duty than a passion. His world was planned out, predictable.\n\nThe plan fractured during his sophomore year when his father suffered a major health crisis. Without hesitation, David left school, trading textbooks for inventory ledgers to keep the family store afloat. For two years, he was the pillar his family needed. When his father recovered enough to sell the business and retire, David found himself at a crossroads. At 22, with a resume full of practical retail experience but no degree, returning to school felt like a step backward. Instead, he leaned into what he knew, taking an entry-level job at a large retail chain in San Francisco.\n\nOver the next decade, David\u2019s pragmatism and quiet competence saw him rise steadily through the ranks. He is now the manager of a sleek, minimalist home goods store in Hayes Valley. His defining life choice is his 0.0-mile commute; he lives in a modern apartment two floors above the shop. His daily routine is a hyperlocal loop: coffee from the barista he knows by name, a brief walk downstairs to work, and an after-work drink at the corner bar with a few colleagues. His social circle is small but loyal, a mix of old friends from high school and a few fellow retail lifers.\n\nThough content, David quietly nurtures a dream that feels like a refined echo of his parents' journey. He saves meticulously, hoping to one day open his own small, curated menswear boutique in the very neighborhood he now calls home. It\u2019s a vision of honoring his family\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, but this time, charting a course that is entirely his own."
