Born in Seoul, he was adopted as an infant by a loving, boisterous Irish-American couple, Liam and Shannon O\u2019Connell, and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. Growing up, he was a bridge between worlds: Sunday dinners were corned beef and cabbage, but his face reflected a heritage he wouldn\u2019t begin to explore until much later. He was a true San Franciscan kid, more interested in the logic of video games and building his own computer than in traditional academics.\n\nThis practical mindset guided his educational journey. While many of his peers aimed for UCs, Leo saw a clearer, faster path. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in IT Support and Networking. He thrived in the hands-on environment, finding deep satisfaction in untangling digital knots. His internship, secured through a CCSF job fair, was with a burgeoning biotech firm in Mission Bay. They were so impressed with his calm demeanor and quick problem-solving that they hired him full-time upon graduation.\n\nNow, at 24, Leo\u2019s life has a steady rhythm. His day begins with a MUNI bus ride from his small apartment in the Inner Richmond, a 5.5-mile journey he spends listening to tech podcasts. At work, he is the indispensable fixer, the calm in the digital storm for brilliant but often tech-illiterate scientists and executives. He finds pride in being the person who makes their groundbreaking work possible.\n\nEvenings are for unwinding with online co-op games with a close-knit group of friends from college or grabbing takeout from a favorite Clement Street noodle house. He remains close to his parents, who still live in the Sunset. His connection to San Francisco is that of a native; he knows its shortcuts, its microclimates, and its hidden gems. Though content, Leo dreams of leveling up. He\u2019s quietly studying for cybersecurity certifications, hoping to transition from support to a more specialized security role. He is saving diligently, with a vague goal of one day visiting Seoul\u2014not to search for his past, but simply to connect with a part of his identity that has, until now, just been a story."

That evening, he asked his dad, Liam, who knelt down and put a hand on his shoulder. \"O'Connell isn't about what you look like, son. It's about who loves you.\" The confusion dissolved into a profound sense of belonging. This memory became the bedrock of his identity, the simple, powerful logic that anchored him against any future questions about who he was.\n\n2.\nAt 14, his bedroom floor was a sea of components for his first custom-built PC. After a full day of frustration, nothing worked. He almost gave up, but then he spotted it: a single, misaligned pin on a motherboard connector. With a careful nudge, he fixed it, and the machine whirred to life. The surge of triumph wasn't just about the computer; it was the discovery of his own quiet power to find the one flaw in a complex system and make it right.\n\n3.\nHe remembers being about 10, waiting for the N Judah with his mom in the thick Sunset fog. He couldn't see the tracks, but he could hear the train\u2019s rumble growing in the grey mist. \"In this city, you learn to listen, not just look,\" she\u2019d said. That moment taught him to sense the patterns beneath the surface, to trust the signals others missed. It\u2019s a feeling he still gets, a quiet intimacy with the city that feels more like home than any landmark.\n\n4.\nAt his CCSF internship interview in Mission Bay, the hiring manager looked past his resume and asked him to fix her perpetually crashing laptop. He spent 20 silent minutes diagnosing a corrupt driver everyone else had missed. When he handed it back, working perfectly, her surprised gratitude was more validating than any A+. That day, at 19, he realized his value wasn't in a degree, but in being the calm person who could actually solve the problem. It confirmed his path was the right one.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a rare quiet Sunday at his parents' house, he found an old photo album. Tucked in the back was the referral photo from the Korean adoption agency\u2014a tiny, serious-looking baby. He\u2019d seen it before, but this time it sparked something different. Not a search for what was lost, but a deep curiosity for a place. Looking at that infant\u2019s face, the vague idea of visiting Seoul solidified into a quiet, personal goal: to stand in the city where his own story began."
