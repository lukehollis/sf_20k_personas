Growing up, he was the family\u2019s translator and navigator, bridging the gap between his parents' traditional world and the bustling city outside. He learned early on that stability was fragile and that community was everything. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a lucrative career in tech or finance, a family crisis set his path in stone.\n\nThe turning point was his grandmother\u2019s stroke when he was nineteen. He witnessed his family\u2019s fear and confusion as they struggled to understand doctors, insurance forms, and long-term care options. The one person who brought clarity and compassion to the chaos was a hospital social worker. She spoke to them with patience, found them resources they didn't know existed, and treated his grandmother with profound dignity. In that moment, David saw his future. He pursued a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University, specializing in gerontology and healthcare advocacy.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s life is a testament to his commitment. He is a social worker at a supportive housing facility for formerly unhoused individuals with chronic health conditions in the SoMa neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small staff apartment on the building's top floor. His days are a relentless cycle of navigating bureaucracy for his clients, providing counseling for end-of-life planning, and de-escalating crises born from trauma and illness.\n\nHis personal life is quiet. The work is all-consuming, making relationships difficult. His social circle consists of a few loyal friends from college who understand his dedication. He finds solace in long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park on his days off, a pilgrimage back to the landscape of his youth. His dream isn't of wealth, but of peace\u2014for his clients and himself. He harbors a quiet aspiration to one day take a sabbatical and finally visit his parents\u2019 ancestral village in Guangdong, to connect with a history he has only ever translated for others. For now, he remains a quiet anchor in the lives of the vulnerable, a constant in an ever-changing city."
