Born to parents who immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s, he grew up amidst the scent of inventory in their small neighborhood grocery store on Taraval Street. Witnessing his parents\u2019 constant toil instilled in David a desire for stability over prestige. When his father's health declined in the early 90s, David shelved plans for a four-year university, instead enrolling at City College of San Francisco to stay close to home. He earned an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology, a practical choice for a practical young man.\n\nHis career began not in a dazzling startup, but in the server rooms and help desks of established companies. He was laid off during the dot-com bust, a pivotal moment that pushed him toward the more resilient healthcare sector. He found his niche at a company developing patient monitoring systems. He wasn't the star engineer, but the essential translator: the person who could explain complex hardware to a stressed nurse over the phone or troubleshoot a software glitch during a critical update.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is governed by a quiet routine. The 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his small home office in his Inner Sunset apartment became permanent after the pandemic. His days are a steady stream of support tickets and video calls, his calm voice a reassuring presence for frantic healthcare workers across the country.\n\nSocially, David is more solitary than lonely. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, and his connections now revolve around a small circle of lifelong friends, with whom he shares occasional dim sum or walks around Lake Merced. He has watched with a sense of weary acceptance as his city transformed around him, the tech booms and busts washing over the familiar landscape. His dream isn't to get rich or change the world, but to maintain his independence, feel the satisfaction of a problem solved, and one day retire comfortably in the only city he has ever called home, watching the fog roll in over the Pacific."
