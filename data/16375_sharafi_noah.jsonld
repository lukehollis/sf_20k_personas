The son of Iranian immigrants who fled Tehran in 1979, he was raised in Fresno, a world away from the coastal metropolis he now calls home. His parents, a pharmacist and a teacher, instilled in him a deep respect for education and stability, hoping he\u2019d pursue medicine. However, Noah was always more interested in the *why* of human behavior than the mechanics of the body. He chose to study Psychology at UC Santa Cruz, a decision that created a gentle friction with his family\u2019s practical worldview.\n\nAfter graduating, Noah found himself in the Bay Area during the tail-end of the first dot-com bubble. He realized his academic training in human cognition was perfectly suited for the burgeoning field of web usability. He started as a junior researcher, translating the empathy of psychology into the logic of interface design. For over a decade, he honed his craft at various e-commerce and social media companies, becoming a skilled, well-compensated professional. But a turning point arrived in his late thirties; he felt a growing hollowness in optimizing checkout flows and increasing user engagement for its own sake.\n\nThis led him to pivot his career toward digital health. Now, as a Lead UX Researcher, he designs platforms that connect students with mental health resources and help patients manage chronic illnesses. This work satisfies a deeper need to contribute meaningfully, aligning his profession with his original fascination with the human mind.\n\nAt 47, Noah lives a life of earned contentment in his Inner Richmond apartment. His commute on the N Judah to his SoMa office is a cherished ritual, a time for podcasts and observing the city wake up. A decade past an amicable divorce, he is in a stable, loving relationship with a landscape architect. His social life is a small, tight circle of friends, with weekends often spent hiking in the Marin Headlands or exploring the culinary diversity of Clement Street. His aspiration is no longer to climb a corporate ladder, but to mentor the next generation of researchers and perhaps one day, travel with his partner to see the Persepolis his parents could only describe. Noah found his place not by inheriting it, but by carefully designing it, a life that feels intuitive, compassionate, and user-friendly."

His father\u2019s hopeful voice, laced with a Farsi accent, asked about his chemistry prerequisites. Noah had to explain his switch to a psychology major. The silence on the line was heavy, a quiet disappointment that stretched from the coast to the Central Valley. In that moment, he felt the painful, necessary weight of choosing his own blueprint over the one his parents had so carefully drafted for him.\n\n2. It was 11 PM under the sterile fluorescent lights of a SoMa startup. The team was celebrating a 0.7% lift in conversion after changing a button from teal to cerulean. He stared at the glowing graph, feeling a profound and sudden hollowness. He had spent months channeling his understanding of the human mind into getting someone to click \u2018Buy Now\u2019 marginally faster. The absurdity of it struck him with full force. This wasn't why he\u2019d been so fascinated by human behavior; he needed to build things that healed, not just sold.\n\n3. About a year after his divorce, he was eating a bowl of beef noodle soup alone on a foggy Tuesday night on Clement Street. The steam warmed his face as the familiar din of the restaurant\u2014clanking bowls, snippets of Cantonese\u2014wrapped around him. It wasn't lonely; it was deeply peaceful. He wasn\u2019t Noah the husband or Noah the researcher, just a man in his neighborhood. He realized this unglamorous, multicultural street felt more like home than any place he had ever lived, a quiet belonging he had found for himself.\n\n4. His headphones died just as the N Judah emerged from the Sunset tunnel into the morning light. Instead of annoyance, he looked around. A nurse reading, a student sketching, a construction worker dozing\u2014an entire cross-section of the city, moving together in silent sync. He felt a profound, quiet affection for this shared urban rhythm. It wasn\u2019t a grand epiphany, but it confirmed his contentment: he was exactly where he was supposed to be, a single, integrated part of the beautiful, complex system of San Francisco.\n\n5. They were hiking in the Marin Headlands, and Noah found himself describing Persepolis, the ruin he knew only from his parents\u2019 nostalgic stories. His partner, a landscape architect, paused and looked back at the distant city skyline. \u201cA well-designed space makes you feel something,\u201d he said. \"We'll go see it. Together.\" In that simple promise, Noah felt the final piece of his life\u2019s design click into place. His inherited past wasn't a closed chapter, but a future destination to be shared with the person who truly understood him."
