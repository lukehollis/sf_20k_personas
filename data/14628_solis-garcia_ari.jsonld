Raised in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of Sacramento by a teacher and an accountant, his childhood was defined by long drives and homogenous cul-de-sacs. This environment sparked a fascination with how cities could be better, more humane places. This led him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a BA in Geography and later, a Master of Urban Planning. It was at Berkeley that he fell in love with the Bay Area's chaotic energy and met his future husband, Mateo Garcia, an architecture student who shared his vision for vibrant public spaces.\n\nInitially, Ari began his career in the public sector, working for the city of Oakland on transit-oriented development. He was an idealist, focused on bike lanes, pedestrian safety, and strengthening public transit. The explosion of ride-sharing and autonomous vehicle (AV) technology in the 2010s presented a pivotal choice: fight the tech wave from the outside or try to steer it from within. Believing he could have a greater impact by shaping policy from the inside, Ari made the leap to the private sector.\n\nNow, as the Director of Autonomous Vehicle Policy, Ari navigates the complex intersection of disruptive technology and civic responsibility. His days are a tightrope walk between corporate growth targets and his own deep-seated urbanist principles. He and Mateo, now a successful architect, live in a thoughtfully designed condo in Hayes Valley. His 3.8-mile e-bike commute\u2014often gliding through the \"Wiggle\" bike route\u2014is a daily recommitment to the lifestyle he advocates for. He\u2019s an active member of his neighborhood association, often finding himself in debates that mirror his professional life.\n\nAri\u2019s core aspiration is to ensure that AVs contribute to a more equitable and less congested San Francisco, creating a system of shared, electric fleets rather than simply adding more private cars to the road. His greatest fear is that he\u2019ll fail, and the technology he helps implement will only worsen the urban problems he has dedicated his life to solving. Every policy memo he writes is a battle for the soul of the city he loves, a city he hopes to leave better, and more connected, than he found it."

For forty-five minutes, he was an island in a sea of asphalt, with nowhere to walk and nothing to do but watch cars whip past. It wasn't just boredom; it was a profound feeling of being trapped by design. That hot, isolating pavement was where his life\u2019s work began\u2014a rebellion against a world built for machines instead of people.\n\n2.\nIt was after a brutal midterm during his master\u2019s program at Berkeley. He and Mateo were walking up towards the Campanile, the lights of San Francisco glittering across the bay. Mateo stopped, tracing the lines of the cityscape with his hand, talking about buildings as living things. In that shared, breathless moment, he didn't just fall for Mateo; he fell for the future they could build together. His abstract urbanist ideals suddenly had a partner, a foundation, a home.\n\n3.\nHe stood on an Oakland corner, admiring a protected bike lane he\u2019d fought for months to get approved. His pride evaporated as he watched a string of ride-share cars double-park inside it, forcing cyclists to swerve dangerously into traffic. The sense of accomplishment curdled into a cold dread. He realized then that his well-intentioned plans were just painting lines on a problem being rewritten by code. To make a real difference, he had to get inside the machine.\n\n4.\nHe was on his e-bike, gliding down Page Street, when one of his company\u2019s AVs pulled to the curb. He watched, heart in his throat, as a woman using a power wheelchair expertly used the automated ramp he'd spent six months championing in policy memos. She gave a little smile of satisfaction as the door closed. It was a brief, powerful, and deeply personal victory\u2014a moment of pure proof that this technology *could* create a more equitable city, justifying every compromise.\n\n5.\nLast month, walking home from a contentious neighborhood association meeting, he saw it: one of his company's AVs, completely empty, circling the block. It was \"rebalancing,\" hunting for its next ride. To Ari, it was a ghost\u2014a symbol of his worst fear realized. An emission-free vehicle creating pointless congestion; a perfect technological solution to the wrong problem. It was a chilling glimpse into a future where he hadn't just failed to fix the city, but had actively helped break it more efficiently."
