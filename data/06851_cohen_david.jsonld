            "value": "David Cohen\u2019s name tells a quintessential San Francisco story. He was born in the Mission District to a Salvadoran mother who fled the civil war in the late 1970s and a Jewish-American father, a progressive activist who helped resettle refugees. David grew up in a small, rent-controlled apartment, a vibrant home filled with the aromas of pupusas and brisket, the sounds of Spanish cumbia and his father\u2019s folk records. He was a child of two worlds, fluent in both language and culture, a bridge from his very beginning.\n\nAfter graduating from Mission High, David enrolled at City College of San Francisco, vaguely intending to study sociology. However, his life veered sharply when his father died suddenly from a heart attack. At 20, David dropped out of college to support his grieving mother, taking on a series of jobs\u2014stocking shelves at Casa Lucas Market, washing dishes, and driving for a delivery service. He felt adrift, his own ambitions sublimated to the immediate need of survival.\n\nThe turning point came when he helped an elderly, monolingual neighbor navigate a terrifying tangle of medical bills and appointments. David realized his unique position as a cultural and linguistic translator was a powerful skill. He discovered a deep sense of purpose in guiding people through a system that was not built for them. He pursued a certification and became a Community Health Worker for a non-profit clinic just blocks from his childhood home.\n\nNow 46, David\u2019s life is his neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from the apartment he now shares with his aging mother. His day is spent connecting residents with healthcare, translating for doctors, and running wellness workshops. He is a familiar, trusted face, bridging the gap between new immigrants and established city services. Though he remains single, his life is rich with connection. His dream is not for wealth, but for the preservation of his community against the constant tide of gentrification. He hopes to see the Mission\u2019s soul endure and, one day, to finally finish that college degree\u2014not for a new career, but for himself and for the father who first taught him the meaning of community."
