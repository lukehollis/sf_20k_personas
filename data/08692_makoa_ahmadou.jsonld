            "value": "Ahmadou Makoa is a product of the Bay Area\u2019s unique cultural confluence. His name, a puzzle to many, tells the story of his parents: a determined Peruvian mother who immigrated to Oakland in the 80s, and an Afro-Polynesian father whose own roots were a complex tapestry of Samoan heritage and Black American history. Growing up in Oakland, Ahmadou was surrounded by a vibrant, chaotic urban landscape. He saw firsthand how policy decisions made in faraway offices could ripple through his community, shuttering local businesses or creating new parks. This awareness planted the seed for his future.\n\nHis educational path was a direct line toward understanding these forces. After an undergraduate degree in sociology, he pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, driven by a powerful, if idealistic, desire to build more equitable cities. Landing a role as a City Planner for the San Francisco government felt like the culmination of his life\u2019s work. He would be one of the people in the room, shaping the city he\u2019d admired from across the bay.\n\nA key turning point came three years into his job. Ahmadou was a lead planner on a major rezoning project in the Mission District\u2014the very neighborhood he had recently moved into. He believed in the project\u2019s goals of increasing housing density, but the victory felt hollow. In the year that followed its approval, he watched two family-run legacy businesses on his block get replaced by a soulless chain cafe and a luxury dog groomer. The guilt was a low, constant hum. Was he a public servant or an agent of displacement?\n\nNow at 38, his life is contained within the few square blocks of his apartment, from which he works remotely. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk to his living room desk, covered in blueprints and zoning maps. Divorced a year ago\u2014his ex-wife tired of competing with his all-consuming job\u2014his primary relationship is with the city itself. His daily routine involves long, meditative walks through the Mission's alleys and main streets, observing the tangible outcomes of his abstract work. He is both an architect of and a mourner for a changing San Francisco. His hope is no longer to build a perfect city, but a more modest, urgent one: to find a way to preserve its soul before people like him plan it out of existence."
