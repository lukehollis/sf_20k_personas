The only child of Taiwanese immigrants, he grew up in the fog-shrouded avenues of the Outer Richmond. His parents ran a small, beloved grocery store on Geary Boulevard, their lives a testament to relentless work and deferred dreams. They instilled in David a deep sense of responsibility, hoping he would pursue a stable, respectable career.\n\nInitially, David followed his passion, not their plan. He enrolled at San Francisco State University and lost himself in the grand narratives of the past, earning a Bachelor's degree in History. He envisioned a quiet life in academia, but the reality of SF\u2019s cost of living and the sight of his parents\u2019 aging hands sorting produce was a stark wake-up call. The turning point came during a visit home when his father, without judgment, asked, \"History is important, but will it secure your future?\" That question shifted David's path. He studied for his financial licenses, discovering an unexpected aptitude for market analysis. His history degree gave him a unique edge, allowing him to see economic trends not just as data points, but as repeating patterns of human behavior.\n\nNow 41, David is the principal of his own successful financial advisory firm, which he runs from a sleek home office in his SoMa condominium. The 0.0-mile commute affords him a disciplined lifestyle. Mornings begin with a run along the Embarcadero, followed by hours of managing portfolios and client calls via Zoom. He\u2019s respected for his calm demeanor and his ability to explain complex financial strategies through historical analogies. Though professionally fulfilled, his social life is curated and small; he maintains a close circle of old friends and dedicates Sundays to visiting his retired parents in the Richmond, a trip that feels like visiting a past life.\n\nHis connection to the city is layered\u2014he is a product of its working-class immigrant past and a driver of its high-finance present. Looking ahead, David hopes to bridge these two worlds. His quiet aspiration is to use his wealth to create a foundation that provides grants for historical preservation projects in the Bay Area, ensuring that the stories of the city that shaped him are not forgotten."
