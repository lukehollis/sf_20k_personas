Born in Vietnam, he was adopted as an infant by a loving French-American couple, the Moreaus, and raised in San Francisco's Richmond District. His upbringing was a comfortable mix of cultures, but one steeped in his parents' practical aspirations for him. They envisioned a stable career in tech or finance, a path paved with a four-year degree.\n\nFollowing their dream, Liam enrolled in business courses at a local community college. He felt immediately adrift. The world of spreadsheets and marketing plans felt abstract and lifeless compared to the vibrant city outside his classroom window. After three semesters of struggling for motivation, he quietly dropped out, a decision that created a gentle but persistent strain with his well-meaning parents. He spent a year working odd jobs, feeling disconnected from both his purpose and his city.\n\nThe turning point came unexpectedly. He took a part-time job as a janitor and helper at a small, play-based preschool in the Inner Sunset. Initially, it was just about a paycheck. But in the quiet moments after the children left, while cleaning paint from tiny tables, he was drawn to the joyful chaos he'd witnessed. He found himself fascinated by the intricate social negotiations over building blocks and the profound comfort of a well-read story. The head teacher, a woman named Anya with decades of experience, noticed his gentle presence and the easy way he had with the children who arrived early. She offered him a position as a Teacher Assistant.\n\nNow 27, Liam\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of that school. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down the back steps; he rents the small, affordable in-law unit of the converted house where the preschool operates. His days are a whirlwind of mediating disputes, tying shoelaces, and leading finger-painting sessions. He has found a profound sense of purpose in nurturing the city\u2019s youngest residents. His social life revolves around his fellow teachers and the community of parents.\n\nLiam aspires to return to school, but this time on his own terms, to get an associate's degree in Early Childhood Education. He dreams of one day co-running the school with Anya. While he feels a quiet pull to explore his Vietnamese heritage, his present is firmly rooted in his Inner Sunset neighborhood, a small, nurturing world he has built for himself within the sprawling, ambitious heart of San Francisco."
