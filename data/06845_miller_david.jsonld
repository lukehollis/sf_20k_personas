Raised by an engineer father and a librarian mother, his world was built on logic, structure, and the quiet rustle of turning pages. He dutifully earned a Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Illinois, a practical choice that pleased his parents. But a rebellious, intellectual curiosity led him to a Master\u2019s degree that he rarely mentions in corporate settings: English Literature. It was an act of personal defiance, a passion he believed he\u2019d have to quarantine from his professional life.\n\nThe pragmatist won out. In the late 1990s, David was drawn to San Francisco by the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom. He discovered his niche in management consulting, where his unique blend of analytical rigor and literary storytelling made him uncannily effective. He could deconstruct a company\u2019s failing business model and then craft a compelling narrative to sell the solution to the board. His career ascended rapidly, but the relentless pace and a short-lived, high-stress marriage in his early thirties served as a crucible. He realized financial success was hollow without personal autonomy.\n\nThat realization was his key turning point. A decade ago, David leveraged his senior position to negotiate a fully remote role, long before it was commonplace. He now lives and works from his meticulously organized Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a deliberate, controlled lifestyle. Mornings begin not with a rush to a BART station, but with a foggy walk to Golden Gate Park, followed by strong coffee at his desk overlooking the quiet street. His social life is small and curated, consisting of a few long-time friends who prefer dinners with deep conversation over loud bars.\n\nNow at 48, David feels the pull of his other life. The stacks of consulting reports feel insubstantial compared to the novels on his shelves. His aspiration is no longer a bigger title or a larger bonus, but an exit strategy. He dreams of taking an early retirement within the next five years to finally write the novel he\u2019s been outlining in his head for decades\u2014a story far removed from profit margins and synergy, rooted instead in the complex, messy humanity he once studied so passionately."
