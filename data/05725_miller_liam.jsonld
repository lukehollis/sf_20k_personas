Raised in the quiet, predictable suburbs of Sacramento, Liam was the son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist. His upbringing was stable and loving, but it instilled in him a deep yearning for a life less ordinary than the beige landscape of his childhood.\n\nHe attended UC Davis, choosing Communications not out of a specific passion, but because its versatility felt like an open door. The true turning point was a junior year internship at a boutique marketing agency in San Francisco. The three months spent amidst the electric hum of creative strategy, tight deadlines, and diverse, ambitious colleagues was a revelation. It was the antithesis of Sacramento, and he knew he could never go back. Upon graduation, he relentlessly applied for jobs in the city, finally landing the Project Coordinator position he holds now.\n\nAs a Project Coordinator, Liam is the organizational hub, wrangling timelines, assets, and personalities. His day is a blur of Slack notifications, Zoom calls, and color-coded spreadsheets. Working remotely means his apartment is both office and sanctuary, a boundary he struggles to maintain. To combat the isolation, he forces himself into a routine: a morning run through the neighborhood, a mid-day walk to a local coffee shop, and post-work gym sessions.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight-knit group of college friends who also migrated to the Bay Area, supplemented by occasional work happy hours. He feels like an observer of San Francisco more than a participant, enjoying Dolores Park on sunny days and exploring the Mission\u2019s taquerias, yet still feeling the slight detachment of a newcomer.\n\nLiam dreams of moving from coordinating projects to creating them. He aspires to a strategist role, where his ideas, not just his organizational skills, drive a campaign. He hopes to one day build a life here that feels permanent\u2014to find a partner, to have a favorite neighborhood bar where the bartender knows his name, and to finally shed the feeling of being a temporary resident chasing a career."
