They envisioned a path paved with scholastic achievement leading to a lucrative career in engineering or medicine. Rohan, eager to please, initially followed this script, enrolling at San Francisco State to study Public Administration, a compromise he found more fulfilling than coding.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. His mother's sudden, severe illness upended everything. The labyrinth of insurance forms, disability applications, and social services he navigated on her behalf became his real, unsanctioned education. Witnessing his parents' vulnerability and the bureaucratic coldness they faced ignited a new sense of purpose. He left school to work and help support his family, his degree left unfinished but his mission clarified.\n\nThis experience forged his career path. He sought a role on the other side of the desk, becoming an Eligibility Worker for the SF Human Services Agency\u2014the very type of empathetic, knowledgeable person he wished had guided his family. The job brought him into the heart of the city, and he found a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant, resilient energy resonated with him.\n\nHis daily 2.1-mile Muni ride is a ritual, a moment to observe the city he serves before his day begins. At work, he untangles complex cases, connecting residents with vital resources like CalFresh and Medi-Cal. His evenings are his own: cooking simple meals, meeting a close-knit circle of friends for trivia at a local bar, or simply walking past the Mission\u2019s colorful murals. He maintains a close relationship with his parents, now stable and proud of the man he\u2019s become.\n\nRohan doesn't dream of a tech fortune. His aspiration is quieter: to finally finish his degree through online courses and perhaps one day move into a policy-making role within the agency. He hopes to find a long-term partner and continue to afford his life in the city he loves. For Rohan, success isn't defined by a diploma or a high salary, but by the tangible help he provides to his fellow San Franciscans every single day."

Each sterile box felt like a judgment, each line of jargon a deliberate wall meant to keep them out. He felt a hot surge of protective anger and deep helplessness. In that moment, the abstract concepts from his Public Administration classes became painfully real. He wasn\u2019t just a student anymore; he was a navigator, a role he would choose to embrace forever.\n\n2.\nHis first true case was an elderly woman, a Filipina grandmother whose application for CalFresh was a tangled mess. He remembers her quiet, worried eyes across his desk. He spent hours on her file, making calls, untangling the bureaucracy he now knew so well. When he finally called her to say it was approved, her tearful, grateful \u201cSalamat, anak\u201d (\u201cThank you, my son\u201d) echoed in his cubicle. For the first time, he felt the power of his position\u2014not as a gatekeeper, but as someone who could finally open the door.\n\n3.\nIt was a warm evening about a year after he\u2019d moved to the Mission. Walking home from the 24th Street BART, the scent of frying onions from a sidewalk cart mixed with the thump of cumbia from an open window. Kids kicked a soccer ball against a vibrant garage door mural. He realized with a jolt that he wasn\u2019t an observer anymore; the city\u2019s chaotic, resilient pulse felt like his own. He unlocked his apartment door with a profound sense of peace. This feeling was the wealth he was building.\n\n4.\nOn the phone one Sunday, his father, a man of few emotional words, was quiet for a long moment. Rohan braced for the usual gentle prodding about his future. Instead, his dad said, \"A friend's cousin... he lost his job. You know this CalFresh? You helped him. He told me you were kind.\" The pride in his father's voice was unmistakable and overwhelming. It wasn't the validation of a diploma or a high salary, but something far more meaningful. In that moment, he knew they finally understood his choice.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, after a particularly draining day, he didn\u2019t turn on the TV. Instead, he opened his laptop, its glow illuminating his face in the dark apartment. He navigated to the SF State portal, the first time in years, and pulled up the online catalogue for the Public Administration degree completion program. There was no grand decision, just the quiet click on a link to an academic advisor. It was a silent promise to himself: the work for others was his purpose, but this next step was entirely for him."
