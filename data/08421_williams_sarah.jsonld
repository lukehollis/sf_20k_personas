Born and raised in Modesto, she was the first in her family to leave the Central Valley, drawn to San Francisco in the late 90s by a romantic notion of city life and a passion for literature. She enrolled at SF State, losing herself in Woolf and Joyce, imagining a future surrounded by books, perhaps as an editor or a teacher.\n\nThat dream was cut short two years in. A call from her mother\u2014her father had a heart attack and could no longer work his construction job\u2014changed everything. Sarah left school and found the quickest paying work she could get: a call center for a dial-up internet provider. It was supposed to be temporary.\n\nBut \"temporary\" metastasized into a career. The dial-up company was bought by a larger telecom, and Sarah, a quick and empathetic problem-solver, was kept on. She earned certifications online, moving from customer service to Tier 1 technical support. The path wasn't glamorous, but it was stable, and it helped keep her family afloat until her father recovered. By then, returning to her English degree felt like an impossible luxury.\n\nNow, at 42, Sarah lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her small bedroom to the living room desk where she spends eight hours a day remotely resolving strangers\u2019 frustrations with VPNs and password resets. Her colleagues are avatars and usernames in a Slack channel.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and quiet. She avoids the trendy, bustling parts of the city, preferring the fog-drenched streets of her neighborhood. Her evenings are for long walks through Golden Gate Park or along Ocean Beach, the cold, salty air a cleansing ritual after a day spent in the digital ether. She maintains a small, tight circle of friends, mostly from her brief college years, for a weekly trivia night at a local pub.\n\nHer old dream isn't dead, just dormant. On her laptop, buried in a folder, is a half-finished novel she started a decade ago. Sarah\u2019s deepest hope is that one day, she\u2019ll find the energy to close the ticket queue for good and finally write her own ending."
