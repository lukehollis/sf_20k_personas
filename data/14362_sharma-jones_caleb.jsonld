The son of two fathers\u2014a Welsh-American architect (Jones) and an Indian immigrant biochemist (Sharma)\u2014Caleb was raised in a household that celebrated both the humanities and the sciences. He grew up on a steady diet of museum visits, architectural tours, and discussions about cellular biology over dinner, ingraining in him a unique ability to find the beauty in structure and the system in art.\n\nFollowing his passion, Caleb pursued an Art History degree at UC Santa Cruz, dreaming of a life as a museum curator. However, post-graduation, he faced the harsh reality of the art world: a landscape of unpaid internships and fierce competition. A key turning point came when he took a job organizing fundraising galas for a local arts non-profit. He discovered he had a talent not for curating objects, but for curating human experiences\u2014shaping the flow of a space, the mood of an evening, and the engagement of its attendees.\n\nThis revelation pivoted his career. He leveraged his skills into corporate event planning before landing a role managing client relations at a prestigious consulting firm. Today, as the Director of Visitor Experience, he has found the perfect synthesis of his skills. He designs and oversees the entire client journey at his firm\u2019s downtown headquarters, treating it like a meticulously curated exhibition.\n\nCaleb lives in a tastefully decorated apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of grit and gloss he adores. His 2.5-mile commute on the Muni is a cherished routine, a time to read or people-watch. His social life, once centered around a long-term partner, is now being rebuilt after a recent, amicable split. He maintains a close-knit circle of friends, his chosen family, with whom he explores new restaurants and attends performances at the nearby SFJAZZ Center.\n\nThough successful, Caleb aspires to reconnect with his original passion. He dreams of joining the board of a small local museum or using his weekends to mentor young artists. He remains deeply in love with San Francisco, a city that reflects his own story\u2014a place of blended heritage, relentless innovation, and an unwavering belief in a life beautifully designed."

But then his father, the architect, explained how the perforations were a pixelated map of the light filtering through the park's trees. A system. In that moment, the world snapped into focus. Art wasn't just feeling; it was structure. That realization became the blueprint for his entire way of seeing, the lens through which he would view everything from a Rothko to a corporate lobby.\n\n2.\nIt was his first gala, and a lighting rig had just failed, plunging the silent auction into gloom. Panic flickered, but then something else took over. Caleb saw the space not as a disaster, but a puzzle. He marshaled volunteers, arranged clusters of candles, and rerouted the flow of guests toward the bar. He wasn't curating art; he was curating the evening itself. The flush of success, felt in his early twenties, wasn't about the money raised, but the feeling he'd sculpted. His career path finally came into focus.\n\n3.\nThe N-Judah lurched to a stop near Duboce Park, the morning sun slanting through the dusty windows. He looked up from his book: a nurse dozing, a line cook reading a Spanish novel, a coder tapping on a laptop. It was a cross-section of his city, a temporary community rattling downtown together. This daily 2.5-mile journey wasn't just a commute; it was a grounding ritual. It reminded him that for all its changes, San Francisco's heart was still this beautiful, chaotic, shared human experience.\n\n4.\nHe almost didn't go. Buying a single ticket to SFJAZZ felt like a formal declaration of his new solitude, a few months after the split. The empty seat next to him was a palpable ache, a space once filled by his partner of seven years. But when the first notes of a saxophone solo filled the room\u2014improvisational, mournful, yet defiant\u2014he felt a shift. He wasn't just alone; he was a singular part of a collective experience. It was the first night he felt whole, a quiet rebuilding beginning right there.\n\n5.\nHe stood in the glass-walled conference room after a major client visit, the city lights twinkling below. Every detail he\u2019d designed\u2014from the pour-over coffee to the seamless tech\u2014had landed perfectly. The praise was intoxicating, a testament to his unique skill set. Yet, looking at the pristine space, he felt a quiet ache. He had curated the perfect experience, but the art was a financial projection. That recent moment of success crystallized his next ambition: to bring this skill back home, to a place where the art was on canvas."
