Raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a book-loving teacher mother, her childhood was a blend of Pacific Northwest hikes and sensible, science-fair-driven curiosity. While her parents appreciated nature, Sarah developed a fiercer, more urgent connection to it, watching the sprawl of tech giants slowly encroach on the green spaces she loved.\n\nThis drive led her to pursue Environmental Science at the University of Washington, where her idealism was at its peak. A turning point came during a summer internship with a small nonprofit. She spent months compiling research on wetland preservation, only to see their efforts stonewalled by a corporation\u2019s legal team. Frustrated and disillusioned, she realized that to enact change, she had to learn to speak the language of power and policy. This conviction propelled her to Duke University for a Master\u2019s in Environmental Science and Policy, focusing on corporate sustainability.\n\nUpon graduating, she accepted a lucrative offer from a major consulting firm and relocated to San Francisco, a city that mirrored her own complex blend of capitalist ambition and progressive ideals. She settled into a bright, airy apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not with a frantic BART ride, but with a walk to a local coffee roaster before logging into a world of Zoom calls and data analysis. She advises Fortune 500 companies on everything from carbon offsetting to supply chain ethics, navigating the fine line between meaningful change and corporate greenwashing.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends\u2014other driven professionals she meets for weeknight dinners in the Mission or weekend runs through Golden Gate Park. Though her work is demanding, Sarah finds solace in the city\u2019s tangible commitment to her field, from its compost bins to its sweeping views of the bay. Her dream is to eventually leave consulting and lead the sustainability division for a major tech company, proving that profitability and planetary health are not mutually exclusive. For Sarah, success isn\u2019t just a title; it\u2019s seeing her once-idealistic passion translate into measurable, global impact."
