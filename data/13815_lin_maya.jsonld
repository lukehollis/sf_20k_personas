The daughter of a Taiwanese engineer and a librarian, she grew up in Fremont surrounded by the hum of innovation. While her peers were learning to code, Maya was more interested in her mother\u2019s domain: observing how people navigated the library, why they chose certain books, and the quiet frustration on their faces when the catalog system was confusing. This fascination with the human side of systems became her calling.\n\nHer path was deliberate. An undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science at UC San Diego led her to a prestigious Master\u2019s program in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon. She returned to the Bay Area not for a flashy startup, but for a Senior UX Researcher role at a well-established service platform. She wanted to improve tangible, everyday experiences\u2014how people find a good plumber or book a restaurant table\u2014not just chase the next big disruption.\n\nA key turning point came three years into her career when a project she\u2019d poured her soul into was unceremoniously canceled. The failure was initially crushing, but it taught her a vital lesson in resilience and the importance of process over outcome. It solidified her resolve to be an advocate for the user, not just for the feature.\n\nNow 34, Maya has built a life that feels authentic. She shares an apartment in the Inner Richmond with her partner, Alex, a chef whose world of tangible flavors provides a welcome counterbalance to her digital one. Her daily 5.5-mile commute on the Muni to her SoMa office is a cherished ritual of reading and people-watching. Weekends are for dim sum on Clement Street, long runs in Golden Gate Park, and disconnecting with friends over elaborate board games.\n\nMaya feels deeply connected to the fabric of San Francisco\u2014a city of endless, complex human puzzles. While she\u2019s planning her next career move, likely into a management role, her long-term dream is to start a small consultancy focused on ethical design for nonprofits. She wants to use her expertise not just to streamline services, but to build more empathetic and accessible communities, one user interface at a time."

An elderly Cantonese man was trying to use the digital catalog, his brow furrowed in frustration as he repeatedly clicked the wrong button. Her mother tried to help, but the system was just\u2026unintuitive. In that moment, Maya didn't just feel pity; she felt a sharp, analytical curiosity. The problem wasn't the man, it was the design. It was the first time she understood that empathy could be a form of problem-solving, a seed planted for her entire future.\n\n2.\nThe VP called it \"sunsetting.\" Maya, then 29, just stared at the clinical PowerPoint slide erasing three years of her work. The user interviews, the prototypes\u2014gone. Walking to the Muni that evening, the initial sting of failure gave way to a cold, hard clarity. Her work had become about shipping features, not serving people. The cancelation was a painful gift; it forged her professional spine, transforming her from an employee into a fierce, unwavering advocate for the end user, no matter the corporate weather.\n\n3.\nEarly in their relationship, Alex was teaching her how to make risotto. \"You have to watch, feel how the rice absorbs the stock,\" he\u2019d said, stirring patiently. Maya, then 31, had just spent a week arguing about a complex user flow. In his kitchen, surrounded by the smell of parmesan and shallots, she saw the parallel. His craft was tangible, hers digital, but the core was the same: a deep, patient observation of a process. It was the moment she knew his world of tangible flavors would always ground her.\n\n4.\nIt was a foggy Tuesday on the N Judah, sometime around age 32. The windows were steamy, the car packed tight. Near her, a young man in a suit silently offered his seat to an older woman carrying grocery bags. No words were exchanged, just a grateful nod. That tiny, elegant piece of un-programmed human interaction struck her profoundly. This was the city\u2019s real interface, the source code she wanted to understand. Her commute wasn't a chore; it was her most essential field research, reminding her who she worked for.\n\n5.\nLast year, walking off a dim sum brunch on Clement Street, a flyer taped to a lamppost caught her eye. It was for a local immigrant support center, but the information was a chaotic jumble of mismatched fonts and confusing instructions. She felt a familiar frustration, but this time it was different. It sparked not just critique, but a clear, electrifying purpose. That crumpled piece of paper crystalized her long-term dream. She realized her skills could be a true service, an act of community building, not just commerce."
