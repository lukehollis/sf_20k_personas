Growing up in Glendale, California, he was the son of Lebanese immigrants\u2014his father a gifted auto mechanic whose garage was Sami\u2019s first classroom. The name Haddad means \"smith\" in Arabic, a legacy Sami felt not as pressure, but as a calling. He spent his childhood surrounded by the smell of grease and the satisfying click of a ratchet, disassembling and reassembling anything he could get his hands on. This innate curiosity for how things worked led him to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where their \"Learn by Doing\" philosophy honed his raw talent into a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nA key turning point came during his senior project: a complex robotic arm that failed spectacularly during its first demonstration. Instead of despairing, Sami spent a sleepless 48 hours in the lab, meticulously re-machining a faulty joint and rewriting lines of code. The eventual success taught him a lesson that became his professional mantra: failure is just the first step in prototyping.\n\nThis resilience landed him a coveted hardware prototyping role in San Francisco's manufacturing sector. Now 29, Sami is the vital link between digital design and physical reality, translating CAD models into tangible objects using 3D printers, CNC mills, and laser cutters.\n\nHe lives in the Mission District, a vibrant world away from the sterile precision of his lab. His 3.8-mile bike commute is a daily ritual, a tactical navigation of hills and traffic that clears his mind. Evenings are often spent at a climbing gym in the Dogpatch or sharing beers with a tight-knit group of fellow engineers. Though he is close with his family, maintaining connections through weekly video calls, he relishes the independence his $145,000 salary affords him in a notoriously expensive city.\n\nSami loves the contrast of his life: the meticulous engineering by day and the chaotic, artistic energy of his neighborhood by night. His ultimate dream is to one day open his own small-scale design and fabrication shop, creating bespoke furniture or high-end bicycle frames\u2014a modern interpretation of the ancient craft embedded in his name."

His father, smelling of oil and patience, took a greasy transmission gear and placed it in Sami\u2019s palm. \"See?\" his father said in Arabic, \"Our name, Haddad, is in this. We fix, we make.\" In that moment, the weight of the steel felt less like a tool and more like an inheritance. It wasn't a burden, but a map. This moment defined his purpose before he even knew the word for engineering.\n\n2.\n3 AM in the Cal Poly lab, the air thick with the smell of scorched metal and stale coffee. At 22, after 48 sleepless hours, he hit \u2018enter\u2019. The robotic arm, once a symbol of public failure, whirred to life and gracefully picked up the target block. There was no applause, just the quiet hum of machinery. That solitary victory felt more profound than any A+. It taught him that true creation doesn't happen in the spotlight, but in the stubborn, relentless hours spent fixing what is broken.\n\n3.\nHis first Saturday in the Mission, age 23. He walked out of his apartment into a sensory overload: the thumping bass from a car, the sizzle of grilling bacon-wrapped hot dogs, the vibrant Clarion Alley murals clashing against the sky. It was the complete opposite of his sterile, orderly lab. Instead of feeling jarring, it felt whole. He realized his life didn't have to be one thing; the precision and the chaos could coexist. That was the day San Francisco truly became home.\n\n4.\nCresting the final hill on Potrero Avenue at 27, his legs burning and lungs full of cool morning fog. Below him, the city sprawled out, a grid of challenges he\u2019d learned to navigate. The daily 3.8-mile ride wasn\u2019t just a commute; it was a physical problem-solving session. Each gear shift, each swerve around a pothole, was a small, satisfying calculation. It was in these moments of kinetic focus that his mind felt clearest, a clean slate ready for the day\u2019s precise work.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a friend\u2019s Dogpatch apartment, he ran his hand over the wobbly joint of a mass-produced bookshelf. He saw it not as it was, but as a CAD model in his mind\u2014the stress points, the inefficient design. A sudden, intense urge hit him: he could build this better. Stronger, more beautiful. The thought connected everything\u2014his father\u2019s garage, his engineering degree, his own hands. That was the moment his dream for a fabrication shop felt real, a modern way to be a Haddad."
