Raised in a middle-class, culturally Jewish home in the San Fernando Valley, he arrived at SF State in 1990 with plans to major in Public Health. The city, however, had a different curriculum for him.\n\nThe AIDS epidemic was a brutal, all-consuming reality. The theoretical knowledge of his textbooks felt hollow compared to the urgent crisis unfolding in the streets. Compelled by a deep sense of responsibility, David began volunteering for a harm-reduction nonprofit. Delivering meals, offering a listening ear, and navigating the chaotic healthcare system for terrified young men became his life's work. The classroom couldn't compete with the raw, immediate need he saw every day. He left college a few credits shy of a degree, having already found his vocation.\n\nFor three decades, David has remained on the front lines. His work evolved as the city\u2019s crises did, shifting from HIV/AIDS outreach to now serving as a Community Health Worker connecting at-risk youth with mental health and social services. His career is a quiet testament to his endurance. He lost many friends in those early years, including a partner, which left him with a lasting sense of melancholy but also an fierce commitment to his \"found family\" of fellow activists and survivors.\n\nToday, David lives a simple, routine-driven life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 2.1-mile commute on the Muni is a daily ritual of reading and people-watching. His evenings are often spent walking in Golden Gate Park or cooking for the small circle of friends who form his core support system. At 51, he doesn\u2019t dream of wealth or fame; he hopes to see the programs he\u2019s dedicated his life to continue after he\u2019s gone. His quiet aspiration is to one day save enough to travel through Southeast Asia. He mourns the loss of the affordable, bohemian city of his youth but remains fiercely dedicated to protecting its most vulnerable residents, serving as a quiet, vital part of San Francisco's conscience."

The apartment was a stiflingly small studio in the Tenderloin, and the young man in bed\u2014his own age\u2014was skeletal, his eyes vast. David could barely speak. But the man simply smiled, a weak, cracked thing, and thanked him not for the soup, but for looking him in the eye. In that moment, David knew his public health textbook was a fiction. The real work was here, in this room. He never went back to class.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe can still feel the precise pressure of his partner Michael\u2019s thinning hand in his during the winter of \u201895. The weak afternoon light filtered through their Bay window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. Michael\u2019s breathing was a shallow whisper. There were no dramatic last words, only a final, gentle squeeze. The silence that followed was absolute, a void that hollowed David out completely. That silence is what forged his fierce, lifelong loyalty to the friends who remained\u2014his promise to the man he lost.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe community meeting in late 1996 was electric with a word he\u2019d never heard before: \"cocktail.\" As someone explained how the combination of new drugs was working miracles, the room didn't erupt in cheers, but in choked sobs. David felt a dizzying wave of hope followed by an immediate, crushing guilt. He saw a ghostly parade of faces\u2014friends who had died just months, even weeks, earlier. It was a brutal kind of hope, one that taught him that even victory can feel like a profound loss.\n\n***\n\n4.\nJust last year, a 16-year-old girl he\u2019d been working with, who had been silent for weeks, finally looked up from her phone in a Mission coffee shop. \u201cWas it really better back then?\u201d she asked. The question was so simple, so direct. He didn\u2019t give her an easy answer. But in that small moment of curiosity, a bridge was built across decades of city history. It wasn't saving a life, but it was connection. It was everything. It reminded him the work was the exact same.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe recalls a walk with his two oldest friends a few autumns ago, near the Dutch Windmill as the fog swept over Ocean Beach. They weren\u2019t reminiscing or mourning; they were arguing good-naturedly about where to get dinner. A sudden, overwhelming sense of peace washed over him. They had made it. This mundane, chilly, beautiful evening\u2014the three of them, still here, walking toward a warm meal\u2014was the quiet, enduring victory they had all fought for. It was more than enough."
