A third-generation Japanese American, she was raised in San Mateo by parents who valued stability above all else. They had seen their own parents, interned during WWII, rebuild from nothing, and they instilled in Sarah a deep appreciation for security and diligence.\n\nHer heart, however, belonged to the world of art. She pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History at SF State, losing herself in the lines of Renaissance portraits and the bold colors of Impressionism. But upon graduating in the late 90s, the pragmatic voice of her upbringing won out over the precarious life of a museum curator. She took an administrative assistant job at a burgeoning dot-com, intending it to be a temporary stop.\n\nInstead, she discovered a different kind of curation. She had a gift for organizing chaos, for managing complex schedules, and for navigating the brilliant but often difficult personalities of the tech world. The dot-com bubble burst, but Sarah, with her reputation for unshakable reliability, landed safely at a more established company. She rose steadily over two decades, her career ascent mirroring her personal life: a quiet marriage that ended amicably in her late thirties, leaving not scars but a newfound sense of self-reliance.\n\nNow, at 50, Sarah is an Administrative Manager, working from her impeccably organized spare-bedroom office in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute, a permanent fixture since the pandemic, has reshaped her life. Her days begin not with a frantic BART ride, but with a walk to a favorite bakery on Clement Street for coffee and a pastry, followed by a stroll through Golden Gate Park. She is a beloved regular at local shops, a familiar face who knows the owners by name.\n\nHer social life is a curated collection of close friends, including a book club composed mostly of women from her Art History program. These gatherings are her link back to her first love. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer to work in a museum, but to visit them. She\u2019s saving for a month-long trip to Italy and Japan, to finally see the art she has only ever known in books. She aspires to a future of travel, mentorship for younger women in her field, and the deep, quiet contentment she has so carefully built for herself in her chosen corner of San Francisco."
