Born in a quiet Boston suburb to an engineer father and a high school teacher mother, his upbringing was steeped in intellectual curiosity and the promise of the tenure track. He pursued this path with vigor, earning a Ph.D. in 19th-Century European History from Brown University. However, the insular world of academia and its limited prospects left him disillusioned. The turning point came during a visit with a college friend who had entered the burgeoning field of management consulting. David realized his academic skills\u2014distilling complex information, identifying patterns, and building a compelling narrative\u2014were highly valuable in the corporate world.\n\nHe made the leap, joining a boutique firm in San Francisco in the late 1990s, just as the first dot-com bubble was inflating. He was a natural. His ability to apply historical context to market trends gave him a unique edge, and he rose quickly. His career flourished, but it came at a personal cost; his marriage, strained by 80-hour workweeks and constant travel, ended amicably in his late thirties.\n\nNow 50 and a Managing Partner, David\u2019s life is headquartered in a minimalist Pacific Heights condo with a panoramic view of the Golden Gate Bridge. His 0.0-mile commute is a treasured luxury, his day a disciplined sequence of video conferences from a home office lined with history books and modern art. He manages global teams and dissects corporate strategy with the same analytical rigor he once applied to Napoleonic tax codes.\n\nHis social life is curated: dinners with a small circle of friends, many of whom are fellow industry leaders, and occasional weekends in Napa. He appreciates San Francisco for its beauty and dynamism, enjoying early morning runs through the Presidio before the city fully wakes. Though he has achieved immense professional success, a quiet aspiration lingers. He dreams of finally writing the book on the Franco-Prussian War he abandoned decades ago, hoping to synthesize the two halves of his life\u2014the historian and the strategist\u2014and build a legacy more lasting than a quarterly report."
