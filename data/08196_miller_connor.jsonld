Raised in the Sacramento suburbs by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing school administrator mother, his path was expected to be linear: a state college degree in business, a stable job, and a comfortable, predictable life. Connor dutifully enrolled at Chico State but found himself adrift. The classes felt abstract, disconnected from the world he wanted to understand. After three semesters of aimless study, he dropped out, craving a tangible reality his suburban upbringing couldn't offer.\n\nHis turning point was a weekend trip to San Francisco. The city\u2019s chaotic energy and layered history captivated him. He moved a few months later, initially crashing on a friend\u2019s couch in the Outer Sunset and cycling through a series of gig-economy jobs. He wasn\u2019t building a career, but he was learning the city\u2019s pulse, one delivery and one coffee order at a time. The real opportunity came through a temp agency: an assistant position for a large property management company.\n\nNow, Connor lives and works in the same sleek, modern apartment building in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute means his life is contained within these walls. He is the building\u2019s ghost, the one who answers emails about broken disposals at 10 PM, coordinates with plumbers, and gives tours of vacant, sterile units to hopeful tech workers. He knows the tenants not as friends, but as a collection of complaints, lock-outs, and Amazon package notifications. This intimate proximity to others' lives, combined with his professional distance, has made him a keen, almost invisible, observer of the city\u2019s transient population.\n\nThough his social circle is small, he cherishes late-night walks through his neighborhood after his duties are done, watching the city\u2019s nightlife from the outside. Connor is saving his money, not yet sure of the goal. He dreams of finishing his degree, but this time in urban studies or photography\u2014something that would allow him to document the city he manages. He aspires to one day have a life in San Francisco that is truly his own, not just one he facilitates for others from a management office in the lobby."
