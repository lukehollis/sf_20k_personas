Born in a refugee camp after her parents fled Vietnam in the late 1970s, she arrived in the city as a toddler. Her family settled in a cramped Tenderloin apartment, where her parents worked multiple low-wage jobs. Linda\u2019s childhood was a blur of translating official documents, helping at her parents' small grocery stand on weekends, and navigating the complexities of a new world for them. This early responsibility instilled a profound sense of duty and empathy, steering her toward San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Social Work, determined to build bridges for families like her own.\n\nHer career began where her life did: as a caseworker in the Tenderloin. For over two decades, she has remained with the same non-profit, her dedication earning her a steady ascent to Program Manager. She now oversees initiatives that provide educational and healthcare access to new immigrant families, a role she sees as the ultimate fulfillment of a promise made to her younger self. A major turning point was the 2008 recession, when she fought tirelessly to secure grants that kept their after-school programs from shutting down, solidifying her reputation as a fierce advocate.\n\nNow 50 and single after an amicable divorce in her late thirties, Linda lives a life of disciplined purpose. Her rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond is her sanctuary, filled with books and photos of her aging parents, whom she visits every Sunday. Her daily routine is anchored by her 2.5-mile commute on the 38-Geary Muni bus, a moving cross-section of the city she serves. Socially, she keeps a close circle of friends\u2014fellow non-profit veterans and a book club that has met for fifteen years.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is etched in her bones, from the fog rolling over Arguello Boulevard to the familiar call of the produce vendors in Clement Street. Linda\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of legacy. She hopes to mentor a successor who shares her passion and, perhaps, finally take a trip to Vietnam, not just as a tourist, but to understand the ghosts and memories her parents left behind."
