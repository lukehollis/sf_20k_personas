He spent his youth stocking shelves in his immigrant parents' small grocery store, a world of Cantonese chatter, the scent of dried mushrooms, and the constant hum of the register. While his parents preached the virtues of financial security, Raymond\u2019s path was forged by a different, more personal experience. The pivotal moment of his youth was watching his grandmother, a monolingual Cantonese speaker, struggle to navigate the labyrinthine public health system. He saw her frustration and fear, lost in a sea of paperwork and appointments she couldn't understand. That helplessness, he decided, was a problem he could solve.\n\nThis resolve fueled his educational journey. He stayed local, earning a BA from UC Berkeley before pursuing a Master of Public Administration at SF State. He saw the city government not as a faceless bureaucracy, but as a machine he could learn to operate from the inside. He started as a junior analyst, diligently working his way up through the Department of Public Health. Now a Program Manager, he oversees community health initiatives, focusing on outreach to non-English speaking and elderly populations\u2014the very work inspired by his grandmother\u2019s ordeal.\n\nToday, Raymond lives in a sunny Hayes Valley apartment with his partner of five years, a landscape designer named Alex. His 2.1-mile commute on the MUNI 21 bus is a daily ritual, a time to read policy briefs or simply watch the diverse fabric of the city he serves pass by his window. Evenings are for unwinding with Alex, discussing city politics over a home-cooked meal. Weekends often involve jogs through Alamo Square or visits to the farmers' market.\n\nRaymond\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul. He sees its flaws\u2014the inequality, the bureaucracy\u2014but he also feels its heartbeat. His dream isn't to leave or to get rich; it's to make the city work better for everyone, especially for the next family like his own. He aspires to one day lead his department, ensuring that no one is left behind simply because they don't speak the right language or know the right person. For Raymond, public service isn't just a career; it's a promise to his younger self and a tribute to his grandmother."

It was a utility bill, dense with English he was just mastering himself. He slowly translated the intimidating text into Cantonese, watching her shoulders relax as understanding dawned. It wasn\u2019t about the words; it was about the relief on her face. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t just a grocer\u2019s son helping a customer; he was a vital, necessary bridge. That small act of service planted a seed of purpose.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe remembers the stiff plastic chair in the SF General waiting room, age sixteen. His grandmother, usually so formidable, seemed to shrink beside him, clutching a sheaf of English forms like a shield. She kept looking from the papers to the indifferent receptionist, her face a mask of confusion and quiet fear. Raymond felt a hot, useless anger rise in his throat. He saw not just bureaucracy, but a system that made his Po Po feel powerless and alone. That specific helplessness hardened into his life\u2019s resolve.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis first year as an analyst, he\u2019d spent weeks designing a trilingual pamphlet for a city flu shot clinic. On a whim, he took the 38 Geary to the clinic site. He saw an elderly man, a Vietnamese speaker, pointing to a line in the pamphlet and nodding confidently to the nurse. Raymond stood by the door, unseen, feeling a profound, quiet victory. It wasn't a grand policy change; it was just a pamphlet. But it was real. It was working. He knew he was in the right place.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOn one of their first dates, walking through Alamo Square, Raymond vented about a funding proposal for translation services getting stalled. He expected his date, Alex, to just nod politely. Instead, Alex stopped and said, \u201cIt\u2019s like bad design. A park with no benches is telling people they\u2019re not welcome to stay.\u201d The simple analogy clicked perfectly. In that moment, Raymond felt deeply seen. He knew Alex didn\u2019t just like him, but that he understood the very core of his work. His mission didn\u2019t have to be a solitary one.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast autumn, at a health fair his department organized in the Outer Richmond, he watched a scene unfold. A young woman was patiently explaining a screening form to her grandfather in Cantonese, using the exact dual-language materials his team had developed. He saw himself and his grandmother in them, but this time, the fear was gone, replaced by confident understanding. A lump formed in his throat. It was a promise to his younger self fulfilled, a tangible piece of the better city he was helping to build."
