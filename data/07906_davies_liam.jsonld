            "value": "Born in Busan, South Korea, Liam Davies has no memory of his birth country. He was adopted at ten months old by a loving, eco-conscious couple in Portland, Oregon. His childhood was a blend of Pacific Northwest idealism\u2014weekend hikes, meticulous recycling, and a well-tended compost bin\u2014and the subtle, persistent feeling of being an outsider. While his parents gave him a foundation of love and environmental stewardship, growing up as one of the few Asian kids in his predominantly white neighborhood instilled in him a quiet longing for a place where he could simply blend in.\n\nThis search for belonging, coupled with his ingrained passion for the environment, guided his educational journey. After completing his undergraduate degree in Urban Studies at the University of Washington, he moved to the Bay Area for a Master's in Environmental Policy at UC Berkeley. It was a pivotal decision. For the first time, he was surrounded by a diverse community that reflected his own identity, and he found his academic calling in green urban development.\n\nNow 31, Liam works as a sustainability consultant from his sunny Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a ten-foot walk from his kitchen to his home office. He advises Bay Area tech and real estate giants on reducing their carbon footprints, a job that straddles the line between genuine impact and corporate greenwashing\u2014a moral ambiguity he grapples with daily.\n\nHis life is a structured routine. Mornings start with pour-over coffee and a view of the bustling street below, followed by a day of Zoom calls and data analysis. To combat the isolation of remote work, he is fiercely committed to his evening running club, which meets twice a week to trace paths through the verdant artery of Golden Gate Park. These runs, and the casual beers afterward, form the bedrock of his social life.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but specific; it\u2019s a city of career opportunities and chosen community rather than inherited ties. He dreams of leaving consulting to launch a B Corp focused on sustainable housing, creating tangible change in the city he now calls home. He also hopes to one day visit Korea, not to find his past, but to better understand a missing piece of his present. For now, he remains a man building his own legacy, one green initiative and one purposeful stride at a time."
