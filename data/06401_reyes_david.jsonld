            "value": "David Reyes is a product of San Francisco\u2019s two souls: the hardworking, immigrant grit and the polished, creative ambition. The son of immigrants from Michoac\u00e1n, David grew up to the scent of pan dulce and burnt sugar from his parents' bustling bakery in the Mission District. He spent his youth stacking pastry boxes and sweeping flour, internalizing his parents\u2019 belief that success was tangible\u2014something you could hold, taste, and sell. While he respected their craft, his own passions were drawn to the form and history of objects, leading him to pursue an Art History degree at SF State.\n\nHis turning point came with the 2008 recession. Armed with a degree that felt abstract and useless in a collapsing economy, David took a menial job helping a friend, a struggling ceramicist, manage her chaotic Etsy shop. There, he discovered his true calling: he had his father's head for logistics and his mother's eye for quality control, combined with a deep understanding of artistic value. He was a natural bridge between the creator and the consumer. This realization set him on a new path, and he methodically built a career managing production for artisan workshops.\n\nNow 43, David lives in a Dogpatch live/work loft, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his minimalist apartment upstairs to the workshop downstairs\u2014a space filled with the scent of curing leather and wood stain. As a Product Manager, he doesn't make the art, but he makes it possible. He translates an artist\u2019s vision into a viable product line, managing supply chains, pricing, and market strategy.\n\nThough focused on his career after a long-term relationship ended a few years prior, his life is far from solitary. His social circle is a tight-knit group of chefs, designers, and brewers he meets at neighborhood haunts. David is a quiet anchor in his community, a man who found a way to honor his parents' practical legacy within the city\u2019s demanding creative economy. His dream is to one day launch a small fund to provide seed capital for local artisans, ensuring that in a city obsessed with the digital, the beautiful, tangible things still have a place to thrive."
