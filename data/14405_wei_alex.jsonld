Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond, he\u2019s the son of immigrants from Hong Kong. His father, a quiet, methodical auto mechanic, filled their garage with the scent of grease and the sound of socket wrenches. While his peers were fixated on coding bootcamps, Alex found his calling amidst the gears and lathes of his high school\u2019s underfunded shop class. He discovered a deep satisfaction in shaping raw metal into something precise and useful.\n\nThis passion was a quiet rebellion against the city\u2019s prevailing tech-centric ethos. Instead of pursuing a four-year degree, Alex enrolled in City College of San Francisco\u2019s Machine Tool Technology program. It was a practical choice, one that solidified his identity. His turning point came not with a dramatic event, but the first time he successfully programmed a CNC machine to execute a complex design. In the precise, automated dance of the cutting tool, he found a creative and technical fulfillment that felt more real than any line of code.\n\nNow 30, Alex lives a life of calculated routine in the Dogpatch. His 2.8-mile commute is a daily highlight\u2014a swift, thrilling ride on his trusty Kawasaki through the industrial neighborhood\u2019s quiet morning streets. He works at a small, high-end manufacturing firm that produces custom components for local biotech and aerospace companies. His days are spent under the hum of servo motors and the sharp smell of cutting fluid, his focus absolute as he transforms digital blueprints into tangible, critical parts.\n\nHis social life is centered around a small circle of old friends and a few coworkers. They\u2019ll grab beers at a local brewery or work on their motorcycles together. Alex\u2019s income of $85,000 affords him a comfortable, if not lavish, existence in his small apartment. His dream isn\u2019t to c-suite or a startup exit; it\u2019s to save enough to one day open his own small fabrication shop, taking on specialized, artistic projects. Alex Wei is an artisan of the modern age, a testament to the fact that in San Francisco, not everything is built in the cloud. Some of it is still forged from steel."

It wasn't about strength, but precision. The solid, definitive *click* when the correct torque was reached was a revelation. It wasn\u2019t just tightening a bolt; it was a promise kept to the machine. That sound became the bedrock of his understanding of craftsmanship and quiet diligence.\n\n2.\nIn his high school shop class, surrounded by neglected machinery, he milled a small puzzle box from a block of steel. While his friends were at a coding club, he felt the satisfying heft of his creation, its knurled lid fitting perfectly. Holding the cool, precise object in his palm was a quiet act of defiance. It was real, tangible proof that his intelligence wasn't measured in lines of code, but in thousandths of an inch.\n\n3.\nAt City College, he stood watching as the CNC machine whirred to life, executing his first complex program. He was mesmerized as the cutting head traced paths he\u2019d designed, shaving away aluminum to reveal the exact form he\u2019d imagined. It felt like conducting an orchestra of steel. In that moment, the digital and the physical fused, validating his entire path in a shower of glittering swarf and the sharp scent of cutting fluid.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the first morning he rode his newly tuned Kawasaki to work. The engine\u2019s thrum was a perfect counterpoint to the quiet Dogpatch streets. Leaning into the turns past silent warehouses, the cool pre-dawn air rushing past, he felt a profound sense of ownership over his small slice of the city. This 2.8-mile stretch wasn't a commute; it was a daily, visceral declaration of freedom. It became his morning meditation in motion.\n\n5.\nOne evening last year, after a long day machining biotech components to exacting tolerances, he found himself sketching a flowing, abstract sculpture in his notebook. He wasn't thinking of function or client specs, just the beauty of the form. The desire wasn\u2019t just to build parts for others, but to create something solely for its own sake. That late-night sketch transformed his vague dream of having his own shop into an urgent, tangible goal."
