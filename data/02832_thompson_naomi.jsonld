Born in San Jose to a Japanese-American engineer and a traditional homemaker, Naomi grew up caught between her father\u2019s pragmatism and her own burgeoning love for the abstract. While her father hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career, her mother quietly nurtured her aesthetic sense through ikebana and calligraphy. San Francisco, a glittering mirage to the north, became her symbol of artistic and personal freedom.\n\nShe pursued this freedom at UC Berkeley, majoring in Art History, and later cemented it by moving across the country for her graduate studies at NYU. It was in New York\u2019s vibrant, chaotic art scene that she met David Thompson, a brilliant, charismatic painter whose vision perfectly complemented her own. They fell in love over discussions of Rauschenberg and plans for a new kind of gallery\u2014one that championed challenging, local art over commercial safety.\n\nThey brought their dream back to the West Coast, pouring their savings and souls into a small ground-floor space in a still-gritty, post-freeway Hayes Valley. \"Galerie Thompson\" was born. For five years, it was their shared world. Then, a sudden illness took David, leaving Naomi widowed at 34. The gallery, once a joint venture, became her mission\u2014a living memorial to his passion.\n\nToday, at 53, Naomi lives in the spacious apartment above the gallery. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days are a practiced rhythm: mornings spent with strong coffee and artist correspondence, afternoons arranging installations, and evenings hosting openings that spill onto the Hayes Street sidewalk. She is a revered figure in the neighborhood, a matriarch of the city's art community. Her connection to San Francisco is etched into the gallery walls and the memory of her life with David. Her enduring hope is to keep the gallery a vital force, a testament to their original vision, and to launch one more truly groundbreaking artist before she ever considers stepping away."
