Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, she was the quiet, observant daughter of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small grocery on Balboa Street. Her parents valued security and tangible success, envisioning a future for Mei Lin in engineering or finance. To appease them, she initially enrolled in business at UC Davis, but felt a profound sense of displacement, as if she were learning a language she could never truly speak.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year when her mother was diagnosed with a rapid, aggressive form of dementia. As her mother\u2019s verbal communication faded, Mei Lin, desperate to connect, brought out old watercolors from her childhood. In the silent, shared space of painting simple landscapes and flowers, she found her mother again. The colors became their new language. This raw, powerful experience reshaped her entire world. She abandoned her business degree, finished with a BA in Psychology, and pursued a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, relentlessly seeking out programs that would allow her to integrate art into clinical practice.\n\nNow 47, Mei Lin runs a private practice from her cozy Inner Sunset flat, where the front parlor has been converted into a sunlit studio and therapy space. Her 0.0-mile commute is a blessing, allowing her to ground herself each morning with a walk through the nearby Golden Gate Park before her first client arrives. She specializes in helping adults navigate grief, trauma, and chronic illness, using collage, painting, and sculpture as tools for externalizing pain that words cannot capture.\n\nWhile she has a close circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists and fellow therapists\u2014Mei Lin remains single, finding deep fulfillment in her work and her own personal art practice. Her relationship with her aging father, now widowed, has softened into a quiet, mutual respect. He doesn't fully understand her work, but he saw how it gave his wife peace. Mei Lin\u2019s dream is to one day secure funding for a community-based art therapy program for dementia caregivers, honoring the a-ha moment that defined her life. She remains, at her core, a woman dedicated to finding the color and form of feelings too deep for words."
