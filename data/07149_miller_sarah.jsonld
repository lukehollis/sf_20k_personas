The daughter of a Korean immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father, she grew up in the fog-dusted suburbs of Daly City. Her childhood home was a place of deep love but also quiet, unexamined tensions. Her mother\u2019s unspoken trauma from a difficult past and her father\u2019s well-meaning inability to understand it created a silence that Sarah learned to navigate from a young age. This environment, layered with the complexities of being bicultural, planted the seed for her future career. She saw firsthand how a lack of communication and unprocessed pain could shape a family.\n\nHer academic journey at UC Berkeley started in sociology but quickly pivoted. A pivotal moment came during a visit home when she witnessed a painful, wordless argument between her parents. She realized her true calling wasn't just to observe societal patterns, but to intervene and heal them on a micro level. She pursued a Master of Social Work (MSW) at San Francisco State University, focusing on family systems and trauma-informed care. After graduation, she completed the rigorous clinical hours required to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).\n\nNow 27, Sarah lives in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of her profession; she runs a telehealth practice from a carefully arranged corner of her living room, providing therapy to clients across California. Her days are structured and emotionally demanding. Mornings begin with a walk in Golden Gate Park, a ritual to ground herself before a day of holding space for others' pain. Evenings are for disconnection\u2014perfecting her mother\u2019s kimchi-jjigae recipe, reading non-clinical fiction, and meeting her small, tight-knit group of friends for dinner on Clement Street.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she chose this city for its diversity and acceptance, finding a sense of belonging she never quite felt in the suburbs. Her ultimate dream is to open a small, community-focused private practice in her neighborhood, specifically serving bicultural individuals and AAPI families. It\u2019s more than a career goal; for Sarah, it\u2019s a way to offer others the tools and understanding she once wished for her own family, turning the silences of her past into a source of healing for the future."
