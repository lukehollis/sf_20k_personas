Born to a Parsi family that valued both tradition and pragmatism, Sarah grew up understanding the intricate dance of global trade from her father, who worked in textile exports. Seeking a different path, she immigrated to the Bay Area at 22, armed with fierce ambition but limited resources.\n\nHer educational journey was practical. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration while working nights as a data entry clerk for a freight forwarding company near the port. This was her entry into the world of logistics, a field that appealed to her innate sense of order. She didn't have a prestigious degree, but she had an unmatched work ethic and a knack for untangling complex supply chain knots. Over three decades, she diligently climbed the ladder from clerk to coordinator to her current role as a Logistics Manager.\n\nA key turning point was meeting her husband, Alex, a gentle landscape architect, in the late \u201890s. He grounded her relentless drive, and together they built a life and raised their son, Rohan, who is now studying engineering at Cal Poly. The pandemic marked another profound shift; her company went fully remote, and Sarah\u2019s commute evaporated. She traded office politics for the peace of her home office.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a cozy, book-filled Edwardian in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not with traffic, but with a brisk walk around Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park, a ritual she cherishes. Her work is a flurry of emails and video calls, managing shipments moving across continents from her sunlit spare bedroom. San Francisco is no longer a city of hustle for her; it's her sanctuary. Her aspirations have shifted from career advancement to personal fulfillment: traveling with Alex, visiting Rohan more often, and finally mastering the art of sourdough baking. She dreams of one day taking a trip back to Mumbai, not as the girl who left, but as the woman who built a life she could be proud of, one perfectly managed shipment at a time."
