His commute is a 90-second walk from his minimalist condo to the immaculate glass-and-steel temple to consumer technology where he serves as the Retail Operations Manager. At 45, he has perfected a life of convenient, curated efficiency.\n\nRaised in the quiet suburbs of Portland, Oregon, Alistair was the son of a practical accountant and a no-nonsense high school teacher. His decision to major in Art History was a quiet act of rebellion, a pursuit of beauty over the expected utility. After graduating, he felt adrift, his degree seemingly useless in a pragmatic world. He spent his early twenties managing a high-end bookstore, where he discovered an unexpected talent for logistics, inventory control, and, most importantly, curating an inviting public space.\n\nThe key turning point came at 29. A long-term relationship in Portland had withered, and a friend, working for a rising tech giant, told him they were looking for managers for their new \"experiential\" stores in San Francisco. They didn't want sales sharks; they wanted people who understood aesthetics and customer experience. It was a perfect, if unorthodox, fit. Alistair packed his life into two suitcases and moved south.\n\nIn San Francisco, Alistair thrived. He shed his small-town skin and embraced the city's ambition. He rose steadily in his company, his calm demeanor and keen eye for detail making him an invaluable manager. His personal life is composed of a tight circle of friends cultivated over 15 years\u2014a chef, a graphic designer, a lawyer\u2014who have become his chosen family. He dates intermittently but finds deep companionship elusive amidst the city's transient energy.\n\nNow, a quiet dream grows within him. He feels the pull of his original passion. While he appreciates the precision of his tech career, he fantasizes about a second act: opening a small, expertly curated gallery or a specialty bookstore, perhaps in a quieter neighborhood like the Inner Richmond or even further north in Sonoma. It would be a return to his roots, trading corporate perfection for something smaller, more tangible, and wholly his own."
