The daughter of hardworking Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat in the Richmond District, Grace grew up translating utility bills and navigating cultural divides. Her parents, practical and shaped by scarcity, hoped she\u2019d become a doctor or engineer. But volunteering at a community center in high school opened Grace\u2019s eyes to the city\u2019s unseen struggles\u2014families battling eviction, children grappling with trauma. It was there she found her calling, not in treating physical ailments, but in mending the fractures of the human spirit.\n\nThis path created a quiet rift with her parents, who struggled to understand her choice to pursue a Master of Social Work at SF State instead of a more lucrative career. Her early professional years were a trial by fire, working with vulnerable families in the city\u2019s public school system. The emotional weight of her cases contributed to the end of her marriage in her early thirties; her ex-husband, a software engineer, could never fully grasp the world she inhabited daily. The divorce was a painful turning point, but it solidified her commitment to a life of service, free from others' expectations.\n\nNow 46, Grace is a respected Licensed Clinical Social Worker, a steady presence for students navigating crises. Her life has a comfortable rhythm. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in NoPa, filled with books and thriving houseplants. Her 2.5-mile commute on the N Judah is her quiet time, a space to read before a demanding day. Evenings are for decompressing with long walks through the Panhandle, meeting her small, tight-knit circle of friends for pho, or volunteering at a youth arts collective.\n\nGrace feels the city changing around her, the chasm between the wealthy and the struggling ever-widening. Her dream isn\u2019t to escape it, but to dig in deeper. She aspires to start a small non-profit providing accessible art therapy for at-risk youth. For Grace Lee, San Francisco is not a backdrop for ambition, but her lifelong community\u2014a place she is determined to hold together, one person at a time."

As she translated the dense text, she wasn\u2019t just a daughter; she was a navigator, a lifeline. The moment planted a seed of purpose: to stand in the gap for people overwhelmed by systems they couldn\u2019t understand. It was the first time she felt the weight and honor of being a bridge.\n\n2.\nAt 16, volunteering at the community center, she saw a boy named Miguel who never spoke. While others saw a quiet child, Grace saw his drawings: a house with bars on the windows, a stick figure weeping behind a fence. His silent trauma was a language she instantly understood. In that moment, her parents' dream of her becoming a doctor dissolved. She realized then she wasn\u2019t meant to mend bones, but the fractures of the human spirit. It was the quiet, irreversible beginning of her true calling.\n\n3.\nShe was 32, just home after helping a family pack their life into trash bags following an eviction. Her then-husband was celebrating a successful product launch. When she tried to explain the hollow look in the mother\u2019s eyes, he said, \u201cYou have to learn to leave it at the office.\u201d The words created a chasm between them she knew could never be crossed. The loneliness was acute, but it was also clarifying. Her life\u2019s work wasn\u2019t a job; it was who she was.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the silence at the kitchen table when, at 22, she announced her acceptance to the MSW program at SF State. It was heavier than any argument. Her father just stared into his tea, her mother smoothed the vinyl tablecloth. Their disappointment wasn't spoken, but it filled the small room\u2014a fear for her future, a grief for the secure life she was rejecting. In that quiet, painful moment, Grace chose her own path, learning that true conviction sometimes means disappointing the people you love.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a student known for his silent rage walked into her office. For months, they\u2019d simply sat, sometimes with a sketchpad between them. He silently placed a small, misshapen clay bird on her desk. \u201cFor you,\u201d he mumbled, not making eye contact. In that fragile offering, Grace felt an entire world of healing unlock. It was more than a breakthrough; it was the blueprint for her future non-profit, a tangible reason to keep digging her roots deeper into the city."
