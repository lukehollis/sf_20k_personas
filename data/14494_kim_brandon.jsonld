Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, he is the only son of Korean immigrants who run a small, perpetually busy dry-cleaning business. Growing up, he watched his parents work with a quiet, tireless dedication, instilling in him a profound sense of responsibility. The turning point came when he was sixteen. His grandmother collapsed from a stroke at a family dinner, and Brandon felt a paralyzing helplessness until the paramedics arrived, moving with a calm and competence that seemed almost magical. In that moment, his future clicked into place.\n\nHe initially enrolled at San Francisco State University, vaguely aiming for a pre-med track to satisfy his parents' ambitions. However, he found the academic world too abstract and slow. He craved immediate, tangible impact. During his sophomore year, he simultaneously took an EMT certification course and discovered his true passion. He swapped abstract biology for the frantic, hands-on reality of emergency medicine. He never finished his four-year degree, a point of quiet disappointment for his parents, but they couldn't deny the pride they felt seeing him in his uniform.\n\nNow, Brandon works for a university's campus emergency response team. His 5.8-mile commute on the N-Judah line takes him from his shared two-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset to a world of student crises\u2014everything from panic attacks during finals to serious injuries on the sports field. His $62,000 income requires careful budgeting in a city known for its expense, but his life is rich in other ways. His closest friends are fellow EMTs who understand the gallows humor and deep empathy required for the job.\n\nHis off-hours are spent decompressing with long runs through Golden Gate Park, grabbing cheap, delicious pho on Irving Street, and helping at his parents' shop on weekends. Brandon\u2019s San Francisco isn't the city of tech IPOs, but of foggy mornings, diverse neighborhoods, and the constant, thrumming pulse of human need. His dream isn't fame or wealth; it's to become a fully certified Paramedic, to deepen his skills so he can be even more capable the next time the call for help comes."

His grandmother was on the floor, her face slack, her breath a terrible rasp. Brandon froze, a cold, useless knot of panic in his chest. When the paramedics arrived, they moved with a purpose that cut through the fear. They were a shield of calm competence. In the silence after they left, he knew. He wouldn\u2019t be the one watching helplessly ever again. He would be the one who knew what to do.\n\n2.\nThe smell of steam and chemical solvent hung in the air at his parents' shop. It was the backdrop against which he told them he was leaving SF State for his EMT certification. He remembers his father\u2019s shoulders stiffening over the press, not turning to look at him. His mother paused, her hands still over a folded shirt. There was no yelling, just a thick, heavy silence filled with their disappointment. It was the first time he truly chose his own path, a decision that felt both impossibly heavy and liberatingly right.\n\n3.\nIt was his third month on the campus team. A call came in for an unconscious student on the main quad. He arrived to find a boy, not much younger than him, face down on the grass. The training kicked in, a frantic, rhythmic dance of chest compressions and commands. The world narrowed to that small space. For two terrifying minutes, there was nothing. Then, under his hands, a flutter. A cough. A gasp of air. It wasn\u2019t a dummy in a classroom; it was a life. Brandon felt a relief so profound it almost buckled his knees.\n\n4.\nSome mornings, the N-Judah feels like his own private viewing room for the city. He\u2019ll get a seat by the window as it rumbles through the Inner Sunset, the fog so thick it swallows the top of Sutro Tower. He watches the city wake up\u2014the baker dusting flour on her apron, the elderly woman walking her dog, the students with their headphones on. It\u2019s a quiet, 25-minute ritual of observation, the steady inhale before the chaotic exhale of his shift. This, he thinks, is the real San Francisco.\n\n5.\nThe call was to the library during finals week. No sirens, just a quiet urgency. He found a freshman girl huddled between bookshelves, hyperventilating, convinced she was dying. There was no bleeding, no wound to treat. He simply sat on the floor with her, speaking in a low voice, guiding her breathing until her frantic sobs subsided into shudders. Handing her a water bottle, he realized his job wasn't just about restarting hearts, but sometimes, about convincing a person their own heart was still worth listening to."
