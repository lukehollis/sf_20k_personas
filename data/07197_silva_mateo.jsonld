The son of immigrants from Oaxaca, his childhood was steeped in the rich, complex aromas of mole negro, toasted chiles, and fresh masa. While his parents, a landscaper and a motel housekeeper, encouraged a stable career, Mateo found the rigid structure of community college suffocating. He\u2019d doodle menu ideas in the margins of his textbooks, his heart and mind always drifting back to the alchemy of the kitchen.\n\nThe turning point came at 20. He dropped out, packed a single duffel bag, and moved to San Francisco, determined to turn his obsession into a profession. He started at the bottom: washing dishes in a tourist-trap restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf, then graduating to a line cook position in a trendy Hayes Valley bistro. He learned classic techniques by day but spent his nights experimenting with the Oaxacan flavors of his heritage, deconstructing his mother\u2019s recipes and reimagining them with a modern, artistic flair.\n\nHis break came through a side gig catering a small pop-up art show. His inventive bites\u2014smoked paprika octopus on a blue corn sope, a hibiscus-infused aguachile\u2014impressed the founder of a new artist collective. She offered him a unique position: Head Chef and artist-in-residence at their live/work space in the Mission District.\n\nNow, Mateo\u2019s commute is a walk down a flight of stairs from his spartan loft to the building's large, industrial kitchen. His daily routine is a creative dialogue; he wanders through the studios, drawing inspiration from a painter's palette or a sculptor's forms to design the communal meals. The artists are his found family, his toughest critics, and his greatest inspiration. Though he feels deeply connected to his work, Mateo dreams of one day opening his own small, tasting-menu restaurant\u2014an intimate space where he can elevate Oaxacan cuisine to high art, telling the story of his family's journey on every plate."
