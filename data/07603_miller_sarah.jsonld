Raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a teacher and an accountant, she was instilled with a sense of pragmatism and a love for order. This clashed with her youthful idealism, which led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature at Ohio State University, dreaming of a life surrounded by books in a bustling publishing house.\n\nUpon graduating in the late 90s, the reality of the job market hit hard. After a disillusioning, unpaid internship in New York, she took a temporary administrative assistant position at a hospital to make ends meet. It was there she had a crucial realization: while she loved literature, she *excelled* at logistics. She discovered a deep satisfaction in creating order from chaos, managing complex schedules, and streamlining inefficient processes. This accidental career path became her calling.\n\nThe key turning point came in her late twenties when she followed a serious boyfriend to San Francisco for his tech job. The relationship eventually dissolved under the city\u2019s intense pressures, but Sarah had already fallen in love with the fog-laced hills and cultural vibrancy. She stayed, securing a role at a major medical center and steadily working her way up.\n\nNow 48, Sarah is the Administrative Manager for a large outpatient clinic, a role she performs entirely from her meticulously organized, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a life of structured solitude. Mornings begin with a walk with her aging beagle, Clementine, in Golden Gate Park, followed by hours of managing budgets, staff schedules, and telehealth systems via her laptop. Her social life is small but meaningful, revolving around a weekly book club and a close friend from a former yoga class.\n\nThough content, the English major in her still yearns for something more. Her dream is to save enough to take a six-month sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain\u2014a grand, romantic adventure she plans with the same precise detail she applies to her work. For Sarah, San Francisco is no longer a place of romantic folly, but a quiet harbor from which she plans her next chapter."
