He was born and raised in the Outer Sunset, the second son of Taiwanese immigrants who poured their life savings into a small grocery store on Taraval Street. His childhood was a symphony of rumbling streetcars, the scent of dried shrimp and cardboard boxes, and the constant, unspoken pressure to validate his parents' sacrifice. They envisioned a doctor or an engineer; David, quiet and observant, was drawn to stories.\n\nHis first act of gentle rebellion was enrolling at San Francisco State University and declaring a major in English Literature. While his parents fretted, David found solace in dissecting narratives, a skill that would prove unexpectedly valuable. He graduated just as the first dot-com bubble was inflating. Needing a practical job, he leveraged his writing skills to land a technical writing position at a fledgling startup. He discovered a surprising aptitude not for coding, but for translating the chaotic ambitions of engineers into organized plans. The dot-com bust was a key turning point; laid off and humbled, he realized he thrived on structure and communication. He methodically worked his way through QA testing and eventually into project management, a career that perfectly synthesized his literary mind with the tech world's relentless drive.\n\nNow, David lives in a tastefully renovated Edwardian flat in Cole Valley with his partner of twelve years, Sarah, a graphic designer. His 0.0-mile commute consists of a short walk from the kitchen to his home office. His days are a disciplined cycle of virtual stand-ups, Gantt charts, and stakeholder calls. He finds calm in the routine: a morning coffee from the cafe on Cole Street, a lunchtime walk through the Panhandle, and quiet evenings cooking with Sarah. He dutifully visits his retired parents in the Sunset every Sunday, the old tensions having softened into a comfortable, loving silence.\n\nThough successful, a part of David still resides in that English Lit classroom. His secret ambition is to finally write, not technical specs, but a collection of short stories about the San Francisco he remembers\u2014the fading storefronts, the immigrant families, and the ghosts of the city being overwritten by code. He dreams of capturing the narrative of his own life before it, too, becomes just a well-managed project."
