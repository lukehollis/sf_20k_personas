His father, a civil engineer, and his mother, a university librarian, instilled in him a singular focus: excel, so you never have to struggle as we did. Rohan internalized this, trading a typical suburban childhood for debate club trophies and advanced placement courses. The pressure was immense, but it forged a discipline that became his greatest asset.\n\nHis academic path was a direct line from UC Berkeley, where he studied economics, to Columbia Law, where he specialized in corporate finance. New York City expanded his worldview, but the Bay Area\u2019s gravitational pull\u2014the epicenter of tech and venture capital\u2014was too strong to ignore. He was recruited by a prestigious San Francisco firm before he even passed the bar, dazzling partners with his sharp intellect and relentless work ethic. He didn't just climb the corporate ladder; he sprinted up it, billing staggering hours and mastering the intricate dance of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nToday, Rohan is one of the youngest partners at his firm. The 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his all-consuming career; he lives in a sleek SoMa condominium tower just floors above his office. His daily routine is a monastic cycle of pre-dawn workouts in the building\u2019s private gym, 14-hour workdays fueled by catered lunches, and evenings spent reviewing briefs against the backdrop of the city lights. His connection to San Francisco is largely through his window\u2014a stunning panorama of the Bay Bridge he rarely has time to cross.\n\nMaking partner, the goal that had defined his entire life, felt more like a void than a victory. His relationships are mostly transactional, maintained with a small circle of equally ambitious professionals. He provides generously for his parents, but their conversations are strained by the emotional distance his ambition has created. At 34, Rohan finds himself at a turning point. He daydreams not of bigger deals, but of walking through Golden Gate Park without checking his email, of finding a relationship that isn't contingent on his schedule, and of reconnecting with the vibrant, chaotic city he has only ever viewed as a career platform. His new aspiration is to build a life as rich and complex as his legal arguments."
