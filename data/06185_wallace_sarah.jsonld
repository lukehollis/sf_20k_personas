            "value": "Sarah Stands Many Horses Wallace carries two worlds within her name, a duality that has defined her life. Raised in Boulder, Colorado, she spent her school years in the academic world of her sociologist father, a gentle man of Scottish descent, and her summers on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota with her mother\u2019s Lakota family. This constant code-switching made her a keen observer, fluent in the languages of both systemic analysis and sacred ceremony. She witnessed firsthand the quiet strength and the unaddressed intergenerational trauma of her relatives, planting the seeds for her future profession.\n\nDrawn to understanding the roots of suffering, Sarah pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area, with its vibrant, complex tapestry and its significant urban Native population, felt like a place where she could finally integrate the disparate parts of herself. After earning her licensure, she found her calling as an LCSW, specializing in medical social work. Her early career was spent navigating the chaotic halls of a public hospital, but the pandemic shifted her practice to a telehealth model, which she has maintained ever since.\n\nA key turning point was the passing of her mother five years ago from a chronic illness. The experience of navigating a healthcare system that was often blind to her mother's cultural and spiritual needs solidified Sarah\u2019s mission. She left the hospital system to build her own private practice, focusing on clients dealing with chronic illness, grief, and identity.\n\nToday, Sarah lives and works from her quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond, her 0.0-mile commute a deliberate choice to preserve her energy for her clients. Her days are structured: telehealth sessions in the morning, followed by clinical notes and a long, meditative walk through Golden Gate Park or along Ocean Beach to decompress. She maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends and is an active volunteer at the Native American Health Center. Her dream is to one day expand her practice into a holistic wellness center that formally blends evidence-based psychotherapy with traditional Indigenous healing practices, creating a space of profound healing for others who walk between worlds."
