The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised in a world of academic pressure and Silicon Valley ambition. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a biochemist, envisioned a similar path for her\u2014medicine or engineering. Priya, however, was always more attuned to the unspoken emotional currents in a room than to complex equations.\n\nHer defining turning point came during her sophomore year at UC Berkeley. Her maternal grandmother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and Priya witnessed firsthand the cold, impersonal nature of a healthcare system focused solely on the body, not the spirit. She saw her family struggle, not just with grief, but with navigating a confusing maze of jargon, insurance, and difficult choices without emotional support. It was then she abandoned her pre-med track, much to her parents\u2019 initial dismay, and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program.\n\nAfter earning her MSW and becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Priya moved to San Francisco, drawn to its diversity and spirit of acceptance. She took a demanding job within a large hospital system, specializing in palliative care and supporting families through medical crises. She found immense purpose in being the person her own family had needed years ago.\n\nNow 42, Priya has cultivated a life of intentional calm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a result of the post-pandemic shift to telehealth; her cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond doubles as her office. Her days are structured around intense virtual sessions with patients, followed by restorative walks through Golden Gate Park or along Clement Street\u2019s bustling markets. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends\u2014a nurse and a teacher\u2014who understand the emotional toll of \u201ccaring\u201d professions.\n\nWhile she has found peace, Priya dreams of extending her reach. She hopes to write a practical, compassionate guide for families navigating end-of-life care, turning her years of clinical experience into a resource for those lost in the system. For Priya, San Francisco is not a place for hustle, but a sanctuary where she can do her vital work and recharge, finding meaning in helping others find peace at the most difficult times."
