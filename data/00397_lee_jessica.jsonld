The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery, Jessica\u2019s childhood was a lesson in tireless work ethic and the nuances of community. She spent her weekends stocking shelves and making change, absorbing the city\u2019s rhythm through the conversations of her parents\u2019 customers.\n\nShe chose a practical Communications degree from San Francisco State University, graduating just as the first dot-com bubble spectacularly burst. The city\u2019s economic whiplash was a formative experience. While her peers fled, Jessica found an administrative role at a traditional commercial real estate firm. She learned the bones of the industry\u2014the properties, the zoning laws, the old-money players\u2014while watching the tech world retreat and then regroup.\n\nHer turning point came around 2010. As the next wave of tech startups began craving unconventional office space, Jessica saw an opportunity her old-school colleagues dismissed. She understood the new culture: the need for open floor plans, flexible leases, and amenities that felt more like a campus than a cubicle farm. She pivoted, leveraging her deep knowledge of SF\u2019s building stock with her innate ability to speak the language of ambitious founders. She quickly became the go-to account executive for tech companies looking to plant their flag, building a formidable reputation for closing complex, high-value deals.\n\nNow 44, Jessica lives in a minimalist Mission Bay condo, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to her success. Her days are a disciplined sequence of early morning runs along the Embarcadero, followed by a relentless schedule of Zoom calls with clients and virtual property tours. Her social life is intertwined with her career, consisting mostly of industry dinners and networking events. While financially secure, her intense focus has left little time for deep personal relationships.\n\nLately, Jessica feels a shift. The thrill of the deal is being replaced by a quieter ambition. She dreams of starting her own consulting firm focused on sustainable urban development, mentoring young women entering the male-dominated field. She wants to reconnect with the version of San Francisco she grew up with\u2014the one built on community, not just code\u2014and build a legacy that feels as solid and enduring as the city itself."
