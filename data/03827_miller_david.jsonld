Born and raised in Fresno, he was a thoughtful, introspective child in a practical, working-class family. His father, a mechanic, and his mother, a dental hygienist, couldn't quite understand his obsession with books, but they supported his dream to be the first in their family to earn a degree.\n\nIn the early 1990s, David arrived at SF State, a wide-eyed English Literature major captivated by the city's bohemian energy. He spent his days discussing poetry and his nights working at a cafe in the Haight. However, the unstructured academic world didn't click. He craved connection over theory, and the pressure to forge a creative career felt immense and paralyzing. After three semesters, when a family emergency called him home, he never returned to his studies, leaving his degree unfinished\u2014a quiet, lingering regret.\n\nThe next decade was a drift. David worked in bookstores and as a baker's assistant, always staying in the city he loved but without a clear path. The turning point came when he started volunteering at a small, independent elementary school to fill his time. There, helping a second-grader finally grasp the phonetics of a difficult word, he felt a profound sense of accomplishment he\u2019d never found in a college lecture.\n\nNow 50, David is a fixture at that same school. He\u2019s been a teacher's aide for nearly fifteen years, living in a small staff apartment directly above the classrooms. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs. His life is circumscribed but rich; he knows the names of every student, the best place to get a coffee on 9th Avenue, and the quietest benches in Golden Gate Park. Though he never married or had children of his own, he sees his legacy in the dozens of kids he\u2019s guided. His dreams are smaller now, but more tangible: to finish the short story he\u2019s been writing for a decade and, perhaps, to see one of his former students become a writer themselves."
