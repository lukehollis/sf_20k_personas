Adopted from South Korea as an infant by a loving white couple from the suburbs of Sacramento, Michael grew up navigating a world of dual identities. His upbringing was stable and affectionate, filled with bike rides and trips to Lake Tahoe, but he always felt a subtle otherness, a curiosity about the face he saw in the mirror. This gentle disconnect fueled a deep-seated empathy for others who felt out of place.\n\nFeeling a pull towards a more diverse environment, he moved to San Francisco after high school. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, finding the city\u2019s energy both exhilarating and anonymous. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do, but a volunteer stint at a community health clinic solidified his path. He saw firsthand the impact of compassionate, accessible care and decided to pursue an Associate's degree in Medical Assisting, a practical choice that promised stability and purpose.\n\nA key turning point was landing a job at a small private practice in the Inner Richmond. The position came with a rare perk: a small, rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment directly above the clinic. This cemented his connection to the neighborhood and explains his zero-mile commute. His life is now woven into the fabric of Clement Street. His alarm is the rumble of the 38 Geary bus, and his daily routine involves a short walk downstairs to prepare the clinic, greeting the elderly Cantonese-speaking patients he\u2019s come to know by name. He\u2019s the calm, organized presence that keeps the clinic running smoothly.\n\nMichael\u2019s social life is small but tight-knit, revolving around a weekly dim sum lunch with friends and quiet evenings spent reading or exploring the city's parks. He\u2019s a keen observer, finding comfort in the city's steady hum. His dream isn't fame or fortune; it's a quiet expansion of his current life. He's slowly saving and taking online classes, aspiring to become a Registered Nurse. He also harbors a quiet hope of one day visiting Seoul, not to find his birth family, but simply to connect with the culture that is a part of him, finally bridging the two worlds he has always inhabited."
