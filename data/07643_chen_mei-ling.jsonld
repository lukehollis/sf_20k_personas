The daughter of pragmatic Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small grocery in the Sunset District, her childhood was measured by the ebb and flow of inventory and the salty air from nearby Ocean Beach. While her parents championed stability, Mei-Ling found her calling in the sprawling wilds of Golden Gate Park, cataloging plants in notebooks and watching the herons at Stow Lake. This deep-seated love for the natural world felt like a gentle act of rebellion against her parents' practical dreams of a career in medicine or law.\n\nHer educational journey was a direct path toward this passion. After completing her undergraduate degree, she pursued a Master's in Environmental Management at UC Berkeley. The true turning point, however, came during a visit to her parents' ancestral village in China. Witnessing the environmental degradation firsthand\u2014the smog-choked air and the ghost of a once-vibrant river\u2014crystallized her purpose. It was no longer just about preserving beauty; it was about fighting for survival.\n\nNow 41, Mei-Ling works as a sought-after environmental consultant from her meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a life of focused intensity, spent analyzing environmental impact reports and advising corporations on sustainability. Her days are a blend of deep digital work and necessary analogue escape. After hours of staring at data, she recharges by tending to her impressive collection of succulents on her fire escape or going for long runs through the Presidio, her breath misting in the cool air.\n\nWhile dedicated to her career, she maintains a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, tech workers, and fellow activists\u2014who share her love for thoughtful conversation and hiking trails in Marin. She is deeply connected to her city, seeing it not as a concrete jungle, but as a complex ecosystem she is professionally and personally committed to protecting. Her ultimate dream is to leverage her expertise to lead a major public greening initiative for San Francisco, ensuring that future generations of children can find their own wild sanctuaries within the city limits."
