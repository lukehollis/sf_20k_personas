His rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment, filled with thriving plants and shelves of well-read books, is a quiet refuge from the emotional storms he weathers daily. Growing up in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, Owen\u2019s path was forged by his mother's early-onset multiple sclerosis diagnosis. As a teenager, he became a part-time caregiver, learning to navigate the labyrinth of healthcare systems, insurance paperwork, and the profound grief that accompanies chronic illness. This experience, both burdensome and clarifying, steered him away from a business degree and toward a life of service.\n\nHe left Ohio for UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program, drawn by its reputation and the allure of a California that felt a world away from home. Graduating with his LCSW license, he accepted a demanding position at the nearby UCSF Medical Center. His \"commute\" is a short, often fog-shrouded walk, a ritual that allows him to mentally prepare for the day. He works with patients and families facing life-altering diagnoses, offering counseling and support as they navigate their most vulnerable moments. The work is draining, requiring a brand of empathy that leaves him depleted by evening.\n\nHis daily routine is his anchor. An early morning run through Golden Gate Park, a quiet coffee at a local cafe, and evenings spent either reading or with a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014mostly other healthcare professionals who understand the unspoken weight of their work. At 30, romantic relationships have been fleeting; he finds it difficult to share the emotional space his job consumes.\n\nOwen\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn't about its vibrant nightlife or tech-fueled glamour, but its pockets of tranquility. He loves the quiet murmur of his neighborhood, the proximity to the ocean, and the anonymity of being one small part of a complex city. His deepest aspiration isn't career advancement, but learning to build a life that can hold both the profound sorrow of his work and a measure of personal joy. He dreams of one day opening a small private practice focused on caregiver support, honoring the path that first set him on this journey."
