Growing up, he watched his younger sister navigate a school system utterly unprepared to support her severe learning disability. The constant battles for resources and understanding ignited in him a fierce resolve to build the systems that had failed his own family. This foundational experience steered him away from a more lucrative career path and towards a Bachelor's in Sociology, followed by a move to the West Coast in the mid-90s, seeking a more progressive social landscape.\n\nHe landed in San Francisco and took a frontline job as a case manager for at-risk youth. The work was grueling but reinforced his purpose. He witnessed the city's struggles with homelessness, addiction, and the lingering shadow of the AIDS crisis firsthand. To move from the frontline to a position where he could effect broader change, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning his Master of Social Work while working full-time.\n\nA key turning point was developing a groundbreaking mentorship program that paired high school students with professionals in their desired fields, a program that secured major grant funding and is still running today. This success propelled him into leadership roles, leading to his current position as a Clinical Program Director. He now oversees programs providing educational and mental health support for underserved families, a direct echo of his childhood mission.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the Mission District. He shares a rent-controlled apartment with his partner of 18 years, Marcus, a public high school teacher. His 2.1-mile bicycle commute is a daily ritual, a rolling survey of the neighborhood he serves, from the murals on Clarion Alley to the lines outside the taquerias. Evenings are often spent cooking, walking their rescue dog around Dolores Park, or meeting with a close-knit circle of friends, most of whom also work in public service.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn't one of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014for his programs and for the city he loves. He worries about the displacement of the very communities he works to support but remains steadfast. His greatest aspiration is to mentor the next generation of social workers, ensuring the fight for a more equitable San Francisco continues long after he retires."

For a moment, David saw his sister\u2019s familiar frustration. Instead of forcing it, he quietly asked, \u201cWould it help if I read them to you?\u201d The boy\u2019s shoulders sagged in relief as he nodded. It was a searingly clear moment that taught him true support wasn\u2019t about fixing a problem, but first acknowledging a person\u2019s dignity.\n\n2.\nThe grant funding for his mentorship program had come through, but the real moment of success was in a cramped high school library in the mid-2000s. He watched a shy student, once convinced she\u2019d never leave the Mission, excitedly show her architect mentor a 3D model she\u2019d designed. Seeing the spark of her newly imaginable future reflected in the mentor\u2019s proud gaze, David felt a profound, bone-deep certainty. This was the work. This was how you built a bridge out of despair.\n\n3.\nIt was 2008, after a devastating budget cut. He came home to their Mission apartment, the day\u2019s defeats heavy on his shoulders. Marcus didn\u2019t ask questions. He was just there, stirring a pot of soup, the air warm with the smell of garlic. He handed David a bowl and said, \u201cEat. The world can wait an hour.\u201d In that quiet act of care, David understood their shared life wasn\u2019t an escape from his work, but the foundation that made his relentless fight for others possible.\n\n4.\nOn his bike commute last spring, he saw it. The vibrant mural of neighborhood elders on the corner bodega, a landmark on his daily route, was gone. In its place was a stark, whitewashed wall awaiting a new logo. A sharp, specific grief hit him, feeling like a personal loss. It crystallized his deepest fear for the city: that in the pursuit of the new, San Francisco was carelessly, irrevocably erasing its own heart, the very communities he had devoted his life to serving.\n\n5.\nJust last fall, a young MSW intern he was supervising sat in his office, near tears with self-doubt. David looked at her tired, compassionate eyes and saw his own youthful fire. He didn\u2019t offer a solution. Instead, he shared a raw story of a time he failed a client early in his career. A flicker of understanding crossed her face. In that moment of shared vulnerability, he felt he wasn\u2019t just a director, but a steward, passing the torch and its necessary weight to the next generation."
