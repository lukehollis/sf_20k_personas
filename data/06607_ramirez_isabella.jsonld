Raised in Fresno, she was the first in her family to be born in the United States and the default translator and advocate for her Mexican immigrant parents. She spent her childhood navigating a maze of paperwork and appointments, most searingly when her grandmother, her beloved *abuela*, battled a prolonged illness. Watching the healthcare system\u2019s indifference to those who couldn't command its language or culture planted a seed of fierce purpose within her. San Francisco, with its promise of progressive ideals, became her goal.\n\nShe attended San Francisco State University, first for her bachelor's and then for her Master of Social Work, focusing on health equity. The city was a shock\u2014vibrant and liberating, but also stark in its inequalities. Instead of being deterred, Isabella was drawn to the epicenter of the crisis. Upon graduating, she took a demanding position as a clinical social worker at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin, a role that came with a rare city perk: a small, subsidized apartment in the same building as her office. Her commute is the 30 seconds it takes the elevator to travel from her sixth-floor flat to the ground-floor clinic.\n\nIsabella\u2019s life is a constant exercise in managing boundaries. Her mornings are spent in her small apartment, fielding calls and documenting cases. Afternoons are downstairs, running support groups for residents managing chronic illness and addiction, or conducting one-on-one counseling sessions. Her clients are her neighbors; she sees the raw, unfiltered reality of their struggles in the hallway and the laundry room. This immersion is both her greatest strength and her heaviest burden. Decompression comes from weekly dinners with a tight-knit group of fellow social workers and long phone calls with her mother, who still worries she works too hard.\n\nAt 34, Isabella feels the weight of her work but remains steadfast. Her dream isn\u2019t to escape, but to build. She envisions transforming the building\u2019s barren rooftop into a community garden, a therapeutic space where residents can cultivate life and where she, too, can find a moment of peace. For Isabella, San Francisco is not a city of picturesque skylines, but of resilient, complicated people. And here, in the heart of its most challenging neighborhood, she has found her purpose."
