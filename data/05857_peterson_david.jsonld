Raised in a quiet suburb of Portland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and an accountant father, his childhood was one of structured predictability. This environment fostered in him a deep appreciation for systems and order, leading him to pursue a Master's in Library and Information Science. His dream was a tranquil one: to be an archivist at a university, a custodian of history.\n\nThat dream dissolved in the late 1990s. While finishing his degree, he visited a friend in San Francisco and was swept up in the intoxicating energy of the dot-com boom. He saw a new kind of library being built\u2014a digital one\u2014and its architects were desperate for people who could organize the sprawling, messy information. He abandoned his archivist plans, taking a job as a junior project manager at a burgeoning startup. He was the calm in the storm, the one who created spreadsheets and timelines while his colleagues coded on beanbags.\n\nHe survived the dot-com bust, a key turning point that instilled in him a pragmatic cynicism and made him invaluable. While others chased equity, David built a reputation for delivering projects. He rode the subsequent waves of tech, his career steadily ascending. He married, bought a condo in Hayes Valley when it was still considered \u201cup and coming,\u201d and had a daughter. But the long hours and the relentless pace of the industry took their toll, leading to an amicable but draining divorce in his mid-forties.\n\nNow, at 50, his life is contained within his impeccably organized condo. His commute is a ten-step walk to his home office. His days are a disciplined sequence of virtual stand-ups and Gantt charts, broken up by long cycling trips through Golden Gate Park. He socializes with a small circle of friends, fellow veterans of the tech wars. His connection to San Francisco is one of a weary but devoted long-term resident; he complains about the city\u2019s changes but feels a fierce loyalty to the fog-laced streets he\u2019s called home for over two decades. His hope is to one day disengage from the corporate machine and blend his two lives\u2014using his tech expertise to help a museum or historical society digitize their archives, finally returning to the quiet order he first set out to find."
