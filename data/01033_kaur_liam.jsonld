            "value": "Liam Kaur\u2019s very name tells a story of San Francisco\u2019s cultural crossroads. He was born in the Sunset District to a Punjabi Sikh father who drove a taxi and an Irish-American mother who worked as a public-school aide. His childhood was a dissonant blend of his father\u2019s quiet, introspective spirituality and his mother's family's loud, chaotic grief. Feeling like he belonged to neither world, Liam\u2019s adolescence spiraled. He dropped out of high school, embracing the city\u2019s underbelly and finding a fleeting sense of identity in addiction and petty crime. This turbulent period is the \"unknown\" chapter of his life, a time he rarely speaks of.\n\nThe turning point came at 25, after a near-fatal overdose. In the sterile quiet of a hospital ward, a compassionate social worker saw past the anger and despair, connecting with the frightened young man beneath. That encounter planted a seed. After getting clean, Liam began a grueling educational climb. A GED led to classes at City College of San Francisco, then a hard-won bachelor\u2019s degree from SF State, and finally, a Master of Social Work. He was driven by a singular focus: to become the person he had so desperately needed.\n\nNow 44, Liam lives a quiet, structured life in Cole Valley. His commute is zero miles; a small, soundproofed room in his apartment serves as his office, where he sees clients via telehealth. His days are disciplined: morning meditation, a walk through the Panhandle, and then hours spent guiding others through the same darkness he once navigated. As a Clinical Social Worker, he specializes in addiction and complex trauma, his lived experience giving him an empathy that cannot be taught.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is visceral. He sees his younger, lost self in the faces of the clients he helps and feels the city's pulse not in its tech booms, but in its community clinics and support groups. His social circle is small but deep, built on the foundations of recovery and shared understanding. Liam\u2019s primary aspiration is the radical act of maintaining stability for himself and his clients. He dreams of one day finding a lasting partnership and perhaps writing a memoir, not for acclaim, but to leave a map for others still lost in the wilderness."
