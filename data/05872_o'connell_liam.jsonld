Raised in a quiet, middle-class suburb of Chicago, he was the son of a union electrician and a school administrator who instilled in him a powerful work ethic. Liam was smart, diligent, and saw a lucrative career in finance as his clear ticket out of the predictable Midwest life he knew. He pursued an Economics degree at the University of Illinois, graduating with honors, his sights set firmly on the financial hubs of the country.\n\nThe turning point came when he received a lucrative offer from a major investment firm in San Francisco. At 22, he packed his life into two suitcases and moved into a new, sleek apartment in SoMa, envisioning a life of bustling commutes, post-work drinks in the Financial District, and vibrant weekend adventures. He arrived just six months before the world shut down.\n\nHis company went fully remote, and Liam\u2019s commute shrank to the ten feet between his bed and his desk. The thriving city he had moved for was reduced to a view from his 15th-floor window and the curated options on his food delivery apps. His professional life flourished; he was good at his job, parsing data and building complex financial models with an almost obsessive focus. His days became a monotonous cycle: wake, log on, analyze, work late, sleep.\n\nNow 25, Liam is a ghost in his own city. He lives in San Francisco but doesn't *know* it. His social circle consists of a few colleagues he knows primarily through a screen and a long-distance relationship that fizzled under the strain of his relentless work schedule. He feels a profound disconnect between the successful life he\u2019s built on paper and the hollow reality of his daily existence.\n\nHis quiet aspiration is no longer about the next promotion. He dreams of logging off at 5 PM, walking to a North Beach cafe without checking his email, hiking the trails of the Presidio, and finally feeling the pulse of the city he sacrificed so much to join. Liam\u2019s greatest ambition is to close his laptop and truly begin his commute."
