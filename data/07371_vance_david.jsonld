As the older brother to Leo, who was born with severe autism, David\u2019s youth was a crash course in patience, advocacy, and finding joy in non-traditional milestones. While his parents, a pragmatic accountant and a dental hygienist, focused on logistics, David became Leo\u2019s translator, protector, and friend, learning to navigate a world that wasn't built for his brother.\n\nHe initially sought escape in literature, earning an English degree from UC Davis, but a post-graduate malaise left him feeling directionless. The turning point came while volunteering at a center for adults with developmental disabilities. He saw his brother\u2019s experience mirrored in others and felt an undeniable pull. This clarity propelled him to San Francisco State University, where he completed a Master's in Education with a specialization in severe needs. The city, with its promise of acceptance and robust public services, felt like the right place to build a life of purpose.\n\nNow 44, David is a veteran teacher at a public high school in the Inner Sunset. His life is inextricably linked to his work; he lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment just a block from campus, making his commute a short, meditative walk. His days are a whirlwind of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), de-escalating meltdowns, and celebrating small, monumental victories\u2014a student making eye contact, another mastering the city bus route. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of the emotional energy his students required, leaving him quietly solitary.\n\nHis San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or Michelin stars. It\u2019s the foggy quiet of Golden Gate Park on a Sunday morning, the familiar comfort of his local coffee shop, and the shared camaraderie with other public-sector workers. David\u2019s dreams are grounded: he hopes to pilot a new vocational program at his school and, perhaps one day, find the energy to write the stories he long ago abandoned. He doesn't own a piece of SF's glittering skyline, but he holds a vital, often-unseen stake in its future, one student at a time."
