Her mother, an immigrant from Chennai, India, was a pragmatic ER nurse who valued stability and education. Her father, a third-generation Irish-American from the Sunset District, was a gifted but perpetually struggling furniture maker who saw beauty in grain and joinery. Priya grew up in a small Richmond district house filled with the scent of sandalwood incense and sawdust, learning from her mother\u2019s practicality and her father\u2019s passion for creation.\n\nWhile her peers chased tech internships, Priya found her calling in the loud, precise world of high school shop class. The abstract concepts of calculus bored her, but the tangible reality of turning a block of raw aluminum into a functional part on a lathe felt like magic. Watching her father sell his beautiful, handcrafted tables for a fraction of their worth to cover bills solidified her resolve: she would build things, but she would build a stable life doing it.\n\nShe enrolled in City College\u2019s Manufacturing Technology program, thriving in a hands-on environment. She was often the only woman in her classes, a fact that only hardened her determination. After earning her associate's degree, she landed a job as a CNC Machinist.\n\nNow 28, Priya\u2019s life is a study in focused routine. Her alarm goes off at 6:00 a.m. in her modest Dogpatch apartment. A short ride on the T-Third Muni line takes her to the manufacturing facility where she spends her days programming and operating machines that cut metal with microscopic precision. The hum of the machinery is her soundtrack, the smell of cutting fluid her version of perfume.\n\nEvenings are for her small circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow makers and old school friends\u2014meeting for trivia at a local brewery or simply watching movies. Her true dream is taking shape in a shared makerspace nearby, where she\u2019s slowly acquiring equipment. Her ultimate goal isn\u2019t wealth, but mastery. She aspires to open her own small, high-end fabrication shop, creating bespoke metal components for artists and designers, perfectly blending her father\u2019s artistry with the unshakeable stability she\u2019s built for herself. She is a different kind of San Franciscan, one who makes the tangible things the city is built on."

The buyer haggled, and her dad, needing the cash, reluctantly agreed to a price that felt like an insult. Priya felt a hot, protective anger swell in her chest. That day, she understood the difference between creating beauty and commanding its worth. It wasn't enough to just make things; you had to build a life where your work was respected, not bargained away out of desperation.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she misjudged a piece in shop class and sliced her palm open. Her mother, home from a 12-hour ER shift, calmly stitched the wound at their kitchen table under the lamp light. There was no lecture, only quiet focus. Finishing the last stitch, her mother looked at her and said, \u201cGood. Now you know its power. Respect it, and you can control it.\u201d Priya learned then that pragmatism wasn't fear; it was the foundation for handling powerful things, whether it was a machine or a crisis.\n\n3.\nThe epiphany came in her junior year, standing before a metal lathe. The abstract equations in calculus class felt like a foreign language, but the tactile feedback of the cutter shaving a perfect, shimmering spiral from a block of aluminum was pure, instant clarity. Holding the finished, precisely dimensioned part in her hand\u2014cool, smooth, and real\u2014she felt a sense of competence and purpose that no textbook had ever given her. This was her language. This was her path.\n\n4.\nHer first solo project at City College was a complex part on the 5-axis CNC mill. She spent the entire night before reviewing her G-code, her stomach in knots. The next day, with a few older male students watching skeptically, she hit \u2018run.\u2019 The machine whirred to life, a symphony of precise movements she had orchestrated. Pulling out the flawlessly executed component, a quiet, unshakeable pride settled deep in her bones. In that moment, she wasn't a woman in a man's world; she was simply a machinist.\n\n5.\nLast year, using money she\u2019d meticulously saved, she bought her first major piece of equipment for the makerspace: a used Bridgeport mill. The night it was delivered, she stayed long after everyone else, running her hand over its cold, solid body. The air smelled of grease and potential. It wasn\u2019t just a machine; it was the cornerstone of her own shop, the first tangible piece of the stable, creative life she was building for herself, one precise cut at a time."
