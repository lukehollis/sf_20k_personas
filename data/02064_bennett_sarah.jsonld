Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing elementary school teacher mother, her childhood was one of stability and encouragement. She attended UC Davis, choosing a Communications degree less out of passion and more out of a general interest in people. The degree felt broad enough to keep her options open, a safe bet for a future she hadn't yet defined.\n\nHer key turning point came during a post-college internship in San Francisco. The city\u2019s kinetic energy was a revelation. It wasn't just a place; it was a current, and she felt an immediate, irresistible pull to join its flow. After a year of unfulfilling administrative work, she landed a junior sourcing role at a mid-size tech company. There, she discovered her true calling: the human puzzle of recruiting. Her Communications background proved invaluable, allowing her to translate the dense language of engineering roles into human conversations, connecting with candidates on a level her peers often missed.\n\nNow 32, Sarah is a senior technical recruiter, working entirely from her chic but compact apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life unfolds within a ten-block radius on weekdays. Mornings start with coffee from a local cafe, followed by a day spent navigating a digital tapestry of LinkedIn profiles, video calls, and complex compensation packages. To combat the isolation of remote work, she religiously takes a midday walk through the neighborhood, finding solace in the murmur of Patricia\u2019s Green.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit \"found family\" of friends, a mix from old jobs and kickball leagues, with whom she explores the city's food scene or escapes for weekend hikes in Marin. While professionally successful, Sarah aspires to move beyond filling roles into a Head of People position where she can shape a company's culture from the ground up. Personally, she hopes to find a partnership that feels as authentic and grounding as the life she has so meticulously built for herself in the city she chose to call home."
