His home was orderly and prosperous, but affection was a scarce resource, expressed through academic achievements rather than open communication. From a young age, Owen became the family\u2019s unwitting emotional barometer, learning to read the subtle shifts in tone and body language that betrayed his parents\u2019 unspoken anxieties. He developed a deep, quiet empathy, a skill born of necessity that would later define his professional life.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree in psychology on the East Coast but felt a gravitational pull westward for graduate school. He chose the University of San Francisco for its Master's in Counseling Psychology program, drawn by the city\u2019s reputation for challenging convention and embracing vulnerability. The move was a deliberate severing of ties with the emotional austerity of his upbringing. After earning his degree and completing his licensure hours at a bustling, under-resourced community clinic, Owen felt the familiar sting of burnout. The sheer volume of cases left little room for the deep, focused work he felt his clients deserved.\n\nThis experience was his key turning point. Two years ago, Owen took a leap and established his own private practice, run entirely from a dedicated office space within his Inner Sunset apartment. His zero-mile commute is a cornerstone of his carefully curated life. His days are structured and serene: a foggy morning walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by back-to-back teletherapy sessions where he provides a calm, anchoring presence for his clients. He has cultivated a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists and tech workers\u2014with whom he shares dinners and quiet hikes, valuing deep connection over a large social network.\n\nNow 32, Owen feels deeply rooted in the fog-laced streets of his neighborhood. He is single, comfortable in his own solitude but open to a meaningful partnership. His aspiration is not growth for its own sake, but to deepen his craft. He hopes to specialize in helping couples navigate the unique pressures of life in the Bay Area and perhaps, one day, lead workshops on emotional intelligence for the very tech companies whose relentless pace contributes to the burnout he so often treats. He seeks to provide the emotional clarity he craved as a child, one session at a time, from his quiet corner of San Francisco."
