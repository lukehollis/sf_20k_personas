Born in the Mission District to a Mexican immigrant father who worked as a mechanic and a second-generation Irish-American mother who was a librarian, Joaquin\u2019s childhood was a blend of grease-stained knuckles and literary worlds. He spent weekends in his father\u2019s garage, mesmerized by the alchemy of turning broken parts into functional machines, inheriting a deep respect for tangible skill.\n\nHis mother, however, nurtured his eye for form, taking him to SFMOMA and the de Young Museum. This duality led him to SF State, where he pursued a BFA in Sculpture, finding his voice not in clay or wood, but in welded steel. He loved the resistance of the material, the way it yielded to heat and force. After graduating, the romance of being a starving artist quickly wore off. He realized his truest satisfaction came from solving structural puzzles and creating objects that were both beautiful and functional.\n\nThe turning point came at 32. After a decade of working in various fabrication shops, he pooled his savings and took a lease on a cavernous, neglected warehouse in Dogpatch, a neighborhood still defined by its industrial past. He founded Solis Metalworks. In the beginning, it was just him, a welding torch, and long nights. He built a reputation for meticulous work, fabricating everything from custom staircases for architects to structural components for large-scale art installations.\n\nToday, Joaquin\u2019s life is anchored by a satisfying routine. He cycles the 2.8 miles from his modest Potrero Hill home, enjoying the morning fog before the sun burns through. His shop, now employing a small, dedicated crew, is his sanctuary\u2014a loud symphony of grinders, welders, and hammers. He is a tough but fair boss, known for mentoring young craftspeople. A long-term relationship ended amicably years ago; his dedication to the shop had become his primary partnership. His social life is a small circle of fellow makers and old friends, often meeting for beers at a local pub.\n\nJoaquin feels like a quiet observer of the new San Francisco. He fabricates pieces for the tech offices and luxury condos that have reshaped his city, a bittersweet irony he appreciates. His dream isn\u2019t expansion or wealth, but legacy. He hopes to eventually turn the business over to his lead fabricator and spend his final working years back where he started: creating his own sculptures, finally closing the loop between his artistic soul and his life\u2019s trade."

His father\u2019s hands, scarred but sure, moved with a mechanic\u2019s grace inside the guts of a Ford transmission. He handed his dad a cold, heavy wrench, feeling its purpose. He didn\u2019t just see a broken thing being fixed; he saw chaos being turned back into order. It was the first time he understood the deep, honest magic of making something whole again, a lesson that settled into his bones.\n\n2.\nAt fourteen, his mother took him to SFMOMA. He stood inside a Richard Serra sculpture, dwarfed by its curving, rusted steel walls. The material was familiar\u2014the stuff of I-beams and car frames\u2014but here, it was bent into something that only served to command space and awe. Running his hand along its coarse surface, he felt the echo of his father\u2019s garage meet the silence of the museum. Steel wasn't just strong; it could have a voice. It was a language he knew he had to speak.\n\n3.\nHe was 25, a year out of SF State, staring at a jagged sculpture in his tiny studio. It was technically sound but felt emotionally hollow. A week later, he fabricated a simple, clean-lined gate for a neighbor. Seeing it swing perfectly on its hinges, hearing the solid click of the latch, delivered a jolt of satisfaction his \"art\" never had. He wasn't failing his BFA; he was discovering his true calling was in the elegance of function, where beauty and purpose were welded together.\n\n4.\nThe first night in the Dogpatch warehouse, at 32, was terrifying. Standing alone in the cavernous dark, the smell of rust and neglect filling his lungs, the weight of his depleted savings felt crushing. Then he flipped the main breaker. A single bare bulb flickered on, illuminating a universe of dust motes. In that small circle of light, the fear gave way to a fierce, quiet resolve. This empty space, its history and its future, was his. The work could begin.\n\n5.\nLast year, he saw a grand, floating staircase his shop fabricated, installed in a gleaming SoMa tech office. He watched young programmers walk up and down, their eyes glued to phones, oblivious to the precision of the welds holding them up. He felt a bittersweet pride\u2014his hands, representing an older San Francisco, had built a small part of the new one. It wasn't resentment he felt, but a clear vision of his own end goal: to one day build for himself again."
