The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small laundromat, she grew up understanding the city through its Muni bus lines and the grit of her parents' hard work. Watching them navigate a city that was both their home and a constant challenge instilled in her a deep fascination with urban systems. This led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies and later, a Master's degree in Urban Planning from UCLA, where she focused on transportation infrastructure.\n\nHer career started in the public sector, working for the SFMTA. For over a decade, she learned the bureaucratic intricacies and real-world impact of public transit. However, watching the slow pace of change, she grew restless. The key turning point came when a burgeoning tech company, promising to revolutionize urban mobility, recruited her. Leaving the stability of a city job for a private startup was a monumental risk, but she saw a chance to implement change on a scale she\u2019d only dreamed of. The gamble paid off, and she ascended the ranks to her current role as Director of Transit Operations.\n\nNow 52, Sarah lives a life of quiet contradiction. From her minimalist Hayes Valley condo, she orchestrates the complex daily movement of thousands of people without ever leaving her desk. Her 0.0-mile commute is a series of Zoom calls managing logistics, data analytics, and operational teams across the region. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of old colleagues and professional friends, often meeting for dinner or walks through Golden Gate Park. A long-term relationship ended several years ago, leaving her more time to pour into her demanding career and self-reflection.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her being\u2014from the scent of dim sum in her parents' neighborhood to the\u4fef\u77b0\u7684 data streams on her monitor. Her ultimate aspiration is to build a truly equitable transit system, one that serves not just the tech elite but also families like the one she grew up in. She dreams of one day leveraging her private sector experience to return to public service, finally bridging the gap between Silicon Valley innovation and the fundamental needs of the city she calls home."
