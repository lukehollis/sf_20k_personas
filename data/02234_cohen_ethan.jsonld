The son of a public school teacher and a CPA, his childhood was a stable landscape of academic achievement and dinner table conversations about state budgets and local taxes. The turning point came during his junior year of high school when he watched his mother, a dedicated educator, grapple with the demoralizing effects of state funding cuts on her classroom. Seeing policy as a tangible force that could either uplift or undermine a community ignited a quiet fire within him.\n\nHe pursued a Political Science degree at UC Davis, but it was his acceptance into UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy that truly brought him into his own. Immersed in the Bay Area\u2019s vibrant, often contentious, political energy, Ethan shed his suburban reticence. He found his tribe among classmates who debated housing density and transit equity with the same passion others reserved for sports. San Francisco, with its progressive ideals and complex problems, became his ultimate goal.\n\nLanding a position as a Policy Analyst for the City and County of San Francisco felt like a coronation. To fully commit, he found a small, modern studio in Hayes Valley, just a short walk from City Hall, rendering his commute nonexistent. His days are a meticulous cycle of data analysis, memo drafting, and virtual meetings, trying to find evidence-based solutions for the city\u2019s intractable issues.\n\nMost evenings, Ethan de-stresses with a run through the Panhandle to Golden Gate Park, his mind still processing zoning codes and demographic trends. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of fellow Berkeley grads, their get-togethers often turning into informal policy roundtables. While professionally driven, he hopes for a deeper connection, though his demanding work leaves little room for serious romance. Ethan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t about power, but about efficacy. He aspires to be the anonymous architect behind a landmark housing or transit bill\u2014a piece of legislation that works, proving that good governance can, in fact, change lives. He sees San Francisco not just as his home, but as his life's project."
