The youngest of four in an Irish-American family of police officers and nurses, he was expected to follow a path of civic duty. However, watching his older brother grapple with an opioid addiction that the family met with tough love and frustration, Michael saw a different kind of frontline. He saw the wound beneath the wound, the systemic failures and personal despair that his family\u2019s practicality couldn\u2019t touch. This divergence set his life\u2019s course.\n\nHe left Boston for the West Coast, earning his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. It was a conscious break from the world he knew, a search for a new vocabulary to address the pain he\u2019d witnessed. He settled in San Francisco in the late 1990s, just as the first dot-com boom was reshaping the city. Michael began his career at a city hospital, his calm demeanor becoming an anchor for patients navigating the terrifying intersection of chronic illness, poverty, and mental health crises. A long-term relationship in his thirties taught him as much about boundaries and self-preservation as his clinical supervision, ending amicably but leaving him more introspective.\n\nNow 52, Michael lives a quiet, ordered life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. The pandemic transitioned his practice to telehealth, and his commute is now a ten-foot walk from his kitchen to the small, book-lined office that was once a dining nook. His days are a patchwork of video calls with clients, his voice a steady presence in their chaotic lives. Mornings often start with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, coffee in hand, preparing his mind for the day\u2019s emotional weight.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but muted; he loves the city\u2019s resilience but mourns the ghosts of what it once was. His hopes are no longer grand. He dreams of mentoring a new generation of social workers, of seeing a few of his long-term clients find lasting stability, and perhaps, one day, taking a trip to County Cork to walk the land his grandparents left behind."
