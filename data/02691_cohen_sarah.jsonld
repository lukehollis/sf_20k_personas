Raised in Berkeley by a sociology professor father and an architect mother, her childhood was a blend of intellectual inquiry and an appreciation for well-designed spaces, both natural and built. Family weekends were spent not at malls, but hiking the trails of Mount Tamalpais or exploring the coastal bluffs, instilling in her a deep-seated reverence for the local environment.\n\nThis passion naturally guided her to UC Santa Cruz, where she pursued a degree in Environmental Studies. It was during a summer internship with a waterfront planning agency in Oakland that she had her turning point. She saw firsthand the contentious but vital negotiations between developers, community activists, and environmental regulators. Sarah realized her true calling wasn't in pure activism, but in being the pragmatic bridge between progress and preservation. This led her to a Master's in Urban and Environmental Planning from UCLA, after which she returned to the Bay Area, eager to make her mark.\n\nNow 33, Sarah is a Senior Environmental Planner for a private consulting firm, working entirely from her apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute is a conscious choice, allowing her to be fully embedded in the community she serves. Her days begin with a run through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park, her expansive, misty backyard. Work consists of dense environmental impact reports, zoning analyses, and endless Zoom calls with city officials and neighborhood groups.\n\nHer social life is a close-knit circle of friends, many met through a local climbing gym and a shared love for weekend trips to Tahoe or the Sonoma coast. She is deeply connected to her neighborhood, frequenting the Sunday farmers' market on Irving Street and knowing the baristas at her favorite coffee shop by name. While content, Sarah dreams of one day leading a transformative public project\u2014perhaps a new shoreline park or a city-wide green roofing initiative. Her ambition isn't for power, but for legacy: to leave San Francisco a more sustainable, resilient, and beautiful place than she found it."
