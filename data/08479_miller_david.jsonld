As the live-in Facilities Manager, his 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life entirely intertwined with the grand, aging structure he calls home.\n\nThe son of Chinese immigrants, David grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District. His parents ran a small, bustling herb shop, and his childhood was scented with ginseng and star anise. They envisioned a future for him in a stable, respected profession like pharmacy, but David was always more fascinated by the mechanics of things\u2014how the streetcar lines worked, what made the old Victorian homes settle and groan. He was a tinkerer, a problem-solver.\n\nDefying his parents\u2019 hopes, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Building Systems Technology. This practical education became his ticket out of the family business and into a world he understood. He started as a maintenance technician for a large property management firm, learning the intricate workings of HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems across the city.\n\nThe turning point came twenty years ago when he was offered the manager position at \"The Alhambra,\" a pre-war building with marble floors and a history of eccentric tenants. The job came with a basement-level apartment, a steady salary, and a sense of ownership he\u2019d never felt before. A brief, early marriage had dissolved under the strain of his on-call lifestyle; The Alhambra became his most enduring partner.\n\nHis days are a consistent rhythm of walking the halls, troubleshooting a resident\u2019s finicky radiator, coordinating with contractors, and signing for packages. He knows the building's secrets\u2014which floorboards squeak, which pipes rattle during a storm. His social life is woven into the fabric of the building; he\u2019s a trusted confidant to elderly residents and a quiet, steady presence for the newer tech transplants.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of grand ambition. He simply hopes to keep The Alhambra running smoothly, a bastion of old San Francisco charm against the relentless tide of modernity. His quiet, personal aspiration is to one day fully restore the building\u2019s disused rooftop garden, creating a small, green oasis overlooking the city that has been both his workplace and his entire world."
