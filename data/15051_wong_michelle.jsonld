Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the salty air of Ocean Beach. Her parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small but bustling grocery store, instilling in her a formidable work ethic and a deep sense of pragmatism. While they hoped she\u2019d pursue law or medicine, Michelle found her passion not in textbooks, but in the vibrant murals of the Mission District and on school trips to the de Young Museum. She saw art as the city\u2019s true language.\n\nChoosing a Bachelor's in Arts Administration was her first great compromise\u2014a practical path to a creative world. She began her career in the trenches of smaller Bay Area non-profits, writing grants and organizing community art fairs. Her talent lay in translating artistic vision into compelling financial proposals. This skill eventually led her to the SF Museum of Modern Art, where she has spent the last fifteen years, climbing from a junior associate to her current role as Director of Development.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 38. The amicable split from her architect husband marked the end of a chapter defined by dual ambitions and raising their son, Alex. Now 50, with Alex recently graduated and working in New York, Michelle is navigating a new, quieter independence.\n\nHer days are structured and demanding. She leaves her chic Hayes Valley condo, a home she bought post-divorce, and takes the MUNI to SoMa. Her work involves courting Silicon Valley philanthropists, planning multi-million-dollar galas, and ensuring the museum\u2019s legacy. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or quiet dinners with a close-knit circle of friends. Weekends are for the farmers' market and long walks through Golden Gate Park, retracing the steps of her youth.\n\nHer aspiration is no longer just to climb the career ladder, but to secure a transformative endowment for the museum\u2014a legacy that will outlast her. Privately, she dreams of traveling more, perhaps even taking a sabbatical to finally try her own hand at ceramics, a desire long suppressed by a life spent facilitating the art of others."

The vibrant, impossibly thick frosting on the cakes seemed more real than the neatly stacked oranges in her parents\u2019 store. In the museum\u2019s hushed reverence, so different from the clamor of the grocery, she felt a profound sense of recognition. This was a language she understood instinctively, a vibrant secret world beyond the Outer Richmond fog. It was the day she knew she wouldn't sell produce; she would find a way to live inside that frame.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt 24, in a cramped Berkeley office that smelled of stale coffee, she got the email. The foundation had approved her grant proposal for a community mural project. Her heart didn't soar; it settled. For the first time, she saw that her pragmatism wasn't a betrayal of her passion but its most vital ally. She wasn't a failed artist. She was the conduit, the one who could translate the chaotic beauty of creation into the clean, compelling language of money and purpose.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe divorce wasn\u2019t one moment, but she remembers the last night in their shared home. Her husband\u2019s architectural models cast long shadows on the walls. There was no shouting, only a shared, quiet acknowledgment that their ambitious blueprints no longer fit on the same page. Looking at him, she felt a wave of clean, sharp grief, followed by an unnerving sense of space. It was the night she stopped defining herself in a partnership and began sketching the outlines of her own, singular life.\n\n***\n\n4.\nShe remembers Alex, age ten, on a windswept Ocean Beach. He complained about the cold as she pointed towards the blurred outline of the Cliff House, telling him stories of her own childhood. He then found a perfect sand dollar, his face breaking into a wide grin. In that moment, holding his small, sandy hand, she felt she was giving him his true inheritance: not a trust fund, but the grit and soul of this foggy city, a beauty you had to learn to love.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last Saturday at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, she picked up a heavy, handmade ceramic mug. The earthy glaze felt rough and honest under her thumb. After a week of courting tech billionaires for the museum\u2019s new wing, the simple, tangible weight of it was staggering. It wasn't an object to be acquired or curated; it was something to be used. A quiet, fierce hunger awoke in her\u2014not to manage, but to finally, after all these years, make something with her own hands."
