Raised in a quiet, unassuming suburb outside of Portland, he was taught that success was a linear path: college, career, family. He followed it dutifully, moving to San Francisco in his early twenties for a burgeoning career in advertising. For two decades, he crafted campaigns and chased promotions, marrying his college sweetheart and buying a condo in the Marina. He had the life he was supposed to want, yet a persistent hollowness gnawed at him.\n\nThe turning point came at forty-two. A painful, protracted divorce shattered the facade of his life, forcing a brutal self-assessment. He realized he\u2019d spent his life trying to persuade people, but he\u2019d never learned how to truly listen\u2014least of all to himself. The experience broke him open, and in that raw, vulnerable space, a new purpose took root. Selling his condo, he enrolled in a Master\u2019s program for Marriage and Family Therapy, a choice that baffled his former colleagues. He was trading a lucrative career for late-night study sessions and immense student debt, but for the first time, he felt aligned.\n\nNow, at fifty, Gregory lives and works from his serene Noe Valley flat. His commute is a walk from his bedroom to his home office, a space filled with books and natural light. His days are structured by the needs of his clients, whom he sees almost exclusively via telehealth. He guides couples through infidelity and individuals through mid-life crises, drawing from a well of empathy deepened by his own past. His mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, a small ritual connecting him to his neighborhood.\n\nGregory\u2019s social circle is smaller now, but more authentic. He has a few close friends with whom he hikes the trails of Mount Sutro or shares quiet dinners. While he is not actively seeking a new partner, he is open to the possibility. His great aspiration is no longer a corner office but a quieter one: to help others navigate the difficult transitions he once faced alone. He finds profound satisfaction in his work, a quiet joy in knowing that his second act, born from wreckage, is one of healing."
