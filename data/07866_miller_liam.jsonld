He lives and works in the same building, a residential treatment facility for young adults. His life is a stark contrast to his upbringing in a comfortable Marin County suburb, where the biggest crisis was a missed soccer goal. He was a rudderless, affable kid who went to UC Santa Cruz to study Communications, more for the coastal vibe than any real passion.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. His older sister, always the brilliant and intense one, had a severe psychotic break, revealing a long-unmanaged bipolar disorder. Watching his family navigate the chaotic and often stigmatizing mental healthcare system shattered Liam\u2019s youthful naivete. He witnessed the profound impact of empathetic, skilled technicians and overwhelmed, burnt-out ones. He changed his major to Psychology the next semester.\n\nUpon graduating, he sought work that felt immediate and necessary. The Behavioral Health Technician position in San Francisco was perfect\u2014it offered a room, a small stipend, and an unparalleled education in human struggle. He moved into the facility, leaving his old life across the bridge.\n\nLiam\u2019s daily routine is a structured cycle of group check-ins, medication administration, de-escalation, and charting. He is the calm anchor in his residents' daily storms, the one who sits with them through panic attacks and celebrates a week of sobriety. His social life is limited to quiet beers with colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their work, and weekly video calls with his sister, now stable and in recovery.\n\nHe finds solace in early morning runs through the fog-drenched Golden Gate Park, a solitary ritual to process the emotional weight of his job. Though he lives in a vibrant city, his San Francisco is this small, intense pocket of the Inner Sunset. He dreams of going to graduate school to become a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). For now, he is learning on the front lines, his life dedicated to providing the stability he once took for granted, one difficult, meaningful day at a time."
