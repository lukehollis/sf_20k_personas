Raised in the seemingly idyllic suburbs of Marin County, her childhood was quietly defined by the unpredictable shadow of her older brother\u2019s struggle with schizoaffective disorder. While her parents focused on maintaining a veneer of normalcy, Natasha became a keen observer of human fragility, learning to navigate the emotional minefield of a family grappling with a crisis they couldn't name. This early, intimate exposure to mental illness became the silent, driving force of her future.\n\nRejecting a more lucrative path, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, determined to acquire the language and tools her family never had. Her early career was spent in the trenches of San Francisco General Hospital's psychiatric emergency services. There, she confronted the raw, systemic failures of the healthcare system, a reality that both hardened and galvanized her. The turning point came in her late thirties when, exhausted by institutional bureaucracy, she decided to build a practice on her own terms.\n\nShe used an inheritance to purchase a classic Edwardian in the Inner Sunset, converting the front parlor into a serene, private office. This decision eliminated her commute and allowed her to create a therapeutic sanctuary. Now, at 53, Natasha\u2019s days are a structured rhythm of compassion. Her mornings begin with a foggy walk with her beagle, Oscar, in Golden Gate Park, a ritual to center herself before seeing clients\u2014a mix of in-person and telehealth appointments.\n\nHer husband, an urban planner for the city, provides a stable, grounding presence. Their two children are grown and gone, leaving a quiet house filled with books and art. Natasha\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal; she sees the city not just as a landmark-dotted hub, but as a complex organism of individuals seeking connection and peace, much like her brother once did. Her deepest aspiration is no longer to change the system, but to provide profound, tangible healing to one person at a time, hoping to finally offer the understanding she wished she could have given her brother all those years ago."
