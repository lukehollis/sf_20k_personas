The son of hardworking immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, he grew up in Daly City, just over the San Francisco line. His world was one of tightly-knit family, the scent of his mother\u2019s cooking, and the exhaustion on his construction-worker father\u2019s face. The turning point came with his older brother, Marco, who fell into a devastating cycle of substance abuse in his late teens. David watched, helpless, as his parents struggled against a healthcare and legal system they didn\u2019t understand, one that saw Marco not as a kid needing help, but as a problem to be managed. That feeling of powerlessness ignited a quiet, lifelong fire in David.\n\nDriven by this experience, he pursued a bachelor\u2019s in Sociology at San Francisco State University, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. His early career was a trial by fire in community health clinics in the Mission and Bayview, dealing with acute crisis intervention, gang violence, and generational trauma. The work was vital but draining, and by his late thirties, he felt the familiar specter of burnout. This led him to his current role within a large healthcare system, specializing in long-term therapy. The shift to a telehealth model during the pandemic became permanent for him, explaining his zero-mile commute from his apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is a study in managed compassion. His days are structured around virtual sessions from a small, book-lined home office. He is a calm, steady presence for patients wrestling with depression, anxiety, and loss. He lives with his partner of twelve years, Elena, a high school art teacher. Their shared life is their sanctuary\u2014walks through the fog-dusted trails of Golden Gate Park, browsing the markets on Clement Street, and quiet evenings spent cooking together.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and layered. He mourns the working-class city of his youth but has carved out a peaceful existence in its current form. His aspirations are not for wealth or recognition, but for sustainability. He dreams of mentoring young Latino social workers, helping them navigate the demanding field without losing themselves. More than anything, he hopes to continue being a quiet bulwark for those in pain, honoring the memory of the brother he couldn\u2019t save by helping the countless others he can."
