The son of hardworking immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, he grew up in Daly City, just over the San Francisco line. His world was one of tightly-knit family, the scent of his mother\u2019s cooking, and the exhaustion on his construction-worker father\u2019s face. The turning point came with his older brother, Marco, who fell into a devastating cycle of substance abuse in his late teens. David watched, helpless, as his parents struggled against a healthcare and legal system they didn\u2019t understand, one that saw Marco not as a kid needing help, but as a problem to be managed. That feeling of powerlessness ignited a quiet, lifelong fire in David.\n\nDriven by this experience, he pursued a bachelor\u2019s in Sociology at San Francisco State University, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. His early career was a trial by fire in community health clinics in the Mission and Bayview, dealing with acute crisis intervention, gang violence, and generational trauma. The work was vital but draining, and by his late thirties, he felt the familiar specter of burnout. This led him to his current role within a large healthcare system, specializing in long-term therapy. The shift to a telehealth model during the pandemic became permanent for him, explaining his zero-mile commute from his apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is a study in managed compassion. His days are structured around virtual sessions from a small, book-lined home office. He is a calm, steady presence for patients wrestling with depression, anxiety, and loss. He lives with his partner of twelve years, Elena, a high school art teacher. Their shared life is their sanctuary\u2014walks through the fog-dusted trails of Golden Gate Park, browsing the markets on Clement Street, and quiet evenings spent cooking together.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and layered. He mourns the working-class city of his youth but has carved out a peaceful existence in its current form. His aspirations are not for wealth or recognition, but for sustainability. He dreams of mentoring young Latino social workers, helping them navigate the demanding field without losing themselves. More than anything, he hopes to continue being a quiet bulwark for those in pain, honoring the memory of the brother he couldn\u2019t save by helping the countless others he can."

A social worker, speaking in detached administrative terms, explained Marco\u2019s \u201coptions.\u201d David saw his father\u2019s confusion and his mother\u2019s quiet shame. In that moment, seeing his family shrink under the weight of a system that saw a case file, not a son, a silent vow formed inside him. He felt a hot, clarifying anger that gave him direction for the first time. He would learn the language of this system, not to join it, but to fight it from within.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the tight grip of a Guatemalan mother\u2019s hand on his arm in his first year at the Mission clinic, around age 26. She was terrified, navigating a child welfare scare with limited English. David, fluent in both the language of her home and the bureaucracy of the city, calmly translated and advocated for her. He stayed two hours past his shift. Seeing the relief wash over her face, he felt a tangible echo of his own family\u2019s panic. This was the first time his work felt like a true remedy, a small but powerful antidote to his own history of helplessness.\n\n3.\nJust a few months into dating Elena, he was 35 and on the edge of burnout. They were on her small balcony in the Sunset, and he finally spoke about Marco\u2014not the broad strokes, but the raw, painful details he rarely shared. Elena didn\u2019t offer platitudes or try to fix it; she just listened, her presence a quiet anchor in the fog. He realized then that with her, he didn't have to be the strong one. This profound feeling of being seen and held without judgment solidified their bond, creating the sanctuary he so desperately needed.\n\n4.\nOn a foggy Tuesday morning last year, he walked the trails near Spreckels Lake before his first session. The mist muted the city\u2019s noise, and he thought of his younger self, driven by a furious need for justice. The anger was still there, but it had softened into something more sustainable: a deep, quiet resolve to simply hold space for others\u2019 pain. He felt a sense of melancholy peace, an acceptance of the city he\u2019d lost and the life he\u2019d built. It was a peace he\u2019d learned to earn, not just find.\n\n5.\nLast winter, during a telehealth appointment, a young client, a student from the Excelsior, haltingly described the weight of his family\u2019s expectations and his deepening depression. David saw his brother, his cousins, and his own younger self in the young man\u2019s face on the screen. He didn't offer a rush of solutions, but a steady presence and a simple validation: \u201cThat sounds incredibly heavy.\u201d At that moment, he fully understood the power of his calmer, long-term work. This quiet act of witness felt more potent than any crisis averted in his frantic early career."
