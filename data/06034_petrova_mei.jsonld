They met in an English class in the Mission and built a life in the fog-drenched avenues of the Outer Richmond. Growing up, Mei\u2019s world was a blend of borscht and congee, defined by her parents' shared belief in practicality over passion. They instilled in her a deep sense of responsibility and a cautious approach to life, emphasizing stability above all else.\n\nThis upbringing guided her educational journey. While friends pursued four-year degrees and artistic dreams, Mei opted for an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College of San Francisco. It was a direct, no-fuss path to a steady job. She found her footing in real estate, not out of any love for architecture, but for its tangible, problem-solving nature. Starting as a receptionist, her reliability and quiet competence saw her promoted to a Property Management Assistant.\n\nA key turning point was her father's sudden death five years ago. The event solidified her path, reinforcing the need to be the dependable bedrock for her now-widowed mother. She accepted her current role, which came with a significant perk: a rent-reduced one-bedroom apartment in a Hayes Valley building she helps manage. This explains her zero-mile commute; her work and home are the same. She is a permanent fixture, the person tenants text at 10 PM about a leaky faucet or a noise complaint.\n\nHer current life is a paradox of connection and isolation. She knows the intimate details of dozens of people's lives but rarely has time for her own. Her daily routine involves a morning walk with her rescue terrier, Gus, followed by a stream of emails, maintenance calls, and apartment showings. Social life is a snatched coffee with a friend or a quiet evening watching a movie with her mom.\n\nAt 29, Mei dreams of quiet anonymity. Her ultimate aspiration isn't a high-powered career but to buy a small, simple condo in a quiet neighborhood like Glen Park\u2014a place that is just a home, not also an office. She hopes to one day travel to Harbin and Vladivostok, to see the cities her parents left behind and finally understand the pieces of her identity that exist beyond the 49 square miles of San Francisco."
