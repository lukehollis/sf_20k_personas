Raised in Bend, Oregon, he was the son of a meticulous carpenter father and a pragmatic elementary school teacher mother. His childhood was spent not in front of screens, but in his father\u2019s workshop, disassembling old lawnmowers and building elaborate Lego contraptions. A pivotal moment came at fifteen when a faulty space heater caused a fire that destroyed the workshop. Witnessing his father\u2019s life's work turn to ash instilled in Caleb a deep-seated determination to create things that were not just innovative, but also safe and enduring.\n\nThis drive propelled him to the University of Washington for his mechanical engineering degree, where he excelled. He stayed for his Master's, focusing on sustainable manufacturing and robotics, fascinated by creating efficient systems that minimized waste. While his peers were drawn to software, Caleb remained loyal to the tangible world. The most promising opportunities for hardware innovation were in the Bay Area, and upon graduating, he accepted a coveted role as a Product Development Engineer at a manufacturing firm in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood.\n\nNow, Caleb\u2019s life is a study in practical efficiency. He lives in a small but functional apartment in the Mission, a perfect 2.5-mile bike ride from his office. His days are spent in a state-of-the-art lab, running simulations and creating prototypes for next-generation consumer electronics. Evenings are often spent at Dogpatch Boulders with his girlfriend, Maya, a graphic designer he met through a mutual friend, or sketching ideas for custom, ultra-durable bike components in his notebook.\n\nWhile he enjoys his job, Caleb views it as a crucial learning phase. His ultimate dream is to launch his own company dedicated to creating repairable, long-lasting outdoor gear\u2014a direct tribute to the lessons learned from his father and the fire. For Caleb, San Francisco isn't about chasing venture capital fame; it's the ultimate workshop, providing the tools, connections, and inspiration to one day build a legacy that lasts."

He watched his dad sift through the wreckage, his face a stoic mask, until his hand closed around a single, warped steel chisel\u2014its wooden handle gone. His father didn\u2019t weep; he just held it, weighing the loss. In that silent moment, Caleb felt a resolve harden in his chest: he would build things that could withstand the fire, things that would endure.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in the UW robotics lab, fueled by stale coffee and frustration. For weeks, the sorting arm he designed for his sustainable manufacturing project had been clumsy, inefficient. Then, after one last tweak to a gear's torque limit, it moved. The motion was silent, fluid, and perfectly precise. Watching the arm flawlessly sort components, he felt a profound, quiet thrill. It was the moment he knew he'd never be satisfied with code; he needed to feel the satisfaction of a physical system clicking into perfect place.\n\n3.\nHis first morning commute in San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a bike ride; it was a revelation. Pedaling from his Mission apartment, he felt the city unfold as a series of interconnected systems: the graded streets, the flow of traffic, the industrial skeleton of Dogpatch rising to meet him. Arriving at the lab, sweaty and energized, he didn't feel like a new employee. He felt like he had just found his place on a massive, intricate, and perfectly designed circuit board.\n\n4.\nHe and Maya were at Dogpatch Boulders. She was stuck on a difficult problem, her designer's eye seeing only shapes, not leverage. Instead of just giving her the sequence, he talked her through the physics of it\u2014the balance, the center of gravity, the force. Her eyes lit up with understanding. She sent the route on her next try, and the smile she gave him wasn't just happy; it was a look of shared language. He realized their minds worked the same way, just with different materials.\n\n5.\nA plastic buckle on his high-end backpack snapped on a trail in the Marin Headlands. The frustration was immediate, followed by a familiar resourcefulness as he MacGyvered a fix with a spare strap. Sitting on the ridge, looking back at the Golden Gate Bridge, the path forward became blindingly clear. His future wasn't just about making \"durable\" things. It was about making things that could be fixed on a trail, miles from anywhere. It was about building for resilience, not replacement. His company finally had its soul."
