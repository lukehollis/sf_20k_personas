The son of Indian immigrants who owned a small neighborhood market, he was meant to be their American dream manifest. Growing up, he absorbed his parents\u2019 work ethic but craved a different path, one filled with color and design. He was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling in the graphic design program at SF State, and for two exhilarating years, his future felt boundless.\n\nThe turning point came swiftly and without warning. His father suffered a major heart attack, leaving him unable to manage the physical demands of the family store. With his mother overwhelmed, Liam made the only choice he felt he could: he dropped out of school to run the market. The vibrant world of design studios was replaced by the predictable rhythm of stocking shelves, working the register, and managing inventory.\n\nNow 26, Liam\u2019s life is a study in routine. His commute is a walk down the stairs from the small apartment above the shop where he lives. He knows his customers by name, their coffee orders memorized, their family dramas absorbed in brief snippets over the counter. He is a quiet, observant fixture of the neighborhood, well-liked but known by few. His social life exists in these fleeting interactions and occasional late-night calls with a college friend who now works at a tech firm downtown\u2014a painful reminder of the life he left behind.\n\nThough his days are monotonous, Liam\u2019s dreams persist. Hidden beneath the register is a sketchbook filled with intricate logos, character designs, and surrealist landscapes of a San Francisco he rarely explores. He hopes his father\u2019s health will one day improve enough for his parents to sell the store. His ultimate dream is simple yet feels impossibly distant: to re-enroll in school, finish his degree, and finally design a life of his own, beyond the familiar fog and the four walls of the family business."

His professor, a stern woman with paint on her glasses, had projected his poster design for the whole class to see. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, pointing to his work, \u201cis what happens when instinct and theory align.\u201d A hot flush of pride bloomed in his chest\u2014a feeling of being seen, of being on the correct path. It was the last time he felt his future was a certainty. This memory, from when he was 19, is his touchstone for what he lost.\n\n2.\nThe phone call came while he was in the SF State library, studying for midterms. His mother\u2019s voice was a thin, panicked thread of Hindi, a language reserved for emergencies. He doesn\u2019t remember the exact words, just the sudden, crushing silence that followed. The world of color theory and deadlines dissolved, replaced by the stark, terrifying image of his father in a hospital bed. At 20, he learned that duty had a weight that could anchor a dream to the ground, and he chose to bear it without question.\n\n3.\nJust last winter, Mrs. Gable came in, her eyes red-rimmed because her cat had gone missing. Liam didn't say much. He just turned the coffee machine back on, made her a latte on the house, and listened. He is the quiet keeper of the neighborhood\u2019s small griefs and fleeting joys. The interaction solidified his role: a permanent, caring fixture in their lives, while his own hopes remained completely invisible to them. He knows their stories, but they don't know his.\n\n4.\nA few months ago, while scrolling on his phone behind the counter, he saw a post from his friend Mark. It was a screenshot of an app Mark had designed for his tech firm, and it was beautiful\u2014sleek, intuitive, and alive. A sharp, complicated ache hit him: immense pride for his friend, followed by a bitter wave of personal loss. It made his own life feel small and colorless. The memory is a constant, painful reminder of the world that moves on without him, just a few miles downtown.\n\n5.\nLate last Tuesday, long after he\u2019d locked the shop door, he sat on a milk crate in the stockroom. He pulled out his sketchbook and drew the Richmond fog not as a grey blanket, but as a sea of swirling, iridescent creatures. In the silent, dusty darkness, surrounded by boxes of inventory, he felt a spark of defiance. This secret act, known only to him, is his most vital possession. It\u2019s the proof that the artist inside him hasn\u2019t died, just gone into hiding, waiting."
