Born in Fremont to Gujarati immigrant parents who ran a small but beloved Indian eatery, her childhood was a whirlwind of schoolwork and folding samosas. Her parents, having sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned a future for Aaliyah in medicine or engineering\u2014a stable, respectable path far from the grueling hours of the food industry.\n\nTo please them, she enrolled in pre-med at San Jose State, but her heart wasn't in it. The sterile labs felt alien compared to the vibrant chaos of a kitchen. It was there she met Mark Davis, a charismatic art student who saw the fire in her that her family tried to temper. At 20, she made her first definitive choice for herself: she dropped out of college, married Mark, and moved with him to a cramped Nob Hill apartment in San Francisco, embracing the city as a symbol of her newfound freedom.\n\nWhile Mark chased his artistic muse, Aaliyah, pragmatic and hardworking, found her footing in the world she knew best: restaurants. She started as a server, her innate grace and understanding of hospitality earning her quick promotions. She rose through the ranks\u2014hostess, bartender, assistant manager\u2014her career accelerating while her marriage slowly unraveled under the weight of financial strain and divergent dreams. Their divorce in her late thirties was a quiet heartbreak, leaving her alone but more resolved than ever.\n\nNow 47, Aaliyah is the unflappable manager of a bustling, upscale bistro in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is the envy of the city; she lives in the cozy one-bedroom apartment directly above the restaurant, a perk of her unwavering dedication. Her days start with the rumble of delivery trucks and end long after the last dessert is served. Her staff\u2014a motley crew of aspiring artists, immigrants, and career servers\u2014has become her chosen family. San Francisco is no longer a symbol of escape, but the foundation of a life she built entirely on her own terms. While a quiet dream of one day owning her own small place lingers, her greatest aspiration is simpler: to see the pride in her parents\u2019 eyes, not for the doctor she never became, but for the formidable woman she is."
