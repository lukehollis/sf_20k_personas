His home and workshop are one and the same: a sprawling, high-ceilinged live/work loft in Dogpatch, where sparks from his grinder often dust the concrete floor just yards from his kitchen.\n\nBorn in Vallejo to a Filipino mother and an Irish-American father who served as a mechanic in the Navy, Kevin\u2019s upbringing was a blend of cultures, grounded in working-class pragmatism. He was never one for books; his attention was always captured by how things fit together. In high school, shop class was his sanctuary. He later earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Welding Technology from a local community college, seeing it as a ticket to a steady, hands-on trade.\n\nFor years, he worked industrial jobs, repairing ship hulls and welding structural steel. The work was honest but soulless. The turning point came when a friend, an aspiring sculptor, asked for help building the metal armature for a massive installation destined for Burning Man. Out on the playa, seeing people climb on and interact with something he had helped create from raw metal, Kevin felt a profound sense of purpose he\u2019d never known.\n\nHe saved up, moved to San Francisco, and slowly built a reputation as the go-to fabricator for artists with ambitious, seemingly impossible visions. He is not the visionary, but the wizard who makes the vision a physical reality. His days are a blur of blueprints, TIG welding, and metal finishing.\n\nAt 39, his social life is woven into his work. His friends are the artists, engineers, and fellow makers who populate the city's warehouses. Relationships have been challenging; his life is dictated by project deadlines, not a 9-to-5 schedule. His connection to San Francisco is to its industrial past and its creative, non-conformist soul. He finds beauty in the rusted cranes at the port and the old brick of his own building. Kevin's dream isn't to be the famous artist, but to be the master craftsman behind a landmark piece of public art\u2014a sculpture that becomes a permanent, beloved part of the city skyline, a silent testament to the man who built it."
