Her father, an immigrant chef from the Philippines, filled their home with the scent of adobo and garlic rice, while her Irish-American mother, a public librarian, filled it with books and stories. This blend of culinary artistry and curated knowledge became the foundation of Alani\u2019s world. Weekend trips on the MUNI into San Francisco were rituals; while her father explored markets in the Mission, her mother would take her to the de Young or the Asian Art Museum, teaching her that objects could tell stories just as powerfully as words.\n\nThis upbringing led her to a degree in Art History at UC Santa Cruz, followed by a prestigious graduate program in Museum Studies at New York University. The East Coast sharpened her ambition, but the Bay Area was always home. She returned to San Francisco and began the steady climb from unpaid intern to curatorial assistant, and finally, to her current role as Exhibitions Director at a contemporary arts center in SoMA.\n\nA key turning point in her career was curating \"Mesa,\" an exhibition exploring the intersection of food, migration, and identity in California. It was a deeply personal project, a tribute to her father\u2019s journey and the flavors of her childhood. The exhibition\u2019s success solidified her reputation as a director with a unique, narrative-driven vision.\n\nNow at 39, Alani lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a walk in Golden Gate Park and a 2.8-mile bus ride to work, where she manages budgets, artists, and deadlines. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow creatives\u2014chefs, designers, and writers\u2014who gather for elaborate dinner parties and gallery openings. Though fulfilled in her career, Alani dreams of one day spearheading a major international exhibition for the Venice Biennale. More quietly, she aspires to create a digital archive of Filipino-American culinary traditions, ensuring the stories her father told through food are never forgotten. For Alani, San Francisco is not just a city; it is the gallery that holds every piece of her life."

Alani could almost smell the smoke from her father's wok just a few blocks away in a Mission market. In that moment, she understood that a story didn\u2019t just live in a book; it could be held, fired in a kiln, and placed in a gallery. It was the first piece she ever curated in her mind.\n\n2.\nAt 26, she was an unpaid intern, locking up the gallery late on a rainy SoMA night. The bus wouldn't come for 20 minutes, and the expensive NYU degree felt like a foolish debt. She almost called her parents to admit defeat. Instead, she stared at a sculpture gleaming under the streetlights and vowed to one day be the one choosing what stood in that light. That cold, damp wait on the corner of Howard and 3rd forged a resilience no prestigious program ever could.\n\n3.\nThe opening night of \"Mesa\" was a blur of chatter, but Alani only saw her father. He stood before a video installation of hands rolling lumpia, his own chef's hands clasped behind his back. He didn't speak, but she saw the faintest glisten in his eyes. In that silent moment of recognition, she hadn't just curated a successful exhibition; she had honored his entire journey from a Philippine kitchen to a San Francisco gallery. It was the proudest moment of her life.\n\n4.\nJust last year, her Inner Richmond apartment was overflowing for a dinner party. A novelist argued playfully with a graphic designer over a pot of her father\u2019s sinigang, which she\u2019d finally perfected. The laughter, the steam on the windows, the mix of creativity and food\u2014it was the perfect synthesis of her parents. She realized she hadn\u2019t just found a career in SF; she had built a chosen family whose currency was connection, her own living exhibition.\n\n5.\nOn a recent phone call, her father didn\u2019t ask about work; he meticulously described how to properly toast garlic for sinangag, worried she'd forget the subtleties. The call wasn't about a recipe; it was about legacy. Hanging up, looking out at the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park, the idea for the digital archive crystallized. It wasn't about art history, but heart history. This project, she knew, would be more important than any biennale."
