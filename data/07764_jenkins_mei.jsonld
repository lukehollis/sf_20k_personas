            "value": "Mei Lin Jenkins is a product of two worlds, a fact reflected in her very name. Born in Walnut Creek to a pragmatic American engineer father and a mother who had immigrated from Guangzhou, Mei\u2019s childhood was a quiet negotiation between cultures. Her mother, homesick but resilient, treated her few possessions from China\u2014faded photographs, brittle letters, a silk qipao\u2014with a quiet reverence. From her, Mei learned that objects were not just things, but vessels of memory and identity.\n\nThis early lesson shaped her academic path. After earning a B.A. in Art History from UC Santa Cruz, she felt adrift. The turning point came with her mother\u2019s passing. While sorting through a lifetime of carefully preserved belongings, Mei realized her true calling was not just to study art, but to save the stories it held. She enrolled at UCLA, earning a Master of Library and Information Science with a focus on archival studies, mastering the tools to protect fragile histories.\n\nFor the past decade, she has worked as a Digital Collections Archivist, currently for the Asian Art Museum. The pandemic shifted her role to be fully remote, a change she embraced. Her 0.0-mile commute terminates at a standing desk in the second bedroom of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are a meticulous, solitary dance: digitizing delicate scrolls, cataloging photo negatives of early Chinatown, and giving digital immortality to artifacts that might otherwise crumble to dust.\n\nMei\u2019s life is deliberately curated. She is single, having amicably ended a long-term relationship years ago, and prefers a small circle of close friends. Her mornings begin with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, and lunch is often takeout from a favorite Clement Street dumpling house. Her connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; she knows the rhythm of her neighborhood intimately.\n\nHer greatest aspiration is to bridge her professional skills with her personal history. She dreams of meticulously scanning every one of her mother\u2019s photographs and letters, creating a private digital archive for her family. Ultimately, she hopes to travel to her mother\u2019s village near Guangzhou, armed with these digital ghosts, to see the world her mother left behind and, in doing so, fully piece together her own."
