Born in Leningrad just before the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, she spent her first years in a world of stark grey utility. Her family, engineers who saw opportunity in the West, immigrated to Sacramento when she was ten. While her parents wrestled with a new language and culture, Anastasia found refuge in the logic of maps and the clear, predictable lines of city grids\u2014a stark contrast to the uncertainties of her new life.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Urban Planning. She was captivated not by grand architecture, but by the unseen arteries of a city: the bus routes, light rail lines, and bike lanes that dictate its rhythm. Upon graduating, she accepted a position with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), seeing it as a chance to impose a quiet order on a city famous for its beautiful chaos.\n\nHer career progressed steadily, but her personal life hit a turning point in her mid-thirties with a quiet, amicable divorce. The experience, while painful, solidified her independence. She sold the condo she\u2019d shared with her ex-husband in the Marina and found a small apartment for herself in the Inner Sunset. It was there she truly rooted herself in the city, no longer as part of a couple, but as an individual.\n\nNow 45, Anastasia\u2019s life is defined by a serene routine. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her home office, a space with meticulously organized maps and data charts. Her days are spent poring over traffic flow models and public feedback, seeking elegant solutions to complex urban problems. Mornings begin with a walk in Golden Gate Park, feeling the cool fog on her face, before grabbing a coffee from her favorite 9th Avenue cafe. Her social life is small but meaningful: a bi-weekly book club with other professional women and weekend hikes in Marin with a former colleague.\n\nAnastasia\u2019s dream is to see one of her major projects\u2014a proposed Geary Street light rail expansion\u2014break ground. It\u2019s a legacy of efficiency she wants to leave for her adopted home. For herself, she hopes for contentment and, one day, to take a trip on the Trans-Siberian Railway, tracing a line back to a past she has long since redesigned."
