The only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, David spent his childhood stocking shelves and translating for customers at his parents\u2019 small neighborhood grocery store. He watched them work tirelessly, their dreams focused on providing him with the stability they never had.\n\nThe turning point came during his freshman year at UC Davis. His grandmother, who spoke only Cantonese, suffered a preventable health crisis due to a misunderstood prescription. Navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system on her behalf, David witnessed firsthand the cultural and linguistic barriers that left the most vulnerable behind. The experience was a revelation, steering him away from a more lucrative business path and toward a Bachelor\u2019s in Public Health. His mission was no longer about personal wealth, but community wellness.\n\nAfter graduation, he returned to San Francisco, taking a position with a non-profit health clinic in Chinatown. Now 33, David is a Senior Community Health Educator. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his immersion in the community; he lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment above a bustling bakery, just a three-minute walk from the clinic. His days are a blend of hosting workshops on preventative care, conducting outreach in Cantonese and Mandarin, and ensuring elderly residents have access to translation services for their medical appointments.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of his neighborhood. He has a standing weekly dim sum lunch with his retired parents and shares his life with his partner, Sarah, a public school teacher who understands his purpose-driven path. He isn\u2019t chasing a tech fortune or a corner office. David\u2019s dream is to secure funding for a mobile health unit to reach homebound seniors. For him, the soul of San Francisco isn\u2019t in its skyline, but in the resilience of its communities, and he has dedicated his life to preserving it, one person at a time."
