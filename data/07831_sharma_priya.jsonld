Born in Los Angeles to a young Colombian mother who couldn't care for her, she was adopted by the Sharmas, a loving Indian-American couple who were both engineers. Raised in Fremont, her childhood was a unique blend of experiences: learning cumbia from a neighbor\u2019s party on one side of the street and the intricate steps of Garba from her family on the other. This dual identity, initially confusing, shaped her into an exceptionally empathetic and observant person.\n\nFeeling a need for structure amidst her complex identity, Priya found solace in the clean logic of numbers. She pursued an undergraduate degree in mathematics, followed by a Master's in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley. Her analytical mind thrived in the burgeoning tech world, and she steadily climbed the ranks from a junior analyst to her current role as a Data Analytics Manager. Her career provided the stability and intellectual challenge she craved.\n\nA major turning point came in her early thirties when, after years of contemplation, she connected with her birth mother. The meeting was brief and emotionally charged, offering answers but not a simple reunion. It gave Priya peace, allowing her to fully embrace the identity she had forged for herself\u2014a Latina woman raised in a South Asian home, a proud product of California\u2019s cultural crossroads.\n\nNow at 41, Priya lives a deliberately curated life in her Noe Valley apartment. The 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a walk to a local caf\u00e9 before settling into her home office, her bay window overlooking the quiet street. She manages a remote team, her leadership style defined by the same empathy that marks her personal life. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of friends who gather for elaborate dinners that might feature her mother\u2019s chicken biryani one week and her own attempt at arepas the next. Her San Francisco is one of neighborhood intimacy, a city whose embrace of diversity mirrors her own story. Her future aspirations aren\u2019t about career climbs, but about connection\u2014mentoring young women of color in tech and one day traveling through both Colombia and India, not to find herself, but to celebrate the pieces that made her whole."
