Their dedication to service was the air she breathed, shaping her worldview and instilling a profound sense of responsibility. She saw firsthand how systems could either uplift or fail a community, which propelled her to San Jose State University to earn a degree in Public Health.\n\nHer early career in the mid-90s was spent in non-profits, writing grants and running outreach programs. The turning point came during the first dot-com boom. While many chased stock options, Imani saw a different kind of potential: using technology to scale public health initiatives. She pivoted, learning the language of systems and data, and skillfully bridged the gap between community health needs and technological solutions. This foresight carved out her niche in Health IT. It was in San Francisco, during a collaborative project, that she met Rohan Sharma, a kind-hearted software engineer. They married and built a life together, a partnership of shared values and mutual respect until his sudden passing from a heart attack a decade ago.\n\nNow 53, Imani is a respected Senior Health IT Project Manager, leading teams that develop software for healthcare and social assistance programs. Her work is her mission. She lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its grounded, community feel. Her daily routine is anchored by the rhythmic rumble of the N Judah Muni line, which carries her the 5.8 miles to her downtown office.\n\nWeekends are for herself: long walks through the park, browsing the Clement Street Farmers' Market, and hosting small dinners for a close-knit circle of friends. Though financially secure, she lives simply, preferring to invest in experiences and her community. Imani\u2019s quiet dream is to transition from her corporate role into consulting for non-profits, mentoring a new generation of women of color in health and tech. She has found her purpose not in grand gestures, but in the steady, focused work of building stronger, healthier systems, one project at a time."

She watched her mother, a nurse, not just treat a baby's fever but quietly arrange a grocery delivery for the panicked young mom. It wasn't just medicine; it was a system of care, of seeing the whole person. That day, Imani understood that true health was built on dignity and support. It was a blueprint for her life\u2019s work, planted in her by the quiet competence of her mother's care.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998, and Imani was 28, hunched over a spreadsheet in a stuffy non-profit office. She wasn't envious of the dot-com boom\u2019s stock options; she was frustrated by the inefficiency of her own vital work. A thought struck her with absolute clarity: the code and systems her peers were chasing for wealth could revolutionize community outreach, reaching thousands instead of dozens. That moment of intense frustration wasn't about wanting more money, but more impact. It forged her new path, the bridge between technology and public health she still walks today.\n\n3.\nShe didn't fall for Rohan over a candlelit dinner, but over lukewarm coffee at 2 AM in a downtown conference room. They were debugging a patient portal, and he stopped coding to truly listen as she explained the user experience from a community health perspective. He didn't just hear her; he understood the mission behind the mechanics. In his quiet focus and shared purpose, she felt seen not just as a colleague, but as a partner. It was the profoundly comforting feeling of coming home, years before they ever shared one.\n\n4.\nThe morning after Rohan\u2019s heart attack, Imani stood frozen in their Inner Sunset apartment. The familiar rumble of the N Judah turning onto Irving Street\u2014a sound that had always been the backdrop to their shared life\u2014felt alien and sharp. It was a rhythm without its partner. The world kept moving, but hers had fractured. In that hollow silence, pierced by the city\u2019s unwavering pulse, she learned the profound weight of solitude. That apartment, once their sanctuary, became her anchor, tethering her to his memory and her own survival.\n\n5.\nLast spring, at the Clement Street Farmers' Market, she bought kale from a young woman who mentioned she was studying data science but wanted to work in food justice. Seeing that same spark in the woman\u2019s eyes\u2014that desire to connect community need with new tools\u2014was like looking in a mirror across time. Imani gave her card, a simple gesture that crystallized her future. It was time to stop just building the systems and start building up the people, especially the young women of color, who would lead them next."
