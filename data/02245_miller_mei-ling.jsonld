Born in Walnut Creek to a pragmatic Caucasian father, an aerospace engineer, and a first-generation Chinese-American mother who instilled in her a deep sense of community responsibility, Mei-Ling grew up navigating two cultural worlds. This duality shaped her path, blending her father\u2019s analytical mindset with her mother\u2019s compassionate worldview.\n\nDriven by a desire to understand and improve societal systems, she pursued a Master\u2019s in Public Policy on the East Coast. Her early career was spent in the thick of Washington D.C., analyzing healthcare legislation for a nonprofit. However, she grew disillusioned with the slow, impersonal nature of federal policy. A key turning point came after a hard-fought public health initiative she championed was dismantled by political maneuvering. Feeling burnt out and disconnected from the people she aimed to serve, she moved to San Francisco in her early thirties, seeking work with more direct community impact.\n\nShe found her calling within a large Bay Area healthcare provider. As a Public Health Program Manager, Mei-Ling designs and oversees initiatives targeting San Francisco's most vulnerable populations\u2014from mobile vaccination clinics in the Bayview to nutrition security programs for seniors in the Tenderloin. The COVID-19 pandemic was the defining challenge of her career, a grueling period that solidified her commitment and normalized her current work-from-home reality.\n\nToday, her life unfolds from her cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute affords her a quiet morning ritual: tea, a review of community health data, and gazing at the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park. Her days are a mix of intense Zoom strategy sessions and deep-focus work. She remains amicably divorced from her college sweetheart, David Miller, and has built a vibrant \u201cchosen family\u201d of friends with whom she hikes, explores Clement Street\u2019s restaurants, and discusses city politics.\n\nAt 48, Mei-Ling\u2019s ambition is not for promotion, but for legacy. She dreams of developing a public health program so successful it becomes a national model. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she doesn't just live in the city, she actively works to heal it, one well-managed program at a time."
