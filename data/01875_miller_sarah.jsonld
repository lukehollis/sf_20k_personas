Raised in a quiet, tree-lined suburb of Portland, Oregon, she was the practical daughter of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist. Her early passion wasn't code, but composition. She earned a Bachelor's degree in Art History from the University of Oregon, dreaming of a life spent curating exhibits in world-class museums.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco in her early twenties, following that dream and a college boyfriend who had landed a software engineering job. The relationship fizzled, but the city\u2019s energy captivated her. The reality of a curator\u2019s salary versus the city\u2019s cost of living, however, was a stark awakening. Needing to pay rent, she took a temporary job as a receptionist at a small, chaotic dot-com startup. It was there she discovered her true talent: imposing a gentle, unshakable order on creative chaos. She was the one who remembered birthdays, wrangled impossible schedules, and sourced the perfect espresso machine. Her rise from receptionist to her current role as Senior Office Manager was a natural progression, a testament to her competence and unflappable demeanor.\n\nNow 42, Sarah lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a benefit of her long tenure in the city. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is deeply woven into her neighborhood. Her days begin not with a frantic BART ride, but a foggy walk in Golden Gate Park with her rescue beagle, Clementine. From her small home office, she manages the logistics of a fully remote tech company\u2014a digital shepherd to a flock of engineers scattered across time zones.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle, centered around a book club of women from wildly different professions. Though her career is in tech, her heart still belongs to the arts. Her dream is to one day leave the corporate world and use her savings to open a small, independent gallery or art consultancy firm, finally bridging the gap between the life she built and the one she once imagined."
