Born in South Korea as Dae-hyun, he was adopted as an infant by a loving, Caucasian-American couple, the Millers, and raised in the foggy avenues of the nearby Sunset District. His childhood was a comfortable but slightly dissonant experience; he was David Miller, son of teachers, who loved skateboarding and Giants baseball, yet his face in the mirror always set him apart in his predominantly white and Irish-American circle of friends.\n\nHis academic journey was short-lived. A restless year at San Francisco City College, studying general education with no clear goal, confirmed his disdain for structured academia. He craved tangible work. At 20, he took a job as a stock clerk at Clement Street Hardware, a dusty, legacy institution run by an aging owner, Mr. Henderson. David discovered a surprising passion not for the nuts and bolts themselves, but for the community they served. He enjoyed solving a neighbor's plumbing dilemma or helping a family pick out the right paint for a new nursery.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade later when Mr. Henderson retired. Seeing David\u2019s dedication, he offered him the manager position and the lease on the small apartment above the shop. David accepted without hesitation. This decision cemented his life\u2019s path. His commute became a walk down a single flight of stairs.\n\nNow 43, David is a fixture of the neighborhood. His daily routine is a comforting ritual: coffee from the corner bakery, opening the shop\u2019s roll-down gate, the smell of sawdust and machine oil, and the parade of familiar faces. His social life is woven into his work; the contractors, elderly residents, and young couples who frequent the store are his de-facto family. While he has a few close friends, his life is largely solitary.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is that of an anchor in a sea of change. He is a remnant of a more grounded, neighborhood-focused city. His dream isn\u2019t wealth or fame, but simply to keep the hardware store afloat against the tide of online retailers. A quieter, more personal hope is to one day visit Seoul, not to find his birth parents, but to connect with the part of his identity he has only ever seen in the faces of his customers."

            "value": "1.\nHe was ten, sitting on the bleachers at a Sunset Rec baseball game. His friend Mike\u2019s little brother tugged on his sleeve. \"Why don't your mom and dad look like you?\" The question wasn't mean, just curious, but it landed like a stone in his stomach. For the first time, he saw his loving family through an outsider\u2019s eyes. It was a quiet, internal splintering, the moment he realized his reflection told a different story than the one he was living. He just shrugged and focused on the game.\n\n2.\nHe was 22, still just the stock boy. Mrs. Chen, a tiny woman who lived down the block, came in, frantic about a leaky sink. David didn't just sell her a washer; he sketched the repair on a napkin. Her relief was palpable, a gratitude far weightier than the 50-cent part. In that moment, he understood the job wasn't about inventory or profit. It was about holding the neighborhood together, one small fix at a time. It felt more real and purposeful than any college lecture ever had.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the smell of old coffee and sawdust in Mr. Henderson\u2019s back office. He was 30. \"I'm retiring, David. The store... and the flat upstairs... they should be yours.\" The words weren\u2019t a question, but a statement of fact. David felt a decade of aimless restlessness dissolve. It wasn't ambition he felt, but a profound sense of arrival. His entire world exhaled, settling into the space of a single city block. He just nodded, unable to find the words to say thank you.\n\n4.\nJust last year, a young tech couple came in looking lost, staring at a viral DIY video on their phone. David listened, then calmly walked them through the proper way to patch plaster, a skill he\u2019d taught dozens of residents before them. He saw their digital-age anxiety melt into genuine confidence. In that exchange, he felt his own significance. He wasn\u2019t just selling supplies; he was the keeper of the neighborhood\u2019s unwritten manual, a constant in a city that never stopped changing.\n\n5.\nHe was around 38. A family came in for paint, the parents speaking to their young son in gentle, melodic Korean. As the father knelt to look his son in the eyes, David saw a familiar likeness he had only ever known from his own mirror. It wasn't a painful longing for what was lost, but a quiet, magnetic pull toward an unknown context. It was then the thought of Seoul solidified from a vague idea into a gentle, persistent hope\u2014not to find people, but a place."
