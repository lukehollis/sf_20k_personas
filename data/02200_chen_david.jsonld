Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he is the only son of immigrant parents who ran a small dry-cleaning business. They envisioned a stable future for him, one built on a prestigious degree and a corner office. David obliged, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration from UC Davis, and dutifully entered the corporate world as a junior financial analyst.\n\nThe work was soul-crushing. The predictable rhythm of spreadsheets and quarterly reports felt alien compared to the constant, tangible industry of his parents' shop. After three years, a wave of corporate downsizing became his unexpected liberation. Adrift, he took a server job at a bustling downtown restaurant simply to pay his rent. To his surprise, he thrived in the controlled chaos. He had a natural talent for anticipating needs, defusing tension, and making people feel cared for. He discovered a passion not just for food, but for the intricate dance of hospitality.\n\nHis ascent was swift: from server to shift lead, then to assistant manager at a different establishment. Now, at 37, he manages a sleek, high-volume restaurant located on the ground floor of a modern SoMa condominium complex. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his all-encompassing career; he lives in a small unit on the fifth floor of the same building.\n\nHis days are a blur of inventory checks, staff scheduling, and smoothing over the inevitable crises of a busy service. His social life is deeply entwined with his work, consisting of after-shift drinks with his kitchen crew and bartenders, who have become his surrogate family. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his demanding hours. While he feels a deep, native's connection to San Francisco, his current experience of it is often limited to his immediate neighborhood.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is quiet but persistent. Every paycheck, a portion is set aside for a future he can taste: a small, 30-seat restaurant of his own, perhaps back in the Sunset. It would be a place that serves the Cantonese comfort food of his childhood, elevated with modern technique\u2014a tribute to his parents' hard work, but built entirely on his own terms."
