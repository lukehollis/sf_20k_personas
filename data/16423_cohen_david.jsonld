Born in 1977, he was adopted at eight months old by a loving Jewish couple in Berkeley\u2014a sociology professor father and a social worker mother. Growing up as an Asian child named David Cohen in the intellectually vibrant but culturally specific world of 1980s Berkeley, he developed a keen awareness of systems, identity, and how things fit together\u2014or didn't. His home was filled with books, debates, and a deep-seated value for social betterment.\n\nThis ethos guided his educational journey. While volunteering at a community clinic during his time at UC Davis, he grew fascinated not by the medicine itself, but by the chaotic tangle of paper records that hindered patient care. He saw a problem that could be solved with logic and technology. He pivoted to Health Informatics, seeing it as a modern form of social work: creating order to improve lives.\n\nHis career was a steady, deliberate climb. He started as a data analyst at a hospital in the East Bay before being recruited by one of San Francisco's large university health systems. Now, as Director of Health Information Systems, he doesn't create disruptive apps; he ensures the vast digital infrastructure that underpins student health services, patient records, and research data is secure, efficient, and humane.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is one of structured routine. From his quiet Noe Valley apartment, he takes the MUNI L-Taraval line 3.8 miles to his office near Parnassus Heights. He is a familiar face at his neighborhood bakery. Though he had a significant long-term relationship that ended in his late thirties, he is currently single. His social life revolves around a small, loyal group of friends and weekly dinners with his now-retired parents in Berkeley. A turning point was a solo trip to South Korea ten years ago, not to find his birth family, but to connect with the culture of his origin. It didn't change who he was, but it added a quiet, foundational layer to his identity.\n\nHis aspirations are as practical as his profession. David dreams of implementing a fully integrated, patient-centric data system across the university's entire network. Personally, he hopes to find a lasting partnership and, perhaps, travel more\u2014this time, with someone by his side. He is a man who found his place not by conforming, but by building the systems that allow others to feel seen and cared for, a digital reflection of the upbringing he was given."

He saw his parents at the dinner table debating policy, his mother\u2019s hand on his shoulder. His name wasn\u2019t a contradiction; it was the label for the system they had built, one made of love and intellectual rigor. It was the moment he stopped seeing his identity as a puzzle and started seeing it as a structure, intentionally and beautifully designed.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe remembers the smell of old paper in the community clinic\u2019s basement. He was twenty, a pre-med volunteer, searching for a misfiled chart for a frantic elderly woman upstairs. He saw her history, her health, fractured across a dozen folders\u2014a system failing the person it was meant to serve. Medicine lost its allure, but a new purpose ignited. He wouldn\u2019t heal people with scalpels, but with structure and logic. He saw his path not as a doctor, but as an architect of care.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe was 34, sitting on a wooden stool in Seoul\u2019s Gwangjang Market, eating a bowl of handmade noodle soup. He watched the vendor\u2019s hands, practiced and sure, and felt a connection that wasn\u2019t intellectual, but silently cellular. It wasn\u2019t a grand discovery, more like finding a foundational note beneath a complex song. He didn\u2019t find a missing piece of himself; he just felt the quiet resonance of the place he came from, adding a new, grounding layer to the man he already was.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was the first Saturday morning after his partner of seven years had moved out. The silence in his Noe Valley apartment was an active presence. The absence of her mug next to his felt like a data void, a system failure. The grief was sharp, but so was a quiet resolve. He methodically made his coffee, walked to the bakery, and bought one croissant instead of two. It was the start of rebuilding his personal architecture, one careful, solitary routine at a time.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast winter, the L-Taraval lurched to a stop in the Twin Peaks tunnel. Trapped in the warm, crowded car, he looked at the faces around him\u2014a UCSF nurse, a construction worker, a student. He realized he was just another predictable part of the city\u2019s vast, complex system, a familiar face on the 7:42 AM run. In a city of constant change, this structured commute had become his quiet, daily proof of belonging. He wasn\u2019t just observing the system; he was in it."
