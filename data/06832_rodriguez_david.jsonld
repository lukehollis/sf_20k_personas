The only son of an engineer and a teacher who emigrated from Mexico City to Fremont in the late 1970s, David grew up in a home where ambition was a virtue and education was the ultimate scaffold for a new life. He absorbed their work ethic, their pragmatism, and their deep-seated belief that success was earned, not given.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line upward. A practical Bachelor of Science from UC Davis led to a coveted spot in UC Berkeley\u2019s MBA program. It was there, amidst case studies and networking events, that he found his calling not in founding a startup, but in organizing their chaotic energy. He thrived on creating order from complexity, a skill that made him a natural fit for the world of consulting. Today, as a Project Manager, he parachutes into large corporations, his specialty being the implementation of complex sustainability and environmental compliance initiatives.\n\nA key turning point wasn't professional, but personal: a broken engagement in his late thirties that left him re-evaluating the life he was so carefully constructing. The split prompted him to sell his condo in the East Bay and buy a bright, airy flat in Noe Valley, seeking a change of scenery and a deeper connection to a neighborhood. The pandemic-induced shift to remote work solidified this change. His 0.0-mile commute transformed his relationship with San Francisco.\n\nNow, David\u2019s life is deeply rooted in his immediate surroundings. His day begins with a walk to a 24th Street caf\u00e9 for an oat milk latte, followed by hours of Zoom calls and Gantt charts from his standing desk overlooking the fog rolling over Twin Peaks. Mid-day breaks are for hikes in Glen Canyon Park. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow MBA grads and neighbors\u2014for dinner parties or weekend trips to Sonoma. David has achieved the stability his parents dreamed of for him, but now his aspirations are shifting. He finds himself daydreaming of leveraging his project management skills for a local non-profit, perhaps restoring a piece of the very nature he now cherishes on his daily walks. He wants his next project to be building something that lasts, right here in the city he finally, truly calls home."
