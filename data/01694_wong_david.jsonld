His identity was forged not in a classroom but on the muddy, cacophonous construction sites of the Bay Area. Raised in Richmond by a quiet, hardworking father who was a maintenance man, David inherited a belief that value was something you built with your hands. The abstract world of academia held no appeal; after high school, he followed the work, starting as a general laborer on a crew in Oakland.\n\nFor twenty years, his life was measured by physical effort. He learned the trades through observation and grit, earning the respect of his peers for his reliability and uncanny ability to anticipate problems. His career, however, was violently rerouted at age 39 by a fall that left him with two herniated discs and a doctor\u2019s order to never again lift more than twenty pounds. The turning point was devastating but clarifying. His body was broken, but his mind, which had been cataloging every detail of the construction process for two decades, was perfectly intact.\n\nHe leveraged his encyclopedic knowledge of job sites into a new career. He became a freelance project coordinator, a vital link between architects, contractors, and city permitting offices. He was the translator, the guy who could look at a schematic and know exactly why the plumbing would be a nightmare. He works from a meticulously organized office in his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, making his commute exactly zero miles.\n\nHis intense focus on work contributed to the amicable end of his marriage years ago; he managed projects better than he managed relationships. Now, his social life is woven into his job\u2014lunches with contractors, site visits that turn into friendly chats. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound and physical. He walks through SoMa or Hayes Valley and sees his legacy in the seismic retrofits and remodels he helped steer. His dream isn't grand; it\u2019s to one day afford a small, rundown bungalow in the Sunset, a project all his own where he can finally put down his schedules and pick up his own tools again."
