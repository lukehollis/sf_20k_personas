The only child of Chinese immigrants, she grew up behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Outer Richmond. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home, the scent of fresh produce, and the quiet pressure to achieve a life more stable than her parents\u2019 own. They envisioned her as a doctor, a tangible symbol of success. Mei-Ling dutifully pursued pre-med at SF State, but a required volunteer rotation at a community health clinic shattered her prescribed path. It wasn't the science of healing that captivated her, but the human stories of struggle, grief, and resilience.\n\nThis was her pivotal turning point. Announcing her switch to social work caused a deep, albeit temporary, rift with her parents. They saw it as a step down, a path of emotional labor with little financial reward. But Mei-Ling was resolute. She earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley and dedicated her career to the most challenging of fields: palliative care.\n\nFor the past twenty years, she has been a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a major hospital. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her dedication; she lives in a modest Cole Valley condo, a short walk from the UCSF Parnassus campus where she works. Her days are spent navigating the fragile space between life and death, supporting patients and their families through unimaginable pain. The work is a heavy cloak she has learned to wear with grace.\n\nNow 48 and amicably divorced for over a decade, her life is one of structured solitude and deep connection. Her small circle of friends, mostly other healthcare professionals, are her chosen family. Mornings often begin with a quiet walk through the Presidio, watching the sun burn through the marine layer. Evenings are for unwinding with a book, tending to her collection of succulents, and video calls with her aging parents, who now live in the Sunset and are, finally, immensely proud of their daughter\u2019s compassionate strength.\n\nMei-Ling\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s a quiet continuation of her purpose. She hopes to mentor the next generation of social workers, find time to learn watercolor painting, and simply continue to be a steady, calming presence for those facing life\u2019s most difficult passage, a vital, unseen anchor in the city she has always called home."

Mei-Ling simply sat with her, holding her frail, spotted hand until a translator arrived. In the woman\u2019s grateful squeeze, she felt a profound calling\u2014not to cure the body, but to witness the soul. It was in that silent, shared moment that the path of 'doctor' dissolved, replaced by a deep, undeniable need to simply be present for people in their most vulnerable moments.\n\n2.\nThe air in the store's small back office, heavy with the scent of cardboard and dried mushrooms, felt thick with disappointment. At 21, she told her parents she was abandoning pre-med. Her father didn't shout; he just looked away at the dusty shelves. The silence was worse. In that moment of profound disconnect, a terrifying strength rose within her. It was the first decision she had ever made entirely for herself, forging a path away from their dream and into her own purpose. The rift was painful, but the self-possession was permanent.\n\n3.\nTen years into her career, she had a young patient who just wanted to see the bridge one last time. He was too weak to leave his bed. Mei-Ling spent an afternoon rearranging his hospital room, pushing furniture aside so his bed faced the window with its partial view of the orange towers through the Karl the Fog. He passed two days later. That memory taught her that her work wasn't about the process of dying, but about honoring the small, sacred details of what it means to be living, right until the very end.\n\n4.\nShe was 42, having Sunday dim sum with her parents in the Sunset. Her father, a man of few words, had been listening to her talk about a difficult case. He paused, chopsticks hovering over a dumpling, and said in Cantonese, \"Your heart is very strong. It is a good heart.\" There was no grand apology, just that simple, profound acknowledgement. Decades of unspoken tension dissolved in the steam from the cart. In that moment, she wasn't the daughter who had disappointed him; she was the daughter he finally, fully understood.\n\n5.\nOn a solo walk through the Presidio last year, she stood at an overlook as the sun finally burned through the dense marine layer. The light hit the water, and the city she knew so intimately revealed itself. She felt no loneliness, only a deep sense of peace. That moment crystallized her life after her divorce: not an absence of partnership, but a fulfilling presence of self. This quiet solitude, this constant dance between fog and light, was the shape of her own hard-won and deeply cherished contentment."
