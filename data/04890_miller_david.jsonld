Raised in the quiet academic enclave of Madison, Wisconsin, by two literature professors, David was groomed for a life of the mind. He dutifully pursued this path, earning a Master's in Comparative Literature from the University of Chicago, specializing in 20th-century Russian novelists.\n\nHis entry into the world of management consulting was an accident born of financial necessity. A temp job writing market analysis reports revealed his uncanny talent for distilling complex corporate problems into compelling narratives\u2014a skill honed by dissecting Dostoevsky. The pay was staggering, the work was intellectually stimulating in its own way, and the promise of a dynamic life in San Francisco was a potent lure away from the staid Midwest. He told himself it was just for a few years, but the years compounded.\n\nFor two decades, David\u2019s life was a blur of airports, client boardrooms, and hotel suites. He became a \"fixer,\" renowned for his calm demeanor and sharp insights. This transient existence, however, came at a cost, dissolving his marriage in the early 2000s; his ex-wife tired of a husband who was merely a visitor in their own home. When the pandemic ended corporate travel overnight, David found himself permanently grounded. The 0.0-mile commute was a shock to his system. Suddenly, the city he used as a beautiful backdrop for his departure and arrival was simply\u2026 home.\n\nNow, at 52, he gazes out at the bustling street from his window, a stranger in his own neighborhood. His daily routine consists of Zoom calls and crafting strategic frameworks, the silence of his apartment a stark contrast to his former life. The forgotten novels on his shelves seem to mock him. His aspiration is no longer to climb a corporate ladder but to simply reconnect with the man he was supposed to be. He dreams of leaving consulting, maybe teaching at a local college or finally writing that long-abandoned thesis on absurdist fiction. David\u2019s next big project isn't for a client; it's figuring out how to close the distance between his window and the vibrant life happening just outside."

When his father looked up and said, \"This is the real magic, David, the only kind that lasts,\" a profound sense of purpose settled in him. It wasn't just a book; it was a map to a future he understood, a world of ideas he belonged to. That feeling of rightness was the northern star he would spend decades losing sight of.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the first direct deposit from the consulting firm landing in his bank account. It was more money than his father made in a semester. He had synthesized market data into a story, a fiction of sorts, and was rewarded handsomely. The thrill was intoxicating, but it was laced with a quiet shame. It was the first time he chose the beautiful, practical lie over the difficult truth, a compromise that felt small then but would come to define his entire adult life. This occurred in his mid-20s, just after graduate school.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't a fight. His wife Sarah, back in their Marin house in 2003, was packing his carry-on bag for him. \"You're getting so good at leaving,\" she said, her voice devoid of anger, just exhausted truth. The comment, delivered with such calm finality, struck him harder than any argument. He realized then that his presence was no longer a default state but a fleeting visit. It was the moment he understood that the life he was building for them was the very thing dismantling it.\n\n4.\nStanding alone in a hotel suite overlooking Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour around 2015, he\u2019d just closed a career-defining deal. The city lights were a dazzling, impersonal reward. He felt a surge of professional pride, followed by a profound, echoing emptiness. The victory was his alone, a data point on a performance review. The memory became a symbol of his success: a spectacular view seen through glass, beautiful, vast, and utterly untouchable. It was the pinnacle of a life he no longer wanted to lead.\n\n5.\nLast spring, grounded by the pandemic, he heard a neighbor practicing a cello, the same passage played over and over with flawed, aching sincerity. The sound cut through the sterile silence of his Zoom calls. It wasn't efficient or optimized; it was just human effort. That imperfect music made the novels on his shelves feel heavy with judgment. It was the moment the distance between his window and the street became intolerable, sparking the terrifying, necessary project of finally coming home to himself."
