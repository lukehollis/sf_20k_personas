Raised in West Oakland, he was the son of a longshoreman father who preached the value of a steady hand and a public-school teacher mother who championed the power of a curious mind. Tariq inherited both. While his friends were drawn to the burgeoning hip-hop scene, Tariq was fascinated by the Bay Area\u2019s jazz and funk history, spending hours in libraries listening to old vinyl and reading liner notes. This passion led him to UCLA, where he pursued a Master's degree in Ethnomusicology, dedicating his thesis to the social impact of Tower of Power.\n\nThe academic path, however, felt isolating and financially precarious. The first dot-com boom was exploding, and a friend convinced him to take a \"temporary\" job at a San Francisco startup. His role was user experience research, and to his surprise, the skills were identical to his graduate work: analyzing human behavior, identifying cultural patterns, and translating complex systems into understandable narratives. He was a natural. The temporary job became a career. Over two decades, Tariq skillfully navigated the boom-and-bust cycles, evolving from a researcher into a sought-after senior technology consultant who specialized in human-centered design strategy.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with a quiet divorce. The separation prompted Tariq to reassess his life, trading a large suburban house for a minimalist, art-filled apartment in Hayes Valley. With a zero-mile commute, his days have a distinct rhythm. Mornings start with coffee from a local roaster, followed by hours of deep work on video calls, advising global clients from his sunlit home office. Afternoons are for walks through Patricia's Green or down to the SFJAZZ Center, a pilgrimage site for him.\n\nNow 48, Tariq finds his ambitions shifting. The consulting work is intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding, but his original passion calls to him. His dream is to leverage his tech acumen and wealth to build a comprehensive digital archive of Bay Area soul and funk music, preserving the very history he once studied. He envisions an interactive platform with oral histories, obscure recordings, and community stories\u2014a way to finally synthesize the two halves of his life, honoring the legacy of his parents and the city that shaped him."
