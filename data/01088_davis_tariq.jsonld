Raised in West Oakland, he was the son of a longshoreman father who preached the value of a steady hand and a public-school teacher mother who championed the power of a curious mind. Tariq inherited both. While his friends were drawn to the burgeoning hip-hop scene, Tariq was fascinated by the Bay Area\u2019s jazz and funk history, spending hours in libraries listening to old vinyl and reading liner notes. This passion led him to UCLA, where he pursued a Master's degree in Ethnomusicology, dedicating his thesis to the social impact of Tower of Power.\n\nThe academic path, however, felt isolating and financially precarious. The first dot-com boom was exploding, and a friend convinced him to take a \"temporary\" job at a San Francisco startup. His role was user experience research, and to his surprise, the skills were identical to his graduate work: analyzing human behavior, identifying cultural patterns, and translating complex systems into understandable narratives. He was a natural. The temporary job became a career. Over two decades, Tariq skillfully navigated the boom-and-bust cycles, evolving from a researcher into a sought-after senior technology consultant who specialized in human-centered design strategy.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with a quiet divorce. The separation prompted Tariq to reassess his life, trading a large suburban house for a minimalist, art-filled apartment in Hayes Valley. With a zero-mile commute, his days have a distinct rhythm. Mornings start with coffee from a local roaster, followed by hours of deep work on video calls, advising global clients from his sunlit home office. Afternoons are for walks through Patricia's Green or down to the SFJAZZ Center, a pilgrimage site for him.\n\nNow 48, Tariq finds his ambitions shifting. The consulting work is intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding, but his original passion calls to him. His dream is to leverage his tech acumen and wealth to build a comprehensive digital archive of Bay Area soul and funk music, preserving the very history he once studied. He envisions an interactive platform with oral histories, obscure recordings, and community stories\u2014a way to finally synthesize the two halves of his life, honoring the legacy of his parents and the city that shaped him."

From inside, the horn section of Tower of Power blasted from the turntable, impossibly tight. His dad nodded along, \"That's a crew that works together, son.\" In that moment, Tariq understood: the disciplined rhythm of the docks and the intricate groove of funk were the same language. It wasn't just music; it was the sound of a community's soul, built with steady, practiced hands.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe stood before his thesis committee at UCLA, passionately defending his analysis of Tower of Power\u2019s social impact. The professors nodded, impressed, but the air felt thin, academic. Looking out the window towards the pulsing city, a wave of pragmatism hit him. He loved this history, but he couldn't live inside it. He realized his mother\u2019s gift of a curious mind needed his father\u2019s steady hand to build a real life. The isolation of the ivory tower suddenly felt unsustainable.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was 1999, his first \u201ctemporary\u201d tech job. He sat in a sterile observation room, watching a woman struggle with a confusing website, her frustration palpable. It wasn\u2019t about code; it was about culture, behavior, and unmet needs. He wasn't a tech impostor; he was an ethnographer in a new field. The skills were identical. That day, the intellectual thrill he\u2019d found in library archives sparked alive in the real world. His pivot wasn't a compromise; it was a translation.\n\n***\n\n4.\nFive years ago, he spent his first night in the Hayes Valley apartment. The cavernous silence of his old suburban house was replaced by the city's gentle hum. He owned three boxes of books, a turntable, and one perfect chair. Unpacking a record\u2014Herbie Hancock\u2014he didn't feel loss, but lightness. He was shedding a life that no longer fit. This minimalism wasn't about scarcity; it was about clarity. He was finally curating his own existence, and it started in this small, art-filled room.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, sitting in the dark at the SFJAZZ Center, he watched a legendary but aging funk bassist play with fire and grace. The audience was rapt, but Tariq felt a pang of preemptive loss. This history was so vibrant, yet so fragile. He looked down at the powerful phone in his hand\u2014the very tool of the career that had pulled him from this world. In a flash, he saw the bridge. He could use the language of tech to preserve the language of soul. The archive wasn't a dream; it was a duty."
