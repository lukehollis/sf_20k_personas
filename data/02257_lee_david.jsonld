The only son of Toisanese immigrants, he grew up in the Inner Sunset amidst the clatter of his parents' small laundromat on Irving Street. They were practical people who equated success with financial security and pushed David toward a stable career. He was a quiet, observant boy, more interested in the narratives he found in books than in balance sheets.\n\nRebelling gently, David attended San Francisco State University and earned a bachelor's degree in English Literature. He envisioned a life of letters, perhaps as a critic or academic, but the reality was isolating and financially precarious. He drifted through his late twenties, working in bookstores and cafes, feeling a growing disconnect between his intellectual pursuits and a tangible purpose.\n\nThe turning point arrived when his father suffered a major stroke. During the long weeks at the UCSF Medical Center on Parnassus Heights, David was a constant presence. He watched the registered nurses with a kind of awe. They were competent, compassionate, and direct; they explained complex procedures with patience and held his mother's hand when she wept. He saw in their work everything his own life lacked: immediate impact, human connection, and undeniable purpose.\n\nAt 31, David made a radical shift. He enrolled in an accelerated nursing program, trading literary theory for anatomy and physiology. It was a humbling and grueling experience, but he had never felt more driven. Now, at 47, he is a seasoned RN on a telemetry floor at that same UCSF hospital.\n\nHis life has come full circle. He lives in a small apartment just blocks from where he grew up, and his commute is a short walk up the hill, a journey he often makes before the sun burns through the morning fog. His days are a demanding cycle of 12-hour shifts, but he finds solace in the rhythm. His social life is small, centered on a few trusted colleagues and his older sister in the East Bay. His dream is no longer to write the great novel, but to mentor new nurses and one day use his savings to volunteer with a medical mission abroad. For David, fulfillment isn't found in grand ambitions, but in the quiet, steady work of caring for the people of the city that has always been his home."
