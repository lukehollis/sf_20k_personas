Born in a dusty village in Punjab, India, her world was one of sprawling fields and the tight-knit embrace of a large Sikh family. Her education ended with her secondary schooling; a university degree was a distant dream reserved for men with city ambitions. Her future was decided, as was custom, through a carefully arranged marriage to Harcharan Singh, a man ten years her senior who had already established a modest life in America.\n\nAt twenty-one, Pritpal arrived in San Francisco, a city whose cold fog was a stark contrast to the searing Punjabi sun. Her new home was a small apartment above a struggling eatery her husband had bought. This restaurant, which they named \u201cPunjab Garden,\u201d became her entire universe. While Harcharan worked the front, Pritpal, guided by her mother-in-law's recipes, mastered the kitchen. She learned English from customers and vendors, her accent a melodic map of her journey.\n\nThe defining turning point came fifteen years ago with Harcharan\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack. Widowed at 38, Pritpal faced a choice: sell the business and retreat, or take the helm. She chose to fight. Overnight, she transformed from a behind-the-scenes cook into the formidable manager, bookkeeper, and heart of Punjab Garden. The 0.0-mile commute became a permanent reality; her life was contained within the building\u2019s walls, her days measured by the rhythm of lunch rushes and dinner service.\n\nNow 53, Pritpal is a neighborhood institution. Her son, Jaspreet, is a software engineer in San Jose\u2014her immense pride and a symbol of the future she and Harcharan worked for. Their weekly calls are her cherished connection to a world outside her own. Her relationship with the city is hyper-local; she knows the names of the shelter residents who come for a hot meal and the tech workers who crave her saag paneer. Her dream isn\u2019t a lavish retirement, but something simpler: to see the restaurant survive another decade, to perhaps one day take a month-long trip back to her village in Punjab, and to finally sleep in without the scent of frying onions wafting up from the kitchen below."
