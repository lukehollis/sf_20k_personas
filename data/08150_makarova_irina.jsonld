The daughter of a disillusioned engineer and a literature-loving librarian, her early world was one of hushed conversations, scarcity, and the grey light filtering through tall windows. In 1991, with the USSR crumbling, her family seized a fleeting opportunity, landing in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District with little more than their education and a deep-seated ache for a home they could no longer recognize.\n\nFor a teenage Irina, San Francisco was a bewildering kaleidoscope of freedom and alienation. While her parents, Pyotr and Anya, traded their professional pride for janitorial and cashier jobs, Irina channeled her dislocation into academic excellence. She watched families like hers fracture under the strain of immigration, which ignited in her a fierce desire to understand and mend the unseen wounds of cultural displacement. This path led her to San Francisco State University for a degree in psychology and then to UC Berkeley for a Master of Social Work.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of community health clinics, but the bureaucracy wore on her. A key turning point was realizing she could offer more profound care on her own terms. After years of rigorous supervision and saving every spare dollar, she earned her LCSW licensure and established a private practice.\n\nNow, at 48, Irina\u2019s commute is zero miles. She lives and works in a serene Cole Valley apartment, where a converted sunroom serves as her office. Her days are a quiet rhythm of telehealth sessions with clients\u2014often fellow immigrants and first-generation Americans\u2014punctuated by long, meditative walks in Golden Gate Park. Never married and with no children, her deepest connections are with a small circle of friends and her elderly father, Pyotr, whom she visits weekly.\n\nSan Francisco is more than a city to Irina; it\u2019s the soil in which she was replanted. She carries the memory of Leningrad within her, but her life was built here, in the fog and the relentless optimism of a city of outcasts. Her quiet aspiration is to develop a therapeutic framework for bicultural identity, a way to help others build a bridge between the world they left behind and the one they now inhabit."
