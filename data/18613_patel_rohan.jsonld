He began that journey, enrolling in San Jose State\u2019s Industrial Design program, but found himself increasingly disconnected. While his peers thrived on abstract theory and sleek digital renderings, Rohan lived for the workshop. The visceral feeling of a lathe shaping a block of aluminum and the precision of a 3D printer bringing a design to life were what truly captivated him.\n\nThe turning point came during his third year. Facing mounting student debt and disillusioned with the academic grind, he saw an ad for a CNC machinist apprenticeship at a manufacturing firm in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood. It was a gamble. He dropped out of college, a decision that caused a rift with his family, who saw it as a step backward. For Rohan, however, it was a step toward something real. He excelled in the hands-on environment, quickly mastering the complex programming and operation of computer-controlled mills and lathes.\n\nNow 29, Rohan is a respected machinist, turning blueprints into high-precision components for medical devices and aerospace prototypes. His relationship with his parents has healed, their disappointment replaced by a quiet pride in his skill and self-sufficiency. He lives in a shared apartment in the Mission, and his daily 2.8-mile bike ride to the workshop is a grounding ritual, weaving through the vibrant chaos of his neighborhood before arriving at the focused order of the machine shop.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of artists and fellow tradespeople, a world away from the tech-centric culture his parents envisioned. His dream is no longer a degree but ownership. He meticulously saves, hoping to one day buy his own multi-axis CNC machine and open a small, bespoke fabrication studio, collaborating directly with independent designers. Rohan didn\u2019t follow the script, but in the city of reinvention, he is proudly machining his own unique path."

His peers passionately defended their concepts, but all Rohan could feel was the phantom weight of an aluminum block in his hands. A profound emptiness washed over him. This was not creating; it was simulating. That day, the abstract theory of the classroom became a cage, and the visceral hum of the workshop became a desperate, necessary escape. He knew he had to leave.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, the crumpled apprenticeship ad on his desk. His hand shook as he called his father. \u2018I\u2019m dropping out,\u2019 he said, the words tasting like both betrayal and freedom. The silence on the other end was heavier than any lecture. Hanging up felt like cutting a vital cord. The shame was immense, but beneath it was a terrifying, foundational flicker of self-possession. For the first time, his life was completely his own to build or to break. He chose to build.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the first time he machined a truly difficult part, a titanium component for a satellite prototype, around age 22. After hours of intense focus, he ran the calipers over the finished piece. Perfect. To the thousandth of an inch. A wave of quiet, profound pride washed over him, a feeling no diploma could ever grant. He wasn't a dropout; he was a creator. In the cool, precise weight of the metal in his palm, he felt the entire worth of his risky decision.\n\n4.\nHis father visited the workshop when Rohan was 26. He watched silently for nearly an hour as Rohan programmed and ran a complex job on the 5-axis mill. He didn't praise the choice, but he pointed at the finished aerospace part and said, \u201cThis takes a steady hand. A smart mind.\u201d It wasn't forgiveness; it was recognition. In that quiet moment of acknowledgement from his father, years of familial tension dissolved, replaced by a new, unspoken foundation of respect for the man his son had become.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a sculptor brought him a design for a kinetic piece that bigger shops had dismissed as impossible. Rohan spent a weekend sketching, re-programming, and finding a way. Seeing the artist\u2019s face light up when he delivered the core mechanism solidified everything. It wasn't just about technical precision anymore; it was about partnership and creation. On his bike ride home through the Mission that evening, the vague dream of his own shop became a clear, burning ambition: to be the go-to machinist for the city\u2019s independent creators."
