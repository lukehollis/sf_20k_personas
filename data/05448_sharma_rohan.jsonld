His father, a software engineer, and his mother, a high school math teacher, instilled in him a profound work ethic and a clear, pragmatic path: excel in a quantitative field, secure a high-paying job, and build a secure life. Rohan, an obedient and bright son, never questioned this blueprint. He excelled in school, naturally gravitating towards numbers, and enrolled at UC Berkeley, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Economics.\n\nHis junior year internship led directly to a full-time offer as a Financial Risk Analyst in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District. The position was a perfect manifestation of his parents\u2019 dreams. However, a key turning point was the company\u2019s post-pandemic decision to embrace a permanent remote work model. Rohan signed a lease for a modern, compact apartment in SoMa, excited by the prospect of a zero-mile commute.\n\nNow, at 25, his life is a study in digital containment. His day begins and ends in the same 600-square-foot space. He wakes up, logs into his terminal, and spends eight to ten hours analyzing market volatility models and credit default swaps\u2014abstract concepts that feel worlds away from the city outside his window. The pride of landing the job has slowly been replaced by a quiet sense of detachment.\n\nTo combat the isolation, Rohan has cultivated a disciplined routine. After logging off, he walks to a bouldering gym, the physical problem-solving on the wall a welcome analogue to his digital work. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of college friends, with whom he explores the Mission for burritos or hikes in the Marin Headlands on weekends. These excursions are his lifeline, reminding him he lives in a vibrant city and not just a corporate server.\n\nRohan\u2019s deepest aspiration is a secret he barely admits to himself. He dreams of leaving the abstract world of finance for something tangible, like opening a craft coffee roastery. He feels a growing pull towards creating something real that people can hold and enjoy. For now, he is a man at a crossroads: living the life he was raised to want, while quietly wondering if he has the courage to risk it all for the life he's discovering he might actually need."

The words \u201cfull-time offer\u201d landed with a satisfying thud. It wasn't just a job; it was the finish line. His father\u2019s single, proud nod was the only trophy he needed. In that moment, he felt the immense relief of having perfectly executed the plan laid out for him. He had succeeded, sealing his identity as the son who delivered on every promise.\n\n2.\nHis first morning in the SoMa apartment, he stood with his coffee, admiring the clean lines and floor-to-ceiling window. The dream of a zero-mile commute was real. But as he looked out at the identical windows of the building opposite, a strange feeling crept in. He wasn't just looking at a city; he was looking at other boxes from inside his own. This moment, at age 23, marked the beginning of his digital containment\u2014the point where his new freedom began to feel like a cage.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the sharp texture of the plastic holds, his muscles screaming as he fell from the same V4 problem for the tenth time. Chalk was caked under his nails. Then, one evening, he launched for the final hold\u2014a purely physical, desperate move\u2014and his fingers latched on. The surge of raw, tangible accomplishment was intoxicating, a feeling he never got from a spreadsheet. That evening, at 24, was when the bouldering gym transformed from a hobby into a non-negotiable part of his sanity.\n\n4.\nLast spring, standing atop a hill in the Marin Headlands with his friends, the wind whipping his jacket. The entire city, the Bay, and the Golden Gate Bridge were laid out below. For a moment, the credit default swaps and market volatility models in his head vanished, replaced by the sheer scale of the view and the easy laughter of his friends. It was a potent reminder that his world was larger than 600 square feet, a memory he clung to during long, quiet workdays.\n\n5.\nIt was on a foggy Saturday in the Outer Sunset. He stumbled into a tiny shop where a man was tending a gleaming roasting machine. The air was thick with the rich, complex smell of transforming beans\u2014it was the most real, tangible thing he\u2019d experienced in months. He watched, captivated, as the roaster carefully checked the color and scent. That's when the idea took root: to create something simple, warm, and real that people could hold in their hands. The thought was both terrifying and thrilling."
