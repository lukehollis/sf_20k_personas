Raised in Sacramento, Kenji\u2019s childhood was a blend of two worlds, a quiet negotiation between minimalist aesthetics and Midwestern pragmatism. This duality became the bedrock of his identity.\n\nHis path was clear early on. He pursued an architecture degree at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master of Architecture from Yale, where he honed his theoretical edge. His early career was spent at a massive corporate firm in San Francisco, designing sleek but soulless glass towers. The turning point came with his father's passing. Standing in his father's dusty studio, surrounded by imperfectly beautiful pottery, Kenji realized he was building monuments to commerce, not community.\n\nHe quit his job and, with a former colleague, founded a boutique firm focused exclusively on arts and cultural institutions\u2014museums, theaters, and non-profit galleries. As Managing Principal, Kenji is the visionary, balancing creative ambition with the practical realities of construction.\n\nNow 46 and divorced, Kenji lives a deliberately curated life. His home is a spacious, concrete-and-glass live/work loft in SoMa, where his commute is a walk down a flight of steel stairs from his living quarters to his studio. His days are a disciplined rhythm of client calls, digital drafting, and quiet sketching. Evenings are for visiting a new gallery exhibition, sharing a bottle of wine with his small circle of fellow creatives, or simply watching the fog roll in over the city\u2019s skyline from his balcony.\n\nKenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound. He sees the city as the ultimate expression of his own blended identity\u2014a place of relentless innovation grounded in natural beauty, a city that embraces its own beautiful imperfections. His driving aspiration is to design a signature cultural center for the city, a building that will not only be an architectural landmark but also a true public space that fosters the kind of artistic community that shaped him."

His father gathered the shards, explaining how they would mend it with gold, making its story of breakage part of its beauty. It was Kenji\u2019s first true understanding of *wabi-sabi*, an acceptance of imperfection that he would later seek in both his buildings and his city. For him, beauty wasn't in the flawless, but in the thoughtfully repaired.\n\n2.\nHe was 32, standing in the cavernous lobby of a skyscraper he\u2019d helped birth. The morning light hit the Italian marble, but it felt cold, antiseptic. He watched people rush through, their reflections fleeting and anonymous against the glass. There was no joy, no community, only the frictionless flow of capital. The emotional void was staggering. It was the moment he knew he wasn't building for people; he was building containers for transactions. The soullessness of it was a physical weight he carried home that night.\n\n3.\nAt 38, a week after the funeral, he sat alone in his father's silent studio. The air was thick with the scent of dust and dry clay. On a shelf sat a simple, lopsided bowl, its glaze uneven, his father\u2019s thumbprint still visible near the rim. Kenji held its solid, human warmth and weighed it against the cold, perfect glass towers he designed. In that dusty light, the choice was devastatingly clear. He was honoring the wrong legacy. He would resign the next morning.\n\n4.\nHe was 43, the first night in his SoMa loft after the divorce papers were signed. The space felt vast, echoing his own emptiness. He stood on the balcony, watching the fog swallow the skyline, blurring the sharp edges of the city into a soft, grey abstraction. It wasn't an erasure, but a quiet transformation. Standing there, wrapped in the cool air, he didn\u2019t feel lost. He felt found, finally at home in a city that, like him, wasn\u2019t afraid to show its beautiful, melancholic imperfections.\n\n5.\nTwo years after quitting his job, he stood in the back of a crowded Mission gallery, his firm\u2019s first completed project. He was 40, terrified, and exhilarated. He watched not the art, but the people. He overheard two students debating how the angled skylight he\u2019d agonized over made a sculpture\u2019s shadow dance on the concrete floor. It was a small detail, a quiet moment of connection. In that instant, he knew he\u2019d made the right choice. This was architecture that breathed. This was a space that served the soul."
