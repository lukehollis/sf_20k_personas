Born in Queens, New York, to a pragmatic Hakka Chinese father and a vibrant Trinidadian mother of Indo-Caribbean descent, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese proverbs and the rhythm of soca music. Her name, Aaliyah, was her mother\u2019s choice; her surname, Chen, her father\u2019s legacy. This dual heritage instilled in her a unique perspective, a constant awareness of different worlds coexisting.\n\nHer path was clarified during a college trip to Trinidad. Witnessing the stark reality of coastal erosion and plastic-choked mangroves was a visceral turning point, transforming a general interest in nature into a fierce calling. She pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master's in Environmental Management from Yale. She was drawn to San Francisco, the nexus of world-changing technology and progressive environmentalism, believing she could make the most impact there.\n\nNow 31, Aaliyah is an Environmental Consultant, a digital nomad within her own Inner Sunset apartment. Her clients are the tech giants of Silicon Valley, and she spends her days navigating the thin line between genuine corporate responsibility and savvy greenwashing. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a cherished morning routine: a misty run through Golden Gate Park, just steps from her door, before diving into data analysis and back-to-back video calls.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is rooted in this proximity to nature within a bustling urban core. She met her partner, a landscape architect named Maya, while volunteering for a trail restoration project on Mount Sutro. Their weekends are spent exploring the coastline or tending to the native plants on their balcony.\n\nAaliyah\u2019s life is a quiet but determined mission. She dreams of launching her own consultancy focused not just on sustainability, but on regenerative practices that actively heal ecosystems. She aspires to prove that the engines of innovation can also be forces for restoration, a belief that reflects her own beautifully complex and blended existence."
