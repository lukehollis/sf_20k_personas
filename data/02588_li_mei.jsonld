From her small apartment above the shop, the aroma of oolong tea precedes her descent to open \"The Gentle Steep,\" her meticulously curated tea and ceramics store in the Richmond District. This life, steeped in quiet purpose, is one she built for herself, far from the one her parents envisioned.\n\nBorn and raised just a few blocks away, Mei is a true daughter of San Francisco. Her parents, immigrants from Guangdong, ran a bustling, practical corner grocery store. They preached the gospel of hard work for a stable future, pushing Mei towards a secure profession. She complied, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration from SF State, and for fifteen years, she was a model daughter. She took the bus downtown to a beige cubicle, managing logistics for a large import-export company, her life measured in spreadsheets and shipping manifests.\n\nThe turning point came at 38, after her father\u2019s sudden passing. Sorting through his meager belongings, she realized he had worked his entire life without a single day dedicated to his own passion. A quiet dread filled her. Looking at her own life, she saw the same path unfolding. With a small inheritance and her own savings, she quit her job. She poured everything into her lifelong love for traditional Chinese tea ceremony and pottery, a passion her parents had dismissed as a hobby.\n\nShe found the perfect small storefront on Clement Street, with a modest apartment upstairs, fulfilling her dream of a zero-mile commute. \"The Gentle Steep\" became her sanctuary and her life's work. Her daily routine is a calming rhythm of steeping samples for customers, discussing the merits of a Yixing clay pot, and arranging delicate porcelain cups. Her social life is woven into the fabric of her shop; regulars have become close friends, and she\u2019s part of a tight-knit community of local merchants.\n\nAt 50, Mei has no desire for expansion or franchising. Her aspirations are smaller, more meaningful. She dreams of traveling to Jingdezhen to source ceramics directly from the artisans and mentoring the young college student she employs. Mei Li found her success not on a corporate ladder, but on a quiet street in the neighborhood that raised her, creating a life of beauty and intention, one cup at a time."
