Raised in the Outer Sunset, she is the only child of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou who poured their life savings into a small, bustling neighborhood restaurant. Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty, spent doing homework at a corner table while the sounds of sizzling woks and Cantonese chatter filled the air. She was quiet and observant, absorbing the intricate patterns of language and community around her.\n\nWhile her parents hoped she would pursue a practical career like medicine or law, Mei felt drawn to the structure of information itself. At UC Berkeley, she majored in Linguistics, fascinated by how syntax and semantics shape human understanding. It seemed an esoteric choice until a a post-grad internship introduced her to the burgeoning field of data curation. Suddenly, her academic passion had a lucrative, real-world application: teaching artificial intelligence to understand the nuances of human language.\n\nNow at 25, Mei\u2019s life is contained within a meticulously organized 600-square-foot apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bed to a standing desk overlooking Patricia's Green. Her days are a silent, focused rhythm of categorizing, labeling, and cleaning massive datasets for a major tech firm. To break the digital silence, she forces herself out for a morning coffee at Ritual and an evening yoga class. Her social life is intentional, consisting of a tight-knit circle of college friends and her partner, Alex, a landscape architect who grounds her with his connection to the physical world.\n\nA native San Franciscan, Mei feels a strange disconnect from the city of her youth. Her parents\u2019 world of grit and hustle feels a universe away from her own reality of code and remote work. Her dream is to bridge this gap. She secretly aspires to use her data skills not for corporate algorithms, but to create a digital archive of the specific Cantonese dialects and oral histories of the city\u2019s older residents\u2014a project that would honor her heritage while utilizing the skills of her modern world. She is a product of two San Franciscos, striving to find where her own story fits."

Mrs. Chan, a tiny woman with a fierce laugh, was haggling with her father over the price of the steamed rock cod. It wasn't about money; it was a rhythmic, theatrical exchange in their specific village dialect. Mei didn't just hear words; she saw their shape, their history. It was the first time she understood language wasn't just a tool, but a home, and she felt a secret pride in its complexity.\n\n2.\nIt was in the dusty, silent stacks of Doe Library at nineteen. She was supposed to be studying organic chemistry, but instead, she was lost in a book on linguistic syntax. The elegant, branching trees mapping out a single sentence felt more logical and beautiful than any biological process. When her mother called to ask about the MCAT, a wave of guilt washed over her, followed by a quiet, thrilling certainty. This was her path. It was the first choice she ever made that was entirely and unapologetically her own.\n\n3.\nAt her internship, age twenty-two, her manager pulled up a screen filled with millions of garbled user queries. \"Your linguistics degree?\" he'd said, \"You're going to teach our AI what this chaos actually means.\" In that moment, the abstract theories from Berkeley crashed into the real world. The syntax trees she'd diagrammed for fun were now the blueprint for a machine's understanding. It wasn't just a job; it was validation. Her esoteric passion had a tangible, powerful purpose in this new San Francisco.\n\n4.\nShe was twenty-four, walking with Alex through Golden Gate Park, trying to explain a complex data-labeling problem. He listened patiently, then stopped her mid-sentence and pointed to a twisted Monterey cypress. He spoke of its fight for light, its roots gripping the sandy soil. For the first time all day, her racing mind went quiet. He didn't just hear her; he grounded her. With Alex, the world wasn't just information to be sorted; it was a living thing to be felt and understood.\n\n5.\nJust last month, her father called. He mentioned an old family friend had passed, using a specific, poetic Cantonese phrase for grief\u2014one she hadn't heard since childhood. The sound of it struck her with a physical ache. It was a phrase, a piece of history, that existed almost solely on the tongues of a fading generation. The thought of it vanishing forever felt like a personal failure. In that instant, her vague idea of an oral history archive became an urgent, non-negotiable mission."
