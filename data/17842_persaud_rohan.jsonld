Raised in Daly City by Indo-Guyanese immigrant parents who ran a bustling grocery store, his world was one of vibrant flavors, loud family gatherings, and the tangible goal of building a better life. From a young age, Rohan was gentle and introspective, a calm presence amidst the cheerful chaos.\n\nThe turning point that set him on his unusual path came at age sixteen with the death of his beloved grandmother. While his family grieved openly, Rohan found himself captivated by the serene dignity of the funeral proceedings. He watched the funeral director, a man of profound calm, orchestrate the service with a grace that transformed a moment of loss into a beautiful, respectful farewell. He realized then that caring for the dead was a final, essential act of service for the living.\n\nWhile his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue business or medicine, they supported his decision to study anthropology as an undergrad, followed by a graduate degree in Mortuary Science. Rohan excelled, finding a deep connection to the rituals and philosophies surrounding death across different cultures. He now works as a Licensed Funeral Director at a small, independent funeral home in the Mission District that specializes in personalized, multicultural services.\n\nRohan lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. His daily commute is a 3.5-mile journey on the N Judah MUNI line, a time he uses for quiet reflection before his emotionally demanding day begins. His work is his calling; he helps families navigate the complex logistics and overwhelming grief of loss, ensuring their loved ones are honored according to their specific traditions.\n\nEvenings are for decompression. He walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace in the living world after spending his day with the departed. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of friends who understand the gravity of his work, including his long-term partner, a landscape designer. Rohan\u2019s dream is to one day open his own funeral home focused on eco-friendly green burials, believing that a person\u2019s final act can be one of gentle return to the earth. He is a man who has found purpose not in the spotlight, but in the quiet, essential shadows of life."

At eight, his favorite place was a small stool behind the counter, hidden from view. While his family's laughter and the store's chatter filled the air, he would watch a single customer, studying the careful way they chose a mango or the worry lines on their brow. In those quiet moments of observation, he found a stillness that felt more like home than the noise did, a feeling that would anchor his entire life.\n\n2.\nAt his grandmother\u2019s funeral, Rohan didn\u2019t focus on the casket, but on the funeral director\u2019s hands. He watched the man gently straighten a photograph on the easel, then offer Rohan\u2019s weeping father a glass of water with a quiet, steady gaze. There was no grand gesture, just a series of small, dignified acts of care. In that instant, Rohan\u2019s own grief was eclipsed by a profound sense of awe. He understood that this\u2014this calm, respectful service in the face of overwhelming loss\u2014was the most important work a person could do.\n\n3.\nHis first solo service was for a Filipino family holding a nine-day novena. Rohan, then twenty-seven, felt a tremor of fear. But as he lit the candles and quietly guided the family through prayers he had only read about, he saw their collective tension ease. The matriarch later grasped his hand, her eyes thanking him for honoring a tradition she feared would be lost in a new country. The weight of responsibility was immense, but the feeling of getting it right\u2014of providing that specific comfort\u2014cemented his purpose completely.\n\n4.\nWalking through the Queen Wilhelmina Tulip Garden after a grueling week, he confessed to his partner how heavy the stories felt. His partner, a landscape designer, stopped him and pointed to the cycle of the bulbs, buried and seemingly gone, only to push through the cold soil to bloom again. \u201cYou\u2019re like the gardener of the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tend to things in their dark season.\u201d Rohan felt a wave of love and understanding so deep it almost brought him to his knees, his heavy heart suddenly lighter.\n\n5.\nRiding the N Judah home, the train lurches to a stop near 19th Avenue. He looks out the window, not at the traffic, but at the lit windows of the houses climbing the hill. In one, he sees the silhouette of a child being lifted up to say goodnight. A simple, fleeting moment of life, utterly precious and fragile. He feels a quiet ache of tenderness in his chest, a renewed sense of his duty as a guardian of these small, sacred histories when their stories end."
