Raised by a pragmatic dentist and a book-loving teacher, her passion for theatre and modern art was seen as a charming hobby, not a viable career. Bucking their gentle expectations, she pursued an Arts Administration degree at UCLA, determined to build a life around the creativity she adored, even if she wasn't the one on stage.\n\nHer true life began in 1991 when she moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a haven for the unconventional. She arrived in a city grappling with the AIDS crisis but pulsating with a defiant, collaborative artistic energy. Her first job was a poorly paid grant writer for a small dance collective in the Mission. It was there she discovered her true talent: translating artistic vision into compelling narratives for donors.\n\nA key turning point came in the late \u201890s when she secured a game-changing grant that saved a revered but struggling experimental theatre from closing. This success cemented her reputation, and she was eventually recruited by her current employer, a prestigious multi-disciplinary arts center in SoMa. As Director of Development, she navigates the delicate world of fundraising, charming old-money philanthropists and educating new tech titans on the importance of cultural patronage.\n\nHer personal life is anchored by her partner of 28 years, David, a landscape architect she met at a warehouse art show. They share a lovingly restored Edwardian in Noe Valley, a home filled with art from friends and a scruffy terrier named Lenny. Her commute on the J-Church light rail is a cherished ritual, a time for reading and observing the city's daily rhythm.\n\nAt 54, Rebecca\u2019s dream is about legacy. She aspires to build a multi-million-dollar endowment for her non-profit, ensuring it can weather economic storms and support challenging artists for generations to come. She wants to guarantee that the rebellious, creative San Francisco that saved her still has a place for the next young person looking for a home."

The air was thick with the ghost of sweat from the studio and the urgency of the AIDS crisis, which made every performance feel like a defiant eulogy. It was then she realized her work wasn\u2019t a charming arts job; it was a desperate, vital act of preservation. This feeling\u2014a fierce, protective instinct for fragile, essential things\u2014became the bedrock of her entire career.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was a SoMa warehouse show in \u201896\u2014overwhelming, loud, reeking of turpentine and cheap beer. She\u2019d felt lost in the chaos until she saw David. He wasn\u2019t looking at the canvases, but at how a steel sculpture bisected a beam of light from a grimy window. He saw the space, the architecture of the experience. In his quiet observation, she felt a profound sense of recognition and calm. Meeting him taught her that the most vital connections weren\u2019t performed, they were simply discovered.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe phone call came in late 1999. Her heart hammered against her ribs while she held the receiver in her cramped office, listening to a dry, East Coast voice from the foundation. Then came the word: \u201capproved.\u201d The grant was secured. The experimental theatre was saved. It wasn\u2019t just relief; it was a surge of intoxicating power. It was the first time she understood that her words\u2014her carefully crafted narratives\u2014could build walls, keep the lights on, and protect the weird and the wonderful.\n\n***\n\n4.\nRattling home on the J-Church a few years back, she saw a kid, maybe twenty, with thrift-store clothes and wide, nervous eyes, furiously sketching the other passengers. In their intense focus, Rebecca saw her own ghost from 1991, full of terror and hope. It was a gut-punch reminder of her purpose: to ensure the city she ran to still had open arms. The endowment she dreamed of went from an abstract goal to a concrete promise to *that kid*.\n\n***\n\n5.\nTheir Noe Valley Edwardian was beautifully restored, but it only became a home the day they brought Lenny back from the shelter. Watching the scruffy terrier skid on the polished hardwood floors\u2014a joyful, chaotic disruption to their curated life\u2014she felt a wave of pure contentment. David built a clumsy dog bed in the kitchen, and Rebecca realized this messy, unconditional love was the most important installation they\u2019d ever acquire. It was the anchor that made all the high-stakes work feel possible."
