Growing up in a quiet, middle-class Sacramento suburb, his family life was outwardly stable but internally fractured by his younger sister\u2019s escalating battle with schizoaffective disorder. He watched his well-meaning parents navigate a labyrinth of inadequate healthcare and social stigma, a process that left him with a profound sense of frustration and a quiet, burning desire to understand and fix the systems that had failed his family.\n\nThis drive propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master of Social Work (MSW). The Bay Area was a revelation\u2014a place of immense wealth and innovation existing alongside deep-seated poverty and neglect. He felt an immediate, magnetic pull to the city's complex social fabric, choosing to do his fieldwork in San Francisco\u2019s most challenging neighborhoods. He never left.\n\nA key turning point came when he accepted a position as a residential case manager at a supportive housing facility in the SoMa district. The role came with a small, on-site apartment, reducing his commute to zero but effectively erasing the boundary between his work and personal life. At 37, David\u2019s days are a blend of crisis intervention, bureaucratic paperwork, and quiet moments of human connection. He helps residents\u2014many formerly homeless, struggling with addiction or mental illness\u2014navigate everything from doctor's appointments to job applications. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a few fellow social workers who can share gallows humor over cheap beers and understand the immense emotional weight of their profession.\n\nDavid lives and breathes his work. His apartment window overlooks the same courtyard his clients use. He knows the rhythms of the building intimately: the early morning departures for day labor, the late-night arguments, the rare sounds of shared laughter. His dream isn\u2019t a promotion or a house in the suburbs; it\u2019s systemic. He fantasizes about policy changes and increased funding. On a personal level, his hope is measured in small victories: a resident staying sober for six months, another reconnecting with a long-lost child. David Miller\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not through its scenic vistas or culinary scene, but through its cracks\u2014the very places he has dedicated his life to mending."
