His parents, immigrants who ran a small but bustling laundromat, instilled in him the values of hard work and filial piety. They envisioned a stable, lucrative future for their son\u2014a doctor or an engineer\u2014a stark contrast to their own life of manual labor. David, dutiful and bright, initially walked this path, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Davis.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. His beloved grandmother was diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer, and the family was thrown into the disorienting, bureaucratic world of palliative care. It wasn\u2019t the doctors who brought clarity, but a hospital social worker\u2014a calm, compassionate woman who navigated insurance forms, arranged for home hospice care, and, most importantly, listened to their grief. Witnessing her impact, David found his true calling. He switched his focus, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 34, David lives in a modern, compact apartment in Mission Bay, a stone's throw from the UCSF Medical Center he's affiliated with. His zero-mile commute is a function of a hybrid role; days are a mix of telehealth calls from his living room and walking to the hospital to meet with patients and families facing life-altering diagnoses. His work is an emotional marathon of empathy, advocacy, and crisis management, connecting vulnerable people to the resources they desperately need.\n\nHis life is contained within a few square miles. Decompression comes from long, solitary walks along the waterfront towards Oracle Park and a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other healthcare workers who understand the psychic toll of the job. He\u2019s single, finding it difficult to dedicate energy to dating amidst his demanding career.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status. He hopes to one day secure a leadership role where he can influence policy to better support patient families. More immediately, he aspires to find a healthier work-life balance and finally master the recipes for his grandmother\u2019s dumplings\u2014a quiet, personal way to honor the woman whose final journey set him on his own."
