His Mexican-American father, a meticulous auto mechanic with grease-stained hands, and his Filipina mother, a compassionate nurse working double shifts, instilled in him a potent mix of pragmatism and warmth. The family home was a delicious collision of cultures, where meals of adobo and sinigang alternated with carnitas and pozole.\n\nInitially, David rebelled against his parents\u2019 practicality. He pursued an English degree at UC Santa Cruz, losing himself in literature and coastal redwood forests. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s, however, was a harsh awakening. Seeing friends lose everything, he pivoted, trading poetry for projections and enrolling in an MBA program at San Francisco State University.\n\nThis new path led him into the burgeoning world of tech marketing. His ability to craft a compelling narrative\u2014a skill honed by his humanities background\u2014made him a natural. He rose quickly, but the relentless pace of startup life took its toll, leading to an amicable divorce a decade ago. The split was a key turning point, forcing him to redefine success not just by career milestones, but by personal well-being and his relationship with his now college-aged daughter, Maya.\n\nToday, David lives a deliberately quiet life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to a corner desk overlooking Geary Boulevard. His days are a rhythm of Zoom calls, data analysis, and midday walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress. He\u2019s reconnected with the city on his own terms, exploring the diverse dim sum and Russian bakeries in his neighborhood. He has a small circle of old friends he meets for beers, but he often prefers a quiet night in, cooking the dishes of his childhood.\n\nHaving achieved professional stability, David\u2019s aspirations are now more personal. He dreams of finally writing the screenplay that\u2019s been percolating for years and taking a long trip to both Mexico and the Philippines to connect with his roots. He is a man who has built a successful life, and is now focused on making it a meaningful one."
