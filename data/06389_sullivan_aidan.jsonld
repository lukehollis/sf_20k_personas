An observant and analytical child, Aidan was less interested in sports than in the subtle patterns of social interaction he saw around him. This fascination led him to pursue a Bachelor's and then a Master's degree in Sociology at UC Berkeley, bringing him to the Bay Area. He specialized in quantitative methods, falling in love with the power of data to reveal hidden societal truths.\n\nHis key turning point came during his thesis research. While academia offered intellectual freedom, Aidan realized the most groundbreaking, large-scale studies of human behavior were happening within the tech industry. He saw an opportunity to apply his skills on a massive scale, trading the ivory tower for Silicon Valley. He pivoted, landing a role as a statistical analyst where he now translates user data into narratives that shape product development.\n\nToday, Aidan\u2019s life is centered in his sunny Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as his office. His 0.0-mile commute allows for a disciplined routine: pour-over coffee, a focused morning of work, and a mandatory afternoon walk to break the screen-time spell. He strolls through Patricia's Green or grabs a pastry from a local bakery, just to feel the city's pulse and see other faces. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of grad school friends, with whom he shares dinners and explores the city's nooks.\n\nWhile successful, Aidan feels a growing pull back toward his sociological roots. He loves San Francisco for its vibrant, chaotic energy, but feels a disconnect between the abstract data on his screen and the tangible city outside his window. His quiet aspiration is to eventually use his expertise for the public good, perhaps offering his skills pro-bono to a local housing non-profit or transit authority. He dreams of a future where his work doesn't just analyze a city's residents, but actively helps them thrive."
