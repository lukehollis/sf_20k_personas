Born in Daly City to Indian immigrants who valued tangible skills over lofty degrees, David learned the language of machinery from his father, a taxi mechanic. While his friends chased tech dreams, David was drawn to the concrete and copper veins of buildings. He earned a practical Associate's degree in Building Systems Technology from City College, a choice that grounded him firmly in the physical world.\n\nHis career began with grunt work\u2014patching drywall and snaking drains in aging apartment buildings across the city. It was steady, honest work that suited his pragmatic nature. During this time, he met Pryia, a soft-spoken librarian, and they married, settling into a small Sunset district apartment. Their daughter, Anjali, was born, and the pressures of San Francisco living mounted. The turning point came 15 years ago when a Facilities Manager position opened up at a grand, pre-war apartment building in the Marina. The job came with a crucial perk: a manager\u2019s apartment on the ground floor. David took it, and his commute became zero.\n\nToday, David\u2019s world is the 48-unit building he manages. His daily routine is a familiar rhythm: a 6 AM walkthrough to check the boilers, coffee while reviewing vendor invoices, and then the day\u2019s cascade of minor crises\u2014a leaky faucet in 4B, a jammed garage gate, a delivery for the elderly Mrs. Gable in 3A. The tenants are his extended, often demanding, family. He knows who is having a baby, who is going through a breakup, and whose dog is the source of the mysterious barking at midnight. He is the building's steady, unflappable heart.\n\nWith Anjali now at UC Davis, David and Pryia have rediscovered a quiet companionship. His dreams are as practical as he is: a seamless transition to the new water heaters he\u2019s speccing out and, eventually, retirement. He pictures a small house in Petaluma, a garden for Pryia, and a garage workshop for himself. For now, though, he remains a cornerstone of his vertical neighborhood, a man whose deep connection to San Francisco is etched into the very foundation of the building he calls both his workplace and his home."

The Daly City garage was thick with the smell of oil and metal. His father didn\u2019t speak of theories, but of tangible results. In that moment, watching a complex machine come back to life, David understood real value wasn\u2019t in abstract dreams, but in the knowing, the doing, the fixing. This quiet lesson became the blueprint for his own life, the foundation upon which he would build everything.\n\n2.\nHe recalls the profound quiet of the Sunset branch library, a world away from his noisy worksites. He was there for a simple job\u2014fixing a squeaky book cart. But Priya, the librarian, spoke to him not as a handyman, but as a person. She thanked him with a soft smile that made the roaring city outside fall silent. It was in that unexpected stillness, surrounded by stories, that he realized he wanted to build a life with her, one of steady, gentle companionship. It was a different kind of construction.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the cold, heavy weight of the keys in his palm fifteen years ago. The owner handed them over, and with them, the ground-floor manager\u2019s apartment. Standing in the empty living room with Priya, a young Anjali clutching his leg, the immense pressure of San Francisco housing finally lifted from his shoulders. This wasn't just a job; it was a foundation. He had secured his family\u2019s place in the city, not with a stock portfolio, but with his own two hands and the promise of service.\n\n4.\nHe remembers teaching a five-year-old Anjali to ride her bike, not in a park, but in the echoing concrete of the building\u2019s garage. Her triumphant, wobbly laps between parking stalls felt like a surreal suburban moment played out in an urban cavern. He felt a pang that she didn't have a yard, but also a fierce pride that he had carved out a safe space for her childhood within the building\u2019s walls. In that garage, he wasn\u2019t just the manager; he was simply a father.\n\n5.\nJust last year, he went to fix a simple leak under Mrs. Gable's sink in 3A and found her crying softly. The dripping pipe reminded her of something her late husband would have fixed. David finished the job, then simply sat with her at her kitchen table while she spoke about him for nearly an hour. In her quiet grief, his purpose crystallized: his role was more than wrenches and invoices. He was a keeper of stories, a quiet witness to the lives unfolding above his head."
