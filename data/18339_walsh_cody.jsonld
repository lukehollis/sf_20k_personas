The son of a car mechanic and a fastidious bookkeeper, he grew up with a deep appreciation for how things worked. While his friends played video games, Cody could be found in the garage, dismantling old lawnmowers and radios, meticulously sketching their components before reassembling them. This innate curiosity for form and function made his choice to study Industrial Design at San Francisco State University a natural one.\n\nUniversity was an awakening. For the first time, Cody was surrounded by people who shared his passion for creating tangible objects. He thrived, but his first job as a junior designer for a consumer electronics company proved disillusioning. He watched, frustrated, as his elegant, user-focused designs were compromised and delayed by inefficient production lines and poor communication. The turning point came when a product he'd poured his heart into was canceled due to manufacturing failures. In that moment, Cody realized his true talent wasn't just in conception, but in execution. He pivoted, taking courses in supply chain management and leveraging his design knowledge to move into production.\n\nNow, as a Production Manager, Cody is in his element. He spends his days at a modern manufacturing facility in the Dogpatch, ensuring that beautiful, well-designed products are made correctly and on time. His 3.8-mile commute from his Potrero Hill apartment is a cherished ritual, a short ride on the T Third Street light rail that gives him time to read or simply watch the city wake up. The neighborhood, with its blend of industrial history and creative energy, feels like home.\n\nHis social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, a mix of fellow designers and tech workers he\u2019s known since college. Weekends are for rock climbing at Dogpatch Boulders, trying new breweries, and long bike rides across the Golden Gate Bridge. Though a long-term relationship ended two years ago, he\u2019s cautiously optimistic about dating. His core aspiration is to one day open his own small-batch manufacturing studio in the Bay Area, focusing on sustainable furniture and ethical production\u2014a perfect fusion of his designer\u2019s heart and his manager\u2019s mind."

After three days of diagrams and careful disassembly, he slid the final screw into place on the old transistor radio. He held his breath, turned the dial, and a crackle of static gave way to a faint melody. His dad, wiping grease from a wrench, gave him a slow, approving nod. It wasn\u2019t just a repair; it was the first time Cody felt the pure, electric thrill of making something broken work again. That feeling became his compass.\n\n2.\nHe\u2019ll never forget the cold, impersonal subject line: \u201cProject Nightingale: Sunset.\u201d His elegant portable speaker design\u2014the one with the perfect weight and feel he\u2019d spent months on\u2014was dead. Not from a design flaw, but a supply chain failure. The initial wave of frustration was quickly replaced by a cold, hard clarity. A beautiful idea was useless if it couldn't be built. That was the moment he stopped being just a designer and started the journey to becoming a maker. It occurred during his first job out of college.\n\n3.\nIt was a few weeks after the breakup, his forearms burning on a difficult problem at Dogpatch Boulders. He\u2019d fallen from this exact spot a dozen times. But this time, encouraged by his friends, he found a new grip, trusted his feet, and pulled himself over the top. The physical release was immediate and overwhelming, a cathartic shedding of the weight he\u2019d been carrying. In that moment of exhaustion and triumph, he didn\u2019t just conquer a wall; he confirmed he was strong enough to hold himself up.\n\n4.\nWalking home in Potrero Hill last year, he saw it on the curb: a gorgeous, mid-century modern armchair, discarded. He knelt to inspect it, his fingers tracing the elegant lines before finding the cause: a single, poorly engineered joint that had failed. A beautiful object, rendered into trash by a small manufacturing oversight. The sight sparked not just sadness, but a clear vision. He wouldn't just design beautiful things; he would build them to endure, fusing form with flawless function. The seed for his own studio was planted.\n\n5.\nIt wasn't a single event, but a recurring moment of peace. The gentle rocking of the T Third Street train on an early Tuesday morning, book resting in his lap. As the car rounded the bend towards the Dogpatch, the rising sun would catch the cranes and warehouses, turning the industrial landscape into something golden and alive. In that quiet, sublime stillness, watching the city awaken, he felt a profound sense of belonging. This was his place, his rhythm, his life working exactly as designed."
