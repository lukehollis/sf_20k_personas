This was the gift of her Native Hawaiian mother, a value woven into the fabric of her upbringing in K\u0101ne\u02bbohe, O\u02bbahu. Her Filipino father, a pragmatic hotel maintenance manager, taught her diligence and the quiet strength of showing up every day. Growing up surrounded by the embrace of 'ohana, both by blood and by community, instilled in Sarah a deep-seated empathy that would define her future.\n\nThe mainland was a deliberate choice, a world away from the island\u2019s familiar warmth. She pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of Hawai`i but felt a pull toward a larger, more complex urban environment. The turning point came during her grandmother's protracted battle with cancer. Sarah witnessed firsthand the overwhelming maze of the healthcare system and the emotional toll it took on her family. It wasn't the doctors, but a compassionate social worker who became their lifeline, translating medical jargon, finding resources, and offering a steadying presence. In that experience, Sarah found her calling. She moved to San Francisco and earned her Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 37, Sarah works from her small but sunny apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her desk, where she spends her days on telehealth calls and navigating crises for patients across the city. She acts as a bridge between scared patients and an impersonal system, a job that is both profoundly rewarding and emotionally draining. To decompress, she takes long, foggy walks in Golden Gate Park or drives to Ocean Beach, the cold Pacific air a stark but comforting echo of home.\n\nHer social life is her chosen 'ohana\u2014a tight-knit group of friends who gather for weekly potlucks, sharing stories and laughter that replenish her spirit. Though dedicated to her work, Sarah dreams of a more direct, hands-on form of healing. She aspires to one day open a small wellness practice in the city, one that integrates clinical social work with the holistic, community-focused principles of her Hawaiian heritage, creating a true space of m\u0101lama in the heart of San Francisco."

Her father had gently explained it was nature\u2019s way, but her mother knelt beside her, whispering about *m\u0101lama*. Together, they made a small bed in a shoebox. The bird didn\u2019t survive the night, but Sarah never forgot the weight of that tiny, fragile life. It wasn't about saving it, her mother had said, but about offering it care and dignity in its final moments. It was her first, truest lesson in empathy.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe hospital hallway felt miles long, the air thick with antiseptic and her family\u2019s silent fear. Her grandmother was fading, and the doctors\u2019 words were a tangled, clinical mess. Then the social worker, a woman named Grace, sat with them. She brought them water and just listened, her presence a quiet anchor in their storm. In that moment of profound relief, Sarah saw her future. It wasn't in healing bodies, but in holding hands in hallways, making the unbearable just a little more bearable. This happened when she was 23.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHer first year in San Francisco, the loneliness was a physical ache. Desperate for a piece of home, she drove to Ocean Beach. The biting wind and gunmetal-gray water were a shock, so unlike K\u0101ne\u02bbohe's warm embrace. But as she watched the powerful, churning waves, she felt a different kind of connection\u2014a shared strength. The Pacific was the same ocean, just with a different face. It taught her, at 25, that she could adapt and find comfort in echoes, that she was resilient enough for this new life.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was a telehealth call with an elderly man, recently widowed and terrified by a new diagnosis. He spoke only Cantonese. Through a crackling translation line, Sarah didn't offer a cure. She simply listened, patiently explaining the next small step, repeating it until the fear in his eyes on the screen softened into understanding. The call left her emotionally drained, but with a fierce sense of purpose. At 34, she knew this was the core of her work: being a calm voice that bridges the gap between fear and the system.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a brutal week of back-to-back crises, she almost skipped potluck. She went anyway, slumping onto her friend\u2019s couch, too tired to talk. Without a word, her friend Ben simply handed her a steaming bowl of sinigang, its sour warmth a taste of her father's home. No questions asked. In that simple act of care from her chosen 'ohana, her spirit felt replenished. At 36, it solidified her belief that *m\u0101lama* was a current that flowed both ways\u2014something she gave and, thankfully, received."
