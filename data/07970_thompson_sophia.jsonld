Growing up in Fresno, her childhood playground was her father\u2019s auto repair shop, a chaotic space filled with the scent of grease and the satisfying click of a socket wrench. While her friends played with dolls, Sophia was taking apart old VCRs and building wobbly go-karts. This innate curiosity for mechanics led her to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where she pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering, thriving in its \u201cLearn by Doing\u201d environment.\n\nA summer internship between her junior and senior years was the decisive turning point. She landed a spot at a small, innovative hardware startup in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood, a company specializing in custom robotics components. The energy of the city and the challenge of creating tangible, cutting-edge products on a small scale was intoxicating. She fell in love with the process, from digital model to physical prototype. Upon graduation, accepting their full-time offer for a Junior Manufacturing Engineer position was an easy choice.\n\nNow, at 24, Sophia\u2019s life is a model of hyperlocal efficiency. She lives in a modern live-work loft, just a few doors down from the workshop, making her commute a 30-second walk. Her days are spent calibrating CNC machines, refining 3D printing processes, and problem-solving on the assembly line. Her world is contained within the industrial-chic blocks of Dogpatch; she gets coffee at a local roaster, unwinds after work at Dogpatch Boulders climbing gym, and socializes with a tight-knit circle of colleagues and climbing friends.\n\nSophia feels deeply connected not to the iconic, tourist-facing San Francisco, but to its identity as a hub for makers and innovators. She isn\u2019t just living in the city; she\u2019s actively building parts of it. Her dream is to eventually lead her own product design firm, creating beautiful, functional hardware that improves people's lives. For now, she\u2019s content honing her craft, one perfectly manufactured component at a time."
