            "value": "Rahim Ali Miller is a product of two distinct San Franciscos. His father, Anis Ali, was an electrical engineer from Karachi, Pakistan, who immigrated in the 1970s and, unable to get his credentials recognized, opened a small repair shop in the Outer Richmond. His mother, Susan Miller, was a free-spirited artist from Oregon whom Anis met at a cafe in the Haight. Rahim grew up above the shop, a childhood scented with solder and ocean fog, his world a mix of his father\u2019s precise schematics and his mother\u2019s vibrant, abstract canvases.\n\nPressured to pursue a more \"American\" path of success, Rahim enrolled in a business program at a local community college. He found it soul-crushingly dull. The theories felt hollow compared to the tangible satisfaction of diagnosing a faulty amplifier or reviving a dead turntable. The turning point came when his father had a minor stroke at 60. Rahim dropped out of college to run the shop full-time, discovering he not only had his father\u2019s knack for repair but also his patient, methodical temperament. It was a relief to finally embrace the work he was meant to do.\n\nAfter his father passed, Rahim renamed the shop \"Miller's Modern Repairs,\" a quiet tribute to both his parents. He is a neighborhood fixture, the man who can fix anything from a vintage radio to a high-end espresso machine. His life is woven into the blocks around his shop. He met his wife, Lena, a schoolteacher, when she brought in a sputtering laptop. They now have a teenage daughter, Maya, who has her mother\u2019s sharp wit and her grandfather\u2019s artistic eye.\n\nRahim\u2019s days are governed by a simple routine: coffee from the bakery on the corner, opening the shop shutters at 9 AM, and troubleshooting the city\u2019s broken treasures. He lives a life measured in successful repairs and conversations with neighbors. His greatest hope is simply to keep the shop viable against the city\u2019s rising costs, preserving a small piece of old San Francisco. He dreams of passing on not just the business, but the value of mending what is broken\u2014a philosophy he feels the ever-changing city has begun to forget."
