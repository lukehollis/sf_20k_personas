Though born in Oakland, she was raised on her grandmother's vivid stories of the Fillmore District\u2014a vibrant Black cultural hub before redevelopment scattered her family across the bay. This inherited sense of displacement became the quiet engine of Aisha's ambition, fueling a desire to understand and shape the forces that define a city.\n\nHer path was focused. After earning a degree in sociology from UC Berkeley, she pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, specializing in transportation equity. She began her career in Washington, D.C., learning the cold mechanics of federal policy, but her heart remained in the Bay. The turning point came when a Senior Planner position opened with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). It felt less like a job application and more like answering a call to come home.\n\nNow 40, Aisha lives in a meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley, her designated home office affording her a 0.0-mile commute. Her days are a digital tapestry of GIS data, traffic flow models, and Zoom meetings with community stakeholders. Her work is her life, and her life is the city. She conducts \"field research\" by taking the 21-Hayes to Golden Gate Park or tracing the proposed route for a new bus-only lane on foot, observing the human element that data alone can't capture.\n\nAisha\u2019s social life is a small, warm circle of fellow public servants, artists, and old college friends. Evenings are often spent at a friend's potluck or quietly sketching ideas in her notebook. Her great aspiration isn't a promotion, but a legacy project: a comprehensive plan to restore and enhance transit connections to the city\u2019s remaining Black communities, making them more accessible and vital. For Aisha, planning San Francisco's future is a deeply personal act of rebuilding the connections her family once lost."
