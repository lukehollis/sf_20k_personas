Raised in the orderly suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a civil engineer, he inherited a belief in sturdy, well-designed systems, whether they governed a society or supported a bridge. This methodical worldview propelled him through his undergraduate studies in Political Science and into a Master of Public Policy program at Georgetown University.\n\nHis early career was forged in the predictable crucible of Washington D.C., working as a junior analyst for a federal agency. For six years, he honed his skills, but grew disillusioned with the glacial pace of federal bureaucracy and the toxic partisanship. A key turning point came during a visit to a friend in San Francisco. He was captivated by the city's urgent, complex problems\u2014housing, transit, homelessness\u2014which felt tangible and, crucially, solvable on a local level. Within a year, he accepted a position with the City and County of San Francisco.\n\nDaniel relocated with a long-term partner, but the transition fractured their relationship, which ended eighteen months after their move. The breakup left him feeling adrift, and he retreated into his work. Living and working from his one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, his world became hyper-local. His days follow a strict rhythm: a morning coffee from a nearby cafe, hours spent immersed in data sets and policy briefs, and a late-afternoon run through the Panhandle to clear his head. His social life is small but consistent, revolving around a weekend running club that traverses the city\u2019s hills.\n\nNow at 38, Daniel finds a deep satisfaction in his work, drafting policies he believes can genuinely improve civic life. He dreams of authoring a landmark piece of housing legislation that measurably impacts affordability. Personally, however, a quiet longing persists. He hopes to build a relationship as stable and supportive as the systems he studies, to find a connection that makes his small apartment feel less like a workspace and more like a home."
