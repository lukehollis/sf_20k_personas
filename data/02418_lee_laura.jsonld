Raised in a pragmatic Ohio household by an architect father and a librarian mother, Laura\u2019s love for art was her private rebellion. While her parents appreciated form and function, she was drawn to the chaotic, emotional world of abstract expressionism. This passion led her to the East Coast, where she earned a selective graduate degree in Art History and Provenance\u2014a field that satisfied both her aesthetic sensibilities and her father\u2019s demand for a practical application.\n\nHer early career unfolded in New York\u2019s gallery scene, where she met and married a charismatic investment banker. For a decade, she lived a life adjacent to her passions, attending galas and helping her husband\u2019s firm acquire art, but she felt more like an accessory than an authority. The turning point was a quiet, amicable divorce at 40. With her settlement, she moved to San Francisco, determined to build a career entirely on her own terms.\n\nShe established her consultancy from her new home, leveraging her niche expertise in art authentication and valuation. Her business, built on word-of-mouth among Silicon Valley\u2019s new money and old-guard collectors, flourished. Now, at 53, Laura\u2019s life is a seamless blend of personal and professional. Her days consist of video calls with clients in Zurich, researching auction catalogs, and taking walks to the nearby SFJAZZ Center for inspiration. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of gallery owners, chefs, and artists she\u2019s championed.\n\nRespected and independent, Laura has no desire to remarry. Her connection to San Francisco is deeply ingrained in her work and lifestyle\u2014she thrives on the city\u2019s fusion of innovation and culture. Her future aspiration isn't about wealth, but legacy. She dreams of using her connections to establish a fellowship for emerging Bay Area artists, ensuring the city that gave her a second chance continues to nurture the next generation of talent."
