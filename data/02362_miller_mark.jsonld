            "value": "Mark Miller was born Min-jun Park, the only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond. His father, a man who believed American success required an American name, chose \"Mark Miller\" from a phone book, hoping it would smooth his son's path. Growing up, Mark felt the immense pressure of his parents\u2019 sacrifice. He was quiet and observant, more interested in the inner workings of the delivery trucks outside the store than in his schoolbooks.\n\nHe graduated from high school without distinction, disappointing his father who had hoped for a university education. Mark tried a semester at City College but felt lost. Instead, he found his calling in the structured, mechanical world of auto repair, working in a garage in the Bayview. For years, this was his life: the smell of oil, the satisfaction of a humming engine, and the camaraderie of the shop. A key turning point came during the 2008 recession when the garage, unable to compete, closed its doors. Suddenly adrift at 38, Mark needed stability.\n\nOn a whim, he applied to be a Muni bus driver. He excelled in the training, his mechanical aptitude giving him an innate understanding of the vehicles. For the past sixteen years, driving a bus has been his life. He lives in a small, subsidized apartment in a transit-owned building right beside a Muni yard in the Dogpatch, hence his 0.0-mile commute. His day begins before dawn with a walk across the yard.\n\nMark is divorced; his marriage frayed under the financial stress of his younger years. He has a daughter, Chloe, now 27, who works in tech and lives in a sleek SoMa apartment\u2014a world away from his own. They have a loving, if somewhat formal, relationship, meeting for dim sum every other Sunday. His true community consists of fellow drivers and the handful of regulars who greet him on the 22-Fillmore line.\n\nFrom his driver\u2019s seat, Mark has become a silent chronicler of San Francisco, watching neighborhoods gentrify and demographics shift. His hope isn't for wealth or recognition, but for a quiet retirement. He dreams of buying a small fishing boat, spending his days on the Bay, away from the traffic and the noise, finally enjoying the city not as a servant to its rhythm, but as a peaceful observer."
