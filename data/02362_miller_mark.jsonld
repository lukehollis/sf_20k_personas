            "value": "Mark Miller was born Min-jun Park, the only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond. His father, a man who believed American success required an American name, chose \"Mark Miller\" from a phone book, hoping it would smooth his son's path. Growing up, Mark felt the immense pressure of his parents\u2019 sacrifice. He was quiet and observant, more interested in the inner workings of the delivery trucks outside the store than in his schoolbooks.\n\nHe graduated from high school without distinction, disappointing his father who had hoped for a university education. Mark tried a semester at City College but felt lost. Instead, he found his calling in the structured, mechanical world of auto repair, working in a garage in the Bayview. For years, this was his life: the smell of oil, the satisfaction of a humming engine, and the camaraderie of the shop. A key turning point came during the 2008 recession when the garage, unable to compete, closed its doors. Suddenly adrift at 38, Mark needed stability.\n\nOn a whim, he applied to be a Muni bus driver. He excelled in the training, his mechanical aptitude giving him an innate understanding of the vehicles. For the past sixteen years, driving a bus has been his life. He lives in a small, subsidized apartment in a transit-owned building right beside a Muni yard in the Dogpatch, hence his 0.0-mile commute. His day begins before dawn with a walk across the yard.\n\nMark is divorced; his marriage frayed under the financial stress of his younger years. He has a daughter, Chloe, now 27, who works in tech and lives in a sleek SoMa apartment\u2014a world away from his own. They have a loving, if somewhat formal, relationship, meeting for dim sum every other Sunday. His true community consists of fellow drivers and the handful of regulars who greet him on the 22-Fillmore line.\n\nFrom his driver\u2019s seat, Mark has become a silent chronicler of San Francisco, watching neighborhoods gentrify and demographics shift. His hope isn't for wealth or recognition, but for a quiet retirement. He dreams of buying a small fishing boat, spending his days on the Bay, away from the traffic and the noise, finally enjoying the city not as a servant to its rhythm, but as a peaceful observer."

His father, whose hands were always stained from unpacking produce, explained in halting English that this name was a key. It would unlock doors Min-jun Park couldn\u2019t. Around age seven, Mark didn\u2019t understand about doors, only that his real name was suddenly a secret for inside the house. He felt the weight of the new name settle on him, a borrowed coat that never quite fit.\n\n2.\nThe last day at the Bayview shop in 2008, the silence was the worst part. For years, his life had a soundtrack of impact wrenches and friendly cursing. Now, there was only the smell of cold grease and the hollow echo of his own footsteps. His boss shook his hand, eyes downcast. At 38, Mark felt the floor drop out. He hadn\u2019t just lost a job; he\u2019d lost the one place where his hands, not his grades, had made him feel competent. The failure stung more than any bad report card.\n\n3.\nHis first solo run on the 22-Fillmore, sixteen years ago. His hands, usually slick with oil, were sweating on the massive steering wheel as he pulled away from the yard. For the first time since the garage closed, he felt a sense of control. He wasn\u2019t under the machine, but in command of it. Watching the city wake up through the vast windshield\u2014the pastel houses, the early commuters\u2014he wasn't just driving; he was holding a small, moving piece of the city. It was a quiet, profound power.\n\n4.\nHe remembers Chloe, about five years ago, insisting on paying for their Sunday dim sum. She tapped her phone to the terminal with a casual flick of her wrist. In that small gesture, he saw the entire world that separated them. He had counted out greasy bills from the garage his whole life; she lived in a world of invisible money. He was proud, overwhelmingly so, but it was a distant pride. He knew then he\u2019d helped build her a life he could only witness from across the table.\n\n5.\nIt was a rainy Tuesday last year, traffic snarled on the approach to the Mission. Through the rain-streaked window of his bus, he saw it: a small fishing boat bobbing on the choppy gray waters of the Bay. The man on board was alone, bundled against the weather. In that instant, Mark\u2019s vague desire for peace took a concrete shape. That boat. That solitude. The idea became a beacon, a promise he made to himself that one day he would trade the rumble of his engine for the gentle rock of the waves."
