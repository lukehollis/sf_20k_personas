            "value": "David Wong\u2019s name is the first chapter of his story. Adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese-American couple, he was raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. Growing up a white child in a predominantly Asian household and neighborhood, David navigated a unique cultural space. He felt the warmth of his family\u2019s heritage in the Cantonese spoken at home and the weekly dim sum rituals, yet he was always conscious of the questions his appearance provoked. This constant negotiation of identity didn't create conflict but instead fostered a deep, early-onset empathy and an awareness of the complexities of belonging.\n\nHis upbringing directly shaped his professional calling. After earning a bachelor's at SF State, he pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, driven by a desire to help children navigating complex family systems. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, David works with students and families across the city\u2019s public schools and associated health clinics. He excels at connecting with youths who feel like outsiders, using the lessons from his own life to create spaces of trust and understanding. His work is not just a job; it is the fulfillment of a purpose forged in the fog-laced streets of his youth.\n\nDavid now lives in the Castro with his partner of eight years, a landscape architect named Alex. His daily routine is grounded in the city\u2019s rhythm. He takes the K-Ingleside Muni downtown, a 3.8-mile journey that gives him time to decompress with a podcast before facing the day\u2019s emotional demands. Evenings are for home-cooked meals and walks with their terrier, Gus, through Duboce Park. On Sundays, he and Alex drive out to the Sunset to have dinner with his aging parents, a cherished weekly tradition that anchors him to his roots.\n\nLooking forward, David dreams of opening a small private practice focused on transracial adoption and identity counseling. More personally, he hopes to take his parents on a trip to their ancestral village in Guangdong province, a journey he sees as the ultimate expression of gratitude for the life and the name they gave him. For David, San Francisco isn't just a home; its diverse, interwoven communities are the very fabric of his identity."

A woman asked his mother in Cantonese why the *gwei zai*\u2014the foreign child\u2014was at their table. David felt a hot sting of shame, then saw the unshakeable calm on his mother's face as she replied, \u201cHe is my son.\u201d The words were a shield and a declaration. In that moment, he learned that family was a truth you asserted, a bond stronger than the confused glances of strangers. It was the first brick in his foundation of empathy.\n\n2.\nHe was fourteen when a classmate joked that \"Wong\" was a strange last name for him. Instead of the anger he expected to feel, a calm certainty settled in. He simply explained, \"I was adopted. It's my family's name, so it's my name.\" The other kid fell silent, embarrassed. It was the first time David realized his story wasn't a liability, but a tool\u2014one that could dismantle assumptions and build a small bridge of understanding. He felt powerful, not different.\n\n3.\nDuring his graduate internship, he met a quiet seventh-grader from El Salvador, isolated by language and culture. David sat with him, not as a therapist, but as another person who understood being an outsider. They drew pictures of their favorite home-cooked meals. Seeing the boy's face light up with recognition, David felt a click of absolute purpose. He wasn't just helping; he was translating the language of belonging, a fluency he'd spent his whole life acquiring. His career was no longer a choice, but a calling.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the frustration of building a bookshelf with Alex in their first Castro apartment. An Allen key was missing, a board was backward. They bickered, then suddenly burst out laughing at the absurdity. Sitting on the floor amidst the mess, Alex said, \u201cWe need a dog to supervise.\u201d In that moment of shared, imperfect creation, David felt the true meaning of partnership. Home wasn't a finished product; it was the joyful, messy process of building it together. They adopted Gus the following week.\n\n5.\nJust last year, at their Sunday dinner, his father\u2019s hands, now frail and spotted with age, patiently showed him again how to fold a wonton. \u201cThe seal must be perfect,\u201d he\u2019d said in Cantonese, his voice softer than David remembered. David was overcome by a profound tenderness and a sharp awareness of time. This man had given him a name, a family, a legacy. The dream of taking his parents to Guangdong solidified into a quiet, urgent promise he owed them."
