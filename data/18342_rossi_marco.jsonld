Born in the gritty, working-class Excelsior district, he was the son of a Sicilian-American fisherman and a Filipina-American seamstress. His childhood was a symphony of foghorns, the clatter of a sewing machine, and the distinct aroma of salt and diesel from his father's boat. Formal education was never the priority in a household where survival was earned with calloused hands. Marco scraped by, graduating high school with a general diploma and little ambition beyond finding steady work.\n\nHe started in construction, framing houses in the Sunset and learning the city's bones from the inside out. The turning point came in his early twenties. While renovating a dilapidated Victorian in the Mission, he watched the property sell for a price that dwarfed his entire crew\u2019s yearly earnings. He realized the real money wasn't in the labor, but in the land itself. Scrimping and saving, he earned his real estate license at 24 and attacked the market with the tenacity of a man who knew what it was like to have nothing. He outworked, out-hustled, and out-learned everyone, building a reputation for finding value where others saw decay.\n\nHis first investment was a small, two-unit building in a then-overlooked corner of SoMa. That one success became two, then ten. Now, at 52, Marco is the principal broker of his own successful firm, Rossi Realty. He lives in a beautifully renovated Marina home with his long-term partner, Olivia, an art curator, and their teenage daughter, Sofia. His 5.5-mile commute in his Tesla is a daily journey through the city he helped reshape.\n\nMarco remains tethered to the old San Francisco, often driving through his old neighborhood, a ghost of the past. He\u2019s proud of his success but feels a pang of loss for the city of his youth. His greatest aspiration is simple: to ensure his daughter has the educational choices he never did, free to build a life on a foundation he spent his own laying, one property at a time."

His father, smelling of the bay itself, hands him a thermos of coffee, its warmth a small miracle against the cold. It wasn\u2019t a choice, it was just life\u2014a raw, honest living wrested from the water. This memory is an anchor; it reminds him that before he owned the land, his family belonged to the sea, the true foundation of the old city.\n\n2.\nAt 23, leaning against a ladder on Valencia Street, sweat stinging his eyes, he watched a couple in crisp clothes take the keys to the Victorian his crew had resurrected. They\u2019d paid a figure that felt like a fantasy. In that moment, the hammer in his hand felt impossibly heavy, a tool of labor, not of wealth. A quiet, cold fury settled in him\u2014not at them, but at his own blindness. He decided right then he would stop building walls and start owning them.\n\n3.\nThe key to the SoMa duplex felt alien in his calloused palm. He was 25. He stood in the dingy, empty unit, the air smelling of dust and neglect. This wasn't a job site; it was *his*. Every dollar was a sacrifice, every late night studying for his license. This small, overlooked property wasn't just an investment; it was the first brick in a new life, a testament to his own grit. It was the first time he felt the intoxicating power of ownership.\n\n4.\nOne evening, around 45, Olivia was explaining the nuance of a painting she\u2019d acquired. He stood beside her in their Marina home, looking past her towards the bay, watching the fog roll over the Golden Gate. For a second, he saw a ghost ship\u2014his father\u2019s boat. He was straddling two worlds: one of fine art and expansive views, the other of fish guts and engine grease. The life he\u2019d built was beautiful, but it felt a universe away from the one that had built him.\n\n5.\nJust last week, he found Sofia, now 16, asleep at their dining table, surrounded by textbooks for classes he couldn\u2019t even name. Her brow was furrowed in concentration even in sleep. He felt a wave of profound, quiet pride that almost buckled his knees. All the hustle, the deals, the relentless drive\u2014it all distilled into this one simple, peaceful image. He wasn't just building an empire of property; he was building a foundation for her, a world of choices he never had."
