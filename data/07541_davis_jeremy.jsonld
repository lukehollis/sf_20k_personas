Born and raised in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, he was the son of staunchly practical parents\u2014a high school math teacher and a dental hygienist\u2014who viewed his early fascination with art as a frivolous phase. His childhood was a quiet rebellion fought with sketchbooks and secret trips to the art museum, where he felt a sense of belonging he never found on the football field or in the church pew.\n\nThis yearning for a different world propelled him east for college and eventually to a Master\u2019s degree in Art History from a Boston university. It was there he learned the language and theory of art, but found the East Coast scene's entrenched elitism suffocating. A post-graduation internship at SFMOMA was meant to be a three-month stint; instead, it became his life's turning point. He fell for San Francisco\u2019s scrappy, innovative, and less pretentious art community. He never left. After years of working his way up through assistant roles, he landed his current position as manager of a prominent contemporary gallery in Hayes Valley.\n\nAt 46, Jeremy\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. His 0.0-mile commute is a simple walk down a flight of stairs from his sleek, minimalist apartment to the gallery below. His days are a rhythm of liaising with artists, courting collectors, and planning installations. His social life orbits his profession; his closest friends are the artists he represents and a few other gallery owners with whom he shares a cynical but deeply felt camaraderie. He is respected for his keen eye and calm demeanor, though some find him reserved and difficult to truly know.\n\nJeremy\u2019s dream is not of wealth, but of legacy. He aspires to discover and launch the career of a visionary Bay Area artist, someone whose work will resonate on a national scale and validate his entire career. He loves San Francisco for its persistent, rebellious creative spirit\u2014the very thing that saved him from a life he was expected to live. His curated existence is his sanctuary, a testament to a life built on his own terms, one masterpiece at a time."
