            "value": "Mei Lin is a daughter of the San Francisco fog. Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the rhythmic clang of the N Judah streetcar. Her parents, immigrants from Guangzhou, poured their life savings and relentless effort into a small neighborhood grocery store, instilling in Mei a profound respect for hard work and community. While they hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career in medicine or law, Mei was drawn to the wild expanse of Ocean Beach, just blocks from her home. Watching the relentless tide and collecting oddly shaped driftwood sparked a deep curiosity about the natural systems governing her world.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Davis for her undergraduate degree and then to UC Santa Barbara\u2019s Bren School for a Master's in Environmental Science and Management. It was a turning point, a gentle rebellion against her parents' practical dreams. She wanted to protect the very environment they had crossed an ocean to give her a future in.\n\nNow 28, Mei works as an Environmental Consultant. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bed to a standing desk in the corner of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are a digital collage of emissions data, sustainability reports, and virtual meetings with corporate clients she helps navigate California\u2019s complex environmental regulations. The work is meaningful but sometimes feels abstract, a battle fought with spreadsheets instead of in the soil.\n\nTo combat the isolation of remote work, Mei is fiercely intentional about her life outside her apartment. She starts most mornings with a run through Golden Gate Park, reconnecting with the green spaces that inspired her. Evenings are for rock climbing at Mission Cliffs with friends from her graduate program or trying new restaurants in her neighborhood. She has a deep, almost familial bond with San Francisco; she sees the threat of sea-level rise not as a data point, but as a future tide threatening the streets of her childhood.\n\nHer dream is to transition from consulting to a hands-on policy role at a non-profit or city agency, shaping the future of urban sustainability directly. More personally, she dreams of one day owning a small condo with a balcony big enough for a real garden\u2014a tangible piece of the nature she has dedicated her life to protecting."
