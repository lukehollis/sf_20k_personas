Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, his childhood was spent in his father\u2019s auto-body shop, a world of grease, steel, and the satisfying clang of tools. While his mother pushed for a traditional academic path, Kevin was most comfortable deconstructing old lawnmower engines. This practical foundation led him to pursue a degree in Industrial Design, a compromise that satisfied his parents' desire for a Bachelor's degree and his own need to create.\n\nUpon graduating, Kevin recoiled from the sterile world of corporate design\u2014endless meetings about abstract user experiences felt dishonest to him. He wanted to feel the grit of the material. A pivotal moment came when he turned down a lucrative job offer to instead apprentice at a small metalworking shop in Oakland. It was there he found his calling, mastering everything from CNC milling to traditional welding.\n\nEventually, Kevin saved enough to take the ultimate leap: leasing a cavernous live/work warehouse in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. This move cemented his identity. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his integrated life; he wakes in his loft apartment to the faint scent of ozone and sawdust drifting up from his workshop below. As Prototyping & Fabrication Manager, he now leads a small, dedicated team, turning the ambitious concepts of tech startups and industrial designers into tangible realities.\n\nHis social life is small but tight-knit, consisting of other makers, engineers, and the patrons of the local brewery where schematics are often sketched on napkins. A recent breakup with a partner who craved a life outside the workshop\u2019s orbit has left him feeling solitary, yet even more dedicated to his craft. Kevin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t expansion or a buyout; it\u2019s mastery. He aspires to be the craftsman that people seek out for the impossible projects, a quiet but essential part of San Francisco\u2019s industrial heart, finding his peace not in spreadsheets, but in the precision of a perfect weld."
