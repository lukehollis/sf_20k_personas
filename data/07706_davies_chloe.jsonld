Growing up in a small, close-knit town in Ohio, her childhood was defined by her mother\u2019s long, degenerative illness. While her father was the primary caregiver, Chloe became an expert in navigating the emotional labyrinth of the healthcare system\u2014the confusing paperwork, the well-meaning but detached doctors, and the profound need for a human advocate in moments of crisis. This experience became the bedrock of her future.\n\nShe pursued a degree in psychology before moving to the west coast for a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn by its reputation and a desire for a fresh start. The turning point came during her second year of grad school when her mother passed away. The grief was immense, but it solidified her vocational calling. She wasn't just studying social work; she was living its purpose. Upon graduating, she accepted a position as a medical social worker, specializing in palliative and hospice care coordination.\n\nNow 34, Chloe lives and works from her quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a blessing, creating a necessary boundary between her emotionally taxing work and her personal life. Her days are a structured rhythm of video calls with patients and their families, coordinating care, and acting as a steady, compassionate voice in the midst of chaos.\n\nTo decompress, she walks. Her apartment\u2019s proximity to Golden Gate Park is no accident. She spends her evenings and weekends tracing its trails, finding solace under the cypress trees. Her social circle is small but fiercely loyal, comprised mostly of other healthcare professionals who understand the unique pressures of the field. Chloe's connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t in its bustling nightlife or tech-driven ambition, but in the quiet neighborhood corners, the local Clement Street Farmers Market, and the fog rolling over the park. Her dream is to one day develop a specialized support program for the families of chronically ill patients, turning the pain of her past into a resource for others."
