As the only child of immigrants who poured their life savings into their Clement Street bakery, Mei was expected to inherit their legacy. She was a dutiful daughter, but her mind wandered far beyond spreadsheets of flour costs and baking schedules. Instead, she was fascinated by the intricate social tapestries of the city around her.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley, where, to her parents' quiet dismay, she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. She loved studying the forces that shaped communities, but post-graduation, she faced a harsh reality: her degree offered more theories than job prospects. This became her pivotal turning point. Unwilling to retreat to the bakery, she enrolled in an intensive data analytics bootcamp, discovering she could apply her sociological lens to the massive datasets of human behavior that powered the tech industry. It was the perfect fusion of her passion and pragmatism.\n\nNow 26, Mei lives a life starkly different from her upbringing. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bed to her desk in a sleek Hayes Valley studio apartment. Her days are a disciplined routine of SQL queries, data visualization, and virtual meetings. To combat the work-from-home isolation, she has rituals: a morning walk to a local coffee roaster, a lunchtime run through Patricia's Green, and evening pottery classes where she can create something tangible.\n\nHer connection to her family remains strong, though tinged with a gentle friction. Her parents are proud of her success but don\u2019t fully understand what she does, only that it pays her San Francisco rent. Her friends, a mix from college and her tech bootcamp, form her chosen family. Mei\u2019s dream is to eventually bridge her worlds\u2014perhaps by founding a startup that uses data analytics to support non-profits or preserve cultural histories like the very Chinatown her parents first called home. For now, she finds meaning in the patterns, both in her datasets and in the vibrant, complex city she navigates daily."
