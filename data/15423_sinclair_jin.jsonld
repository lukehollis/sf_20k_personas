Born in the Outer Sunset to a Korean immigrant mother and a restless American father who left when he was five, Jin\u2019s world was shaped by the quiet determination of his mother and the rhythmic crash of the Pacific Ocean just blocks away. He inherited her work ethic and her gentle demeanor, spending his youth navigating the city on Muni buses and finding solace in the sprawling grounds of Golden Gate Park.\n\nHis educational path was cut short by necessity. During his senior year at Lincoln High, his mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness that required constant care. College was no longer an option; his focus narrowed to supporting and tending to her. This intimate, challenging experience became his true education. He learned about medication schedules, patient comfort, and the profound empathy required to care for someone in their most vulnerable state. After she passed away a few years later, a career in healthcare felt like the only natural progression. He earned his Patient Care Technician certificate and found a position at the UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus Heights, a short ride on the N Judah from the rent-controlled apartment he took over from his mother.\n\nNow 44, Jin\u2019s life moves with a steady, practiced rhythm. His days are spent on his feet, assisting nurses, comforting patients, and finding quiet satisfaction in being a calming presence in the often-chaotic hospital environment. He is well-liked by colleagues for his reliability and dry wit. After his shift, he returns to the familiar quiet of the Sunset. His social life is small but meaningful; a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game with other hospital staff and occasional dim sum in the Richmond with a childhood friend.\n\nJin doesn't dream of wealth or dramatic change. His aspirations are grounded: he hopes to one day save enough to visit his mother's hometown in South Korea and see the places she spoke of. He is woven into the fabric of his San Francisco\u2014not the city of tech booms and headlines, but the one of resilient communities, foggy mornings, and the quiet dignity of a life spent in service to others."

He remembers not his father\u2019s face, but the back of his worn denim jacket disappearing into the white wall of mist at the end of the block. He didn\u2019t cry. Instead, he felt his mother\u2019s hand tighten around his, a small, firm anchor in the sudden quiet. That was the moment his world shrank to the size of their two-person team, a silent pact made against the disappearing world, held together by her strength and the damp, salty air.\n\n2.\nHe remembers a rare sunny afternoon in the Japanese Tea Garden when he was ten. His mother, her hands gentle around a small porcelain cup, pointed to a vibrant pink flower. \"Bongseonhwa,\" she said, the name a soft melody. She told him how they would crush the petals back in her village to dye their fingernails. It wasn\u2019t just a flower; it was a map, a story, a sudden, vivid connection to a place he\u2019d only ever imagined. That feeling, a quiet longing for her Korea, settled deep within him.\n\n3.\nThe college acceptance letter from SF State sat on the kitchen table. He was seventeen. From the other room, he heard his mother\u2019s cough, a dry, rattling sound that had become the house\u2019s grim rhythm. He looked from the letterhead to the doorway of her room, and the choice was never a choice at all. There was no dramatic sacrifice, just a quiet folding of the paper. In that silent moment, his future pivoted. He let go of one path to fully walk another, accepting a different, more profound kind of education.\n\n4.\nEarly in his career at UCSF, an elderly patient, agitated and lost in a dementia fog, kept pulling at her IV line. The nurses were swamped. Jin sat with her, his hand resting gently over hers. He didn\u2019t talk about medicine; he talked about the K-Ingleside bus, about the smell of rain on eucalyptus trees in Stern Grove. He saw his mother in her frightened eyes. When she quieted, her hand relaxing in his, he felt a click of rightness. This was why. His painful past had become his purpose.\n\n5.\nThe rumble of the N Judah emerging from the Twin Peaks tunnel is a familiar exhale at the end of his shift. As the train rattles toward the ocean, the city's noise recedes, replaced by the hushed gray of the Sunset. He watches the familiar pastel houses slip by, their windows glowing. It\u2019s not an exciting homecoming, but a deep, settled one. This transit\u2014from the managed chaos of the hospital to the quiet constancy of his neighborhood\u2014is the steady, grounding rhythm of his life, a journey he has perfected."
