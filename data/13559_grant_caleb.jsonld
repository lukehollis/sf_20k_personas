Raised within the Yurok Tribe, his childhood was a blend of ancestral tradition and the stark realities of modern reservation life. He listened to the elders' stories, learned the importance of community balance, but also witnessed firsthand the health and social disparities that plagued his people\u2014a lack of culturally competent care that often did more harm than good. This duality fueled a quiet determination within him.\n\nHis educational journey was a deliberate path toward rectifying those injustices. After completing his undergraduate degree at Humboldt State, he moved to the Bay Area for his Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. The city was initially overwhelming, a chaotic symphony compared to the rhythms of his rural home. He began his career as a case manager at a Tenderloin nonprofit, working directly with unhoused and at-risk urban Native populations. This was his turning point; seeing his community's struggles mirrored in an urban environment solidified his professional calling. His aptitude for developing effective, culturally-sensitive outreach programs saw him quickly rise through the ranks.\n\nNow 43, Caleb is the Program Director for a major community health initiative. He lives with his partner of ten years, Marcus, a public school art teacher, in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. His 2.1-mile commute on the J-Church MUNI line is a daily ritual, a time to decompress before diving into a world of grant proposals, staff management, and strategic planning. He feels his dual identity acutely\u2014a respected leader in San Francisco's nonprofit sector who still carries the weight and wisdom of his Yurok heritage.\n\nCaleb\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but practical. He loves the city's mosaic of cultures and the proximity to a vibrant community of activists and creators. His ultimate dream is to expand his program's model, securing enough funding to establish satellite offices that serve Indigenous communities throughout California, blending urban resources with traditional knowledge. He hopes to build a legacy of service that honors his ancestors while forging a healthier future for the next generation."
