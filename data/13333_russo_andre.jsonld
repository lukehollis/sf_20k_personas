Growing up, he spent hours sketching the elegant lines of classic cars, his creativity nurtured by a practical mechanic father and an organized, encouraging school administrator mother. This blend of artistry and structure led him to San Jose State University, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Graphic Design, graduating just as the first dot-com bubble was peaking.\n\nHis initial foray into the professional world was disillusioning\u2014a series of junior design jobs creating uninspired interfaces for bland B2B software. The turning point came when he took a freelance gig designing a mobile booking platform for a small, high-end restaurant group. Suddenly, his work had texture and taste. He was designing not just for usability, but for atmosphere and delight. This project became his portfolio\u2019s centerpiece, landing him a job at a company that specialized in UX for the entertainment and hospitality industries. Now, as a Senior UX Designer, he crafts the digital experiences for everything from exclusive dining clubs to independent film festivals.\n\nAndre lives in a tastefully decorated one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His 2.8-mile commute on the MUNI is a cherished ritual, a time for podcasts or simply observing the city\u2019s morning rhythm. At 39, his life is a curated balance. A long-term relationship ended three years ago, a painful but transformative event that pushed him to channel his energy into his work and community. His social circle is tight-knit, favoring gallery openings and intimate dinner parties over loud bars.\n\nHe feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s aesthetic history. His great hope is to launch a personal project: a digital archive and interactive map of the city\u2019s fading historic neon signs, a tribute to a disappearing art form. Andre envisions a future where he is a Creative Director, perhaps with a partner who shares his passion for art and culture, building a lasting, meaningful life in the city that finally allowed his career and his soul to align."

He didn't just praise the drawing; he pointed with a thick finger. \u201cYou got the line right,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice raspy. \u201cMost people miss that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just approval; it was a mechanic validating an artist\u2019s eye for form. It taught Andre that beauty and function were the same language, a lesson that became the foundation of his entire career.\n\n2.\nAt 24, under the fluorescent hum of a sterile Silicon Valley office, he stared at the screen. He was designing a pop-up modal for an enterprise resource planner. Beige, gray, and a soul-crushing corporate blue. He felt a profound disconnect, as if he were meticulously arranging furniture in a house with no windows. That night, cycling home, he felt his passion shrinking, hardening into a small, useless stone in his gut. He knew this wasn't design; it was just alignment, and it was threatening to erase him.\n\n3.\nHe was at the test dinner for the restaurant group, sitting alone at the bar. He watched a couple use the booking app he\u2019d designed. He saw their fingers move across the warm, amber-hued interface, saw the woman smile at the subtle animation on the confirmation screen. It wasn't about buttons or flows; it was about anticipation, atmosphere, the first note of their special night out. For the first time, his work had a flavor, a texture, and he felt utterly nourished by it.\n\n4.\nMonths after the breakup, walking home through Hayes Valley at dusk, he looked up. He\u2019d passed the New Central Cafe\u2019s neon sign a thousand times, but tonight, its tired turquoise buzz felt like a quiet confidant. It was history, art, and electricity, humming defiantly against the fog. In its flickering light, his grief didn't vanish, but it found a new shape\u2014not an absence, but a quiet space he could now fill with his own passions. The archive project was born in that moment of lonely, luminous clarity.\n\n5.\nLast winter, squeezed into his living room with his four closest friends, sharing a bottle of Barolo. They weren't gossiping; they were passionately debating the new David Hockney exhibition at the de Young. Looking at their animated faces, illuminated by the warm light of his apartment, Andre felt a deep, settled peace. The painful rebuilding years had led to this: a life curated not for show, but for genuine connection. He was home, in every sense of the word, surrounded by the art and people he loved."
