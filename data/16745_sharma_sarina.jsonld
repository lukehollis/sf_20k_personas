The only child of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the late 1960s, she was raised in a home that prized stability and education above all else. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a bank teller, envisioned a secure corporate path for her. Sarina obliged, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration from San Jose State University, her mind already calculating market gaps while her parents saw a steady management track.\n\nHer early career was spent climbing the ladder in traditional retail management for a major department store in the 1990s. She learned the logistics of supply chains and the art of customer relations, but grew increasingly frustrated by the industry's slow adaptation to the rising digital tide. The turning point was the dot-com bust. While others saw collapse, Sarina saw opportunity. In 2003, at age 33, she used her savings and a small business loan to launch an e-commerce platform specializing in ethically sourced, artisan-made home goods\u2014a niche she felt legacy retailers overlooked.\n\nThe first decade was a grueling grind of 80-hour weeks, which ultimately contributed to the amicable end of her marriage. Her company, however, thrived. Her son, now a sophomore at UCLA, grew up packing boxes alongside her.\n\nToday, Sarina lives in a tastefully minimalist Victorian flat in Noe Valley. Her 3.5-mile commute in her Tesla to her SoMa headquarters is a brief, quiet ritual before a day of strategic meetings. Her routine is disciplined: a 6 AM workout, a scan of international markets over coffee, and home by 7 PM for a simple dinner. Her social circle is tight-knit, composed of other female founders and a few old friends from her retail days.\n\nShe loves San Francisco for its relentless innovation cradled by natural beauty\u2014a weekend hike in the Presidio is her preferred method of resetting. Her dream is no longer about growth, but about legacy. She aspires to transition her company into a B-Corp and has begun mentoring young women entering the tech and retail space. More personally, she hopes to travel with her son to India, reconnecting with a heritage she previously had little time to explore."

It was a management position at a stable, boring corporation. She saw the love in his eyes\u2014his deep desire to protect her from risk. In that quiet moment of smiling and folding the paper away, her own ambition crystallized. It wasn't defiance, but a quiet resolve to honor his love by building a security he couldn't yet imagine, entirely on her own terms.\n\n2.\nThe key felt cold and foreign in her hand as it turned the lock on the South of Market warehouse in 2003. The cavernous space smelled of dust and concrete, an emptiness that perfectly mirrored the terror in her stomach. That fear was immediately followed by a breathtaking wave of freedom. This space, this risk, was hers alone. It was the moment she consciously traded the comfort of a predetermined path for the terrifying, exhilarating ownership of her own future.\n\n3.\nIt was nearly 2 AM in the warehouse, sometime in 2008. She found her ten-year-old son, Rohan, fast asleep on a pile of bubble wrap, his cheek smudged with dust. A wave of guilt so sharp it stole her breath washed over her. She gently draped her jacket over him instead of waking him. That image became her fortress. It wasn't just a business anymore; it was a silent promise that his sacrifice would build a future so bright it would eclipse these hard, exhausting nights.\n\n4.\nShe keeps a printed email from 2010, the paper now soft at the edges. It was from a woman who ran a weaving cooperative in Rajasthan, who wrote that Sarina\u2019s latest order meant three new girls in her village could afford to attend school. Reading it, Sarina wept at her desk. It was the first time profit felt secondary. That single email transformed her company's mission from a clever market opportunity into a tangible, human connection, validating every risk she had ever taken.\n\n5.\nOn a recent Saturday, standing on a Presidio trail overlooking the Golden Gate, her phone buzzed. It was a photo from her son at a UCLA event, beaming. Looking from the screen to the vast, beautiful expanse of the bay, she felt a profound sense of peace. The frantic, relentless climb felt\u2026 complete. In that quiet, breezy moment, ambition shifted from growth to gratitude. The question was no longer \"how high can I build?\" but \"what can I leave behind?\""
