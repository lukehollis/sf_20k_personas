The only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small, beloved dry-cleaning business, Elijah grew up amid the scent of steam and the constant hum of machinery. His parents preached the gospel of stability and hard work, hoping he\u2019d pursue a straightforward path like engineering or medicine. In a quiet act of defiance, Elijah chose to study English Literature at SF State, losing himself in novels and poetry, a world away from his practical upbringing.\n\nUpon graduation, reality set in. Needing a steady income, he took an entry-level job as a receptionist at a burgeoning tech startup. His calm demeanor and innate organizational skills, honed by years of managing inventory at his parents' shop, made him indispensable. He was quickly promoted to Executive Assistant and, as the company scaled, he naturally transitioned into the role of Office Manager. He became the \"digital glue\" of the company\u2014managing logistics, onboarding new hires, and cultivating a positive remote culture, a role that became permanent after the pandemic.\n\nToday, Elijah\u2019s 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to a standing desk in the corner of his Inner Richmond apartment. He shares the space with his long-term partner, Clara, a ceramicist he met in college. His days are a flurry of Slack messages, Zoom calls, and coordinating virtual events. He finds his connection to San Francisco not in the tech scene, but in his neighborhood. Mornings start with a walk through the fog to a local bakery for coffee, and evenings are often spent exploring the trails of Golden Gate Park with Clara or trying a new restaurant on Clement Street.\n\nAt 35, Elijah feels a gentle pull towards the life his English degree once promised. While he\u2019s grateful for the stability his career provides, he dreams of taking a sabbatical to finally write the novel that has lived in his head for a decade. His aspiration isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to build a life rich with connection and creativity, proving that his parents' hard work could pave the way for a dream they never could have imagined."
