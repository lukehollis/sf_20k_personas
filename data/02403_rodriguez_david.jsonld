He was born and raised in Fresno, the son of a mechanic who owned a small auto shop and a school administrator who meticulously managed household finances. His parents, both second-generation Mexican-Americans, instilled in him a dual inheritance: his father\u2019s practical, hands-on approach to problem-solving and his mother\u2019s gift for organization and planning. He was the first in his immediate family to attend a four-year university.\n\nHe chose San Jose State University, graduating with a Bachelor's in Communications in the late 2000s, just as the tech boom was solidifying its grip on the Bay Area. Lacking a technical degree, he entered the industry through a side door, taking a marketing coordinator role at a mid-sized startup. It was there his true talents emerged. While others focused on creative copy, David excelled at orchestrating the complex campaigns, aligning engineers, designers, and sales teams. A perceptive director noticed his knack for \"herding cats\" and sponsored his transition into a junior project manager position. This was his turning point.\n\nOver the next decade, David climbed the ladder, moving between companies and honing his skills. Today, he\u2019s a senior project manager for a major cloud services company. The pandemic permanently shifted his work life; his 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the spare office in the Hayes Valley apartment he shares with his partner of eight years, a landscape architect named Liam.\n\nHis days are structured by routine: a foggy morning walk with their rescue terrier, Karl (named after the fog), a strong coffee from his favorite local cafe, then hours of Slack messages and video calls. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; he knows the baristas, the grocers, and the bartenders in his neighborhood intimately. While comfortable, David feels a growing disconnect from the digital world he wrangles. He dreams of something more tangible, a fusion of his heritage and his current life. His long-term aspiration is to save enough to open a small, modern agave spirits tasting room with Liam\u2014a project he can finally build with his own hands, not just a Gantt chart."
