From this digital office, he serves as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to the telehealth era. He is a fourth-generation (Yonsei) Japanese-American, a fact that has profoundly shaped his path. Raised in the South Bay by parents who owned a small garden nursery, Kenji grew up under the weight of unspoken expectations. Success was to be measured in a stable, high-earning profession like engineering or medicine; emotional complexities were to be pruned back and kept tidy, like the bonsai trees his father meticulously cared for.\n\nHis educational journey began on this prescribed path at UC Davis, initially pursuing a business degree. He was miserable, the concepts feeling hollow and disconnected from the world he saw. The turning point was a family tragedy, quiet and slow. After his grandfather passed, he watched his grandmother fade into a profound depression, a condition the family treated with silence and tea, not therapy. The helplessness he felt in the face of her suffering became a catalyst. He abruptly changed his major to sociology and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, a choice his parents accepted with resigned disappointment.\n\nNow 31, Kenji has built a life that is a gentle rebellion against his upbringing. His work is his passion; he specializes in helping clients navigate anxiety and intergenerational trauma, particularly within the AAPI community. His days are structured: morning telehealth sessions, a midday run through Golden Gate Park to clear his head, then more sessions in the afternoon. Evenings are for himself\u2014cooking Japanese comfort food, reading, or meeting his small, close-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow therapists he met in grad school.\n\nKenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. He loves the foggy tranquility of the Richmond, the proximity to the ocean, and the unassuming noodle shops on Clement Street. His dream is to eventually open a small group practice in the city, creating a safe, accessible mental health space for those conditioned to believe that suffering should be endured in silence. He hopes to build a future, both for himself and his clients, where vulnerability is seen not as a weakness, but as the first step toward healing."

His father\u2019s hands, steady and precise, snipped a runaway branch from a juniper bonsai. \u201cToo much growth in one direction,\u201d his father said softly, \u201cand you lose the balance.\u201d Kenji looked from the perfectly contained tree to the sprawling garden outside. He felt a quiet, suffocating lesson settle in his chest: feelings, like branches, must be carefully controlled, kept small and tidy. It was the first time he understood that some parts of you were meant to be pruned away before they could even grow.\n\n2.\nAfter his grandfather\u2019s funeral, he found his grandmother staring into a cold cup of tea, her grief a heavy blanket in the silent room. He asked if she was okay and she just nodded, her eyes lost. The helplessness was crushing; it was a wall of unspoken rules he couldn\u2019t break. Watching her fade that year, he knew he had to find a language for the pain his family refused to name. His business textbooks suddenly felt like they were written about a different planet.\n\n3.\nOn his first day in the MSW program at SF State, a professor said, \u201cOur job is to hold space for the stories that have been silenced.\u201d A knot of tension Kenji hadn't realized he was carrying finally loosened in his stomach. He looked around at the earnest, open faces of his classmates and felt a sense of homecoming he\u2019d never known. This wasn\u2019t the failure his parents saw; it was a calling. He had found his place.\n\n4.\nOverwhelmed during a brutal week of grad school, he ran into Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. It muted the city\u2019s noise, and the damp smell of eucalyptus and earth filled his lungs. Trotting along a dirt path, with only the sound of his own breathing, his racing mind grew quiet. The park wasn\u2019t just a landmark; it was an exhale. That was the day San Francisco stopped being a place he lived and became the place that helped him breathe.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young client, a student, finally broke his silence during a session. \"I just feel like if I'm not successful, I'm worthless to my family,\" he whispered to his screen. Kenji saw his own reflection in the boy's fear. By simply listening and validating that feeling, he felt the past and present click into place. He was becoming the person he, and so many others, had once needed. This was the work: sitting in the silence with someone until they felt safe enough to speak."
