From this digital office, he serves as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to the telehealth era. He is a fourth-generation (Yonsei) Japanese-American, a fact that has profoundly shaped his path. Raised in the South Bay by parents who owned a small garden nursery, Kenji grew up under the weight of unspoken expectations. Success was to be measured in a stable, high-earning profession like engineering or medicine; emotional complexities were to be pruned back and kept tidy, like the bonsai trees his father meticulously cared for.\n\nHis educational journey began on this prescribed path at UC Davis, initially pursuing a business degree. He was miserable, the concepts feeling hollow and disconnected from the world he saw. The turning point was a family tragedy, quiet and slow. After his grandfather passed, he watched his grandmother fade into a profound depression, a condition the family treated with silence and tea, not therapy. The helplessness he felt in the face of her suffering became a catalyst. He abruptly changed his major to sociology and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, a choice his parents accepted with resigned disappointment.\n\nNow 31, Kenji has built a life that is a gentle rebellion against his upbringing. His work is his passion; he specializes in helping clients navigate anxiety and intergenerational trauma, particularly within the AAPI community. His days are structured: morning telehealth sessions, a midday run through Golden Gate Park to clear his head, then more sessions in the afternoon. Evenings are for himself\u2014cooking Japanese comfort food, reading, or meeting his small, close-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow therapists he met in grad school.\n\nKenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. He loves the foggy tranquility of the Richmond, the proximity to the ocean, and the unassuming noodle shops on Clement Street. His dream is to eventually open a small group practice in the city, creating a safe, accessible mental health space for those conditioned to believe that suffering should be endured in silence. He hopes to build a future, both for himself and his clients, where vulnerability is seen not as a weakness, but as the first step toward healing."
