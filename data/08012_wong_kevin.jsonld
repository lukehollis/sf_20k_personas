Growing up amidst the rhythm of inventory stocking and friendly customer chatter, Kevin learned the value of community and hard work. His parents envisioned a stable future for him as a doctor or an engineer, a common dream for their generation.\n\nKevin, however, was fascinated by the city itself\u2014its intricate web of MUNI lines, the persistent traffic on 19th Avenue, and the way people moved through its varied landscapes. This led him to pursue a Master\u2019s in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, believing he could solve the city's problems from within the system. He spent his first four professional years at the SFMTA, analyzing transit data and drafting reports. While the work was meaningful, he grew frustrated with the slow pace of bureaucratic change.\n\nThe turning point came when a burgeoning autonomous vehicle company, impressed by his practical infrastructure knowledge, recruited him. The move to the private tech sector felt like a betrayal of his public service ideals at first, but he soon realized he could enact change on a much larger and faster scale.\n\nNow a Senior Project Manager, Kevin lives a life his parents could never have imagined. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to a standing desk in his sleek Hayes Valley condo. His days are a flurry of virtual meetings with engineers, city officials, and international logistics teams, all aimed at integrating smart transportation networks into the urban fabric.\n\nHis partner, Eliza, a freelance illustrator, provides a creative balance to his structured world. Evenings are often spent trying new restaurants in their neighborhood or cycling through Golden Gate Park, a nostalgic return to his childhood backyard. Kevin\u2019s deepest aspiration isn\u2019t a promotion, but to one day ride an autonomous shuttle across the Golden Gate Bridge and know he personally managed the project that made it possible\u2014using the tools of New San Francisco to improve the city that has always been his home."
