The daughter of Chinese immigrants who settled in Daly City, she was raised on the principles of duty, resilience, and the unspoken expectation to care for family. Her father worked long hours in a restaurant kitchen, her mother at a sewing machine, and their sacrifices fueled Mei\u2019s ambition, though not in the way they imagined. They hoped for a doctor or an engineer; Mei was drawn to the complex, often messy, fabric of human need she saw around her.\n\nHer turning point came in her late twenties. Mei, then working in university administration, found herself becoming the primary advocate for her grandmother during a difficult battle with dementia. She spent countless hours on the phone, fighting with insurance companies, coordinating with overwhelmed doctors, and translating complex medical jargon for her parents. The frustration was immense, but in navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth, she discovered a fierce, protective calling. This experience propelled her to quit her job and enroll at SF State, earning a Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 52, Mei is a seasoned case manager for a major healthcare provider. Her short commute from her bed to her desk belies the emotional distance she travels daily. Her mornings start with jasmine tea and a brisk walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to fortify herself for a day of phone calls managing care for the elderly and chronically ill across the city. Her evenings are for decompression\u2014cooking simple, nourishing meals and tending to the small collection of orchids on her windowsill.\n\nA quiet divorce in her late thirties left her with a profound sense of self-reliance but not bitterness. Her social life is small but deep: a weekly dim sum lunch with two friends from her master\u2019s program and a book club that meets monthly. Having spent her career untangling crises for others, Mei\u2019s dream is one of simplicity. She hopes to one day travel to the villages in Guangdong her parents left behind, and perhaps transition to a mentorship role, teaching the next generation of social workers how to fight the good fight with both compassion and strength."

The scent of hot oil from the machine filled their small Daly City living room. Looking at the finished garments, perfect and anonymous, Mei felt a surge of protective love and a quiet resolve. Her own work, she knew then, would not be with thread, but with the tangled lives of people. It was the first time she understood duty could have more than one shape.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the sticky receiver pressed to her ear, listening to tinny hold music while her grandmother shuffled in the next room, lost in time. The insurance agent\u2019s voice was a flat wall of dismissal. A sudden, cold fury cut through her panic. It wasn\u2019t just a problem to solve; it was an injustice to fight. The phone call ended, but the battle had just begun. That afternoon, at 28, she started her application to the SF State social work program.\n\n3.\nThe first night after her husband moved out, the Inner Richmond apartment felt vast and silent. She methodically brewed a single cup of jasmine tea. Standing by the window, watching the fog swallow the streetlights, she expected a wave of loneliness. Instead, a profound calm settled in her chest. This space, this quiet, this life\u2014it was finally, wholly hers. At 38, she learned that self-reliance was not a consolation prize, but a quiet, powerful freedom.\n\n4.\nA hard-won victory for an elderly client, Mr. Fong, finally resulted in him getting home care. Two weeks later, his daughter called not with a problem, but in tears of gratitude. \u201cHe\u2019s eating again,\u201d she\u2019d whispered. \u201cHe smiled.\u201d For Mei, then in her mid-forties, it wasn\u2019t about winning against a system. It was about the quiet dignity restored by a simple bowl of soup, a moment of peace she had helped secure. That memory became her armor.\n\n5.\nOn her 50th birthday, she pulled out a faded photograph of her parents as teenagers in Guangdong, squinting in the bright sun. They looked impossibly young, their faces filled with a future they couldn't yet imagine. Tracing the outline of the village house behind them, Mei felt a pull that was deeper than curiosity. It was a need to stand where they stood, to understand the beginning of the story she was still living, and to find a peace they had to leave behind."
