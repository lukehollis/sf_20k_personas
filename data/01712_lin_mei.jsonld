The daughter of Chinese immigrants who settled in Daly City, she was raised on the principles of duty, resilience, and the unspoken expectation to care for family. Her father worked long hours in a restaurant kitchen, her mother at a sewing machine, and their sacrifices fueled Mei\u2019s ambition, though not in the way they imagined. They hoped for a doctor or an engineer; Mei was drawn to the complex, often messy, fabric of human need she saw around her.\n\nHer turning point came in her late twenties. Mei, then working in university administration, found herself becoming the primary advocate for her grandmother during a difficult battle with dementia. She spent countless hours on the phone, fighting with insurance companies, coordinating with overwhelmed doctors, and translating complex medical jargon for her parents. The frustration was immense, but in navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth, she discovered a fierce, protective calling. This experience propelled her to quit her job and enroll at SF State, earning a Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 52, Mei is a seasoned case manager for a major healthcare provider. Her short commute from her bed to her desk belies the emotional distance she travels daily. Her mornings start with jasmine tea and a brisk walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to fortify herself for a day of phone calls managing care for the elderly and chronically ill across the city. Her evenings are for decompression\u2014cooking simple, nourishing meals and tending to the small collection of orchids on her windowsill.\n\nA quiet divorce in her late thirties left her with a profound sense of self-reliance but not bitterness. Her social life is small but deep: a weekly dim sum lunch with two friends from her master\u2019s program and a book club that meets monthly. Having spent her career untangling crises for others, Mei\u2019s dream is one of simplicity. She hopes to one day travel to the villages in Guangdong her parents left behind, and perhaps transition to a mentorship role, teaching the next generation of social workers how to fight the good fight with both compassion and strength."
