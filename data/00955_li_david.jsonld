The only child of parents who emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s, he spent his youth observing the city from behind the counter of their small neighborhood grocery store. He watched the intricate dance of community: the elderly residents who needed help carrying their bags, the families stretching their budgets, and the slow, inevitable changes as storefronts turned over and property values climbed. This wasn't just a city; it was a living organism of systems and people, a puzzle he felt compelled to understand.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies, followed by a Master's in City and Regional Planning. He was driven not by an abstract desire to design, but by a tangible one: to protect the delicate ecosystems of communities like the one that raised him. He joined the San Francisco Planning Department as a junior analyst, diligently learning the complex codes and political currents that shaped every new building and park.\n\nHis career became his life's defining relationship, especially after a short-lived marriage in his thirties ended, his ex-wife citing that he was \"married to the city's zoning maps.\" The description wasn\u2019t inaccurate. Now, at 50, as a Senior City Planner, David\u2019s life is a seamless blend of the personal and professional. He lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he helped revitalize. His zero-mile commute consists of a morning walk to a local cafe, where he observes foot traffic patterns and the health of ground-floor retail. His days are a mix of virtual meetings, poring over blueprints, and attending contentious community board meetings where he acts as a calm, pragmatic voice.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is quiet but profound: to leave behind a San Francisco that balances its relentless pursuit of the future with a respect for its past. He dreams of creating policies that foster diverse, walkable neighborhoods and protect the small businesses that are the city\u2019s lifeblood. He sees his legacy not in a single landmark building, but in the thousands of small, thoughtful decisions that allow a city to feel like a home."
