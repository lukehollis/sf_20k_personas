The only child of Korean parents who ran a small, perpetually struggling dry-cleaning business in Daly City, she grew up surrounded by the smell of steam and the quiet exhaustion of endless work. Her parents\u2019 dream was simple and unyielding: that Sofia would never have to work with her hands the way they did. Her success would be their validation.\n\nSofia internalized this, making achievement her sole focus. She excelled, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley for economics, followed by a coveted analyst position at a downtown bank. But after three years, she saw a ceiling. To break through, she poured her savings and her soul into a Stanford MBA, a degree that felt like a golden key. It worked. She was recruited into the elite world of management consulting, specializing in finance, where her sharp mind and relentless work ethic made her a star.\n\nNow, at 39, she is a Senior Management Consultant living in a minimalist SoMa condo with floor-to-ceiling windows. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday bleeds into every corner of her life, a seamless transition from morning coffee to late-night client calls from her ergonomic chair. She achieved the stability her parents craved, yet a profound emptiness has begun to settle in. A recent, grueling project that restructured a major portfolio left her feeling hollow instead of triumphant. Her identity had become her job title.\n\nThis realization was her turning point. Seeking an antidote to the sterile world of spreadsheets, she signed up for a weekly pottery class in the Mission, a neighborhood pulsating with a life her own lacked. The messy, unpredictable nature of clay is a quiet rebellion. Her hands, which her parents had fought to keep clean, are now covered in earth. Her social life, once limited to networking events, now includes sharing a kiln with artists and students. Sofia\u2019s aspiration is no longer the next promotion. She dreams of finding a balance, of building a life as carefully as she builds a financial model, but with more room for the beautiful, imperfect, tangible act of creation."
