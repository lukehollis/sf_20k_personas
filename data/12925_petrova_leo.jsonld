Born in Seoul, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by a loving Russian-American couple who had settled in Walnut Creek. This upbringing as a curious cultural hybrid\u2014an Asian boy with a Slavic surname raised on borscht and Bay Area optimism\u2014shaped his entire worldview. He spent his youth feeling slightly outside of every group, a position that sharpened his observational skills and gave him a deep appreciation for aesthetics and the stories objects can tell.\n\nAfter earning a marketing degree from San Francisco State University, Leo resisted the lure of corporate advertising. He was drawn to the tangible world of retail, starting as a stockroom clerk at a Union Square department store in the early \u201890s. He quickly discovered his talent wasn't in sales, but in presentation. He could arrange a display of simple sweaters and, through light and form, evoke a feeling of cozy autumn evenings. This was his calling. Over three decades, he methodically climbed the ladder, moving from brand to brand, honing his craft until he became the Visual Merchandising Director for a national apparel company, overseeing the entire West Coast from their downtown SF headquarters.\n\nAt 53, Leo\u2019s life is a curated composition. He resides in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of high art and stylish commerce mirrors his own sensibilities. His daily routine is a familiar rhythm: a brisk walk to a local cafe for a black Americano, followed by a short ride on the MUNI F-Market streetcar to his office. His work is demanding, but it\u2019s a performance he delights in, directing teams to create immersive, beautiful worlds within the store\u2019s walls.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of friends from the design and arts communities. San Francisco is more than a home; it's the only place where his disparate identities feel perfectly harmonized. Looking forward, Leo isn't dreaming of retirement but of a final creative act. He hopes to one day open a small, highly-curated concept store of his own\u2014a space that tells a single, perfect story. He also quietly plans a trip to Seoul, not to search for his roots, but simply to observe the aesthetics of his birthplace as a visitor, completing a personal and professional circle."

He watched his tall, warm parents, with their soft Russian accents, talk about him\u2014the Korean boy with the Slavic name. It wasn't a moment of sadness, but of profound clarity. He realized his natural position was just outside the frame, a vantage point that offered the best view of the entire composition. This quiet understanding wasn't isolating; it was the birth of his observational power, the skill that would become his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt 24, buried in the fluorescent-lit stockroom of a Union Square department store, a messy shipment of cashmere sweaters arrived. Overwhelmed by the chaos, he suddenly felt a creative pull. He began folding and stacking them not by size, but by shade, creating a gradient that told a silent story of a crisp autumn day. In that moment, surrounded by cardboard and concrete, he discovered his calling. He wasn't just managing inventory; he was arranging the world to evoke a feeling, a performance he\u2019d perfect for decades.\n\n3.\nHe was riding the F-Market streetcar home in his late twenties. As the vintage car rattled past the glowing storefronts and vibrant crowds of the Castro at dusk, he felt a sense of peace settle over him. The city\u2019s beautiful, mismatched collection of identities\u2014its history, art, and people\u2014perfectly mirrored his own internal landscape. He wasn\u2019t an outlier here; he was simply another unique piece in a larger, stunning display. It was the first time he truly felt harmonized, that his disparate parts had finally found their home.\n\n4.\nIn his mid-thirties, after a painful breakup, his apartment felt alien, filled with the ghosts of shared objects. One weekend, he began a purge. He methodically emptied the space, keeping only what held true beauty or personal meaning. He arranged his books by color, his few ceramics by form. In creating that quiet, intentional order around him, he wasn't just decorating; he was rebuilding his own narrative. He learned then that curating his space was a way to control his story, an act of self-preservation through beauty.\n\n5.\nHe was in his late forties, standing before an exhibit of Korean Moon Jars at the Asian Art Museum. In their perfect, asymmetrical white forms, he saw an aesthetic principle that resonated to his core\u2014a profound, minimalist beauty he'd always sought in his own work. It was a powerful, unexpected connection, not to a lost family, but to an artistic heritage. It was then he decided he would one day visit Seoul, not to find his origin, but to finally see the birthplace of his own eye."
