A third-generation Japanese-American, she grew up in the quiet suburbs of San Jose, where her engineer father and nurse mother instilled in her the values of stability and pragmatism. In a quiet act of rebellion, Sarah chose to study Comparative Literature at UC Santa Cruz, losing herself in global narratives while her parents fretted about her job prospects.\n\nAfter graduation, their fears seemed justified. Sarah drifted through her twenties, working a series of unfulfilling jobs\u2014barista, bookstore clerk, freelance copyeditor\u2014that paid the bills but starved her intellect. The turning point came during a particularly grueling shift at a cafe. She watched a software team from a local startup collaborating with an effortless, structured energy. It was then she realized that managing complex digital projects required the same skills as deconstructing a novel: understanding structure, character (or stakeholder) motivation, and a clear narrative arc.\n\nThis epiphany led her to a six-month intensive project management bootcamp. She excelled, leveraging her humanities background into a unique strength for communication and organization. She landed a job as a project coordinator at a San Francisco fintech company and, after two years of disciplined work, was promoted to Junior Project Manager.\n\nNow 32, Sarah lives in a small but sunny one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is deeply woven into the neighborhood. Her days begin with a foggy run in Golden Gate Park and a coffee from a local cafe before she opens her laptop to a world of Slack channels and Jira boards. She finds a surprising satisfaction in bringing order to digital chaos. To balance the screen time, she takes a weekly ceramics class and hosts small dinner parties for a close-knit group of friends.\n\nHer dream is to eventually lead projects for a company with a social or artistic mission, bridging the gap between her literary soul and her hard-won technical skills. For now, Sarah is content building her life, finding her own story within the vibrant, ever-changing narrative of San Francisco."
