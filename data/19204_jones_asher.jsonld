Born Kim Min-jun, he was adopted at eighteen months by a loving Caucasian couple, both sociologists at UC Berkeley. The Joneses gave him a new name but nurtured a deep respect for his heritage, creating a home filled with both Western art and Korean pottery. This bicultural upbringing in the progressive bubble of Berkeley instilled in Asher a love for storytelling and performance from a young age.\n\nHe pursued this passion at San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's in Theater Arts. While he enjoyed acting, he discovered his true talent was behind the curtain\u2014organizing, directing, and creating the entire world of a production. After graduating, he found the traditional theater world too rigid. The turning point came in his late twenties when he helped a friend organize a sprawling, multi-disciplinary art and music festival in a SOMA warehouse. The thrill of orchestrating the beautiful chaos of artists, chefs, and musicians was a revelation. He had found his stage.\n\nOver the next two decades, Asher built a formidable reputation as a freelance event producer. He is the go-to person for creating unique experiences, from avant-garde gallery openings and pop-up dining events to large-scale food festivals in Golden Gate Park. His income is solid but fluctuates, demanding a constant hustle that Asher thrives on. His personal and professional lives are deeply intertwined; his closest friends are the chefs, artists, and lighting designers he collaborates with.\n\nToday, at 53, Asher lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a vibrant space decorated with posters and art from events he\u2019s produced over the years. His 3.8-mile commute is a daily ritual on the Muni, a time he uses to answer emails or simply observe the city that is his constant muse. Divorced amicably a decade ago, he values his independence but is a deeply connected social figure. His dream isn't retirement but legacy: he hopes to establish a small, non-profit mentorship program to guide young, aspiring producers, ensuring that San Francisco\u2019s unique, creative spirit continues to thrive, one unforgettable event at a time."

It was his first lesson in curation\u2014placing history and art together to create meaning and a sense of self.\n\n2.\nHe was twenty-eight, standing on a rickety catwalk in a SOMA warehouse. Below, a thousand people moved between a punk band, a chef searing scallops, and a video artist\u2019s projection. The air smelled of sawdust, sweat, and possibility. It wasn't a play; it was life, amplified. He wasn\u2019t acting, he was conducting. A euphoric calm washed over him. He knew with absolute certainty that this beautiful, unscripted chaos was his true stage, the place where all his passions could finally converge.\n\n3.\nHe recalls the end of his first large-scale food festival in Golden Gate Park, around age thirty-nine. Utterly spent, he sat on a cooler in Hellman Hollow as the last trucks rumbled away. The sun set behind the eucalyptus trees, casting a golden light on the flattened grass where thousands had just shared a meal. He didn't feel the stress of the payroll, only a deep, quiet pride. He had made this happen. He hadn\u2019t just thrown a party; he\u2019d fed a piece of the city\u2019s soul.\n\n4.\nThe divorce, a decade ago, wasn't one memory but a collection of quiet moments. The most vivid was dividing their vinyl collection on the floor of their Mission apartment. No anger, just bittersweet negotiation over who got the Bowie and who kept the Talking Heads. They ended up making playlists for each other. It was a sad but respectful curation of their shared past, teaching him that endings could be collaborations, too, and that some important bonds don\u2019t break, they simply transform into something new.\n\n5.\nJust last year, at a hectic gallery opening in Dogpatch, he saw a young event assistant, barely twenty-five, near tears over a broken sound system. Asher saw his own panic from thirty years ago in her eyes. He calmly walked her through bypassing the faulty cable, and the relief that washed over her face resonated deeply. In that moment, the thrill wasn't just in saving the night, but in the effortless act of passing on knowledge. The seed for his mentorship program was planted, shifting his focus from his own success to his legacy."
