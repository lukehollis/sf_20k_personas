Raised by a pragmatic engineer father and an idealistic teacher mother, his childhood was a narrative of hiking through the Columbia River Gorge and learning the names of native flora. This innate connection to the natural world led him to pursue an undergraduate degree in environmental science, but he soon realized that passion alone didn't enact change. Seeking to bridge the gap between ecology and economy, he moved to the Bay Area to earn his Master's in Environmental Policy and Management from UC Berkeley.\n\nHe landed a coveted job as an environmental consultant, believing he could help corporations become better stewards of the land. For the first decade, the work was fulfilling. He helped companies navigate complex regulations and implement greener practices. However, as he entered his forties, a subtle disillusionment set in. The work began to feel less like saving the planet and more like finding the most cost-effective way for clients to check a compliance box.\n\nThis professional crossroads coincided with the quiet end of a decade-long relationship, leaving David in a state of quiet introspection. His life is now centered in his Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office, reducing his commute to zero. His days follow a steady rhythm: a morning coffee and croissant from a favorite Clement Street bakery, hours of analyzing data and writing reports, and a mandatory afternoon walk through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park to clear his head. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends from his graduate program, meeting for weekly trivia or weekend bike rides across the bridge.\n\nAt 43, David feels authentically San Franciscan yet yearns for a deeper purpose. He dreams of leaving the lucrative but soul-wearying world of corporate consulting. His quiet aspiration is to leverage his expertise for a non-profit like the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, to feel the tangible impact of his work once more, and to protect the very landscapes that have become his sanctuary."
