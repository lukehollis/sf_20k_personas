Her San Francisco is a grid of one-way streets in the Richmond District, apartments with tricky gate codes, and restaurants that always have the order ready on time. Born in a small village in Punjab, India, Priya immigrated to the U.S. with her parents and younger brother at sixteen. The vibrant chaos of her homeland was replaced by the cool, structured fog of a city she didn't understand.\n\nHer high school diploma from India didn't translate into opportunity. While her friends back home went to university, Priya\u2019s family needed immediate income. The turning point came when her father, a taxi driver, suffered a back injury that put him out of work indefinitely. The weight of the family\u2019s rent and expenses fell squarely on Priya\u2019s shoulders. College aspirations were shelved, replaced by the urgent necessity of a job that didn't require a degree. She started with a used sedan and a delivery app.\n\nNow, at 28, her life operates from the driver's seat. Her 0.0-mile commute means work begins the moment she turns on her phone. Her days are a blur of pickups and drop-offs, fueled by podcasts and cheap coffee. She knows the city with an intimacy few possess, from the steepest hills to the hidden back alleys. Social life is a luxury; her closest connections are fleeting chats with other drivers at popular pickup spots and quiet evenings sharing chai with her mother, their conversation a mix of Punjabi and English.\n\nPriya lives for the small moments: the sun breaking through the fog over Ocean Beach during a rare break, a genuinely thankful customer, sending money to her grandparents in India. Tucked away in a notebook in her glove compartment are sketches and design ideas. Her quiet, persistent dream is to save enough to take a graphic design course at City College. Every delivery, every tip, is a small deposit into a future where she is the creator, not just the courier\u2014a future she builds one San Francisco block at a time."
