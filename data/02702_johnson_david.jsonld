The only son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up amidst the scent of produce and cardboard in his parents\u2019 small Fremont grocery store. They preached the gospel of education as the only escape from a life of 14-hour days, and David listened. He pursued an undergraduate degree in economics from UC Davis before leveling up with a Master's in Information Management from UC Berkeley, perfectly positioning himself at the intersection of business and the burgeoning tech scene.\n\nHis early career was a baptism by fire in the dot-com boom and bust, teaching him a crucial lesson in distinguishing hype from true value. He found his calling not in building a single product but in strategizing for many, joining a prestigious consulting firm. The next two decades were a blur of international flights, late-night presentations, and a single-minded drive toward partnership. That goal was achieved at 42, but not without cost; his marriage dissolved under the immense pressure, a casualty of his ambition.\n\nThe pandemic was an unexpected turning point. Grounded indefinitely, David traded his SFO Centurion Lounge access for a permanent home office in his Telegraph Hill condo. The mandated stillness forced a reckoning. With a 0.0-mile commute, his days found a new rhythm: a pre-dawn run along the Embarcadero, followed by hours of deep work orchestrating global teams from his minimalist desk overlooking the Bay. Evenings are no longer for client dinners but for experimenting with complex recipes\u2014a nod to his parents' world\u2014or losing himself in historical non-fiction.\n\nNow 48, David has achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of for him. He is a respected partner in his firm, but the professional summit feels solitary. His aspirations have shifted inward. He hopes to transition from pure consulting to angel investing, mentoring startups focused on sustainable technology. More than that, he dreams of building a lasting personal relationship, proving to himself that he can succeed at something other than his career. He is a man who conquered the corporate world and is now learning to navigate the quiet, expansive territory of his own life."
