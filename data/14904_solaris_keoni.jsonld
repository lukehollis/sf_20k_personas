Raised by his grandparents, he was steeped in the rhythm of island life and the rich traditions of his culture. His grandmother, a master of lauhala weaving, taught him that art was a form of storytelling, a way to weave the past into the present. It was this belief that propelled him from the Big Island to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a degree in Arts Administration, determined to build a bridge between heritage and institutional support.\n\nHis career is a testament to his dedication. Keoni started as an intern at a community arts non-profit in the Mission District and never left. For over two decades, he has been a quiet force, working his way from program coordinator to his current role as Director of Programs. A key turning point came after his grandmother's passing fifteen years ago; grief sharpened his focus, transforming his job into a calling. He committed himself to championing underrepresented artists, particularly those from BIPOC and immigrant communities, ensuring their stories were not just told, but funded and celebrated.\n\nNow 45, Keoni\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the city. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission, a neighborhood whose vibrant murals and cultural cacophony remind him of home. His daily 2.8-mile commute is a ritual\u2014a brisk walk to the 14-Mission bus, where he observes the city\u2019s complex tapestry before arriving at his SoMa office. His social life is an extension of his work; his closest friends are artists, activists, and fellow non-profit leaders. He is a respected figure, known for his calm demeanor and fierce advocacy.\n\nKeoni\u2019s dream is to secure a major endowment for his organization, one that would establish a permanent cultural exchange between Bay Area and Pacific Islander artists. He fears the city\u2019s soul is being eroded by transient tech wealth and sees his work as a form of cultural preservation. He isn't just administering programs; he's nurturing roots in a city that constantly threatens to pave over its own history."

He must have been seven, sitting at his grandmother\u2019s feet, his small, clumsy fingers trying to mimic her deft weaving. She didn't just teach him the pattern; she told him the story of the leaf, from the tree to their hands. The feeling of the rough, pliable lau against his skin was his first lesson in heritage\u2014that it was something tangible, a story you could hold. That day, art ceased to be just pictures; it became ancestry.\n\n2.\nHis first week at SF State felt like being submerged in cold, gray water. He was 18, homesick, and overwhelmed. Then, he took a bus to the Mission. Turning a corner onto 24th Street, he was struck by a mural, its colors as vibrant as any hibiscus. The smell of cooking from a taqueria, the rhythm of Spanish spoken on the sidewalk\u2014it wasn't Hilo, but it was familiar. It was the feeling of community. He felt his shoulders relax for the first time in days, realizing he hadn\u2019t just found a neighborhood, but an anchor.\n\n3.\nThe phone call came on a Tuesday afternoon. He was 30, staring out his office window at a new high-rise skeleton when his uncle\u2019s voice told him T\u016bt\u016b was gone. The city noise faded to a dull roar. In that moment of crushing grief, the cranes outside became a symbol of everything that erases. His work was no longer a career; it became a sacred promise to her memory. He would weave stories of survival into the city\u2019s fabric, just as she had taught him, ensuring no one\u2019s heritage would be paved over.\n\n4.\nIt was the opening for a young Oaxacan printmaker he had championed for months. Keoni stood back, watching the artist explain a piece to a small crowd, her parents beside her, beaming. When a patron bought her largest print, the artist\u2019s mother hugged him, whispering \u201cGracias, gracias\u201d through tears. Keoni felt a profound sense of purpose that transcended any grant report. This was it\u2014not just administering art, but helping a family see their story, their history, honored and valued on a gallery wall. This memory, from eight years ago, fuels his hardest days.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, he stood on his apartment rooftop watching the fog devour the Financial District skyline. The contrast was jarring: the quiet, ethereal fog against the rigid, glowing towers of wealth. Below, the sounds of the Mission\u2014cumbia music, laughter, the sizzle of a food cart\u2014rose to meet him. He felt a fierce, protective love for the life at street level, the city\u2019s true pulse. It was a moment of quiet clarity, reaffirming his dream of an endowment. This was not just preservation; it was resistance."
