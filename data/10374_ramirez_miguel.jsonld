Born and raised in Fresno, he was the only son of hardworking Mexican-American parents who ran a small landscaping business. From a young age, Miguel was fascinated not by lawns, but by the blinking lights and intricate logic of the family\u2019s first desktop computer. He was the one who fixed it, upgraded it, and spent hours learning its secrets.\n\nHis path seemed set for a degree in computer science at a state university, but his journey was rerouted. During his second year at community college, his father suffered a back injury that forced him to stop working. Miguel dropped out to help support his family, taking on a series of unfulfilling retail jobs. The dream of a degree faded, but his passion for technology did not. In his spare time, he earned CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications, building a professional skillset on his own terms.\n\nThis self-taught expertise eventually landed him an entry-level help desk job in Fresno. He slowly climbed the ladder until, nearly a decade ago, a promising offer from a San Francisco tech startup pulled him to the Bay Area. The move was a professional necessity, not a personal one.\n\nNow 43, Miguel\u2019s world has shrunk to the dimensions of his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. As a fully remote IT Support Specialist, his commute is a ten-foot walk from his bed to his desk. His days are a steady rhythm of Slack notifications, support tickets, and video calls, his voice a calm, troubleshooting presence for unseen colleagues. He is good at his job, valued for his patience and deep technical knowledge.\n\nAfter logging off, he reclaims his space. He breaks the digital monotony with long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park or by exploring the dim sum restaurants on Clement Street. His social life is sparse; a long-term relationship ended a few years back, strained by the isolation of his work-from-home life. His primary connections are weekly calls with his parents and the occasional text from former coworkers.\n\nMiguel\u2019s hope is not for a promotion, but for reconnection. He daydreams of opening a small side business restoring vintage electronics\u2014a tactile, hands-on craft far removed from the abstract problems he solves daily. He is a man who found his place in San Francisco by necessity, but has built a quiet life of his own, finding solace not in the city\u2019s frantic energy, but in its peaceful, fog-shrouded corners."
