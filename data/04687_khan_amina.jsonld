Born in Fremont to South African Indian immigrants, her childhood was filled with her parents\u2019 memories of Durban\u2014a vibrant port city, but one whose geography was cruelly dictated by the apartheid-era Group Areas Act. These narratives of forced community displacement and spatial injustice planted a seed that would define her life.\n\nDriven by this inherited sense of purpose, Amina excelled academically, eventually pursuing a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. There, she moved beyond theories of zoning and land use, focusing her studies on restorative justice and equitable development. A pivotal moment came during a graduate trip back to Durban, where she walked the very streets her family had been forced from. Seeing the lingering scars of segregation firsthand transformed her academic interest into a profound personal mission.\n\nUpon graduating, Amina eschewed a traditional government job. She craved the autonomy to choose projects that aligned with her values, so she launched her own one-woman consulting firm. She now lives and works from a meticulously organized live/work loft in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute allows her to immerse herself completely in her neighborhood, a place she sees as a living case study. Her days are a blend of intense focus over digital blueprints and community observation, taking breaks to walk through Patricia\u2019s Green, noting how public spaces foster connection or exclusion.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and fellow activists, often meeting for dinner in the Mission to debate housing policy or for gallery openings in Dogpatch. Amina\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of both love and critique; she is captivated by its beauty and progressive ideals but deeply troubled by its stark inequities. Her ultimate dream is to expand her consultancy into a non-profit that empowers marginalized communities to lead their own redevelopment projects, creating spaces that heal rather than divide, both in the Bay Area and, one day, back in Durban."

Her father wasn\u2019t talking about maps or politics, but about a mango tree in their garden in Durban, its specific slant of shade. He spoke of a home that wasn't just lost, but stolen by a law. For the first time, Amina felt the ghost of a place she\u2019d never been. This inherited grief wasn't sad; it was a fire, igniting a lifelong need to understand how cities hold\u2014and break\u2014our hearts.\n\n2.\nThe dust on her sandals felt ancient. Standing on that Durban street during her graduate trip, there was nothing left of her family\u2019s home, just a concrete-block business and the unrelenting sun. The stories were no longer just stories; they were a hollow space in the world she could feel in her bones. In that moment, the academic theories from Berkeley dissolved into a raw, personal mandate. This wasn't just a research topic anymore. It was a debt she had to repay, a broken geography she had to help heal.\n\n3.\nThe job offer from the city planning department sat in her inbox, a beacon of stability and prestige. She saw the path laid out: secure, respectable, and soul-crushingly compromised. With a trembling finger, she dragged the email to the trash. The fear was electric, but it was quickly replaced by a profound sense of liberation. That single click was her declaration of independence, a commitment to a harder path where her values, not a city government's agenda, would be her only guide. This occurred right after she graduated from Berkeley.\n\n4.\nIt was a perfect afternoon at Patricia\u2019s Green. Laughter, sunshine, the scent of fresh coffee. Then she saw it: a man trying to lie down on a bench, only to be thwarted by the \"artistic\" metal dividers. He wasn\u2019t told to leave; the space itself rejected him. Amina felt a cold fury, seeing the city\u2019s progressive ideals and its brutal exclusivity in one perfect, painful snapshot. It crystallized her love-hate relationship with San Francisco and fueled her resolve to design spaces for belonging, not just for viewing. This was two years ago.\n\n5.\nThe community meeting in the Mission was getting hostile, a tangle of zoning jargon and angry accusations. Then, an elderly woman began speaking\u2014not about floor-area-ratios, but about the smell of her neighbor\u2019s cooking before the evictions started. The room fell silent. Amina felt herself shrink, realizing her blueprints were meaningless without these ghosts. It was a moment of profound humility that reshaped her entire practice. She wasn\u2019t there to impose a vision, but to listen to the memories and help a community build its own future."
