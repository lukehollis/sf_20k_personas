            "value": "Anna Fedorova\u2019s life has been a study in navigating transitions, both cultural and personal. Born in Leningrad just before the fall of the Soviet Union, she arrived in San Francisco at age six with parents who carried their engineering degrees like precious, unusable artifacts. They settled in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose persistent fog seemed to mirror their own sense of displacement. Watching her proud father struggle with underemployment and her mother work multiple cleaning jobs instilled in Anna a deep, quiet empathy for those caught in systems they don't understand.\n\nInitially, Anna sought refuge in academia, pursuing a graduate degree in Slavic Literature at SF State to connect with a heritage she barely knew. The turning point came not in a classroom, but in a hospital room. When her father suffered a major health crisis, the family was lost in the labyrinth of American healthcare until a compassionate clinical social worker stepped in, translating medical jargon, finding resources, and offering a steady hand. In that moment, Anna saw her future. She abandoned her PhD track and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program, driven by a newfound purpose.\n\nNow 39, Anna is an LCSW specializing in palliative care support. Her 0.0-mile commute is a reality of the modern world; she works entirely from a home office in her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, just blocks from where she grew up. Her days are a structured rhythm of intense telehealth sessions with patients and families facing terminal illness, followed by meditative walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress and shed the emotional weight of her work. Her social circle is small but fiercely loyal, mostly consisting of colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nAnna\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound, tied to the fog-laced streets that hold her family\u2019s story of struggle and resilience. Her dream is to eventually open a small private practice focused on serving the city\u2019s elderly immigrant population, offering them the same clarity and compassion that a stranger once offered her family. She hopes to travel to Eastern Europe one day, not just to see the past, but to understand the beginning of the journey that led her here."
