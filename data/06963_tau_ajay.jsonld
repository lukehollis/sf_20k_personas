Born in a mountain village in the Gorkha District of Nepal, his upbringing was one of hard-packed earth, monsoon rains, and the expectation that he, the eldest son, would provide. He finished his secondary schooling, the highest education his village offered, knowing his future lay far from the family\u2019s terraced fields.\n\nHis journey to America was a multi-stage migration common to many Nepali men. He first spent five years as a laborer in Dubai, sending every possible dirham home to his parents and younger sister. It was there he learned the brutal rhythm of a 14-hour workday. A cousin already in San Francisco sponsored his visa, securing him a dishwashing position at a bustling Indian-Nepali restaurant. For two years, Ajay was a ghost in the kitchen, scrubbing pots and learning English from the sharp commands of the chefs.\n\nThe key turning point was not a promotion but a moment of crisis. During a chaotic dinner rush, a junior cook froze, overwhelmed. Ajay, without thinking, stepped in, flawlessly firing off three orders of chicken tikka masala. The head chef, a stern man from his own region, saw not an act of impertinence but one of instinct. He moved Ajay to food prep the next day, and within a year, Ajay was on the line. He found an unexpected solace in the heat and pressure, a sense of control in the precise sear of lamb and the fragrant bloom of spices in hot oil.\n\nNow 37, Ajay\u2019s life is defined by routine. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down the hall and a flight of stairs. His social connections are the other kitchen staff\u2014a mix of Nepali, Salvadoran, and Filipino immigrants who share stories and cigarettes in the alley during their brief breaks. His personal relationships are conducted over staticky WhatsApp calls to his mother in Nepal, assuring her he is well and that the money has arrived.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco isn't with its iconic bridges or tech booms, but with the visceral, frantic energy of his kitchen. His dream is small, but fiercely held: to save enough to one day open his own tiny momo stall. Not a full restaurant, just a counter with a few stools, serving the dumplings of his homeland. It would be something that belongs to him, a testament to a life of sacrifice, built one perfectly pleated dumpling at a time."
