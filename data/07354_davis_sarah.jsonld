Raised in the quiet predictability of California\u2019s Central Valley, she was the first in her family to leave for college. She enrolled at Chico State, vaguely pursuing an art history degree, intoxicated by the freedom but overwhelmed by the lack of structure. After three semesters, a toxic relationship and a growing sense of being adrift caused her to drop out, leaving a hole in her life story she rarely discusses.\n\nFor the next decade, Sarah drifted. She worked as a barista in Portland, a motel cleaner in Reno, and a bartender in Sacramento, never staying long enough to plant roots. The instability chipped away at her, and she developed a dependency on alcohol to quiet the disappointment. She arrived in San Francisco ten years ago, not with a dream, but in a quiet surrender, seeking the city\u2019s anonymity. Here, she hit her lowest point, eventually finding her way into a women\u2019s supportive housing program in SoMa.\n\nThat program was her turning point. Sobriety gave her clarity, and the facility\u2019s commercial kitchen gave her a purpose. She started as a dishwasher, her hands finding comfort in the hot water and steam. She showed a natural talent for organization and consistency, quickly moving up to prep cook and, eventually, to Lead Line Cook. Today, her commute is zero miles; she lives in a small staff apartment on an upper floor of the same building.\n\nHer days start before dawn, the kitchen her sanctuary. She directs a small team, planning and preparing three meals a day for the residents\u2014women whose stories she understands intimately. Her family is now her fellow staff and the women she serves. Her aspirations are no longer grand; she dreams of one day affording a small, quiet studio in the Outer Richmond, where she can hear the foghorns and perhaps take a pottery class at a community center. Sarah\u2019s San Francisco isn't one of postcards, but of second chances, a city that saved her by giving her a place to simply be of service."
