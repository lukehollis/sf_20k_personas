Raised in a quiet, orderly suburb of Columbus, Ohio, by a high school principal and a dental hygienist, her childhood was one of predictable comfort. Her parents, practical and loving, were bewildered when she chose to major in Anthropology at Ohio State. For Simone, it was never about a direct career path; it was about understanding the artifacts and rituals that give human lives meaning, a fascination that would later define her professional life.\n\nAfter graduating, Simone felt adrift. A backpacking trip through Japan became her pivotal turning point. In small towns, she discovered centuries-old paper-making shops and artisans dedicated to traditional woodblock printing (Ukiyo-e). She wasn't an artist, she realized, but she was captivated by the process\u2014the meticulous, tangible craft of bringing an image to life on paper. This revelation propelled her to San Francisco, a city she felt valued craft and unconventional careers.\n\nShe landed an unpaid internship at a small, renowned print studio in Dogpatch, learning everything from sourcing specialty inks to calibrating massive offset printers. She proved indispensable. Now, at 34, she\u2019s the studio\u2019s Production Assistant. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a small loft apartment directly above the workshop. Her days are a blur of coordinating with artists, managing print schedules, and quality-checking zines and art books. Her social life is woven into her work, consisting of a tight-knit circle of printers, graphic designers, and the eccentric artists who rely on her to execute their vision flawlessly.\n\nThough content, Simone harbors a quiet ambition. She dreams of one day running her own small press, dedicated to publishing works from emerging artists and preserving traditional printmaking techniques\u2014a direct marriage of her anthropological studies and her hands-on craft. Her life isn't glamorous, but it is deeply authentic. For Simone, fulfillment is found not in the spotlight, but in the essential, behind-the-scenes work of helping others make their mark."
