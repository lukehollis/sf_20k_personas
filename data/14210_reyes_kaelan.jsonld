The son of a Filipino-American Navy mechanic and an Irish-American nurse, he grew up in the diverse, sun-bleached landscape of San Diego. His childhood wasn't one of art galleries, but of practicality and structure. The turning point came during a middle school field trip to Balboa Park. While his classmates buzzed past the paintings, Kaelan was mesmerized by the space itself\u2014the lighting, the flow of the rooms, the way an object\u2019s placement could tell a story. This fascination became his quiet obsession.\n\nHe moved north for college, earning a BA in Art History from San Francisco State University. The city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy was a stark contrast to San Diego's relaxed pace, and he thrived in it. He loved how art wasn\u2019t confined to museums but spilled onto the streets in murals and into boutique windows. Seeing a direct path from his passion to a profession, he enrolled in an MFA program for Exhibition Design. This is where he honed his ability to transform space and direct the eye, blending artistic theory with commercial psychology.\n\nNow, at 26, Kaelan is the Visual Merchandising Lead for a high-end home goods brand in Hayes Valley. His $85,000 salary affords him a modest but comfortable life in the Inner Richmond. His daily 2.5-mile bicycle commute is a ritual, a moving meditation through the fog-laced streets that allows him to decompress. Mornings are for mapping out store layouts, afternoons are for hands-on installation, and evenings are often spent sketching in his apartment or meeting his close-knit group of friends\u2014fellow creatives from his MFA program\u2014for drinks.\n\nThough he finds genuine satisfaction in his work, Kaelan views his retail career as a well-paid residency. His ultimate dream is to leave the world of commerce and curate an exhibition for a major institution like SFMOMA or the de Young Museum, a stone's throw from his apartment. He wants to use his skills to elevate public art, to create an experience that transcends selling a product and instead sparks the same awe he felt as a boy in a museum, finally curating the story, not just the objects."

Kaelan had stopped before a Roman bust, not for its stony face, but for how it was lit. Bathed in a single, focused beam in a shadowed alcove, its placement gave it a gravity his dad\u2019s perfectly organized toolbox never could. In that moment, a new kind of order clicked into place for him. It wasn't about the object, but about the story the space told around it, a revelation that set his life\u2019s course.\n\n2.\nHis first weeks at SF State were a shock of cold fog after a life of sun. He was 18, anonymous, and felt utterly lost. One afternoon, cutting through the Mission, a massive mural of a woman\u2019s face bloomed from a drab wall, its colors electric against the mist. It wasn't in a gallery; it was for everyone. A sudden, fierce love for this city where art refused to be contained washed over him. That raw, public beauty was the anchor he didn't know he needed.\n\n3.\nDuring his MFA final critique, his project\u2014a conceptual exhibition on urban transience\u2014was met with silence. He braced himself for failure. Then, his sternest professor walked to the model, ignoring the objects and tracing the pathways between them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just display things,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve choreographed the viewer\u2019s attention.\u201d A wave of profound relief hit him. For the first time, his obsession with space felt not like a quirk, but a translatable, powerful skill. He felt seen, and truly capable.\n\n4.\nJust last spring, the fog rolled in thick through Golden Gate Park during his commute home. He stopped his bike, the familiar chill seeping into his jacket. To his left was the de Young Museum, its copper skin muted and mysterious. He was heading home from arranging expensive vases, but his heart was in there. The daily proximity was a quiet torture and a constant promise. This ritualistic pause cemented his ambition: to one day cross that threshold not as a visitor, but as a creator.\n\n5.\nHe stayed late after the successful launch of the new spring collection. The Hayes Valley store was perfect, a symphony of muted colors and soft lighting he\u2019d orchestrated to sell $300 pitchers. The praise had been effusive, yet sitting in the silent, commercial perfection, he felt a profound hollowness. He had directed the eye to a price tag. In that sterile quiet, he vowed his next composition would guide people not to a purchase, but to a feeling\u2014the same awe he once felt as a boy."
