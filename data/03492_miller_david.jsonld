The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who settled in Daly City, David was raised on a steady diet of high expectations. His parents, a successful engineer and a diligent accountant, saw their son\u2019s future in thelucrative stability of tech or finance. David dutifully followed, earning a business degree from a respectable UC and landing a promising job at a downtown financial firm in his early twenties.\n\nThe work, however, felt hollow. The numbers on his screen felt disconnected from the vibrant, complex city just outside his window. The turning point came during a volunteer day organized by his company. He spent an afternoon serving meals in a Tenderloin soup kitchen and was struck by the systemic nature of the problems he witnessed. It wasn't just about charity; it was about policy, access, and justice. This experience lit a fire that his six-figure salary couldn't extinguish.\n\nAt 29, to his parents\u2019 profound disappointment, David quit his job and enrolled in a Master of Public Policy program at UC Berkeley. He finally felt aligned with his purpose. After graduating, he took an entry-level position at a housing advocacy nonprofit. His corporate past gave him a unique perspective on budgets and operations, and he steadily rose through the ranks.\n\nNow 48, David is the Program Manager for a nonprofit focused on homelessness prevention. His commute is zero because his life and work are deeply intertwined in his South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood. He lives in a modern, but modest, one-bedroom apartment from which he works, managing grants, staff, and outreach programs. His personal life is quiet; a marriage in his thirties ended amicably, unable to weather his demanding career and devotion to his cause. His social circle consists of fellow activists and colleagues who share his passion.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are a mix of Zoom calls and neighborhood walks, where he checks in on community partners and sees the direct impact of his work. His dream isn\u2019t of wealth or recognition, but of systemic change\u2014of seeing eviction numbers in his district genuinely decline. He hopes to one day secure enough funding to launch a pilot program for universal basic income for at-risk families, a tangible legacy in the city he chose to serve."

He had just explained he was quitting his finance job to study public policy. His mother meticulously polished her glasses while his father stared at his hands. No yelling, just a profound, weighty sorrow that felt heavier than any argument. It was the moment he chose his own path, knowing it meant leaving theirs behind. That quiet heartbreak, felt at 29, forged his resolve.\n\n2.\nThe woman\u2019s hand trembled as she took the plastic plate of stew. He was 26, wearing an immaculate suit for his firm's volunteer day in the Tenderloin, and the chasm between their lives felt physical. It wasn\u2019t pity he felt, but a sudden, nauseating clarity. The abstract market forces he tracked on his glowing screen created this tremor, this hunger. In that instant, the systemic equation clicked into place, rendering his career utterly meaningless and setting his future on a completely different course.\n\n3.\nHe and Sarah didn\u2019t fight when they decided to divorce; they just sat on the floor of their empty living room, sharing a final coffee from paper cups. \u201cYour cause is a wonderful, noble thing, David,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice soft with resignation, \u201cbut it became the third person in our marriage.\u201d He knew she was right. That moment, in his mid-thirties, wasn\u2019t one of failure, but of a sad, solitary confirmation that his life\u2019s work would demand everything he had.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, on a rainy Tuesday, a woman named Maria called him, crying. Not from despair, but from relief. A grant his team had secured had stopped her family's eviction. He could hear her child chattering in the background. The feeling that washed over him was a quiet, foundational joy, more potent than any seven-figure deal he had ever closed. It was the tangible proof that replaced the hollow thrill of his past life, fueling his drive against the burnout he saw in so many others.\n\n5.\nWalking through SoMa last fall, he saw a young family laughing as they entered the new supportive housing complex his nonprofit had helped fund. A block later, he saw another family sleeping in their car. The juxtaposition didn\u2019t bring despair, but a sharp, focused urgency. This wasn't a problem to be solved; it was a reality to be relentlessly engaged with. It was in that moment the idea for the UBI pilot solidified from a dream into a necessary, achievable plan."
