As the first-generation daughter of Mexican immigrants, she grew up bridging two worlds: the loud, loving, Spanish-speaking chaos of home and the English-speaking world of school. Witnessing the quiet, unaddressed struggles of her community\u2014the stress of migration, financial hardship, and lack of mental health resources\u2014ignited a desire to help people navigate their inner landscapes. This calling led her to San Francisco State for her undergraduate degree and later to UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work.\n\nHer career started in the vibrant heart of the Mission District, working at a community clinic. For fifteen years, she provided bilingual therapy, becoming a trusted face for families grappling with trauma and transition. However, the emotional toll and systemic burnout led her to a position at a large hospital, where she eventually transitioned to a fully remote role. This pivot was a turning point, offering sustainability in a demanding field.\n\nNow 49 and amicably divorced for a decade, Isabel lives a life of curated solitude in the Inner Sunset. Her commute is a two-step shuffle from her bedroom to her home office, a small space with a view of the fog rolling over the nearby hills. Her days are a succession of video calls, holding space for patients from across Northern California. She is a digital anchor in their turbulent lives. To decompress, she takes long, brisk walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace in the eucalyptus groves.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, comprised of a few fellow therapists she\u2019s known since grad school. They meet for dinners where conversations are candid and restorative. Though she cherishes her quiet SF life, she drives back to Fresno every few months, returning with her car full of her mother's *pan dulce*, a tangible connection to her roots. Looking ahead, Isabel dreams of opening a small, private practice focused on telehealth for the Spanish-speaking elderly, a group she feels is profoundly overlooked. It\u2019s not about growth, but about purpose\u2014a way to continue the work that first called to her, all from her quiet corner of the city."
