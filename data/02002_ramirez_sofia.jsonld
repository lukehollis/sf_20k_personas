Raised in Fresno as the only child of Mexican immigrants, her world was defined by the sun-baked sprawl of the Central Valley. Her parents worked tirelessly\u2014her father in agriculture, her mother as a hotel housekeeper\u2014and their lives were tethered to a single, aging sedan. Sofia saw firsthand how a flat tire could mean a lost day's wage and how the lack of a reliable bus route isolated families from better jobs, healthcare, and opportunity. For her, public transportation was never an abstraction; it was a lifeline her community desperately needed.\n\nThis early insight fueled her academic journey. She moved to Los Angeles for her undergraduate degree at UCLA, where the sprawling city and its complex transit system fascinated her. But it was the Bay Area that called to her. She earned her Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley, her thesis focused on creating equitable transit access in low-income neighborhoods. Upon graduating, she landed her dream job as a Transportation Planner for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.\n\nThe great turning point in her life, however, was the 2020 pandemic. Her job, once filled with site visits and community meetings, shifted entirely to remote work. This created the central irony of Sofia\u2019s current existence: she spends her days designing the intricate flow of a million people while her own commute is zero miles.\n\nToday, Sofia lives in a compact, light-filled apartment in Hayes Valley. Her lifestyle is a deliberate exercise in the urbanism she champions. She begins her mornings with a walk to a local coffee shop, works from a desk overlooking a bustling street, and breaks up her day with a run through the Panhandle. Her social life is her anchor; a tight-knit group of friends, her \u201cchosen family,\u201d often gathers for dinners at her place or explores the city's ever-changing culinary scene.\n\nSofia\u2019s ambition is to see a major project\u2014like a new Bus Rapid Transit line on a key corridor\u2014from conception to completion, a tangible mark on the city she loves. She dreams of one day exploring the masterful train systems of Japan and Europe, but for now, she finds deep satisfaction in knowing her work, done from the stillness of her apartment, helps keep San Francisco moving."
