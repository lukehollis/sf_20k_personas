Raised in a multiracial family with deep Mexican and Italian roots, her childhood was defined by the rhythm of the seasons. She watched her parents manage their small winery, grappling not with the romance of winemaking, but with the brutal realities of logistics: fickle shipping companies, rising fuel costs, and the fragility of a supply chain dependent on perfect weather. While her siblings were drawn to the soil, Isabela was fascinated by the complex, often-invisible network that brought their product to the world.\n\nThis fascination led her to pursue a degree in Supply Chain Management at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. After graduating, she moved to San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s energy and a job offer from a major shipping corporation. The transition was a culture shock, swapping dusty, open landscapes for the dense, fog-laced grid of the city. She thrived professionally, known for her pragmatic approach and ability to untangle complex operational knots.\n\nA key turning point came during a severe wildfire season that triggered rolling blackouts, crippling infrastructure and threatening her family\u2019s harvest back home. The event was a visceral reminder of systemic vulnerability. It galvanized her to pivot her career from moving goods to moving power. She transitioned into the utilities sector, eventually landing her current role as a Senior Program Manager for Grid Modernization.\n\nNow, at 38, Isabela lives in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. Her daily routine begins with a Muni ride to her downtown office, a journey she uses to listen to urban planning podcasts. Her days are filled with strategic meetings and data analysis, focused on building a more resilient and equitable energy grid. Evenings are for yoga classes, exploring the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant restaurant scene with a close-knit group of friends, or quiet nights planning her next international trip. Isabela\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal; she is actively building the city\u2019s future while savoring its present. Her ultimate dream is to one day consult for the state, ensuring that the critical infrastructure she helps design benefits all communities, from bustling urban centers to the agricultural heartlands she still calls home."

One morning, the N Judah train stalled on the underground tracks between Van Ness and Civic Center. Claustrophobia prickled her skin. Then, she looked at the faces around her\u2014all calm, lost in music or books, simply waiting. In that shared, suspended moment, the city felt less like a machine and more like a living organism. The anxiety eased into a quiet sense of belonging, a single node in a vast, resilient network. This happened when she was 22.\n\n2.\nThe sky over San Francisco was a bruised orange from wildfire smoke. Her power was out, but the real dread came from the unanswered calls to her parents. She imagined the grapes withering on the vine, the coolers failing, a year's work lost to a faltering grid. The helplessness she felt was visceral, a professional problem made agonizingly personal. It was in that dark, smoky apartment that her career path fractured. Efficiency no longer mattered; resilience was everything. She was 29 when she decided to move from goods to power.\n\n3.\nIsabela stood on the rooftop of the Salesforce Transit Center, years after moving to the city. Below her, buses flowed in and out of the terminal in a perfectly choreographed dance. She was suddenly that little girl again, sitting in her father's dusty office, sketching logistics routes on a notepad. She felt a profound sense of continuity, realizing the system she was now helping build was just a grander version of the puzzle she had been trying to solve her whole life. This memory, from when she was 34, solidified her purpose.\n\n4.\nShe was at a wine bar in Hayes Valley with two of her closest friends, celebrating a small victory at work. The conversation was easy, a comfortable weave of inside jokes and future plans. Through the window, the fog muted the streetlights, cocooning them. In that moment, she felt the deep, anchoring roots of her chosen family. San Francisco had become more than a career move; it was home, a place where she was known and loved. That feeling of contentment, from a quiet Tuesday when she was 36, is one she holds dear.\n\n5.\nPresenting her team's microgrid proposal to a small, rural community liaison board felt more daunting than any corporate meeting. In their faces, she saw her own family's pragmatic skepticism. But as she explained how it would protect their water pumps and cooling centers during outages, she saw understanding dawn. A nod from an elderly farmer, a man who reminded her of her own grandfather, felt like the most significant approval she'd ever received. At 37, it affirmed her belief that a well-designed system serves people, not just profit."
