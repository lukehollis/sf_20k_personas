Born in Fremont to first-generation Indian immigrants, he grew up surrounded by the hum of burgeoning Silicon Valley. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a similar path for him, one paved with the certainty of STEM. Rohan, however, was drawn to the stories of the past. In an act of quiet rebellion, he pursued a Bachelor's degree in History from UC Santa Cruz, a choice that created a gentle but persistent rift with his family\u2019s ambitions.\n\nAfter graduating, the pragmatic need for a stable job outweighed his passion for academia. He fell into an administrative assistant role at a small tech startup during the late \u201890s boom. While his peers coded the future, Rohan found a niche in creating order from chaos. He was reliable, organized, and preternaturally calm under pressure. When the dot-com bubble burst, his steady, essential role saw him through rounds of layoffs. Over two decades, he built a career not as a visionary, but as the indispensable operational backbone\u2014the Office Manager who ensures the visionaries have functioning keycards and a well-stocked kitchen.\n\nHis key turning point was a divorce in his late thirties. The split was amicable but profound, leaving him with a mortgage on a cozy apartment in the Duboce Triangle and a heightened sense of solitude. This is where he truly rooted himself in San Francisco. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is now hyperlocal. His day begins with a walk with his scruffy terrier, Buster, to a cafe on Sanchez Street, followed by a day of managing calendars, vendors, and virtual team events from his spare bedroom.\n\nSocially, he maintains a small circle of old friends, but his primary connections are the familiar faces in his neighborhood: the dog owners at Duboce Park, the barista who knows his order, the clerk at the corner market. He is comfortable, but a faint wistfulness lingers. He sometimes pulls his old history textbooks off the shelf, dreaming of a future where he could volunteer at the California Historical Society or finally write that book on the maritime history of the bay. Rohan\u2019s aspiration isn't for wealth or status, but for a life where his pragmatism and passion can finally coexist."
