Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Fresno, his world was one of tract homes and strip malls, connected only by the family minivan. His parents, proprietors of a local hardware store, instilled in him a pragmatic appreciation for things that were well-built and functional. Yet, David yearned for the density and dynamism he only saw in movies, a yearning that led him to pursue a history degree, focusing on the growth of American metropolises.\n\nThis academic passion solidified into a career path. He attended UCLA, earning a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, where he became obsessed with transit-oriented development and creating walkable, human-scale communities. His first job was with the City of Oakland, cutting his teeth on zoning variances and community outreach meetings. But the ultimate prize was across the bay. In his early thirties, he landed a coveted position as a planner for the City and County of San Francisco.\n\nThe first decade was a whirlwind of professional triumphs and personal costs. David was a key planner on a complex mixed-use housing project in the Mission, a project he remains immensely proud of, despite the political battles it entailed. However, the long hours and consuming nature of his work contributed to the slow erosion of his long-term relationship, which ended five years ago.\n\nNow, at 44, David lives a quieter, more solitary life. His 0.0-mile commute is to a standing desk in the corner of his Hayes Valley condo, a neighborhood he loves for its successful post-freeway revitalization. His days are a disciplined mix of digital blueprints, Zoom calls with developers, and policy draft reviews. He breaks up the day with walks to Patricia's Green or a coffee from a local cafe, observing the urban fabric he helps manage.\n\nHe is no longer the wide-eyed idealist who arrived from Fresno. The city\u2019s intractable problems have tempered his optimism with a heavy dose of pragmatism. Still, a flicker of hope remains. David\u2019s deepest aspiration is to see a truly affordable, large-scale housing project break ground before he retires\u2014a tangible legacy that makes the city he loves just a little more equitable and livable for the next generation."
