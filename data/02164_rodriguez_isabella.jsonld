The daughter of Mexican immigrants, she grew up in a small farming town where her father\u2019s calloused hands worked the land and her mother\u2019s nimble fingers stitched together a life as a seamstress. Her first exposure to art was not in galleries, but in the vibrant patterns of fabric her mother used and the rich, narrative murals that decorated the local panaderia. In high school, a passionate art teacher saw a spark in Isabella, encouraging her to apply to colleges far beyond the valley\u2019s horizon.\n\nThe move to San Francisco State University was a profound turning point. Initially navigating the city\u2019s cacophony and color with a sense of awe and alienation, she quickly found her footing. She shed her \"practical\" business major for Art History, feeling an immediate sense of belonging. To fuse her passion with purpose, she pursued a Master\u2019s in Arts Administration, determined to build bridges between artists and communities. This path led her directly to her current role as a Program Manager for a non-profit dedicated to showcasing underrepresented local artists.\n\nIsabella now lives a life deeply embedded in her work and community. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she resides in a subsidized live/work loft in the Mission District, just one floor above her organization's office and gallery space. Her days are a blur of grant writing, coordinating with artists, and planning community workshops. Her evenings are often spent at gallery openings, poetry readings, or sharing a meal with her tight-knit circle of fellow creatives who have become her chosen family. While she loves her parents deeply, a gentle distance exists; they are proud but don\u2019t fully comprehend her world of installations and artist statements.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and fierce. She sees the ongoing gentrification in the Mission not as an inevitable tide, but as a challenge to be met with cultural preservation. She dreams of one day becoming the Executive Director of her organization, securing its legacy and ensuring that a new generation of kids\u2014ones who, like her, might find their first glimpse of art in the everyday\u2014have a place to see their stories told."
