He was born into the restaurant business, but not this pristine version. His parents, immigrants from Delhi, poured their life savings into a bustling, beloved Indian restaurant in Fremont. Arnav\u2019s childhood was a blend of fragrant spice clouds, the clatter of steel thalis, and the exhaustion on his parents' faces after a 14-hour day. They hoped he would one day take over, but Arnav craved a different kind of order and elegance.\n\nHe escaped to UC Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Art History, a rebellion his parents saw as frivolous. He was fascinated by composition, narrative, and the intentional creation of an aesthetic experience\u2014principles he found lacking in the chaotic, though loving, environment of his family's kitchen. To support himself, he took a server job at a fine-dining establishment in San Francisco. It was there he had his epiphany: a perfectly run dining room was a form of performance art. The ma\u00eetre d' was a curator, the servers were performers, and every dish was a carefully composed masterpiece.\n\nA discerning General Manager noticed Arnav\u2019s preternatural calm and his unique ability to anticipate a guest's needs, recognizing his academic eye for detail translated into flawless front-of-house execution. He was promoted quickly, from server to captain, and finally, at just 24, offered the manager position at his current restaurant.\n\nNow, at 25, Arnav\u2019s life is his work. He lives in a small apartment directly above the restaurant, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to his dedication. His day begins with inventory and ends long after the last glass of wine is polished, often sharing a quiet drink with the head chef to dissect the night\u2019s service. His social circle consists of his staff and a few industry peers. His dream is to earn a Michelin star not for the food alone, but for the impeccable service he orchestrates. Ultimately, he aspires to open his own restaurant, a place that marries the soulful warmth of his heritage with the refined, artful precision he has made his life\u2019s work."
