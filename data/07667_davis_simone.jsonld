            "value": "Simone Davis was raised on the rhythm of Oakland, a city whose pulse she still feels despite now living across the bay. The eldest of three, she became a second mother by default, her own mother a single parent working double shifts as a home health aide. Simone\u2019s childhood was a mix of packing school lunches, mediating sibling squabbles, and finding quiet moments to sketch in notebooks, dreaming of a more colorful world. This early sense of responsibility shaped her, making her a natural caregiver.\n\nHer educational path was practical. She earned an Associate's degree in Graphic Design from Laney College, hoping to turn her artistic talent into a career. However, the instability of freelance work and the need for a steady paycheck led her to a job that felt familiar: working with children. She took a position as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a small preschool, intending it to be a temporary step. But the chaotic, vibrant energy of the classroom resonated with her. The work wasn't a choice she\u2019d planned, but it felt like a calling she\u2019d stumbled into.\n\nThe true turning point came at 28 when she moved to San Francisco. Seeking independence after her younger siblings were grown, she found a small, rent-controlled in-law unit in the Inner Richmond. By a stroke of luck, the preschool just down the block was hiring. Her commute became a 90-second walk, instantly embedding her into the fabric of the neighborhood.\n\nNow 34, Simone\u2019s life is defined by this hyperlocal existence. Her days begin with a walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee before she immerses herself in the joyous cacophony of her classroom. She is the calm center in a storm of finger-painting, story time, and scraped knees. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of a few fellow teachers and a childhood friend who also migrated to the city.\n\nThough content, a quiet ambition still flickers. In the evenings, after the children\u2019s voices have faded, she pulls out her old sketchbooks. Her dream is to merge her two worlds: to write and illustrate a children's book. It\u2019s a goal that feels both distant and deeply personal, a way to honor the artist she was and the nurturing woman she has become, right here in her small corner of San Francisco."
