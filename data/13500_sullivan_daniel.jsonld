His father, a software engineer, and his mother, a high school history teacher, raised him in a home filled with books, lively dinner debates, and a deep sense of belonging. Yet, a quiet curiosity about his origins simmered within him. His mother, in a heartfelt effort to connect him with his heritage, would often cook from Korean cookbooks. For Daniel, the bubbling jjigae and sizzling bulgogi became a sensory link to a culture he knew only through stories and flavors.\n\nThis suburban upbringing propelled him down a conventional path of achievement. He earned an economics degree from UCLA, followed by an MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, fulfilling the implicit expectations of his high-achieving environment. He landed a lucrative job in management consulting in San Francisco, but the work felt hollow, a world of spreadsheets disconnected from anything tangible.\n\nThe turning point came at 28, during a two-week trip to South Korea. He didn't search for his birth parents, but wandering through the sprawling Gwangjang Market in Seoul, surrounded by the dizzying array of sights, sounds, and smells, he found a different kind of homecoming. He found his passion. He returned to SF, quit his corporate job, and dove headfirst into the culinary world. He took a massive pay cut to work as a restaurant manager, absorbing every lesson about operations, sourcing, and customer experience.\n\nNow, at 37, Daniel has masterfully merged his business acumen with his passion. As the Director of Culinary Experience for the Asian Art Museum, he curates everything from the museum\u2019s caf\u00e9 to exclusive, exhibition-themed dining events. His MBA is no longer a relic of a past life but a powerful tool that allows him to build a bridge between art and food.\n\nHe lives in a sleek one-bedroom in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose vibrant food scene he adores. His daily 2.8-mile bike commute to the museum is a cherished ritual, a chance to feel the city's pulse. Evenings are often spent trying a new restaurant or sketching out ideas for his ultimate dream: opening a small, intimate dining space that tells stories through its menu. For Daniel, food was never just sustenance; it\u2019s a language of identity, connection, and art\u2014a language he has finally made his own."

The bubbling red jjigae wasn\u2019t a taste of a homeland he\u2019d never known, but a taste of his mother\u2019s love. It was a sensory bridge she built for him with every stir of the spoon. That warmth, both from the stew and her effort, taught him that food could be a language of profound affection, planting a seed of curiosity that would later define his life.\n\n2.\nAt 27, he had a corner office with a view of the Bay Bridge, a monument to his success. He recalls a specific Tuesday, staring at a spreadsheet optimizing supply chains for a company whose product he found meaningless. The numbers blurred into a gray haze, and a profound hollowness echoed in the quiet hum of the servers. It was the crushing realization that he\u2019d achieved a life he didn\u2019t want. That afternoon crystallized his need for something tangible, something with flavor and soul, sparking the decision to finally book a ticket to Seoul.\n\n3.\nThe chaos of Gwangjang Market hit him all at once. He was 28, a tourist in his birth country, yet he felt an electric sense of homecoming. It wasn't about finding family; it was about the symphony of it all\u2014the steam from mandu, the sharp funk of fermenting kimchi, the rhythmic clang of a vendor\u2019s knife. Surrounded by food that felt both foreign and deeply familiar, he had an epiphany. This vibrant, nourishing world was where he belonged. He wasn't just observing; he was finally understanding a part of himself.\n\n4.\nHis first night as a restaurant manager was pure, terrifying chaos. He recalls standing at the pass, the heat of the lamps on his face, sweat dripping down his neck. The roar of the kitchen, the clatter of plates, the urgent calls from servers\u2014it was a brutal symphony. Yet, when the last table left, he felt an exhaustion so deep and satisfying it was almost euphoric. That night, hunched over a staff meal, he knew he had traded a hollow prestige for something real. He had found his work.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a donor gala for a new Korean ceramics exhibit, he stood quietly watching guests sample his creation: a delicate perilla leaf-wrapped bossam. He had designed the dish to echo the exhibit\u2019s theme of layered glazes. He overheard a woman explaining the connection to her husband, her eyes lighting up with understanding. In that moment, his entire journey clicked into place. His business degree and his culinary passion weren't two separate lives; they were ingredients in a single, perfect recipe. He wasn't just serving food; he was curating connection."
