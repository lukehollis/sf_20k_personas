Born in Mumbai to a Goan Catholic family, her world was a blend of her engineer father\u2019s pragmatism and her textile artist mother\u2019s vibrant creativity. This fusion of structure and aesthetics guided her path, leading her to study architecture in India before a prestigious scholarship brought her to Columbia University for her master's degree.\n\nNew York was formative but relentless. After a decade designing sterile corporate towers for a major firm, Priya felt a deep-seated disconnect. A visit to San Francisco in the late 90s became her pivotal turning point. She was captivated by the city\u2019s eccentric architecture, its audacious embrace of creativity, and the soft Pacific light. She decided to risk everything, moving west to establish her own boutique firm, Silva Design.\n\nHer gamble paid off. Priya carved a niche designing spaces where art and community converge: intimate art galleries in SoMa, acoustically perfect music venues in the East Bay, and airy, sustainable wineries in Napa. Her work is celebrated for its human scale and its conversation with the surrounding environment.\n\nNow 54, Priya lives and works in a meticulously restored Edwardian flat in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her sun-drenched living quarters to her ground-floor studio, which opens onto a small, tranquil garden. Her life is ordered but not rigid. Mornings begin with yoga and strong coffee before she immerses herself in blueprints and 3D models. Evenings are often spent at SFJAZZ, attending a friend\u2019s gallery opening, or enjoying dinner with her close-knit circle of fellow artists and thinkers. Divorced for over a decade, she values her independence and the deep, platonic friendships that form the true architecture of her social life.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she feels a partnership with the city. Her current aspiration is to leave a public legacy\u2014to design a library or a community arts center that gives back to the city that allowed her to build her dreams. She envisions a space that is beautiful, functional, and, above all, welcoming to everyone."
