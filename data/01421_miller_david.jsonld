Born in Daly City to a pragmatic Filipino immigrant mother who worked as a nurse and a Caucasian father, a free-spirited, often-unemployed musician, David grew up navigating conflicting expectations. His childhood was a quiet negotiation of cultures, never feeling entirely rooted in either. This feeling of being an outsider, an observer, would later become his greatest professional asset.\n\nAfter a rudderless period following high school, spent working in cafes and bookstores across the Bay Area, a personal crisis became his catalyst. Watching a close friend spiral into a severe depressive episode, David felt a profound helplessness that ignited a sense of purpose. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, finding his calling in psychology, and later earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire in a community mental health clinic in the Tenderloin. There, he worked with the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations, confronting the raw realities of trauma, addiction, and systemic neglect. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, but it honed his skills and deepened his empathy. After a decade on the front lines, facing burnout, he made the difficult decision to transition to private practice.\n\nNow, at 45, David lives and works out of his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. His \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his home office, a calm space with a view of the fog rolling in over the hills. His days follow a deliberate rhythm: a misty morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by back-to-back virtual therapy sessions with clients wrestling with anxiety, career burnout, and the unique loneliness of modern urban life. Divorced for five years, his social life is small but meaningful, centered on a close group of former colleagues and a weekly pottery class that grounds him.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and complex; he sees its beauty and its pain with a therapist's clarity. David\u2019s dream is not of wealth or notoriety, but of sustainability\u2014to continue his work without losing himself. He aspires to one day lead a men\u2019s support group, creating a space for vulnerability in a city that often demands a tough exterior. For David, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the complex, wounded, resilient client he has dedicated his life to understanding."
