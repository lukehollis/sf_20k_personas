Born in Daly City to a pragmatic Filipino immigrant mother who worked as a nurse and a Caucasian father, a free-spirited, often-unemployed musician, David grew up navigating conflicting expectations. His childhood was a quiet negotiation of cultures, never feeling entirely rooted in either. This feeling of being an outsider, an observer, would later become his greatest professional asset.\n\nAfter a rudderless period following high school, spent working in cafes and bookstores across the Bay Area, a personal crisis became his catalyst. Watching a close friend spiral into a severe depressive episode, David felt a profound helplessness that ignited a sense of purpose. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, finding his calling in psychology, and later earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire in a community mental health clinic in the Tenderloin. There, he worked with the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations, confronting the raw realities of trauma, addiction, and systemic neglect. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, but it honed his skills and deepened his empathy. After a decade on the front lines, facing burnout, he made the difficult decision to transition to private practice.\n\nNow, at 45, David lives and works out of his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. His \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his home office, a calm space with a view of the fog rolling in over the hills. His days follow a deliberate rhythm: a misty morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by back-to-back virtual therapy sessions with clients wrestling with anxiety, career burnout, and the unique loneliness of modern urban life. Divorced for five years, his social life is small but meaningful, centered on a close group of former colleagues and a weekly pottery class that grounds him.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and complex; he sees its beauty and its pain with a therapist's clarity. David\u2019s dream is not of wealth or notoriety, but of sustainability\u2014to continue his work without losing himself. He aspires to one day lead a men\u2019s support group, creating a space for vulnerability in a city that often demands a tough exterior. For David, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the complex, wounded, resilient client he has dedicated his life to understanding."

To his right, his father\u2019s relatives talked over the sound of a blues record, their voices a low American hum. David held a plate of food from both worlds, feeling less like a participant and more like a quiet translator. That feeling of being an observer, caught in the space between, never left him. It became the foundation of his empathy.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the crushing silence in his friend\u2019s dimly lit Mission apartment. He was twenty-one, and everything he said felt hollow and useless in the face of Mark's profound depression. He just sat there, helpless, as his friend stared blankly at the wall. That feeling\u2014of utter inadequacy against the weight of someone else\u2019s pain\u2014was the catalyst. It wasn\u2019t a desire to \"fix\" people that drove him to psychology, but a desperate need to learn how to truly sit with them in the dark.\n\n3.\nA few years into his work at the Tenderloin clinic, a teenage client who hadn't spoken in weeks wordlessly pushed a drawing across the table. It was a detailed sketch of a single, perfect bird on a telephone wire, observed from what looked like a windowsill. Amidst the chaos of sirens and shouting outside, that quiet offering felt monumental. It wasn\u2019t a cure, but it was a connection. It solidified his belief that his job wasn't to solve, but to create a space safe enough for a bird to be drawn.\n\n4.\nHe was thirty-eight when he made the decision. Walking home from the clinic, he caught his reflection in a dark shop window on Larkin Street and was startled by the exhaustion in his own eyes. He looked as haunted as the clients he was trying to help. The fog was rolling in, and for the first time, it didn\u2019t feel like a mysterious comfort but like a weight. He realized he had to change his path, not to abandon the work, but to find a way to do it without drowning.\n\n5.\nLast year, in his weekly pottery class, the pot he was carefully shaping suddenly collapsed into a wet, lopsided ruin. He expected the familiar sting of frustration, but instead, he felt a wave of relief. He let out a small laugh. It was just clay. It could be gathered, centered, and begun again. In the messy collapse, he felt a moment of grace\u2014a lesson from his hands, not his mind\u2014about the permission to be imperfect, to fall apart, and to patiently start over."
