The only child of two literature professors, her home was filled with books but scant on overt emotional expression. From a young age, Leila became a keen observer of unspoken feelings, the subtle shifts in tone and posture that betrayed the anxieties her parents curated with academic precision.\n\nShe initially followed their path, pursuing a graduate degree in Comparative Literature at Northwestern. But a volunteer gig at a domestic violence shelter became her turning point. The raw, immediate need she witnessed made her literary analysis feel sterile and distant. She abruptly changed course, applying to and completing a Master of Social Work program, driven by a newfound urgency to engage with human stories not on the page, but in person.\n\nDrawn by its progressive reputation and a desire for reinvention, Leila moved to San Francisco in her late twenties. Her first job at a major downtown hospital was a baptism by fire. The relentless exposure to crisis and trauma led to severe burnout within five years. That difficult period forced her to rebuild her life with intention. She left the high-intensity ER environment for a position in palliative care, finding profound meaning in helping patients and families navigate end-of-life transitions.\n\nNow 41, Leila has sculpted a life of sustainable peace. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this; she works entirely via telehealth from her serene Inner Sunset apartment. Her days are structured: a morning walk through Golden Gate Park, a block away, is non-negotiable. Work sessions are conducted in a dedicated office nook, after which she closes the laptop and the emotional files of the day. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow healthcare workers and artists\u2014who constitute her chosen family.\n\nLeila\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its frantic energy and more about the quiet pockets she\u2019s claimed as her own. She loves the fog rolling over the hills and the independent bookstores of her neighborhood. Her future aspirations are gentle: she dreams of writing a collection of essays on modern grief and, perhaps one day, opening a small private practice from her home, continuing her work on her own carefully defined terms."
