Born in a Sacramento suburb to a pragmatic Russian-American mother and a warm, optimistic Indo-Fijian father, his identity was a blend of cultures. His father, Rohan Prasad, passed away from a sudden illness when Alexei was just nine, leaving his mother, Irina, to raise him alone. Watching her work two jobs to keep them afloat instilled in Alexei a profound sense of duty and a sharp awareness of the systemic cracks people can fall through. This experience became the bedrock of his empathy and steered him away from more lucrative careers.\n\nHe chose San Francisco State for its social work program, drawn to the city's promise of progressive values. After graduation, he dived headfirst into the demanding world of frontline case management, working with at-risk youth in the foster care system. For nearly a decade, he poured himself into the work, celebrating small victories but absorbing the weight of countless heartbreaks. The turning point came with a case he couldn't \"win\"\u2014a teenager who, despite Alexei\u2019s best efforts, aged out of the system and ended up homeless. Burned out and disillusioned with his individual impact, Alexei realized he could do more by shaping the programs themselves. He transitioned into an administrative role, eventually becoming a Clinical Program Manager.\n\nNow, at 36, Alexei\u2019s life is one of structured purpose. His days begin with the familiar rumble of the 38-Geary bus, taking him from his modest Inner Richmond apartment to his office near Civic Center. He now manages budgets, mentors younger clinicians, and writes grants, fighting battles on spreadsheets instead of in homes. His $98,500 salary affords him a comfortable but not extravagant life in a city that constantly tests one's finances.\n\nRecently out of a five-year relationship, his social life is quiet. Weekends are for long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park or exploring the dim sum restaurants on Clement Street. He feels deeply connected to the city\u2019s real, working-class pulse, far from the tech glamour. He dreams of securing a major federal grant that would double his program's capacity. More personally, he hopes to find a stable partnership and one day travel to both Fiji and the region of Russia his mother fled, finally connecting with the two halves of his heritage that his name represents."

He describes the mangoes in Fiji, so sweet they are like \"sunshine you can hold.\" Rohan promises that one day, they will go and eat them until their stomachs hurt. Alexei remembers the feeling of pure, unshakeable safety. That memory is now the seed of a lifelong promise, a sweet, aching reminder of the optimistic world his father represented.\n\n2.\nAt fourteen, he came home late from a friend\u2019s house to find his mother, Irina, asleep at the kitchen table. Her head was propped on one hand, a pen still loosely held in the other, a stack of bills and her work schedule spread under the harsh fluorescent light. A wave of adult responsibility washed over him. In that moment, he didn\u2019t just see his tired mother; he saw the entire unfair, grinding system. It solidified in him a quiet, fierce resolve to stand in the gaps for people like her.\n\n3.\nThe last time he saw Leo was on a street corner in the Tenderloin, about six months after the boy had aged out of the system. It was 2018. Leo, barely twenty, looked thin and tired but managed a hollow smile. \"Still fighting the good fight, Mr. P?\" he asked, pulling his hoodie tight. Alexei could only nod, the inadequacy a physical weight in his chest. That brief, gutting conversation was the moment he knew he had to stop trying to fix one leak and start trying to fix the faulty plumbing itself.\n\n4.\nIt was just another Tuesday morning two years ago, the 38-Geary lurching down its route. Rain slicked the windows, but through the condensation, Alexei saw the city\u2019s true portrait: the nanny heading to work, the student with their headphones, the elderly man with his grocery bag. A profound, quiet sense of solidarity settled over him. These were his people. This shared, unglamorous journey was the San Francisco he fought for. It wasn\u2019t a memory of triumph, but of belonging, and it fortified his purpose more than any award ever could.\n\n5.\nJust last month, walking alone near the Dutch Windmills as the fog rolled in, he felt the acute emptiness of the space beside him where his ex-partner used to be. For a moment, it was a sharp, lonely ache. But then, the cool, grey mist enveloped him, erasing the horizon. It felt less like isolation and more like a clean slate. It was the first time since the breakup he felt not just his loss, but the quiet, solitary potential of what might come next, for both his city and himself."
