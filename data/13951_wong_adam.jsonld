As a Caucasian man adopted at birth by a loving, second-generation Chinese-American couple in San Francisco's Sunset District, his identity was forged in a unique crucible of cultures. Growing up, he celebrated Christmas and Chinese New Year with equal fervor, learning to navigate the loving space between two worlds. This upbringing instilled in him a profound empathy and an awareness of the systems that shape family and opportunity.\n\nHis parents, an engineer and a teacher, championed education, but Adam was drawn to people, not problems on a spreadsheet. Witnessing the subtle challenges his family and their community faced ignited a desire to help others navigate complex social structures. He pursued a degree in sociology at SF State, volunteering at a youth center in the Mission, which solidified his path. For Adam, social work wasn't just a career; it was a calling, a way to pay forward the stability and love he\u2019d been given. He earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on community mental health.\n\nHis career began with frontline work, counseling at-risk teens. While rewarding, he saw systemic flaws that no amount of one-on-one therapy could fix. This was his key turning point. Driven to make a broader impact, he transitioned into program management, obtaining his LCSW to better inform his leadership. Today, as a Program Manager, he oversees a multi-faceted initiative providing educational and mental health support to underserved families across the city.\n\nAdam now lives in the Inner Richmond. His 2.5-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus is a daily immersion in the city\u2019s diverse pulse. Evenings are often spent jogging in Golden Gate Park or sharing a meal with his aging parents. At 39, he feels a deep sense of belonging, a man whose life story mirrors the city\u2019s own interwoven fabric. His ultimate dream isn\u2019t wealth, but to expand his program's model, convinced that with the right support, every child can find their place in the world, just as he found his."

'For Ah-Dam Wong,' the old man said, his voice full of pride. It wasn\u2019t the crisp bill inside; it was hearing his name, the two halves of his world spoken as one perfect whole. In that moment, all his childhood anxieties about his blonde hair vanished. He wasn\u2019t just loved; he belonged. That feeling of unconditional acceptance became his anchor.\n\n2.\nHe was twenty, and a teen at the Mission youth center named Marco cornered him. \"What do you know, Adam Wong?\" he sneered, making the name a punchline. Instead of backing down, Adam sat down. He told Marco about growing up, about feeling in-between, about the name itself. The kid\u2019s hard exterior slowly cracked. They just talked. It was the moment Adam realized his entire life story was not a complication, but his greatest tool for empathy. It turned his calling into a conviction.\n\n3.\nAt 28, a brilliant teen girl he\u2019d been counseling for months was facing eviction. Adam made call after call, filling out forms he knew led to year-long waitlists. He saw the fire in her eyes dim with each bureaucratic failure. The system wasn't just failing her; it was designed to. That night, staring at her closed case file, a cold rage settled in him. One-on-one help felt like patching a dam with chewing gum. He decided then he had to be one of the people designing the dam itself.\n\n4.\nJust last week on the 38-Geary, he looked up and saw a Filipina grandmother speaking Tagalog to her small grandson, who had bright red hair. The boy answered her in perfect English. Adam saw his own life reflected in that mundane, beautiful moment\u2014the city\u2019s blend of language, love, and lineage. He felt a quiet, profound sense of peace. This was his city, and he was a part of its complex, interwoven story. He was home.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, visiting his parents, he found his mother looking tired. Without a word, he went to the kitchen, grabbed an orange, and carefully sliced it into wedges, arranging them on a plate just as she\u2019d done for him a thousand times. He handed it to her, and she patted his hand, a silent thank you passing between them. In that simple act of care, he felt the entire arc of his life\u2014of being nurtured, and now, of nurturing back. It was his reason for everything."
