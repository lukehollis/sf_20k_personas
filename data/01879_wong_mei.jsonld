Born to industrious Cantonese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood alteration shop, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty. Her parents, having sacrificed much for a foothold in the city, envisioned a stable, lucrative future for her\u2014a dental hygienist, perhaps, or a business manager.\n\nTo appease them, Mei enrolled at City College of San Francisco and dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration. Yet, the world of spreadsheets and profit margins felt hollow. A turning point came during a summer spent volunteering at a community daycare. Surrounded by the chaotic, vibrant energy of young children, she felt a profound sense of purpose she had never experienced before. The decision to abandon the business track for early childhood education was a quiet rebellion, causing a gentle rift with her parents who saw it as a step backward.\n\nNow, Mei is an assistant teacher at the \"Little Sprouts Preschool,\" conveniently located on the ground floor of the apartment building where she rents a small studio. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life and work are deeply intertwined. Her days are a whirlwind of finger paints, story time, and mediating toddler disputes. She is a calming presence, known for her patience and her ability to coax a smile from the shyest of children.\n\nHer social life is modest, revolving around a close friend from City College and the families at the preschool, who have become an extension of her own. Evenings are often spent studying for online courses, slowly working towards a Bachelor's in Early Childhood Education.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and deeply felt. It isn't the city of tech wealth or tourist landmarks, but the fog rolling down Clement Street, the aroma of her parents' shop, and the sound of children's laughter echoing in the courtyard. Her dream isn't fame or fortune, but to one day open her own small, bilingual preschool in the neighborhood that raised her, nurturing the city\u2019s next generation with the same care and dedication she now gives to her work."
