The only child of Hong Kong immigrants, she grew up amidst the fragrant bustle of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Outer Richmond. From behind the counter, she watched the neighborhood evolve, learning early that a city is a living organism, a collection of stories, conflicts, and compromises written in concrete and steel.\n\nInitially drawn to form and beauty, Mei-ling pursued an undergraduate degree in Architecture at UC Berkeley. The turning point came during her senior year when a large-scale redevelopment project threatened to displace her parents' store and dozens of other small businesses. Fighting the project alongside her community, she discovered her true passion wasn't in designing individual buildings, but in orchestrating the complex systems that allow communities to thrive. This revelation led her to a Master's degree in Urban Planning, where she focused on community-led development and historic preservation.\n\nAfter a decade working within the San Francisco Planning Department, Mei-ling grew frustrated with the slow pace of bureaucracy. She left to establish her own consultancy, a boutique firm dedicated to creating more equitable, sustainable, and human-centric urban spaces. Today, she is one of the city's most respected consultants, known for her sharp mind and empathetic approach.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her philosophy. She lives in a meticulously restored Victorian in Hayes Valley, with her office occupying the ground floor. Her days begin not with a drive, but with a walk, cup of coffee from a local cafe in hand, observing the urban ballet of her neighborhood. Though she never married or had children, Mei-ling has cultivated a deep network of friends, colleagues, and community activists who serve as her chosen family.\n\nAt 53, Mei-ling\u2019s aspiration is one of legacy. She dreams of spearheading a program that safeguards the city\u2019s cultural heritage districts against the relentless pressures of the tech economy. She sees her life\u2019s work as a continuation of her parents\u2019 legacy\u2014not just stocking shelves, but tending to the soul of a community, ensuring there is a place for everyone in the city she calls home."
