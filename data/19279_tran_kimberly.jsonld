Born in a Malaysian refugee camp to parents who had fled Saigon with little more than their memories, her family was resettled in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district in the early 1970s. Kimberly grew up as the essential bridge between her parents' world and their new reality, translating at doctor's appointments and parent-teacher conferences. She witnessed firsthand the quiet, complex traumas of a community navigating systemic barriers and unspoken grief, an experience that planted the seed for her future career.\n\nWhile her parents worked grueling hours in restaurants and sewing factories, Kimberly found solace and ambition in her studies. She attended San Francisco State for her undergraduate degree and went on to earn her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, driven by a profound need to give others the support her family had often lacked. Her early career was spent in community health clinics, serving immigrant and refugee populations where her fluency in Vietnamese and innate cultural understanding were invaluable. However, after years of facing institutional burnout, she made the difficult decision to open her own private practice. This was a major turning point, allowing her the autonomy to provide deeper, more sustained care while also achieving the financial stability her parents had dreamed of for her.\n\nNow 54, Kimberly lives a life of practiced intention. She resides in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its blend of cultures. Her mornings begin with a foggy walk among the eucalyptus trees before she catches the 38-Geary Muni bus for the short ride to her office near Japantown. Her clients are a cross-section of the city\u2014anxious tech workers, struggling students at SFUSD schools she contracts with, and elderly clients navigating healthcare challenges.\n\nDivorced for over a decade, Kimberly maintains a close relationship with her son, a recent college graduate now working in environmental science. Her social life is small but deep, centered around a few old friends and colleagues. Kimberly\u2019s dream is no longer about personal ambition, but about legacy. She hopes to mentor a new generation of bilingual social workers and perhaps, one day, travel to the Vietnam she has only known through her parents\u2019 fractured stories, to connect with a part of herself she has spent a lifetime helping others heal."

The doctor spoke in calm, even tones about her mother's chronic fatigue, and Kimberly translated the clinical words into Vietnamese. She watched her mother's face\u2014not understanding the words, but the weight behind them. In that moment, she felt the profound inadequacy of language. It wasn't enough to be a bridge; she felt a fierce, desperate need to be a healer, to do more than just carry bad news from one world to another.\n\n2.\nIn her early thirties, working at a clinic, she watched a Cambodian family get evicted. She had filled out every form, made every call, but the system's gears ground them down anyway. Standing on the sidewalk beside their piled-up belongings, a cold, impotent rage settled in her bones. It wasn't just burnout; it was a crisis of faith in the institutions she'd believed in. This failure was the painful catalyst that pushed her to build something of her own, a practice where she, not a bureaucracy, would set the terms of care.\n\n3.\nThe day she got the keys to her own small office near Japantown, the smell of new paint felt like the scent of pure possibility. It was terrifying. The financial risk was entirely hers, a weight her parents never could have fathomed. But turning the key in the lock for the first time was an act of profound liberation. This was her space, her autonomy. It was the American dream, not as her parents had imagined it, but as she had painstakingly built it for herself.\n\n4.\nJust last year, she found a faded photograph tucked into an old book: her parents, teenagers, laughing on a Vespa in a sun-drenched Saigon. It was a version of them she had never met\u2014carefree, whole, untouched by war. A sharp, unfamiliar longing struck her. She realized she had only ever known them through the lens of their trauma. That photo wasn't just of them; it was a piece of her own origin story she suddenly felt an urgent need to touch and understand.\n\n5.\nHer son, home from college, was explaining his work restoring wetlands in the Bay Area. He spoke of nurturing native grasses and creating habitats. Kimberly listened, struck by the parallel. He was healing landscapes; she was healing psyches. A quiet, powerful wave of peace washed over her. The frantic hustle of her parents' survival had given way to a generation whose work was not to flee or endure, but to restore. Her legacy felt tangible in that moment, rooted and growing."
