The daughter of Indian immigrants who found success in Silicon Valley\u2019s engineering boom, Priya grew up amid high expectations. While her parents envisioned a future for her in tech or medicine, Priya was always more drawn to people\u2019s stories and the invisible currents that shaped their lives.\n\nThe definitive turning point came during her sophomore year at UC Santa Cruz. Her younger brother, buckling under immense academic and cultural pressure, suffered a severe mental health crisis. Navigating the healthcare system was a frustrating maze of clinical detachment and cultural misunderstanding. Witnessing her family's struggle, Priya felt a powerful calling. She channeled this into her studies, graduating with a degree in psychology before pursuing a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career was a trial by fire, working in a demanding community clinic in Oakland to earn the clinical hours for her LCSW licensure. She saw firsthand the systemic gaps she had vowed to help close. Now, at 36, she has found her stride. Priya works as a telehealth therapist for a major San Francisco hospital, her \"commute\" a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to the small, sunlit office in her Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHer days are structured and emotionally demanding. Mornings start with yoga and meditation, a vital practice to ground herself before she logs on for back-to-back virtual sessions with patients grappling with everything from anxiety to acute trauma. In the evenings, she de-stresses by walking through Golden Gate Park or exploring the diverse restaurants on Clement Street with her small, tight-knit group of friends.\n\nPriya loves the quiet, residential feel of her neighborhood, a peaceful anchor in a bustling city. She\u2019s single and navigates the city's complex dating scene with a therapist\u2019s self-awareness and a hopeful heart. Her dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on providing culturally competent mental healthcare for the South Asian community, creating the space of understanding she wished her own family had years ago."
