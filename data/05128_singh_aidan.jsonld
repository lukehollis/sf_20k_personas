The son of a software engineer and a high school math teacher who immigrated from Punjab, Aidan was raised on a steady diet of high expectations. His path was seemingly pre-written: excel in school, attend a top university, and secure a lucrative career in tech or medicine. For a time, he played the part, excelling in his undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe turning point was an unassuming elective on urban inequality. The course required volunteer hours, and Aidan chose a youth outreach program in West Oakland. For the first time, he saw the systemic cracks he had only read about. The stories of the kids he mentored\u2014their resilience in the face of poverty, trauma, and neglect\u2014reoriented his entire worldview. The path his parents envisioned suddenly felt hollow. He broke the news that he was abandoning his pre-law track to pursue a Master of Social Work, a decision that caused a quiet but palpable rift in his family.\n\nNow 27, Aidan\u2019s commute is zero miles because he lives where he works: a residential facility for at-risk youth in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin. His small, spartan apartment is on the building's top floor, allowing him to be a consistent presence for the teens in his care. His days are a blur of crisis intervention, counseling sessions, and relentless paperwork, all fueled by cheap coffee and an unwavering belief in second chances. The line between his professional and personal life is virtually nonexistent.\n\nTo decompress, Aidan runs. He pounds the pavement from his neighborhood through the city's chaotic streets, finding solace in the rhythm of his feet hitting the ground. His social life is small, consisting of a few close friends\u2014fellow social workers who understand the emotional toll of the job. His relationship with his parents has softened into a truce; they don't fully understand his choices, but they see his dedication and are quietly proud. Aidan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth or status, but of systemic change. He hopes to one day transition into policy advocacy, fighting to fix the broken systems he confronts daily, one case at a time."

A 14-year-old named Marcus, who he was mentoring, looked at Aidan\u2019s pristine Cal sweatshirt and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like? Havin\u2019 a future that\u2019s all\u2026 set?\u201d The question landed with the force of a physical blow, exposing the hollowness of his own ambition. It was the first time he felt ashamed of his privilege, a moment that shattered his pre-written life and planted the seed for a new one. That simple question was the beginning of his true education.\n\n2.\nThe silence in his parents\u2019 Fremont kitchen was heavier than any argument. He was 21, and had just explained his decision to pursue social work. His mother stirred a pot of daal that no one would eat, while his father stared at his own hands on the table, unable to meet his son\u2019s eyes. There was no yelling, only a profound, suffocating disappointment. In that quiet, Aidan felt both the pain of letting them down and the fierce, terrifying freedom of claiming his own life. He was alone, but finally on his own path.\n\n3.\nHis first holiday season at the facility, age 25. A 16-year-old named Lena, who hadn\u2019t spoken more than two words to him in months, silently handed him a crumpled drawing. It was a rough sketch of the Golden Gate Bridge, with a tiny, lone figure running across it. \"That's you,\" she whispered. The trust in that small gesture, a fragile bridge built between them, felt more valuable than any degree or salary. It was the moment the exhaustion became fuel, solidifying his purpose in the face of relentless chaos.\n\n4.\nLast year, after a brutal 18-hour day dealing with a teen's overdose, he ran. He ran until his lungs burned and his vision blurred, pushing through the Tenderloin, up the brutal hills toward Twin Peaks. Reaching the top, gasping in the cold air, he looked down at the glittering, indifferent city. The physical pain momentarily eclipsed the emotional anguish. He wasn\u2019t just running from the trauma; he was running towards a vantage point, a reminder of the vast, broken system he was determined to change from within.\n\n5.\nA phone call last month, on his 27th birthday. His mother didn\u2019t ask about his finances for a change. Instead, she said, \u201cAidan, I was thinking about that girl you mentioned, the one who draws. How is she doing?\u201d The shift was subtle but seismic. It wasn't complete understanding, but it was acceptance\u2014love repackaged into a new form of concern. He felt a quiet click in his chest, the sound of a long-held tension easing. Their pride was no longer something he had to imagine; he could finally hear it."
