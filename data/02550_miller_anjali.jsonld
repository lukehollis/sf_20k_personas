Raised in San Jose, she was the daughter of a pragmatic American engineer and a passionate architect from Mexico City. Her name was her mother\u2019s choice, a beautiful sound from a faraway story that felt like home. Her surname, Miller, was a straightforward inheritance from her father. Growing up in a household where blueprints and schematics covered the dining table, Anjali developed a fascination with how systems worked, from the structural integrity of a building to the intricate flow of traffic on the 101.\n\nThis fascination guided her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Master's degree in Urban Planning. She was driven by a desire to solve the Bay Area\u2019s perpetual motion puzzle. A turning point came during an internship where she analyzed Muni\u2019s performance data. Seeing the city\u2019s pulse in spreadsheets and route maps was a revelation; she realized technology held the key to unlocking more equitable and efficient transit. She landed her current role as a Transportation Analyst at a major tech firm, a job that allows her to model and improve the urban circulatory systems she\u2019s always admired.\n\nNow 30, Anjali has crafted a life in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. The pandemic\u2019s shift to remote work, eliminating her commute, was an unexpected gift. Her world, once defined by transit corridors, became hyperlocal. Her days begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, followed by hours of data analysis from her sunlit bay window, overlooking the quiet residential street. She lives with her long-term partner, Leo, a graphic designer whose creative chaos perfectly complements her structured world.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She spends her weekends exploring Clement Street\u2019s dim sum restaurants, browsing Green Apple Books, and cycling with Leo across the Golden Gate Bridge. Anjali\u2019s aspiration is twofold: to contribute to a transportation system that truly serves every San Franciscan and to build a lasting home with Leo in the city that, for all its complexities, feels like the only place she\u2019s meant to be."
