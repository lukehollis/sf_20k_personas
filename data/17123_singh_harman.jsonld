The only son of Punjabi Sikh immigrants, he grew up in Yuba City where his father, an engineer, managed irrigation systems and his mother taught mathematics. Harman witnessed firsthand the isolation that a car-centric culture could create, especially for elders like his grandparents who lost their independence when they could no longer drive. This imprinted on him a deep-seated belief in the power of public infrastructure to foster connection and equity.\n\nThis conviction fueled his academic journey, leading him from UC Davis to a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area felt like a living laboratory, and upon graduating, he eschewed lucrative private consulting for a role with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). He saw it as a calling. For over fifteen years, he has meticulously worked his way up, analyzing data, hosting contentious community meetings, and designing routes that are the city\u2019s arteries.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when his own father had to stop driving. Watching his parents\u2019 world shrink in the Central Valley, while he was designing systems to expand access for others in SF, galvanized his purpose. His work became less of a job and more of a personal mission. He met his wife, Priya, a landscape architect, at a city planning forum, and they bonded over a shared vision for creating humane, sustainable urban spaces.\n\nToday, Harman lives his principles. He and Priya reside in a vibrant, transit-rich apartment in the Mission District. His daily 2.5-mile commute on the Muni J-Church line is his morning field research, observing passenger flow and timing accuracy. He knows the system\u2019s flaws and its triumphs intimately. His aspiration isn\u2019t a larger salary or a corner office, but to see the Central Subway extension fully integrated and a new bus rapid transit line on Geary Boulevard completed. For Harman, his legacy will be written not in a biography, but in the seamless, equitable movement of a city he is devoted to serving."

His grandfather, a proud man who had built their family\u2019s life from scratch, stood by the door, his posture sunk. \u201cCan you take me to the *gurdwara*?\u201d he asked, not meeting Harman's eyes. The drive was silent, but Harman felt a hot, unfamiliar anger. It wasn\u2019t just about the lost car keys; it was a loss of dignity designed by the very roads they drove on. That specific helplessness became the blueprint for everything he would later build.\n\n2.\nDuring his Master's at Berkeley, a professor projected a map of Zurich's overlapping tram network. For others, it was just a diagram. For Harman, it was an answer. He didn\u2019t see lines on a map; he saw lifelines. He saw a path for his grandmother to the market, for a teenager to a library, for anyone to exist without being trapped. In that silent lecture hall, a vague childhood frustration sharpened into a clear, tangible purpose. He knew exactly what he was meant to do.\n\n3.\nAt a dry city planning forum twelve years ago, he spotted a woman sketching in a notebook, transforming a sterile streetscape into a green, human-centered oasis. He approached her during the break, and as Priya explained her vision, he felt a profound sense of recognition. He wasn\u2019t just meeting his future wife; he was meeting the other half of his conviction. It was the moment he knew his personal life and his public mission could become one and the same.\n\n4.\nTen years ago, visiting home, his father placed his car keys on the kitchen table with a quiet finality. \"That's it,\" he said, the engineer in him surrendering to a problem he couldn't fix. Harman saw his grandfather\u2019s resignation echoed in his father\u2019s eyes, a generational cycle of isolation. In that moment, his work at the SFMTA transformed. It was no longer a job analyzing data, but a personal vow to build the access his own family never had.\n\n5.\nLast fall, riding the J-Church, he saw an elderly woman in a sari use a newly installed shelter and sign he\u2019d fought for in months of contentious meetings. She studied his team\u2019s much-debated map for a moment, nodded, and boarded with ease. No one else noticed this tiny, seamless act of independence. For Harman, watching her, it felt like the grandest victory of his career, a quiet affirmation of his entire life's work."
