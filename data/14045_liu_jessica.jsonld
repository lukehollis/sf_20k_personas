The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, she was raised in the quiet, sun-baked suburbs of Fremont. Her parents, who ran a small but successful dry-cleaning business, preached the gospel of stability and education. For them, success was a clear, risk-averse path. Jessica absorbed this lesson, excelling in school and choosing a practical major, Business Economics, at UC Santa Barbara.\n\nHer career began predictably. After graduation, she secured a position at a major accounting firm in San Francisco, a move that made her parents proud. For four years, she dutifully audited and forecasted, but a growing sense of restlessness took hold. The corporate ladder felt slow and uninspired compared to the dynamic world of tech that pulsed just outside her office window.\n\nThe turning point came during a project analyzing a real estate portfolio. Fascinated by the intersection of property, data, and technology, Jessica saw her exit. She retooled her resume, networked aggressively, and landed a role as a financial analyst at a rising PropTech startup. Now, as a Senior Analyst, she thrives on the pressure, building complex models that predict market trends and investment viability.\n\nJessica lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that feels like a comfortable echo of her heritage, with its bustling dim sum restaurants and family-owned markets. Her 3.8-mile MUNI ride to her SoMa office is a daily ritual of podcasts and mental preparation. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix from college and her early career\u2014with whom she explores Marin\u2019s hiking trails and the city\u2019s ever-changing restaurant scene. A recent breakup after a three-year relationship has her channeling more energy into her career and friendships.\n\nWhile she enjoys her $175,000 salary, the city\u2019s steep cost of living keeps her grounded. Her deepest aspiration is to eventually move beyond analyzing the market to shaping it. She dreams of saving enough to start her own real estate investment fund focused on creating more accessible co-living spaces in the city, a tangible way to merge her professional skills with a desire to leave a positive mark on the San Francisco she now calls home."

The hiss of the steam press and the sharp chemical smell were the backdrop to her childhood. She watched her father\u2019s careful, calloused hands bagging a suit, feeling a swell of pride mixed with a quiet, burgeoning need for a different kind of life. That moment planted the seed of ambition\u2014not just to succeed for them, but to build a future with more options, one that wasn't defined by the steady hum of a single machine.\n\n2.\nIt was nearly midnight at the accounting firm, four years into her dutiful career. Staring at a spreadsheet of property addresses, the numbers suddenly blurred. She saw not assets, but buildings on foggy SF streets, homes for unseen people. A jolt of electrifying clarity cut through her fatigue. She wasn't meant to just audit the past; she was meant to model the future. In that silent, fluorescent-lit moment, her restlessness found its purpose, and the path out of corporate life became illuminated.\n\n3.\nSix months into her risky new PropTech job, her heart pounded as she presented her first investment viability model. When a notoriously tough VP pointed to her trend graph and said, \"That's the insight we've been missing,\" the room seemed to expand. The feeling wasn't just pride; it was a profound sense of \"rightness.\" This public, high-stakes validation was the proof she needed. She hadn't just changed jobs; she had finally stepped into the person she was meant to become.\n\n4.\nTwo months after her breakup, she stood atop a windy peak in the Marin Headlands with two friends. The city that held her career and recent heartbreak looked both vast and conquerable across the water. Sharing a quiet moment, watching the fog roll in over the Golden Gate Bridge, a wave of grounded peace washed over her. This was her foundation: not a relationship, but her own resilience, her friendships, and this staggering, beautiful city she claimed as hers. It solidified her resolve to stay.\n\n5.\nRiding the 38R MUNI through the Richmond one evening, she watched four young people trying to pivot a bulky sofa into a narrow apartment doorway. Jessica had analyzed the price-per-square-foot for that very block just hours before. The stark disconnect between her abstract financial model and their tangible struggle struck her with force. The thought wasn't gentle; it was a demand. Her skills could be used for more than profit. They could be used to solve *this*. The co-living fund idea was truly born."
