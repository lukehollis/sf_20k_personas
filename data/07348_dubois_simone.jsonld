This duality defined her path; she had her mother\u2019s aesthetic eye but her father\u2019s penchant for structure and planning. While her early attempts at painting were frustratingly mediocre, she discovered she had an uncanny talent for explaining, organizing, and fundraising for others\u2019 art. This led her to a Master's in Art History, where she realized her true calling was not in creating art, but in championing it.\n\nDrawn by its vibrant and well-funded arts ecosystem, Simone moved to San Francisco in her late 20s. She cut her teeth in unpaid internships and low-level gallery jobs, learning the city\u2019s creative landscape one cold gallery opening at a time. A key turning point was securing a grant-writing position for a mid-sized non-profit, where her blend of passion and pragmatism allowed her to climb the ladder. Now 41, she is the Arts Program Director, a demanding role she manages with intense dedication.\n\nSimone\u2019s life is headquartered in her spacious Dogpatch loft, a converted warehouse space with exposed brick and soaring windows that flood her curated collection of local art with light. Her 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life; her office is a designated corner of her living space. Her days are a blend of Zoom calls with donors, intense budget planning, and studio visits with emerging artists. To decompress, she takes long, purposeful walks through Potrero Hill, ending at her favorite caf\u00e9.\n\nA serious relationship ended five years ago, a painful but clarifying event that solidified her deep bond with her career and her chosen family of fellow artists, curators, and writers. Her social life is an extension of her work\u2014intimate dinners, gallery crawls, and film screenings. Simone dreams of securing a massive endowment for her organization, one that would cement its legacy and create a permanent, radical space for underrepresented Bay Area artists. She is a quintessential transplant who found her true home not in a place, but in a purpose, one she lives and breathes within the art-filled walls of her San Francisco life."
