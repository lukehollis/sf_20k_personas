Raised on the principles of logic and order, she found a natural calling in organizing information. This led her to a Master of Library and Information Science, a degree that promised a quiet, academic life. However, the seismic pull of the first dot-com boom in the late 1990s offered an unexpected, and far more lucrative, application for her skills.\n\nHer turning point came when a friend in San Francisco lamented the chaos at his tech startup. They had brilliant coders but no one to structure their internal knowledge. On a whim, Judith flew out and, within a week, had a job offer. She translated her librarian skills\u2014cataloging, systemizing, creating taxonomies\u2014into the language of corporate efficiency. She was an information architect before the title was common, eventually evolving into her current role as a Senior Process Improvement Manager. She doesn\u2019t build the products; she perfects the human systems behind them, a skill that has kept her invaluable for over two decades.\n\nNow 54, Judith\u2019s world is her serene Cole Valley apartment, the epicenter of her 0.0-mile commute. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, leaving her with a cherished independence and a small, tight-knit circle of friends. Her days follow a comforting rhythm: a morning walk through the Panhandle with her rescue greyhound, a French press coffee while reading the news, and then a cascade of Zoom calls and workflow diagrams. Her home is her sanctuary, reflecting her mind\u2014minimalist, artfully arranged, and free of clutter.\n\nThough she thrives on structure, Judith dreams of introducing a little managed chaos. Her aspiration isn't to climb higher on the corporate ladder but to step off it gracefully in a few years. She envisions using her savings to consult for non-profits, helping them streamline their operations, or perhaps finally cataloging the archives for a small local museum\u2014a return to her original passion, on her own terms, in the city that reshaped her life."
