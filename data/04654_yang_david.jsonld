The first was built on the expectations of his Taiwanese immigrant parents, who sacrificed everything to give him a foothold in America. Raised in the quiet suburbs of the South Bay, David was a dutiful son. He pursued an MBA from Stanford, just as his father had hoped, and dove headfirst into the frenetic energy of the 1990s tech boom. He became a marketing director for a burgeoning software company, and for a decade, his life was a whirlwind of product launches, stock options, and the hollow promise of endless growth.\n\nThe turning point was the dot-com crash of 2001. When his company folded, David felt not loss, but a profound, unnerving relief. The crisis forced him to confront the emptiness of a career he never truly wanted. He began volunteering at a hospice, simply sitting with patients in their final days. It was there, in the quiet spaces of vulnerability and listening, that he found his calling. At 33, he enrolled at UC Berkeley and earned his Master of Social Work, a decision that initially baffled his family but ultimately earned their respect.\n\nNow, at 53, David is a Clinical Social Worker specializing in palliative care. He converted a sunlit room in his Inner Sunset home into a serene office, where he holds telehealth sessions with clients navigating the emotional architecture of chronic illness. His 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet rhythm to his days. Mornings begin with a walk with his partner of fifteen years, Marcus, a landscape architect, through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and layered; he has watched it reinvent itself multiple times. He and Marcus have cultivated a small, tight-knit circle of friends, their chosen family. His aspirations are no longer tied to financial success but to meaning. He hopes to mentor new social workers and perhaps write about the importance of compassionate end-of-life care. David Yang found his purpose not in building a startup, but in helping others gracefully navigate the endings of their own stories."

He stood in his SoMa loft, staring at the Ferry Building, and felt the weight of a decade of product deadlines simply evaporate. It wasn\u2019t failure; it was an exhale he didn't know he\u2019d been holding. For the first time since college, the path ahead was unwritten. That terrifying, exhilarating blankness wasn\u2019t an ending, but the quiet, unassuming start of his real life. (Age: 31, 2001)\n\n2.\nHis first hospice volunteer patient was a retired longshoreman named Arthur who rarely spoke. One afternoon, Arthur asked David to simply describe the fog rolling over Twin Peaks from the window. David sat for twenty minutes, narrating the slow, gray dance. When he finished, Arthur squeezed his hand and whispered, \"Thank you. I can see it now.\" In that moment, David understood that true value wasn't in creating something new, but in bearing witness to what already is. It was the most important work he had ever done. (Age: 32, circa 2002)\n\n3.\nHe met Marcus not at a bar, but at a volunteer event restoring a native plant garden near Stow Lake. David was awkwardly pulling weeds, his mind still new to this slower world. Marcus, covered in dirt, was explaining the resilience of coastal sage scrub. He spoke about root systems and renewal with a passion David had only ever heard applied to market share. In Marcus\u2019s calm confidence, David saw a model for a more grounded way of living. It felt less like a spark and more like coming home. (Age: 38, circa 2008)\n\n4.\nAfter his first year in the MSW program, his father visited. He watched David study late, books on grief and trauma spread where his MBA textbooks once sat. Before leaving, his father, a man of few words, put a hand on his shoulder. \"This work,\" he said, his voice thick, \"it has... heart.\" That single word was more validating than a decade of praise for his business career. It wasn't just acceptance; it was a redefinition of success between them, a quiet closing of an old wound. (Age: 34, circa 2004)\n\n5.\nJust last week, after a difficult telehealth call with a young mother, David closed his laptop. The silence of his sunlit office felt sacred. He walked the ten steps to the kitchen where Marcus was arranging flowers from their garden. Without a word, Marcus handed him a warm mug of tea. In that simple, quiet gesture, David felt the perfect balance of his life: the profound weight of his work held safely by the gentle, solid foundation of the love he had built. This, he knew, was true wealth. (Age: 53, Present Day)"
