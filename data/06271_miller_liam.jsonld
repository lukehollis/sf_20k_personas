            "value": "Liam Miller\u2019s empathy was forged in the quiet stoicism of his suburban Ohio upbringing. The son of a practical engineer and a reserved librarian, emotions in the Miller household were acknowledged but rarely explored. This changed when his younger sister was diagnosed with a chronic illness at fifteen. Liam, then a high school senior, watched his parents grapple not with a lack of love, but a lack of language for the fear and grief that now lived in their home. He saw firsthand the immense, unspoken stress of navigating a complex healthcare system, a burden that seemed heavier than the diagnosis itself. That experience became his compass.\n\nHe pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, deliberately choosing the Bay Area for its forward-thinking approach to mental and public health. Upon graduating, he accepted a demanding position as a Clinical Social Worker at a major San Francisco hospital. To manage the city\u2019s daunting cost of living, he secured a small apartment in a staff housing building adjacent to the medical campus in the Inner Sunset. This created his 0.0-mile commute, a decision of pure practicality that has come to define his existence. His life is a closed loop, contained within a few city blocks.\n\nNow 29, Liam\u2019s days are a marathon of crisis intervention, patient advocacy, and end-of-life counseling. He is the steady, calming presence he wished his own family had years ago. His social circle is small, comprised mostly of fellow nurses and residents who understand the gallows humor and emotional exhaustion that comes with the territory. To decompress, he runs, pounding the pavement through Golden Gate Park, letting the physical strain quiet his mind.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intrinsically tied to the hospital that employs and houses him. While he appreciates the city\u2019s beauty from his running routes, his dream is to one day afford a life beyond the ambulance sirens. He aspires to specialize in palliative care and, more personally, to find a relationship that can flourish outside the intense shadow of his work, perhaps in a quiet apartment in a neighborhood he chooses for himself."
