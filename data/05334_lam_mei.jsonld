Born and raised in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District, Mei was the quiet daughter of immigrant parents who ran a small, bustling bakery. They instilled in her a profound work ethic, hoping she would pursue a stable career in medicine or law. The ghosts of their sacrifices were a constant, silent pressure throughout her youth.\n\nMei honored their wishes with a compromise, earning a Master of Architecture degree from UCLA. It was a practical, prestigious field. However, a pivotal internship at the Getty Center in Los Angeles rewired her ambitions. She discovered she wasn't interested in designing permanent structures, but in crafting temporary, narrative worlds. The immersive, storytelling potential of exhibit design captivated her, offering a perfect marriage of her artistic sensibility and architectural training. She returned to San Francisco and began a determined climb, moving from junior roles at SFMOMA to her current position as a sought-after senior designer.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties after the amicable end of a long-term relationship. Seeking a space that was entirely her own, she invested in the Dogpatch live/work loft. This act of independence solidified her identity. Her life is now a curated collection of deep connections rather than a wide social net: a handful of fellow artists, a trusted fabricator, and her aging parents, who now proudly attend her exhibit openings, finally understanding her vision.\n\nHer days are a rhythm of light and focus. Mornings are for sketching with coffee as the bay gleams outside her industrial windows; afternoons are for 3D modeling and collaborating with curators over Zoom. At 49, her aspirations have shifted from professional success to legacy. She dreams of designing a landmark exhibit for the Chinese Historical Society of America, one that tells the nuanced story of immigration to the city that shaped her. For Mei, her work is more than a profession; it is how she speaks to, and for, the soul of San Francisco."

            "value": "1.\nShe was fourteen, perched on an overturned flour sack in the steamy back room of her parents\u2019 bakery. The air smelled of sugar and yeast, a constant reminder of their sacrifice. Hidden inside her textbook was a sketchbook where she meticulously drew the architectural lines of the Bay Bridge from a newspaper clipping. When her mother entered, she snapped the book shut, a familiar pang of guilt and defiance tightening her chest. This was the first world she ever designed, a secret one built of graphite and longing, right in the heart of theirs.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-four, walking through a special exhibition at the Getty, she stopped. It wasn\u2019t the art that captivated her, but the space itself\u2014the precisely angled temporary walls, the dramatic pools of light creating a journey. She felt a tectonic shift in her mind. This was architecture, not of steel and concrete, but of feeling and narrative. In that silent, sunlit gallery, the weight of her parents' expectations for a \"stable\" architect dissolved, replaced by the thrilling realization that she could build worlds that were meant to be felt rather than just inhabited.\n\n3.\nThe first night in her Dogpatch loft at thirty-eight. After the movers left, she stood alone in the vast, echoing space. The raw brick walls seemed to hold the city's industrial history, and the enormous window framed the stoic patience of the shipyards. There was a terrifying freedom in the silence, a stark contrast to the shared life she had just left behind. Placing her drafting table in the center of the room, she claimed the space not as a refuge, but as a declaration. Her life, from now on, would be built to her own specifications.\n\n4.\nIt was the opening of her exhibit on California Modernism at SFMOMA. She was forty-one. She spotted her father, a man of few words, standing before a display she had designed. He wasn't looking at the object inside, but at the clean lines of the vitrine and the way the light fell. He caught her eye from across the room and gave a slow, deliberate nod. In that single, quiet gesture, she felt the validation she had craved her entire life. It wasn't just acceptance; it was a craftsman's respect.\n\n5.\nLast year, walking through Chinatown, her aging mother pointed to an alleyway and shared a brief, almost forgotten story of her own grandfather\u2019s first week in the city. For Mei, the anecdote was like a flash of lightning, illuminating a hidden blueprint. She suddenly envisioned the entire experience as an exhibit\u2014the texture of the walls, the sounds, the light. Her ambition, once focused on her own career, instantly crystallized into a legacy project. She had to build this space for them, for the city."
