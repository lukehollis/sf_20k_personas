Born Priya Sharma to Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the late 1960s, she was raised on the twin principles of hard work and pragmatism. Her parents, sacrificing everything for a foothold in America, envisioned a stable future for their daughter, one firmly rooted in a practical career.\n\nHer path veered from the four-year university track when, at 21, she fell in love with Mark Thompson, a laid-back SF native and carpenter she met through a mutual friend. Eager to build a life with him in the city, Priya enrolled at City College, earning an Associate's degree in Medical Office Administration. It was a sensible choice that allowed her to start working quickly. She began as a receptionist at the very clinic she now manages, her calm demeanor a perfect balm for anxious parents. Over three decades, she rose through the ranks, her institutional knowledge and innate empathy proving more valuable than any advanced degree.\n\nA key turning point was in the mid-90s when she and Mark pooled their savings to buy a two-bedroom condo just a few blocks from her work, a purchase that now seems mythical. This decision cemented her connection to the neighborhood and created her enviable 0.0-mile commute. Their son, Leo, was born and raised in that home, attending local schools before pursuing a less-stable career as a sound engineer, a source of both pride and parental worry for Priya.\n\nHer days follow a comfortable rhythm: a morning cup of chai, a short walk to the office where she masterfully juggles insurance claims and staff schedules, and an evening walk home to Mark. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of neighbors and old friends. Priya\u2019s ambitions are no longer about climbing a ladder but about savoring the view from where she stands. She dreams of retirement, of traveling with Mark\u2014perhaps finally taking that extended trip to India\u2014and watching her son build a life as unique as the city they all call home."
