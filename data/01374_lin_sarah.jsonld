Her commute is zero miles because her life\u2019s work, the \u201cArchive of the Overlooked,\u201d occupies every floor of her narrow Victorian home in the Inner Richmond. She is its founder, sole employee, and Chief Archivist.\n\nHer upbringing was a study in impermanence. The child of itinerant academics who chased visiting professorships across the country, Sarah never had a hometown. Stability was found not in places or people, but in the objects left behind: a bus ticket from a forgotten trip, a faded photograph found in a thrift store, a local zine from a town she lived in for only six months. These fragments were tangible proof of existence, and she began collecting them before she could articulate why.\n\nThe turning point came at 28, when a great-aunt she barely knew left her a house in San Francisco. For the first time, Sarah had an anchor. The house, filled with the dusty remnants of another life, felt like a promise. She abandoned a string of unfulfilling temp jobs and decided to formalize her calling. Without formal training, she devoured books on preservation and cataloging, her education self-directed and fierce. Her collection grew, focused on the ephemeral histories of her new city: punk show flyers from the 80s, handwritten recipes from shuttered Fillmore diners, oral histories from residents displaced by tech booms.\n\nNow, at 45, Sarah\u2019s days follow a quiet rhythm. She wakes with the fog, spends hours meticulously digitizing and cross-referencing artifacts, and takes late afternoon walks through Golden Gate Park, observing the city she is so devoted to preserving. Her social circle is small; her closest confidante is the owner of a dusty used bookstore in the Mission who occasionally sources items for her.\n\nSarah\u2019s singular dream is to ensure these small, human stories are not erased by San Francisco\u2019s relentless tides of change. Her ultimate goal is to create a secure, publicly accessible digital portal for her archive. She isn\u2019t building a monument to the past, but a resource for the future, a quiet testament to the countless, forgotten lives that have shaped the city she finally calls home."
