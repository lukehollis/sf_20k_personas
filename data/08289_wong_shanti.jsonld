            "value": "Shanti Devi Wong\u2019s name is a map of her heritage, a fusion gifted to her by a Chinese engineer father and an Indian literature professor mother who met at UC Berkeley in the 1970s. Raised in the East Bay, Shanti\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese home cooking, Hindu philosophy, and a deep-seated Bay Area pragmatism. She witnessed firsthand the stark differences in community health outcomes between Oakland\u2019s flatlands and the Berkeley hills, a disparity that seeded her life's calling.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree from UCLA, she pursued a Master of Public Health, eschewing the individual focus of medicine for the systemic impact of policy and administration. Shanti\u2019s early career took her through various county health departments, where she developed a reputation for being a meticulously organized and empathetic administrator who could translate complex data into actionable community programs.\n\nThe defining turning point of her career was the COVID-19 pandemic. As a mid-level administrator, she was thrust onto the front lines of the city\u2019s logistical response. The years were a blur of 16-hour days coordinating testing sites, managing PPE supply chains, and crafting public health communications from her small Inner Sunset home office. The crisis cemented her role and made her remote work permanent, her commute dissolving to zero.\n\nNow, at 51, Shanti\u2019s life is one of quiet discipline. Her day begins not with a commute, but with a brisk, foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, her sanctuary. Divorced for nearly a decade, her social life is a small, tight circle of friends from her book club and a few trusted colleagues. Her connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic sights and more about its statistical soul\u2014vaccination rates, life expectancy by zip code, and access to care. From her desk, overlooking a quiet residential street, she fights for the city's health. Her dream isn't one of personal accolades, but of legacy: to mentor a new generation and help build a public health infrastructure so robust and equitable that it silently serves every resident, long after her work is done."
