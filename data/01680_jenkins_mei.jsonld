Her mother, a pragmatic immigrant from Guangzhou, instilled in her a deep respect for hard work and order. Her father, a charismatic but perpetually struggling landscape painter from Ohio, gave her a dreamer\u2019s soul she often tries to suppress. They divorced when Mei was 14, a split that wasn\u2019t acrimonious but financially devastating, leaving Mei and her mother in a precarious position in their small Daly City apartment.\n\nThis instability became Mei\u2019s defining turning point. While her friends planned for college, Mei, a math prodigy, took a bookkeeping course at a community center. At 18, she landed an entry-level data entry job at a small downtown investment firm. Formal education became a luxury she couldn't afford, but her mind for patterns and numbers was undeniable. She devoured financial theory online, taught herself Python for data modeling in her spare time, and quickly outpaced colleagues with four-year degrees. A senior partner noticed her raw talent, mentoring her and championing her promotions based on sheer performance.\n\nNow 29, Mei is a respected financial analyst for a green-tech venture capital fund, working entirely from her meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her world is her neighborhood. Mornings begin with a strong coffee from a corner cafe on Clement Street, followed by intense hours analyzing market trends and startup viability. Lunch is often a walk to Golden Gate Park, her mind untangling complex financial models amidst the eucalyptus groves.\n\nSocially, Mei is reserved, preferring a small circle of trusted friends to large parties. Her romantic life is cautious; she fears the financial and emotional chaos that defined her childhood. Her core aspiration isn't extravagant wealth, but unshakeable security. She is saving aggressively, her primary dream to buy a small condo in her neighborhood\u2014a tangible symbol of the stability she has built for herself, spreadsheet by spreadsheet, in the city that rewards ambition, no matter its origin."
