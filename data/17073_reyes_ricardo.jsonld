He was born in the Philippines, but his family, seeking better opportunities, immigrated when he was six, settling in the Excelsior District. His father, a mechanic, taught him the value of working with his hands, instilling a practical mindset that would define Ricardo\u2019s life. Surrounded by the hum of his father\u2019s workshop, he developed a fascination for how things were made.\n\nThis fascination led him to the Industrial Arts program at City College of San Francisco. He thrived there, loving the precision of lathes and the logic of assembly. However, his formal education was cut short. When his father suffered a debilitating back injury, Ricardo, as the eldest child, left school at 20 to take a full-time job at a small manufacturing plant in the Bayview, a pragmatic sacrifice he never regretted.\n\nHe started on the assembly line, but his quiet competence and natural understanding of the machinery did not go unnoticed. Over 29 years, he methodically worked his way up, moving from assembler to team lead, and finally, to Production Supervisor. He now manages a team of 30, earning their respect not through loud commands, but through his deep knowledge of every machine on the floor.\n\nRicardo\u2019s life is one of routine and deep-rooted connections. He and his wife, Maria, whom he met in high school, own a small, modest home in the Portola District. Every morning, he takes the T-Third light rail 3.5 miles to work, a commute he\u2019s made for over two decades. He sees the city change from his window\u2014gleaming new condos rising against the backdrop of the industrial landscape that has been his entire career. He feels a quiet anxiety about it, wondering if his daughter, now a student at SF State, will be able to afford the city she was born in.\n\nHis hopes are not grand, but deeply felt. He dreams of seeing his daughter graduate and find a fulfilling career. He aspires to one day take a long-overdue trip back to the Philippines with Maria, and to finally finish the custom cherry-wood bookcase he started in his garage five years ago. For Ricardo, who has spent his life making things for others, creating something beautiful for his own home feels like the ultimate luxury."

The air smelled of salt and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the familiar sweet humidity of home. It wasn\u2019t scary, just\u2026 vast. That night, he understood they were starting over from scratch, and it taught him to watch and observe with a quiet intensity that would become his defining trait. This was his true birth into a new world.\n\n2.\nHe recalls the weight of a ratchet in his 13-year-old hand. His father, smelling of grease and patience, had laid out the cleaned parts of a carburetor on a rag. \"Each piece has a purpose, Ricardo. You just have to see it.\" As they reassembled it, the logic clicked in his mind. It wasn't just metal; it was a system. That quiet afternoon in the Excelsior garage wasn't just about fixing a car; it was the moment he truly inherited his father's understanding of how the world fit together.\n\n3.\nThe decision wasn\u2019t dramatic. He was 20, sitting at the kitchen table with his mother, the scent of Vicks VapoRub for his father\u2019s bad back thick in the air. He looked from his CCSF textbooks to his mother\u2019s tired face. \"I'll get a full-time job at the plant,\" he said. It wasn\u2019t a sacrifice; it was a solution, a blueprint. In that moment, the abstract theories of school became less real than the immediate, tangible need of his family. His life's path was set with a quiet certainty.\n\n4.\nHe doesn\u2019t remember the formal promotion to supervisor as clearly as the day, a week later, when old Gus\u2019s stamping machine jammed. Gus, who had worked there 15 years longer than him, waved off the young techs and said, \u201cReyes, get over here. You know this thing\u2019s soul.\u201d Ricardo diagnosed the issue by sound alone, his hands finding the misaligned bolt without hesitation. That brief nod from Gus was worth more than any title. It confirmed his authority was earned, not given, built from decades of listening.\n\n5.\nJust last year, he stood on the platform at Arleta Station, watching his daughter board the same T-Third train he takes to work. She was headed inbound, towards SF State, her backpack full of possibilities. As the train pulled away, a wave of immense pride washed over him, so sharp it almost hurt, followed by a familiar, quiet anxiety. All his years on the assembly line were for this moment\u2014to launch her into a city he hoped wouldn't eventually push her out."
