            "value": "Rebecca Lewis was raised under the perpetually damp, grey skies of suburban Portland, the daughter of a pragmatic civil engineer and a methodical high school math teacher. Her childhood was one of structure and sensible expectations, a world away from the abstract expressionists she secretly revered in library books. Art was a hobby, her parents insisted, not a career. This well-intentioned dismissal only fueled her defiance.\n\nHer rebellion was quiet and academic. An Art History degree from Reed College led to a Master's in Curatorial Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Armed with credentials her parents could respect, she landed a coveted junior curator position at a prestigious San Francisco gallery. For nearly a decade, she dutifully climbed the institutional ladder, but the bureaucracy and glacial pace began to suffocate her. The turning point came during a contentious acquisitions meeting; she realized she was spending her life advocating for art she didn't believe in, her own vision buried under layers of committee approval. At 35, she resigned.\n\nGoing freelance was both terrifying and liberating. Rebecca transformed the second bedroom of her Hayes Valley apartment into an office, officially reducing her commute to zero. Her days now have a self-made rhythm. Mornings start with a walk to a local cafe for an oat latte, followed by hours of video calls, proposal writing, and strategic planning for her clients\u2014a mix of emerging artists needing guidance and small galleries seeking a fresh perspective.\n\nHer social life is deeply intertwined with her work; close friends were once clients, and gallery openings are her primary networking events. A significant long-term relationship ended a few years after she went independent, a casualty of the financial stress and all-consuming focus her new career demanded. At 42, Rebecca is fiercely independent and protective of her autonomy. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused, defined by the familiar faces at the farmers' market and the quiet hum of the city from her window. She dreams of one day stepping back from consulting to write a book\u2014a definitive text on West Coast conceptual art\u2014a legacy project that would finally be, entirely, her own."
