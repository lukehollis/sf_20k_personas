Raised in a placid Chicago suburb, he was the stable, observant son of an accountant and a librarian. His family valued security and practicality, and art was something found in museums on weekend trips, not a viable career. David followed the prescribed path, earning a business degree and landing a marketing job at a large packaged goods company. The work was predictable and soul-crushing, and after three years of optimizing campaigns for laundry detergent, he felt a profound sense of emptiness.\n\nThe turning point came during a trip to San Francisco. Struck by the city's vibrant, unapologetic creative energy, he saw a different future. He quit his corporate job, enrolled in a graduate program for Arts Administration, and never looked back. It was a decision that baffled his parents but saved his spirit. He moved to the city in his late twenties, trading financial security for a studio apartment in the Mission and an unpaid internship at a small theater company.\n\nNow 49, David is the Marketing Manager for a respected non-profit visual arts center. He\u2019s a key figure in the city\u2019s cultural ecosystem, known for his thoughtful campaigns that prioritize artist integrity over commercial metrics. He has lived in the same Hayes Valley apartment for fifteen years with his partner, Leo, a landscape architect. With his commute being a walk from the bedroom to his home office, his life is deeply woven into the neighborhood. His mornings start with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, followed by hours of Zoom calls, grant writing, and strategizing how to connect contemporary art with a broader, more diverse audience.\n\nDavid isn\u2019t driven by a desire for fame or fortune. He finds deep satisfaction in being a quiet steward of the arts. His dream is to secure a permanent endowment for his organization, ensuring its stability for generations to come. He\u2019s a fixture in his community\u2014the man who knows the baristas by name, shops at the local farmers' market, and believes his life\u2019s work is to help keep the soul of San Francisco creative and accessible."
