The only child of a Korean immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father, she grew up amidst the scent of produce and kimchi from her parents\u2019 small corner grocery store. They were loving but pragmatic, envisioning a future for Chloe in medicine or law\u2014stable careers that promised a security they had worked tirelessly to build. Chloe, however, was always more interested in the stories behind their customers' tired eyes than in balance sheets or biology textbooks.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year of high school. Her grandmother, a first-generation immigrant, suffered a severe mental health crisis, and Chloe watched as her family struggled to navigate a healthcare system that felt culturally and linguistically alien. She saw the desperate need for advocates who could bridge that gap. The experience solidified her path. While her parents were initially disappointed, she enrolled in Social Psychology at UC Berkeley, driven by a newfound purpose.\n\nShe pursued her Master of Social Work (MSW) at SF State, staying close to her roots. Chloe was exceptionally focused, completing her 3,000 hours of supervised clinical experience in record time to earn her LCSW certification by 24. Today, she works for a major healthcare provider, conducting therapy sessions entirely via telehealth. Her 0.0-mile commute means her cozy Inner Richmond studio is both her office and her sanctuary, a boundary she constantly works to maintain.\n\nHer days are a careful balance of heavy emotional labor and self-preservation. Mornings are for back-to-back virtual sessions with clients, many of them young adults grappling with anxiety. Afternoons are for meticulous case notes, followed by a long, decompressing run through Golden Gate Park. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a few friends from her master\u2019s program who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nChloe\u2019s dream is to one day open a private practice dedicated to serving the Bay Area\u2019s AAPI community, creating a space where mental wellness is destigmatized and culturally understood. For now, she finds fulfillment in her work, a quiet but profound continuation of the life of service her parents modeled in their own way, one grocery bag and one therapy session at a time."
