The only child of a Korean immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father, she grew up amidst the scent of produce and kimchi from her parents\u2019 small corner grocery store. They were loving but pragmatic, envisioning a future for Chloe in medicine or law\u2014stable careers that promised a security they had worked tirelessly to build. Chloe, however, was always more interested in the stories behind their customers' tired eyes than in balance sheets or biology textbooks.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year of high school. Her grandmother, a first-generation immigrant, suffered a severe mental health crisis, and Chloe watched as her family struggled to navigate a healthcare system that felt culturally and linguistically alien. She saw the desperate need for advocates who could bridge that gap. The experience solidified her path. While her parents were initially disappointed, she enrolled in Social Psychology at UC Berkeley, driven by a newfound purpose.\n\nShe pursued her Master of Social Work (MSW) at SF State, staying close to her roots. Chloe was exceptionally focused, completing her 3,000 hours of supervised clinical experience in record time to earn her LCSW certification by 24. Today, she works for a major healthcare provider, conducting therapy sessions entirely via telehealth. Her 0.0-mile commute means her cozy Inner Richmond studio is both her office and her sanctuary, a boundary she constantly works to maintain.\n\nHer days are a careful balance of heavy emotional labor and self-preservation. Mornings are for back-to-back virtual sessions with clients, many of them young adults grappling with anxiety. Afternoons are for meticulous case notes, followed by a long, decompressing run through Golden Gate Park. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a few friends from her master\u2019s program who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nChloe\u2019s dream is to one day open a private practice dedicated to serving the Bay Area\u2019s AAPI community, creating a space where mental wellness is destigmatized and culturally understood. For now, she finds fulfillment in her work, a quiet but profound continuation of the life of service her parents modeled in their own way, one grocery bag and one therapy session at a time."

While her parents focused on the transaction, Chloe saw the deep-set exhaustion in her eyes. It was a silent, aching story. In that moment, a profound empathy bloomed within her, a feeling far more compelling than the clinking of the cash register. It was the first inkling that her purpose wasn't in balancing ledgers, but in understanding the invisible burdens people carried.\n\n2.\nThe hospital hallway felt cold, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. She remembers watching her mother, fluent but frustrated, try to explain her grandmother's consuming fear to a doctor who just nodded dismissively. Her grandmother\u2019s terror was reduced to a clinical note, its cultural roots completely ignored. A hot, fierce clarity cut through Chloe\u2019s teenage confusion. She wouldn\u2019t just help people; she would become a translator for their pain, ensuring no one\u2019s story was ever lost in a system that didn't speak their language.\n\n3.\nIt happened during her first year of supervised hours. A young client, referred for crippling anxiety, finally cracked a window into his world after weeks of silence. Through the slight lag of the video call, he spoke of the shame he felt disappointing his immigrant parents. Chloe just listened, holding the virtual space. The sudden, fragile trust that bloomed across the screen affirmed everything. It was the moment all the textbooks and theories dissolved into a single, tangible human connection, proving her path was the right one.\n\n4.\nLast fall, after a session left her feeling hollowed out, she slammed her laptop shut. The tiny studio felt suffocating, thick with secondhand sorrow. Without pausing, she laced up her running shoes and escaped into Golden Gate Park. Pounding the pavement under the cypress trees, she felt the emotional residue burn away with every stride, her ragged breath a release. This wasn't just exercise; it was a necessary exorcism. The run was how she reclaimed her own space, one footfall at a time.\n\n5.\nOver takeout pho with her two friends from her master\u2019s program, she was describing the unique fatigue of her telehealth work. Her friend simply looked at her, exhaustion mirrored in her own eyes, and said, \"We hold so much.\" No further explanation was needed. In that small, quiet apartment, surrounded by the only people who truly understood the weight, Chloe felt a powerful sense of belonging. This was her anchor\u2014the shared, unspoken understanding that kept her grounded in the storm of her profession."
