The only child of a stoic engineer father and a loving but anxious mother, David became the family\u2019s unofficial emotional barometer, learning to read the subtle shifts in mood that hung in the air of their modest home. While his father pushed for a practical career, David found himself drawn to the humanities at Ohio State University. It was a single sociology course on systemic inequality that ignited his path, leading him to pursue a Master of Social Work at the University of Michigan, a decision that felt like both a rebellion and a homecoming.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in his late twenties, lured by the city\u2019s progressive reputation and a job at a community mental health clinic in the Mission. Those early years were a trial by fire, working with clients facing immense trauma, addiction, and housing insecurity. This frontline work instilled in him a profound, non-romanticized understanding of the city\u2019s deepest wounds and solidified his commitment to the field.\n\nThe key turning point in his career was unexpected: the 2020 pandemic. Working for a major hospital network, his role was abruptly shifted to telehealth. To his surprise, David found he could build powerful therapeutic alliances through a screen. The hospital made the position permanently remote, and he traded a stressful MUNI commute for a 0.0-mile walk from his kitchen to his spare-bedroom office.\n\nNow 43, David lives a structured, contemplative life in a one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. His days begin with a walk in Golden Gate Park, fog still clinging to the cypress trees, before he settles in for back-to-back video sessions with patients. He helps them navigate their chaos from his serene, orderly space. Recently single after the amicable end of a long-term relationship, his social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends for dinners in Cole Valley or hiking trips in Marin. David feels deeply connected to the city, not as a place of hustle, but as a complex ecosystem he serves. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s to find a new, lasting partnership and to use his remote flexibility to one day work from a small cottage in Portugal for a few months, proving that healing and connection can transcend any distance."
