Raised in Daly City, just south of the San Francisco line, he was the son of an African American mother, a compassionate hospital administrator, and a second-generation Japanese-American father, a precise and reserved mechanic. His parents instilled in him a profound work ethic, valuing practical skill and reliability over academic accolades. School was something to get through, not a place he thrived, and \u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 graduating from high school, Derrick felt the pull of the workforce, not the university quad.\n\nAt nineteen, he took a job in the mailroom of a burgeoning SoMa biotech firm. It was supposed to be temporary, but Derrick discovered a satisfaction in creating order out of chaos. His meticulous nature, a trait inherited from his father, didn't go unnoticed. A senior operations manager saw his potential, mentoring him and encouraging him to take on more responsibility. Derrick climbed the ladder not with a degree, but with grit and an innate understanding of process flow. He moved from mailroom to office assistant, then to project coordinator, and finally, after fifteen years of dedicated work, to Operations Manager.\n\nNow 36, Derrick lives in the Outer Richmond. His 11.8-mile commute on the Muni Express is a cherished ritual, a time to decompress with podcasts about history and urban planning. His $110,000 salary affords him a comfortable, if not extravagant, life in a city known for its high costs. He lives in a clean, minimalist apartment and spends weekends walking through Golden Gate Park or trying new noodle shops with a small circle of loyal friends, some from his childhood and others from his long tenure at the firm.\n\nDerrick\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of earned stability. He\u2019s seen the city change from the perspective of a commuter and now a resident. His quiet dream is to leverage his hard-won financial security to buy a small condo in his neighborhood. More than that, he aspires to mentor a young person navigating their career without a traditional college degree, to be for someone else the guide he was so fortunate to find himself."

His dad\u2019s hands, usually stained with grease, were meticulously cleaning a carburetor with a small brush. He didn't say much, just \"Every piece matters, Derrick. No small parts.\" Derrick felt a profound sense of respect for that quiet precision. It wasn't just about fixing cars; it was a philosophy. That memory became the blueprint for his own work ethic, teaching him that value was found in ordered systems, a lesson he carried from the Daly City garage to the SoMa high-rise.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, he was organizing a mountain of incoming lab supplies when the mail-sorting machine jammed. Instead of calling for service, Derrick took it apart, calmly locating and removing a shred of a label. His manager, Mr. Evans, watched the whole thing. He just nodded and said, \u201cYou see the whole process, don\u2019t you?\u201d For the first time, Derrick felt seen not for what he lacked, but for the inherent skill he possessed. That moment of validation was the spark, transforming a temp job into a deliberate career.\n\n3.\nThe day he was officially promoted to Operations Manager, he didn\u2019t celebrate loudly. Instead, he stood by the window of his new office, looking down at the blur of traffic on Howard Street. He thought of the 15 years\u2014the mail bins, the spreadsheets, the late nights. A quiet, immense wave of satisfaction washed over him. It wasn\u2019t triumph; it was stability, solid and earned. In that moment, the abstract dream of owning a piece of this city felt concrete, a foundation he had built himself.\n\n4.\nHis first commute from his own Outer Richmond apartment felt different. Getting on the 38R Muni Express, he wasn't traveling *to* the city anymore; he was moving *within* it. He put in his earbuds, the familiar voice of a history podcast starting up as the bus lurched forward. Looking out at the avenues of his own neighborhood, he felt a deep sense of belonging settle in his chest. This wasn\u2019t a destination; it was home. The 11.8 miles became a thread weaving him into the city's fabric.\n\n5.\nHe was eating ramen alone at a small shop in the Inner Sunset last winter. At the counter, a young server, no older than twenty, was methodically refilling soy sauce dispensers, her focus absolute. He saw his younger self in her diligence and her weary eyes. A powerful sense of empathy welled up inside him, followed by a clear, quiet resolve. He knew then that his next big project wasn't just buying a condo; it was finding a way to be the Mr. Evans for someone just like her."
