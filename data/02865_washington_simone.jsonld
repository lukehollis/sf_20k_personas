Raised by a shipyard welder father and a mother whose Creole cooking was legendary in their community, Simone learned the power of food to build connection and express love. This foundation shaped her path, though not directly. A Sociology degree from UC Berkeley equipped her not for coding, but for understanding the complex human systems of a bustling restaurant, a world she fell into while waiting tables to pay tuition.\n\nAfter graduating, she moved across the bay, cutting her teeth in the demanding fine-dining scene of 1990s San Francisco. She thrived on the pressure, swiftly moving from server to manager at a celebrated Hayes Valley bistro. Her brilliance was in logistics and morale; she could soothe a furious chef, charm a difficult critic, and train a flawless front-of-house team with equal grace.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade ago. Burnt out by 80-hour weeks, she was headhunted by a burgeoning tech giant building a lavish new campus in SoMa. They didn\u2019t want a cafeteria; they wanted a Michelin-worthy culinary experience for their employees. Lured by unparalleled resources, humane hours, and a formidable salary, Simone took the job.\n\nToday, Simone lives in a sleek company-subsidized condo, just a five-minute walk from the campus she now helps run, making her commute negligible. Her day is a masterclass in orchestration: managing three distinct cafes, overseeing menus for thousands of young, brilliant, and often demanding employees, and ensuring every flat white and quinoa bowl is perfect. She is respected and financially secure, but she feels a professional disconnect, catering to a private, privileged workforce rather than a diverse public.\n\nHer social life is a deliberate escape from the tech bubble, consisting of a tight-knit circle of friends her age\u2014a teacher, a nurse, and a city planner\u2014who she meets for jazz at SFJAZZ or gallery-hopping in the Mission. Her deepest connection remains with her family in Oakland, a tie that grounds her. Simone\u2019s quiet dream is to cash out her stock options in a few years and open a small, soulful spot of her own in the Outer Sunset, serving the food she grew up with. It\u2019s a longing to trade manufactured perfection for the authentic, messy, and beautiful reality of a true neighborhood restaurant."
