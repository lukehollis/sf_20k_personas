His mother was a dedicated nurse and his father a public school teacher, instilling in him a strong sense of community service from a young age. Their dinner table conversations often revolved around societal inequities, sparking Liam\u2019s early interest in helping others. Summers were spent volunteering at a local community center, where he witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by underserved populations.\n\nDriven by this early exposure, Liam pursued a Bachelor's degree in Sociology at UC Berkeley, followed by a Master's in Social Work. These years were transformative, cementing his passion for advocacy and intervention. A pivotal moment was an internship at a San Francisco youth shelter, where he provided support to homeless teenagers, solidifying his desire for a career in direct service.\n\nUpon graduating, Liam secured a position as a social worker within the San Francisco Unified School District. His days are spent navigating the complex needs of students and their families \u2013 connecting them with resources, providing counseling, and advocating for their well-being. His salary of $75,000, while modest for San Francisco, allows him to live independently in a shared apartment in the Inner Sunset. His daily commute involves a bus ride across the Bay Bridge, offering a quiet time to prepare for the day ahead or decompress on the way home.\n\nLiam's personal life is equally grounded. He maintains close relationships with his parents and younger sister, who is following his footsteps into the social services field. He has a close-knit group of friends from his graduate program, often meeting up for hikes in Golden Gate Park or exploring independent bookstores in the Haight. While he's open to a romantic relationship, his primary focus remains on his career and personal growth.\n\nLiam dreams of establishing a non-profit focused on providing trauma-informed care to young people experiencing homelessness. He knows the path will be challenging but believes in the power of systemic change. His hope is to make a tangible difference in the lives of those who need it most. San Francisco, with its vibrant, albeit complex, social landscape, feels like the perfect place to plant his roots and contribute to building a more equitable city."

The raw vulnerability in their voice, the quiet desperation, it lodged deep within him. It solidified his understanding that systemic issues had faces, broken hearts, and futures hanging in the balance. It fueled a resolve to never look away. (During his San Francisco youth shelter internship)\n\n2. That graduation ceremony at UC Berkeley, seeing his parents beaming in the crowd. Their sacrifices, their belief in him, it all converged in that moment. A profound sense of gratitude washed over him, coupled with a quiet determination to make good on the opportunities they\u2019d helped create. It reinforced the power of family support. (Upon graduating from UC Berkeley)\n\n3. The first time a student he'd been working with, struggling with attendance and family conflict, shared that they'd finally felt heard. The small, hesitant smile on their face was everything. It was a powerful affirmation of why he chose this path and the profound impact of just showing up. It solidified his dedication. (Early in his career at SFUSD)\n\n4. A chaotic bus ride back to the Inner Sunset late one night, seeing the illuminated Bay Bridge stretch out ahead. Despite the exhaustion, a sense of belonging, of being part of this complex, vibrant city, settled over him. It was a reminder of the scale of the challenges, yes, but also the immense potential for connection and change. It grounded him in his new home. (Within the first year or two of living in San Francisco)\n\n5. A hike with his graduate school friends in Golden Gate Park, watching the fog roll in over the ocean. The easy camaraderie, the shared idealism, it felt like a lifeline. These were his people, the ones who understood the weight of the work and still believed in a better future. It reinforced the importance of his support system. (Throughout his early years in San Francisco)"
