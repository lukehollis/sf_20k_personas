The first-generation daughter of immigrants, Amina and Farid Haddad, she grew up watching them navigate the complexities of American bureaucracy while serving as a vital hub for their community. These early observations planted the seeds of a deep-seated desire to make systems work *for* people, not against them.\n\nThis drive led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Public Policy. It was during a frustrating internship with a housing non-profit that she had her key turning point. She saw that passion and good intentions were not enough; policies often failed because they weren\u2019t based on a true understanding of the community's needs. She realized the most powerful stories were often told not in speeches, but in spreadsheets. This epiphany pushed her to master data analysis, seeing it as the most direct path to creating tangible change.\n\nAfter graduation, the Data Analyst position at SF Digital Services was a perfect match, combining her policy education with her newfound analytical skills. She moved into a modest apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose diverse culinary scene on Clement Street reminded her of home. Her daily routine is defined by the 38-Geary bus, a 3.5-mile journey where she observes the city's vibrant, chaotic pulse. She shares her apartment with a close friend from college, Maya, an aspiring architect, and their evenings are often spent debating urban design and city politics over takeout.\n\nWhile she maintains a close connection with her family through weekly video calls, her social life is firmly rooted in San Francisco. She has a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of tech workers and public servants who share her civic-minded outlook.\n\nLayla\u2019s ambition extends beyond her current role. She dreams of leading a data-driven initiative to tackle one of the city's most entrenched problems, like homelessness or transit inequity. For Layla, San Francisco is not just a place to live, but a complex system she is determined to understand and improve, one dataset at a time. Her ultimate goal is to translate the city\u2019s pulse into compassionate, actionable policy."

The scent of warm za'atar hung in the air, but all she could feel was his frustration against the impenetrable wall of official English. She couldn't translate the legalese for him then, but she felt a quiet, fierce vow form in her chest: one day, she would be the one who understood these papers. She would make the walls come down for people like him.\n\n2.\nDuring her Berkeley internship, she stood at a folding table handing out eviction-protection flyers. An elderly Filipina woman approached, not taking a flyer, but explaining in detail why the simplistic policy didn't apply to her multi-family living situation. Layla had no answers, just a glossy pamphlet full of useless promises. The feeling of utter failure was a cold shock, but it sparked a new clarity: good intentions were noise. The truth\u2014and the solution\u2014was in the unheard stories, the ones you had to find in the data.\n\n3.\nHer first weekend in the Inner Richmond, a wave of homesickness hit her hard. She walked down Clement Street, the damp fog chilling her skin, until she was enveloped by a cloud of competing, wonderful smells: steaming dumplings, roasted ducks, and then, a scent of yeast and anise from a Chinese bakery that was so close to her parents' shop. It wasn't the same, but it was a familiar song in a new key. In that moment, San Francisco wasn't a strange city; it was home.\n\n4.\nIn a sterile conference room at SF Digital Services, she presented a slide showing how a five-minute shift in the 38-Geary\u2019s early morning schedule would cut wait times for hospital and service workers. The lonely dots on her scatter plot represented real people shivering at a bus stop. When the transit manager nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d she felt not a loud victory, but a surge of quiet power. This was it. This was turning a spreadsheet into a warmer morning for someone.\n\n5.\nOne evening, Layla and Maya were looking out their apartment window. Maya was sketching the hostile architecture of a new development, while Layla had zoning regulations pulled up on her phone. As they debated the intersection of building codes and human dignity, Layla realized their friendship was a microcosm of her life's goal: bridging the gap between the blueprint and the lived reality. The city wasn't just data or design; it was a conversation she got to have every day."
