Raised in Daly City, the daughter of a public school teacher and a union electrician, she grew up viewing San Francisco as the complicated, glittering heart of her world. Her childhood was grounded in middle-class practicality, but trips into the city for museums and festivals ignited a fascination with how urban spaces shape human lives. This fascination led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Urban Studies.\n\nIt was at Berkeley where she met Kenji Tanaka, a third-generation Japanese American architecture student. His family\u2019s story, which included their internment during WWII, profoundly impacted Katherine. It solidified her belief that housing and community were not abstract concepts but fundamental pillars of justice. They married shortly after graduation, and she proudly took his name, seeing it as a link to a history she felt deeply connected to.\n\nKatherine\u2019s career began in the trenches of the non-profit sector, advocating for tenants and affordable housing projects. After a decade of learning the system from the outside, she made a pivotal decision to work from within, accepting a position with the city. Now a Program Manager in the Mayor's Office of Housing, she navigates a frustrating ballet of bureaucracy, community outrage, and incremental progress. Her $135,000 salary, while substantial, feels modest in the city she serves, a daily reminder of the crisis she is fighting.\n\nShe and Kenji live in a modest row house in the Inner Richmond, where they raised their daughter, Maya. Katherine\u2019s day begins with a packed MUNI bus, her 2.8-mile commute a rolling microcosm of the city\u2019s diversity and disparity. Evenings are for family dinners and poring over zoning maps. Her hope is not for a grand, sweeping solution, but for tangible wins: another senior housing complex funded, a family moved off a waitlist. She dreams that Maya might one day be able to afford a life in the city she loves\u2014a city Katherine both curses for its inequalities and fiercely defends, one policy document at a time."

The man-made waterfall was a thunderous wonder, but what she remembers is seeing a man asleep on a bench nearby, his life carried in two plastic bags. She felt a confusing mix of fear and a sharp, profound sadness. In that moment, the city stopped being just a playground. It became a puzzle of profound unfairness she felt an inexplicable urge to solve. This was the first time she understood that public spaces held private sorrows.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIn a quiet corner of Berkeley\u2019s Moffitt Library, Kenji told her about his grandparents\u2019 home in Japantown. He didn\u2019t describe the house, but the sudden absence of it after they were sent to Topaz. His voice was steady, but she felt the tremor of inherited loss. It was then that her academic interest in urban planning became a moral conviction. A home wasn't just a structure; it was a right, a history, a piece of a person\u2019s soul that could be stolen by policy. It was the moment she fell in love with both him and his fight.\n\n***\n\n3.\nEarly in her non-profit career, she stood in a Tenderloin SRO hallway thick with the smell of bleach and despair. She was trying to comfort a mother who had just lost her eviction case. While the woman wept, her son kept trying to wipe a crayon mark off the wall, wanting to leave the room clean. Katherine felt a hot, impotent fury. That single, heartbreaking detail solidified her decision: fighting from the outside wasn't enough. She had to get inside the system that allowed this to happen.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was 11 p.m. in a sterile City Hall hearing room. After four hours of vitriolic public comment, the board passed her affordable senior housing project by a single, exhausted vote. There was no applause, just the shuffling of papers. The win felt hollow until an email arrived an hour later from a future resident on the waitlist. It said only, \"Thank you. My wife and I can stay in our city.\" This memory sustains her through every bureaucratic battle, reminding her that behind the zoning codes are actual lives.\n\n***\n\n5.\nRiding the 38 Geary home, a ten-year-old Maya pressed her face to the window, watching the blur of restaurants and apartments in the Richmond. \"Mom,\" she asked, \"will I get to have my own house here someday?\" The simple question struck Katherine with the force of a physical blow. It was her greatest fear and deepest motivation, verbalized by the very person she was fighting for. Her long nights spent staring at policy documents were no longer abstract; they were her answer to Maya\u2019s question."
