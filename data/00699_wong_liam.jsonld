His life is measured not in miles commuted, but in the few dozen steps from his on-campus apartment to the hospital ward where he works. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, Liam was the quiet son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood bakery. His childhood was a warm, boisterous cacophony of family, the scent of pineapple buns, and the unspoken expectation that he would pursue a more prestigious, profitable career than his parents.\n\nThe turning point came at nineteen when his grandmother suffered a debilitating stroke. Liam watched his parents, fluent in life but not in medical jargon, struggle to navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system. He saw their fear and frustration, and it ignited in him a fierce, protective purpose. He abandoned vague pre-med ambitions and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program. He wasn't meant to hold the scalpel; he was meant to hold the hands of families like his own.\n\nNow, at 29, his world is the UCSF Parnassus campus. His spartan one-bedroom apartment is a sanctuary from the emotional tempests he navigates daily. As a medical social worker, he is a translator, advocate, and shock absorber for patients and families facing life-altering diagnoses. His days are a blur of discharge planning, connecting families with resources, and providing counsel in sterile, quiet rooms. His social life is deeply intertwined with his work; his closest friend is an ER nurse who understands the pressure without needing an explanation.\n\nWhile his work is fulfilling, he dreams of a life beyond the hospital's immediate orbit. His aspiration is to one day launch a non-profit providing culturally competent elder care and navigation services for San Francisco\u2019s non-English speaking communities\u2014a direct homage to his grandmother. For now, he finds balance in weekend runs through Golden Gate Park and Sunday visits to the Sunset, where the familiar embrace of his family and the sweet smell of the bakery remind him of who he is and why he chose a life just a few steps away from where he is needed most."
