The only child of a Filipino-Chinese couple who settled in Daly City, he grew up surrounded by the scent of his mother\u2019s cooking and the sound of his accountant father\u2019s keyboard. His parents, pragmatic and loving, envisioned a stable future for him in business or tech. Rohan, however, found his voice not in code or spreadsheets, but in the vibrant, chaotic murals of the Mission District and the hushed galleries of Yerba Buena.\n\nHis choice to attend San Francisco State University for a Bachelor's in Arts Administration was the great compromise. It was art, but with a title that sounded responsible enough to appease his father. During college, a pivotal internship at a non-profit dedicated to supporting emerging Bay Area artists changed everything. He wasn't just observing art; he was helping create the infrastructure that allowed it to exist. He saw how grant writing, program scheduling, and community outreach were the essential, unseen scaffolds that held up the creative world.\n\nAfter graduating, he was hired full-time. Now, at 28, Rohan is a Program Manager, earning a respectable $85,000. Each morning, he boards a Muni bus from his small but tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond for the 2.5-mile ride downtown. His commute is his quiet time, filled with podcasts on cultural policy and new music from local bands he hopes to feature. His days are a whirlwind of emails, budgets, and planning sessions, all aimed at giving diverse artists a foothold in an increasingly expensive city.\n\nHis social life is interwoven with his work\u2014gallery openings with colleagues, post-event drinks in Hayes Valley, and weekend visits to his parents in Daly City, where he proudly shares the catalogs from his latest exhibitions. Though recently out of a long-term relationship, he finds fulfillment in his mission. Rohan\u2019s dream is to one day become an Executive Director, creating sustainable models that ensure artists of color can not only survive but thrive in San Francisco. He sees himself as a bridge: between the creative impulse and the practical necessity, between the city\u2019s storied artistic past and its uncertain future."

One mural depicted a family that looked like his cousins, their faces bursting with a story words couldn't capture. He felt a sudden, profound connection\u2014not to holding a brush, but to the power of the wall itself. The quiet world of his Daly City home faded, replaced by this vibrant, public heartbeat. This was a language he understood instinctively, and he knew he had to be a part of it.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the weight of his father\u2019s silence at the dinner table. He was eighteen, his SF State application open. \u201cArts Administration,\u201d Rohan said, the words feeling fragile. He didn\u2019t talk about murals; he talked about budgets, grants, and program management. He watched his father\u2019s shoulders relax, a subtle shift from worry to consideration. In that moment of reluctant acceptance, Rohan learned how to translate passion into pragmatism. It was a skill that would come to define his entire career.\n\n3.\nIt was during his internship, around age twenty. An artist was panicking because the lighting for her installation was wrong. Rohan spent the afternoon on the phone, tracking down the correct fixtures and coordinating a last-minute delivery. Standing in the gallery later, seeing the piece perfectly illuminated, he understood. He wasn't the artist, but without his phone calls, her vision would have remained in shadow. He wasn't behind the scenes; he was building the stage itself. That feeling of essential contribution felt more powerful than applause.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty-five, back in his parents' Daly City living room. He handed his mother the catalog from his first managed show. The smell of the fresh ink mixed with the scent of adobo from the kitchen. His father, the accountant, studied the list of sponsors and donors on the back page, then looked at the art, then back at Rohan. He simply nodded, a rare, full smile on his face. In that moment, Rohan felt his two worlds finally connect. His name in print wasn't just a credit; it was a bridge home.\n\n5.\nA month after the breakup, the quiet on the 38 Geary felt different. Lonelier. He was twenty-eight, staring out at the fog-dampened storefronts. He pulled out his phone, not to scroll through old photos, but to read a new grant proposal from a young sculptor in the Bayview. A wave of purpose washed over the sadness. This was his foundation now, this work of lifting others up. The relationship had ended, but his mission remained. The steady hum of the bus felt less like an engine and more like his own resilient heart."
