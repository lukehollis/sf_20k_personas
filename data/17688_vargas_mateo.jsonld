Born to Salvadoran immigrants who fled civil war in the early 1970s, he grew up in a vibrant, close-knit community defined by resilience and shared struggle. His parents\u2019 stories of survival and their tireless work in restaurants and cleaning services instilled in Mateo a profound sense of duty. He witnessed firsthand how language barriers, poverty, and trauma could derail promising young lives, a reality that hit home when a childhood friend was lost to gang violence.\n\nThis pivotal event steered Mateo toward San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work. He wasn't interested in the lure of tech; he wanted to reinforce the safety nets he saw fraying in his own neighborhood. His career began on the front lines as a bilingual case worker for a community health non-profit. For fifteen years, he built trust, connected families to resources, and advocated for the voiceless. Now a Program Manager, he has traded daily client crises for budget meetings and grant writing, a move he sometimes struggles with, missing the direct connection but understanding the need for strategic leadership.\n\nAt 47, Mateo\u2019s life is a testament to his values. He lives in the same rent-controlled two-bedroom apartment he\u2019s had for twenty years, the air thick with the smell of coffee from the panaderia downstairs. His daily 3.8-mile commute on the 14 Mission bus is a rolling cross-section of the city he serves. His marriage ended amicably years ago, strained by his demanding work, but he remains a devoted father to his 17-year-old daughter, Sofia, who is his anchor and inspiration.\n\nMateo feels the city\u2019s changes acutely\u2014the gentrification that pushes out families, the loss of familiar storefronts. His dream isn't of stock options, but of securing stable, long-term funding for his youth health programs. He hopes to see the kids he serves become the city\u2019s next generation of leaders, ensuring the soul of his San Francisco endures."
