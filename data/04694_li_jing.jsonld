Born in Shanghai to two civil engineers, her childhood was filled with discussions of infrastructure and efficiency. Her family immigrated to the Bay Area when she was eight, trading the dense, vertical logic of Shanghai for the sprawling suburbs of Fremont. The stark contrast sparked a lifelong fascination with how people and cities move. This fascination propelled her through her studies, culminating in a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer career path was cemented by a defining moment: the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a teenager, she witnessed the catastrophic failure of the Cypress Street Viaduct and the Bay Bridge. More importantly, she watched the subsequent debates and the city\u2019s bold decision to tear down the damaged Embarcadero Freeway, replacing it with a walkable, human-scale boulevard. For Jing, it was a profound lesson: a city wasn\u2019t just built, it was chosen. She found her calling not in designing new things, but in improving the complex, often-flawed systems that already existed. This led her directly to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA).\n\nNow 47, Jing is a veteran planner who navigates budgets, public feedback, and political realities with a weary but determined pragmatism. Her life is deeply woven into the fabric of the city she serves. She lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she chose for its direct access to the N-Judah line. Though her commute is officially 0.0 miles due to a hybrid work model, she rides Muni several times a week for \"field research,\" observing passenger flow and timing transfers with a professional's eye.\n\nDivorced for nearly a decade, she co-parents her 16-year-old son, Leo, who attends Lowell High School. Her personal life is quiet; evenings are for helping Leo with homework, walks in Golden Gate Park, and poring over transit maps and data reports. Jing\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a promotion or a larger home, but something more tangible: a future where the Muni Metro runs on time, where crosstown bus routes are truly rapid, and where her son can navigate a safer, more equitable San Francisco without ever needing a car."

After the constant, layered hum of Shanghai, the stillness was unnerving, the space between houses a vast, lonely gap. She saw her first cul-de-sac and felt a deep, childish confusion. It wasn\u2019t a city; it was a diagram with all the people erased. That profound sense of spatial dislocation was the true beginning of her immigration, the moment she started trying to decipher the unwritten rules of the American landscape.\n\n2.\nIt wasn't the shaking of Loma Prieta she remembered most, but the dust. A fine, grey powder that settled on everything for days, the ghostly residue of failure. On the news, the collapsed Cypress Viaduct looked like a broken toy from her father\u2019s engineering models. At fourteen, seeing that concrete giant so humbled\u2014and later watching the city choose to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway\u2014ignited a fierce conviction. Infrastructure wasn\u2019t permanent. It was a choice, one that could be unmade and made better.\n\n3.\nThe day Leo, then eleven, took the 44-O'Shaughnessy by himself for the first time. Jing stood at the corner, her heart a frantic mix of maternal anxiety and professional pride. She tracked his bus on her app, a thin red line representing her son\u2019s journey toward independence. When his text finally came through\u2014\"Made it!\"\u2014her relief was absolute. Her life's work wasn't just about data and budgets; it was about that simple, powerful message. The system, her system, had worked for her son.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the fight over a single bus bulb-out on a dangerous corner in the Excelsior. It took eighteen months of meetings, budget arguments, and endless complaints. The day the concrete was finally poured, she went out just to look at it. An elderly woman with a grocery cart gave her a slight nod and said, \"It's about time.\" That simple, gruff acknowledgment felt more real and rewarding than any official commendation. It was a tangible piece of safety, a small victory she could stand on.\n\n5.\nA Tuesday evening last year, riding the N-Judah home at dusk. As the train emerged from the Sunset Tunnel, the city lights below glittered like a vast circuit board. The car was warm, filled with the quiet murmur of people heading home, a living, breathing manifest. In that moment, her weary pragmatism softened into a quiet sense of belonging. She wasn\u2019t just an analyst of the system; she was a passenger within it, part of its steady, rhythmic pulse through the darkness."
