Born to a pragmatic Japanese-American father and an idealistic Caucasian mother in Sacramento, she spent her youth feeling not quite one thing or the other. This sense of being an observer, of belonging everywhere and nowhere, shaped her deeply. She enrolled in a state university but found the rigid curriculum stifling and impersonal. After a year of feeling profoundly disconnected, she dropped out, searching for a more tangible way to engage with the world.\n\nHer early twenties were a drift of service jobs until a weekend trip to San Francisco changed her trajectory. She was captivated by the city's vibrant, chaotic energy and its mosaic of communities. On a whim, she decided to stay, finding a room in the Inner Richmond and a volunteer position with a small non-profit that established community gardens in food deserts. This was the turning point. For the first time, her work felt real, its impact measured in fresh produce and neighborly connections. Her passion and knack for organizing quickly turned the volunteer gig into a paid position as a Non-Profit Coordinator.\n\nNow 37, Sarah\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk from her bed to the desk in her apartment, where she spends her days coordinating volunteers, writing grant proposals, and managing planting schedules. Her afternoons often involve visiting the garden plots scattered through the Richmond and Sunset districts, her hands in the soil that grounds her. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends met through her work, sharing potluck dinners and foggy weekend hikes in Golden Gate Park. She doesn't dream of wealth or status; her aspiration is to secure a permanent, multi-acre urban farm for the community, a lasting sanctuary of growth and connection in the city she finally calls home."
