Her father, a meticulous accountant, taught her the logic of a balanced sheet, while her mother, a librarian, filled her world with the magic of classic literature. This duality defined her path. She attended UC Davis, immersing herself in the beautiful complexities of English Literature, convinced she would spend her life in academia or publishing.\n\nUpon graduation, however, she faced the stark economic reality of the Bay Area. The creative jobs she dreamed of were scarce and low-paying. A post-college temp job, secured through a family friend, landed her in the back office of a small investment firm. It was supposed to be a placeholder, but something clicked. She discovered a different kind of storytelling in the market\u2019s fluctuations, a narrative hidden within spreadsheets and data projections. The analytical skills she\u2019d honed dissecting Faulkner were surprisingly effective at identifying financial trends.\n\nThis was her key turning point. Bridget leaned into her unexpected aptitude, earning a financial certification online and leveraging her temp experience into a full-time financial analyst role with a larger firm. The position allowed her to finally move to San Francisco, the city that had always shimmered with promise just across the bay.\n\nNow, at 27, Bridget lives in a modern studio in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within a few vibrant city blocks. Mornings start with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte before settling in at her standing desk, her world shrinking to the glow of dual monitors displaying market data. To combat the isolation of remote work, she is fiercely protective of her evenings and weekends. She runs through Golden Gate Park, meets a small circle of friends for dinner in the Mission, and spends Sundays reading at the SFJAZZ Center parklet.\n\nWhile financially secure, the English major in her soul still yearns for something more. Her aspiration isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to use it as a launchpad. Bridget dreams of saving enough capital to one day open her own business: a combined bookstore and wine bar, a place where careful curation and community can flourish\u2014a perfect synthesis of her father\u2019s pragmatism and her mother\u2019s passion."
