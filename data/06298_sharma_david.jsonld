The child of an Indian immigrant father, a reserved history professor from Mumbai, and a free-spirited White mother from Oregon, a landscape painter, David grew up in a household of books and brushes. He inherited his father\u2019s contemplative nature and his mother\u2019s passion for visual expression, a combination that defined his path. This dual heritage made him feel slightly outside of any single identity, a keen observer from an early age.\n\nHis educational journey took him to Reed College for Art History, but he felt a frustrating distance from the raw creation of art itself. This dissatisfaction became a turning point. He didn\u2019t want to just study art; he wanted to champion it. He moved across the bay to attend the San Francisco Art Institute, earning an MFA in New Genres. It was the early 2000s, and he fell in love with a city that still felt accessible to dreamers. After graduation, he worked his way up through the arts ecosystem\u2014gallery assistant, grant writer, curator for pop-up shows\u2014learning the harsh realities of keeping creative endeavors afloat.\n\nNow 48, David is the director of \"Aperture Arts,\" a small but respected non-profit that provides studio space and exhibition opportunities for emerging Bay Area artists. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his life\u2019s integration: he lives in a converted SoMa live/work loft, the ground floor of which serves as Aperture\u2019s main gallery and office. His days are a whirlwind of wrestling with budgets, wooing philanthropic donors from the very tech sector that displaces artists, and mentoring creatives a generation younger than himself. His personal life is intertwined with his work; his closest friends are the artists and activists he champions.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of fierce, protective love. He remembers the grittier, more affordable city of his youth and fights to preserve its creative soul. His greatest aspiration isn\u2019t personal wealth but securing a permanent, deeded space for Aperture Arts\u2014a sanctuary that can outlast him and the city's volatile economic tides. Each evening, looking out from his loft window at the changing skyline, he feels the weight and purpose of his mission: to ensure that San Francisco remains a place where art can be made, not just displayed."
