The daughter of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who ran a bustling laundromat on Irving Street, she grew up surrounded by the scent of detergent and the quiet diligence of hard work. Her parents, valuing stability above all, were pleased when she enrolled at San Francisco State University, assuming she would pursue a sensible career.\n\nSarah chose Business Administration, a practical degree that belied a growing, secret passion. It was an elective in modern art history that cracked her world open. She started spending weekends volunteering at small, independent galleries in the Mission, fascinated by the chaotic, brilliant process of bringing an exhibition to life. The turning point was an internship at a scrappy SoMa arts collective. There, she discovered her business acumen wasn't a betrayal of her artistic love, but its greatest asset. She could budget, create timelines, and manage logistics, transforming an artist's abstract vision into a tangible reality.\n\nNow 30, Sarah is a Production Lead for a prominent arts organization. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal: she lives and works in a sprawling Dogpatch loft, a former warehouse space where her living area bleeds into her workspace. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls with international artists, coordinating with fabricators, and troubleshooting on-site installations. Her social life is woven into her profession; her closest friends are the curators, artists, and technicians she collaborates with.\n\nWhile she excels at executing others' concepts, Sarah harbors a desire for her own creative agency. Her deepest aspiration is to launch a city-wide public arts festival that champions underrepresented Bay Area artists, creating large-scale, accessible works that speak to the city\u2019s complex identity. She wants to honor both the quiet grit of her Sunset upbringing and the audacious creativity that now defines her life, proving that in San Francisco, pragmatism and passion can build something beautiful together."
