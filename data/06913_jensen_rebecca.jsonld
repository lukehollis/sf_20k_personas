Raised in a working-class suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, she was the first in her family to enroll in college. She started a liberal arts degree at a local community college with vague hopes of becoming a teacher, but her plans were derailed after her third semester when her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Rebecca dropped out to become her primary caregiver, a role that consumed her twenties.\n\nAfter her mother passed away, a 28-year-old Rebecca felt adrift. Needing a radical change, she used the small inheritance to move to San Francisco, a city that felt like the opposite of her Ohio life. With an incomplete degree and a resume gap, her path was administrative. She started as a temp, proving her worth not with credentials but with unflappable competence and an innate ability to organize the chaos of creative, often-difficult people. She eventually landed at a boutique architecture firm in Hayes Valley, where she has been the indispensable office manager for over a decade.\n\nHer life is a carefully curated ecosystem. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice; she works from her tidy one-bedroom apartment, which is just two blocks from the firm\u2019s physical office, which she visits twice weekly. Her days are structured and predictable: coffee from the same corner caf\u00e9, a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green at lunch, and evenings spent with a book or a British crime drama. Her social circle is small\u2014a few friends from a former book club and a friendly rapport with her neighbors. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and she has since found a quiet contentment in her solitude.\n\nRebecca\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. She doesn\u2019t see the whole city, but she knows her three-block radius in Hayes Valley better than anyone. Her dream is a quiet one: to finally take the photography class she abandoned twenty years ago and perhaps travel to the coastal towns of Italy she\u2019s only seen in magazines. She yearns for a life defined by her own choices, not just her duties, a final act of personal creation after a lifetime of managing the lives of others."
