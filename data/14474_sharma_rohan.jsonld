The only son of Indian immigrants who settled in suburban New Jersey, he was raised on a foundation of discipline and high expectations. His father, a civil engineer, and his mother, a librarian, instilled in him a belief that success was not a matter of luck, but of methodical effort. Rohan absorbed this lesson, pursuing a practical Bachelor's in Business Administration from Rutgers University, foregoing a more glamorous path for one he deemed secure.\n\nHe began his career in management consulting on the East Coast, quickly proving his worth through long hours and a sharp, analytical mind. A transfer to his firm\u2019s San Francisco office in his late twenties was meant to be a two-year assignment. Instead, it became the turning point of his life. He was captivated by the city's dynamic energy, a stark contrast to the predictability of his upbringing. He stayed, met his now ex-wife, and climbed the corporate ladder.\n\nHis promotion to Director of Strategy came at a personal cost. The relentless pressure contributed to the amicable but painful end of his decade-long marriage three years ago. This event forced a profound introspection. Rohan had achieved the financial success he was programmed to pursue, but he felt a distinct lack of personal fulfillment.\n\nNow, at 45, his life is a structured routine. His day begins before sunrise in his quiet Noe Valley apartment. He takes the J-Church MUNI downtown, a 5.5-mile journey he uses to listen to economics podcasts, mentally preparing for a day of navigating complex business challenges. Evenings are for gym sessions or cooking\u2014a newly discovered passion. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends who have seen him through his divorce.\n\nRohan loves the city he chose over his roots; the way he can leave the steel-and-glass canyons of the Financial District and be home in his walkable, village-like neighborhood in thirty minutes. His dream is no longer about the next promotion. He fantasizes about leaving the corporate world to start a small advisory firm for non-profits, a way to use his skills for community impact. He is searching for a second act, one defined not by income, but by purpose, right in the heart of San Francisco."

Instead, watching the fog roll over the patchwork of neighborhoods, he felt a profound sense of release. It wasn't just a view; it was an invitation. In that moment, the methodical, predictable path laid out for him back east felt like a cage. He knew then, with startling clarity, that his two-year plan was over. San Francisco was home now. This happened when he was 28.\n\n2.\nHe recalls a Saturday morning with his then-wife, Sarah, at the Ferry Building Farmer's Market, years before the end. They were in their mid-thirties, debating which heirloom tomatoes to buy for a pasta sauce they'd make that night. Her laugh, unburdened by the stress that would later define them, echoed against the chatter. It was a simple, perfect moment of shared creation\u2014a life they were building together, one ingredient at a time. That memory now serves as a bittersweet benchmark for a happiness he longs to feel again.\n\n3.\nThe email arrived at 9 PM. \"Congratulations, Director.\" He was alone in his glass-walled office, the city lights of the Financial District glittering below. After a brief surge of pride, a profound hollowness set in. There was no one to celebrate with; Sarah was likely already asleep. He had climbed the ladder only to find himself completely alone at the top. The achievement, which happened when he was 39, felt like a transaction where he had unknowingly paid with his own marriage, confirming the emptiness of his pursuit.\n\n4.\nMonths after the divorce, he was on the J-Church, heading home. It was raining, blurring the lights of the Mission. He\u2019d forgotten his headphones. For the first time in years, there was no podcast, no analyst report\u2014just the squeal of the tracks and his own reflection in the dark window. A wave of grief hit him, sharp and cleansing. It wasn't just for his marriage, but for the man he hadn't yet allowed himself to be. That quiet, solitary ride at 42 was the true, painful start of his introspection.\n\n5.\nLast spring, walking home, he saw volunteers from a local food pantry in Noe Valley struggling with a spreadsheet. They were passionate but overwhelmed by the logistics. Rohan paused, his mind instantly seeing three ways to streamline their operations. It was a lightning bolt of clarity. His skills, honed for corporate dominance, could be used to amplify purpose, not just profit. The abstract desire for a \"second act\" became a concrete mission right there on that sidewalk, giving him a new, tangible dream at 44."
