Growing up in a sprawling Los Angeles suburb, she was the daughter of a Japanese immigrant mechanic and a second-generation grocer. Their lives were dictated by the tyranny of distance and the unreliability of the bus schedule. For Aiko, public transit wasn't a choice but a lifeline, and she keenly observed how its failures dictated her family\u2019s access to work, community, and opportunity. This early awareness planted the seed of a lifelong fascination with the intricate dance of urban movement.\n\nHer undergraduate studies were unfocused until a semester abroad in Tokyo. There, she witnessed a transportation system that was less a utility and more a public marvel\u2014a seamless, respected network that formed the city's backbone. It was a profound turning point. She returned to California with a clear purpose, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Urban and Regional Planning program. She was no longer just an observer; she wanted to be an architect of better systems.\n\nNow, Aiko is a transportation planner for the City of San Francisco. Her 0.0-mile commute is a privilege she\u2019s acutely aware of; from her Inner Richmond apartment, the city is both her client and her home. Her days are a blend of data analysis, community outreach meetings via Zoom, and poring over blueprints for projects like protected bike lanes on the Embarcadero or improving Muni efficiency along the Geary corridor.\n\nHer life is woven into the neighborhood. Mornings start with a walk to a cafe on Clement Street, her evenings often spent with her long-term partner, Ben, or a close-knit group of friends from her Berkeley days. She sees her work everywhere\u2014in the family waiting for the 38R, the cyclist navigating traffic, the pedestrian trying to cross a busy intersection. Aiko\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand in scale but deeply personal: to one day ride a bus line she helped make more frequent and reliable, and see it filled with people whose lives, like her parents' once were, are made just a little bit easier by her work."
