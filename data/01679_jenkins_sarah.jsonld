            "value": "Sarah Jenkins\u2019s life has always been defined by the needs of others. Raised in a small, dusty town in the Central Valley, she was the youngest of three, but the one who stayed. Her mother\u2019s chronic illness meant Sarah\u2019s childhood was a blur of medication schedules and doctor\u2019s appointments. While her friends were at football games, she was learning to check blood pressure and provide gentle, steady comfort. Formal education beyond high school was never a realistic option; her real degree was earned at her mother\u2019s bedside.\n\nAfter her mother passed away when Sarah was 22, the only path that felt natural was caregiving. It wasn\u2019t a choice so much as an ingrained skill. She earned her healthcare assistant certification and worked a series of demanding, low-wage jobs before finding a unique opportunity that brought her to San Francisco a decade ago. The position offered a trade-off she couldn't refuse: a small, private residential care home in the Outer Richmond needed a live-in assistant. The role provided a room and board, solving the city\u2019s impossible housing costs, but in exchange, it tethered her permanently to her workplace. Her commute is zero miles, but her personal freedom is nearly the same.\n\nSarah\u2019s days are a quiet rhythm of service. She wakes to the sound of the home\u2019s old boiler, not an alarm clock. Her life is intertwined with her two elderly residents, whose stories she knows better than her own. Her social connections are limited to a friendly rapport with the part-time nurse and brief chats with neighbors while taking out the recycling. She is surrounded by people, yet profoundly alone.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate but narrow. It\u2019s not the glittering skyline but the sound of the foghorns from her small bedroom window and the salty chill during her brief walks to Ocean Beach on her afternoons off. At 39, Sarah dreams not of wealth or travel, but of anonymity and space. Her deepest aspiration is to one day rent her own small apartment, a place where she can close the door at the end of the day and simply be Sarah, not the caregiver. It\u2019s a quiet dream of a life lived for herself, nurtured amidst a life of selfless sacrifice."
