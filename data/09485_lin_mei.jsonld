Her parents, who arrived from Southern China in the late 1980s, ran a bustling Chinese bakery. Growing up, Mei spent her afternoons amidst the aroma of freshly baked goods, observing the rhythm of the city through the baker's window and the interactions of the neighborhood. This early exposure to community life and the intricacies of its spaces sparked a fascination with urban environments.\n\nHer academic journey was marked by a deep-seated curiosity about how cities functioned and evolved. After excelling in her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, Mei pursued a Master's in Urban Planning, focusing on sustainable development and equitable housing. A pivotal moment came during a summer internship with a local non-profit working to revitalize a neglected public park. Witnessing the tangible impact of thoughtful planning on a community solidified her career path.\n\nGraduating with her Master\u2019s, Mei secured a position as a City Planner within the San Francisco Public Administration. The early years were challenging, navigating bureaucracy and advocating for her vision, but her passion for creating positive change remained unwavering. Her work on a bicycle infrastructure project was a source of particular pride, as it directly improved her own daily commute \u2013 a brisk 2.8-mile bicycle ride from her apartment in the Outer Sunset to her downtown office. This daily journey, cycling through different neighborhoods, reinforces her connection to the city's pulse.\n\nMei is close to her family, often joining them for Sunday dim sum. Her personal life is anchored by a small, close-knit circle of friends, fellow planners, artists, and activists who share her progressive ideals and love for San Francisco. They frequent neighborhood parks, support local businesses, and engage in lively discussions about the city's future.\n\nLooking ahead, Mei dreams of leading larger-scale urban regeneration projects, focusing on affordable housing and green spaces. She envisions a San Francisco that remains accessible and livable for all its residents. Her current daily routine involves early morning bike rides, dedicated workdays, and evenings spent either socializing with friends, attending community meetings, or simply enjoying the quiet moments in her cozy Outer Sunset apartment, the distant sound of the Pacific a familiar comfort. San Francisco isn\u2019t just where she works; it's her history, her community, and the canvas for her aspirations."

Being small and helping bag cookies, Mei felt the energy of the neighborhood's hunger met by her family\u2019s tireless work, understanding the simple power of a well-loved local business. (Age 8)\n\n2. There was a single afternoon during her park revitalization internship where she watched a group of kids, who used to just hang out on the periphery, finally run full speed on the new grass. Seeing their pure joy in the space she\u2019d helped envision was an electric feeling, solidifying her belief that small acts of planning could bloom into tangible happiness. (Age 22)\n\n3. She'd just finished presenting her bicycle network proposal, feeling the weight of bureaucratic resistance. Cycling home through Golden Gate Park, the cool air on her face, she saw another cyclist give her a small, knowing nod. In that moment of simple connection on her commute, she felt a quiet determination settle in, knowing she was working for *these* moments, *these* people. (Age 27)\n\n4. Sunday dim sum with her family, the familiar clatter of dishes and rapid-fire Cantonese, was a constant comfort. Watching her parents laugh over a shared memory kept her grounded, a reminder of the journey they\u2019d taken and the community they'd built, fueling her own drive to create supportive spaces for others in the city she loved. (Ongoing)\n\n5. Huddled with friends on Ocean Beach as the fog rolled in, discussing a new tenant protection bill. The vastness of the Pacific mirrored the scale of the challenges they discussed, but the warmth of their shared passion and commitment to a better San Francisco solidified her sense of belonging and purpose in this ever-evolving city.
