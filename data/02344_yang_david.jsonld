The only son of hardworking Chinese immigrants who ran a small pharmacy in Oakland, he grew up surrounded by the expectation that he would become a doctor. He internalized this dream, excelling in science at Berkeley with the singular goal of medical school. His path was clear, a straight line drawn by his parents' sacrifices.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer stint at a free clinic in West Oakland. While his pre-med peers focused on diagnoses, David was struck by the systemic barriers his patients faced: lack of transportation, food deserts, and language barriers. He realized he was less interested in treating individual sicknesses than in preventing them on a community-wide scale. This revelation led him to pivot, disappointing his parents by forgoing the MCAT and instead enrolling in a Master of Public Health program, focusing on epidemiology and health policy.\n\nUpon graduating, David felt the pull of San Francisco\u2019s tech boom. He saw the immense potential to apply public health principles at scale through technology. He joined a major tech company that was launching a wellness initiative, and he quickly proved his value. As a Health Program Manager, he now designs and oversees programs that use data from wearables and apps to encourage preventative health habits among millions of users.\n\nLiving and working from his apartment in Hayes Valley, David\u2019s world is both expansive and intensely local. His 0.0-mile commute means his daily routine is self-directed; a morning run through the Panhandle, coffee from his favorite local cafe to create a sense of separation from his home office, and long hours on video calls with global teams. Evenings are for exploring the city\u2019s restaurant scene with friends or the occasional Hinge date.\n\nDavid feels a sense of purpose in his work, but he\u2019s not entirely settled. He sees the city\u2019s glaring disparities daily, a stark contrast to the optimized, frictionless world he helps build online. His ultimate aspiration is to bridge that gap\u2014to one day lead a foundation or non-profit that uses tech\u2019s resources to directly address the real-world health challenges he first witnessed in that Oakland clinic, finally uniting his parents\u2019 dream with his own."
