The only son of hardworking Chinese immigrants who ran a small pharmacy in Oakland, he grew up surrounded by the expectation that he would become a doctor. He internalized this dream, excelling in science at Berkeley with the singular goal of medical school. His path was clear, a straight line drawn by his parents' sacrifices.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer stint at a free clinic in West Oakland. While his pre-med peers focused on diagnoses, David was struck by the systemic barriers his patients faced: lack of transportation, food deserts, and language barriers. He realized he was less interested in treating individual sicknesses than in preventing them on a community-wide scale. This revelation led him to pivot, disappointing his parents by forgoing the MCAT and instead enrolling in a Master of Public Health program, focusing on epidemiology and health policy.\n\nUpon graduating, David felt the pull of San Francisco\u2019s tech boom. He saw the immense potential to apply public health principles at scale through technology. He joined a major tech company that was launching a wellness initiative, and he quickly proved his value. As a Health Program Manager, he now designs and oversees programs that use data from wearables and apps to encourage preventative health habits among millions of users.\n\nLiving and working from his apartment in Hayes Valley, David\u2019s world is both expansive and intensely local. His 0.0-mile commute means his daily routine is self-directed; a morning run through the Panhandle, coffee from his favorite local cafe to create a sense of separation from his home office, and long hours on video calls with global teams. Evenings are for exploring the city\u2019s restaurant scene with friends or the occasional Hinge date.\n\nDavid feels a sense of purpose in his work, but he\u2019s not entirely settled. He sees the city\u2019s glaring disparities daily, a stark contrast to the optimized, frictionless world he helps build online. His ultimate aspiration is to bridge that gap\u2014to one day lead a foundation or non-profit that uses tech\u2019s resources to directly address the real-world health challenges he first witnessed in that Oakland clinic, finally uniting his parents\u2019 dream with his own."

In the West Oakland clinic, he translated as she explained in Cantonese why she'd missed appointments. It wasn't forgetfulness; her bus route had been cut. The doctor saw a patient; David saw a systemic failure. In that moment, the sterile allure of the MCAT dissolved, replaced by a burning need to fix the map, not just the diagnosis. It was his second year at Berkeley, and his entire future changed direction.\n\n2.\nThe air in his parents' pharmacy in Oakland hung thick with the scent of herbal remedies and their silent disappointment. He stood between the aisles of aspirin and ginseng, explaining he wasn't taking the MCAT. His mother turned away, her hands methodically re-stocking shelves. His father just stared, the hope in his eyes flickering out. David\u2019s voice felt small, but the conviction in his gut was immense. It was the hardest, most necessary betrayal of his life, happening right after his Berkeley graduation.\n\n3.\nThe first dashboard lit up his screen, a constellation of data points from a pilot program he'd designed. It was a year into his tech job. He saw a tangible city-block-by-city-block increase in daily steps among thousands of users. It wasn't a prescription; it was a nudge, a digital whisper that traveled through phones and changed behavior. For the first time, he felt the true scale of his new path\u2014the abstract theory of public health becoming a living, breathing metric. It was pure validation.\n\n4.\nJust last week, on his morning run through the Panhandle. He passed a new boutique spin studio, patrons sipping $12 green juices. Fifty feet later, he saw a man meticulously organizing his life inside a tattered tent. David felt a jolt of dissonance\u2014the frictionless, optimized world he helped design on his laptop versus the harsh friction of the street. It was a visceral reminder that his work wasn't finished; it had barely even begun. The gap he needed to bridge was right on his doorstep.\n\n5.\nHis father visited his Hayes Valley apartment a few months ago, peering at the multiple monitors with a look of polite confusion. \"So... you tell the phone to be healthy?\" he\u2019d asked. But later, as his mother unpacked a container of homemade wonton soup, she simply said, \"You look well. You're helping people.\" It wasn't the pride of having a doctor for a son, but it was a quiet, earned acceptance. In her simple words, he felt the two halves of his life\u2014their dream and his\u2014finally beginning to converge."
