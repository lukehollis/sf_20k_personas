The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, she was raised in the East Bay, where the scent of her father\u2019s auto shop grease mixed with the aroma of her mother\u2019s cooking. Her father, a pragmatic mechanic, taught her how things worked, while her mother, a homemaker with an artist\u2019s soul, taught her why beauty mattered. This duality became the foundation of her future.\n\nShe pursued Industrial Design at San Jose State, drawn to the challenge of creating objects that were both functional and beautiful. After graduating, she bypassed the flashy tech world for the tangible realm of manufacturing. Yasmin methodically worked her way up, earning a reputation for her keen eye and an unwavering commitment to quality. Now, as Head of Product Development, she leads a team that designs high-end, sustainable home goods.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce five years ago. The amicable split from a man who wanted a quiet, suburban life solidified her own identity. She was, at her core, a city person, fueled by its energy and creative pulse. Free from compromise, she fully invested in her career and her own vision for her life.\n\nToday, Yasmin resides in a tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. Her mornings begin with a strong coffee and a ride on the Muni N-Judah line, a 3.5-mile journey where she sketches ideas in a small black notebook. Her days are a whirlwind of prototypes, material sourcing, and team management. Evenings are for herself: exploring a new restaurant with her tight-knit circle of friends, visiting a gallery, or simply enjoying the view of the city lights from her window.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is aesthetic and sensory. She loves the juxtaposition of Victorian architecture against modern glass, the damp chill of the fog, and the vibrant creativity of her neighborhood. Her dream is to one day launch her own design studio, creating timeless pieces with ethically sourced materials\u2014a true marriage of her father\u2019s practicality and her mother\u2019s artistry."

Her father explained its function in his patient, methodical way. Then, her mother appeared in the doorway, a plate of warm, sweet ma'amoul in her hands, the scent of rosewater cutting through the grease. It was the first time she understood that the useful and the beautiful could, and should, exist in the same space. That moment became the blueprint for everything she would ever design.\n\n2.\nDuring a late-night studio session at San Jose State, she nearly gave up on a frustrating project. Defeated, she ran her hand over a piece of reclaimed redwood. She felt its history in the deep grain, its resilience. In that moment, the sterile, theoretical aspect of design fell away. She realized the material wasn't just a means to an end; it was the beginning of the story. It cemented her path away from abstract tech and toward tangible goods with a soul, shaping her commitment to sustainable sourcing.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, after signing the last of the divorce papers, she stood alone in her new, empty Hayes Valley apartment. The city hummed outside her window\u2014a collage of sirens, laughter, and traffic. Her ex had wanted quiet; she had craved this. It wasn\u2019t a moment of sadness, but of profound, liberating clarity. The noise wasn\u2019t chaos; it was life. That evening, standing at the window, she finally felt wholly, unapologetically herself, fully invested in the life she was building alone.\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday morning two years ago on the N-Judah. As the train burst from the darkness of the Sunset Tunnel into the pale, foggy light at Duboce Park, she looked up from her sketchbook. The damp air, the mix of faces, the gentle rocking of the car\u2014it all hit her with a wave of pure belonging. This journey wasn\u2019t a commute; it was a daily pilgrimage. This city, with its dramatic shifts in light and mood, was the aesthetic partner she had always needed.\n\n5.\nLast year, she unboxed the first production model of a minimalist ceramic canister she had designed. She felt the satisfying weight, the cool smoothness, the perfect fit of the ethically sourced acacia wood lid. It was more than just a product; it was a physical manifestation of her entire life\u2019s philosophy. In her hands, she held her father's pragmatism and her mother's artistry. Holding it, she knew with absolute certainty that her next step had to be a studio with her own name on it."
