Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond, she is a quintessential San Francisco native, a product of a Chinese mother from Hong Kong and a second-generation Irish-American father. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken over a dim sum table and her father\u2019s stories of the city\u2019s past. This dual heritage instilled in her a deep-seated pragmatism, a sense that one foot must always be planted in the world of tradition and the other in the pursuit of practical success.\n\nHer educational journey was modest and driven by necessity. After high school, she enrolled at San Francisco State University with vague artistic interests, but her father's early-onset illness forced a change of plans. She left SFSU to work full-time, eventually earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College by taking night classes. It wasn't a passion, but a tool for stability. She began her career as a receptionist and, through sheer competence and an unparalleled ability to create order from chaos, worked her way up to Office Manager.\n\nA key turning point was her brief marriage in her late twenties. She took her husband's name, Miller, but the union dissolved after five years, a casualty of his fleeting ambitions clashing with her need for security. The divorce, though amicable, cemented her resolve to rely solely on herself.\n\nToday, Mei lives a life of curated efficiency. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she resides in a modern condo in the same mixed-use building as her office. Her days are a meticulous routine of managing schedules, budgets, and the creative temperaments of star architects. She is the firm's institutional memory, respected and indispensable. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a weekly yoga class and dinner with a few long-time friends.\n\nThough content, Mei harbors a quiet dream. Surrounded daily by blueprints for stunning, multi-million-dollar structures, she yearns for a project of her own. Her aspiration is to buy a small, neglected Victorian cottage\u2014perhaps in Bernal Heights or the Mission\u2014and pour her savings and meticulous planning skills into restoring it, finally becoming the sole architect of her own beautiful, enduring space."

Her mother orders in swift Cantonese while her father, hand on her shoulder, whispers a story about the old Cliff House. In that moment, between the clatter of plates and the pull of the past, her feet felt planted in two worlds at once. It was her first lesson in finding solid ground between tradition and lore, a skill that would come to define her pragmatic soul.\n\n2.\nShe was nineteen. On the kitchen table sat a stack of medical bills next to her half-finished charcoal sketches from SFSU. She didn\u2019t cry. Instead, she methodically slid the drawings into a portfolio and pushed it under her bed. It wasn\u2019t a surrender, but a conscious trade: her ephemeral artistic dreams for the tangible security her family now desperately needed. That quiet act of packing away her passion was the moment practicality became her primary purpose, a foundation she built her life upon.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-nine, after the last box was gone, she stood in the empty apartment they had shared. It wasn't sadness she felt, but a quiet, clarifying certainty. She looked at her reflection in the clean window, thinking of the name she\u2019d keep\u2014Miller\u2014not as his, but as a practical, sturdy shell. The amicable end of her marriage wasn't a failure; it was the final, necessary confirmation that the only foundation she could ever truly trust was the one she built for herself.\n\n4.\nAround thirty-five, she stayed late one Thursday to finalize a budget. The office was silent, the only light from her monitor glowing on the meticulously organized project folders and color-coded schedules. She wasn\u2019t an architect, yet she saw how she was the essential structure holding up their grand designs. In the quiet hum of the server, she felt a deep, anchoring satisfaction. This\u2014this invisible, essential order\u2014was her art form, and it was undeniably hers.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a walk through Bernal Heights, she saw it: a small Victorian cottage, sagging and peeling but with beautiful bones. It stood in defiance of the sleek remodels around it. While her firm drafted glass towers, her mind began drafting a different blueprint\u2014one of reclaimed redwood, restored corbels, and a foundation made solid again by her own hands. This silent, neglected house became the vessel for her quietest ambition: to finally architect a space that was entirely, enduringly, her own."
