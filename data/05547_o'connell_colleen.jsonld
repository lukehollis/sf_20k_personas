Born and raised in the Sunset District, she is the daughter of a Muni bus driver and a fiercely dedicated homemaker who curated a world of creativity within their modest row house. Colleen grew up with the rhythmic clang of the N Judah streetcar as her soundtrack and the cool mist of Ocean Beach as her constant companion. She was a quiet, observant child, more interested in the stories behind things than in the things themselves.\n\nThis fascination led her to SF State, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History. She imagined a life spent in quiet galleries, surrounded by beauty and historical weight. However, a post-college internship at a prestigious downtown gallery proved disillusioning. The art world felt sterile and transactional, far removed from the joy of creation she cherished. The turning point came while volunteering at a community center, where she found herself helping with an after-school art program. The messy, uninhibited delight of children finger-painting was more inspiring than any celebrated masterpiece. It was a profound revelation: she didn\u2019t want to curate art; she wanted to cultivate the artists.\n\nColleen went back to school for her early childhood education credentials and, with a small inheritance from her grandmother, took the biggest risk of her life. She converted the ground floor of her Inner Sunset apartment into a licensed home preschool, which she named \u201cSunset Sprouts.\u201d This decision is the source of her zero-mile commute; her life and work are housed under one roof.\n\nHer days are a whirlwind of joyful chaos: story circles, playground negotiations, and glitter-glue catastrophes. Her evenings are spent quietly planning lessons, communicating with parents, and tidying up the colorful world she dismantles and rebuilds each day. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; the parents of her students have become her community and closest friends. At 44, Colleen is content yet quietly aspirational. Her greatest dream isn't wealth, but security\u2014the hope of one day buying the building she lives and works in, cementing her small haven of community and creativity against the city's ever-rising tide."

She explained kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold. \"See?\" she'd said, tracing the golden seam. \"It\u2019s more beautiful for having been broken.\" It wasn't about pristine objects; it was about the beauty of care and repair. That teacup, sitting on their mantel, was the first piece of art whose story she truly understood, planting a seed about valuing process over perfection.\n\n2.\nAt 22, an intern in a stark white gallery downtown, she was carefully dusting a frame. The gallerist was on the phone, describing the painting not by its raw emotion, but by its \"investment potential\" and how it would \"appreciate against the market.\" The vibrant colors on the canvas seemed to dim before her eyes. The sterile quiet felt less like a temple and more like a tomb. In that cold, transactional moment, she realized with a sinking heart that she didn't belong in a world that put a price tag on a soul.\n\n3.\nIt was a messy, chaotic afternoon at the community center when she was 23. A little boy, new to the country and silent for weeks, stood before an easel. He plunged his hands into a pot of blue paint and smeared them across the paper, creating a swirling, turbulent sea. Then he looked directly at her and, for the first time, he smiled. It was pure communication, a soul uncorked. In that messy, beautiful moment of creation, Colleen knew. She didn't want to curate finished art; she wanted to cultivate the artist.\n\n4.\nAt 30, the night before Sunset Sprouts opened, she sat on a tiny red chair in the silent ground-floor room. Her entire inheritance was in these miniature tables and fat crayons. The air smelled of fresh paint and anxious hope. Through the window, the headlight of the N Judah streetcar washed across the wall, a familiar ghost from her childhood. A wave of absolute terror hit her, but it was followed by a profound sense of purpose. This wasn't just a school; it was her life, finally built into a shape that felt like home.\n\n5.\nJust last year, at 43, one of her favorite school parents, a fellow native, told her his family was being forced to move\u2014a rent hike they couldn't fight. The casual, defeated way he said it sent a chill through her. Colleen looked around at the paint-splattered walls of her school, her home. She saw not just her own future, but the fragile community she nurtured. The quiet want for security ignited into a fierce, burning need. She had to own this place. She had to protect her sprouts."
