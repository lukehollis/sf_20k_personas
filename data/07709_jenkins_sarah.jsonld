That\u2019s the distance from her pillow in the loft apartment to the front door of Axon Gallery, the contemporary art space she runs on the ground floor. This zero-mile commute is the defining feature of a life meticulously constructed to blur the lines between work and passion.\n\nBorn in Portland, Oregon, to a librarian mother and a history teacher father, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was scholarly but aesthetically conventional. Her parents revered books, not canvases. It was during a sullen, rain-soaked semester at Reed College that she found her calling in an art history class on German Expressionism. The raw emotion, so at odds with her quiet household, ignited her. She pursued this spark with academic fervor, earning a Master's in Art History from NYU, where she wrote a lauded thesis on the ephemeral nature of digital and performance art.\n\nAfter a grueling stint in the cutthroat New York gallery scene, she moved to San Francisco in her late twenties, drawn by the city\u2019s fusion of tech rebellion and artistic experimentation. She worked her way up from assistant to associate curator before her major turning point arrived: the chance to take over a struggling gallery in a SoMa live/work space. She rebranded it as Axon Gallery, focusing on emerging artists who interrogated technology\u2019s impact on human connection.\n\nHer life is a cycle of intense focus. Mornings are for coffee and correspondence with artists across time zones, afternoons for planning installations and meeting patrons, and evenings for openings and dinners that are extensions of her job. Her last serious relationship dissolved under the weight of this total immersion; her partner felt he was always competing with a sculpture or a deadline. Now 43, her closest confidantes are the artists she champions and a few fellow curators who understand the monastic demands of the profession.\n\nLiving in SoMa, she feels the city's pulse directly\u2014the relentless construction, the hum of innovation, the ghosts of its counter-culture past. Sarah\u2019s dream is to launch an artist who becomes a defining voice of their generation. Yet, a quieter aspiration is emerging: to one day take a vacation where she doesn\u2019t visit a single gallery and to find a connection that exists entirely outside the stark, beautiful, white walls of her world."
