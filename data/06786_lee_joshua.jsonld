The son of pragmatic Korean immigrants who ran a dry-cleaning business in Daly City, Joshua\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the values of hard work, stability, and tangible success. Art was seen as a hobby, not a profession. To appease his parents, he dutifully enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration\u2014a practical, sensible choice.\n\nThe turning point came not in a classroom, but during his part-time job. He started working at \"Artisan's Corner,\" a small, cluttered art supply store, simply to pay for his textbooks. There, surrounded by the earthy smell of clay, the sharp scent of turpentine, and the dazzling promise of untouched canvases, Joshua found his true calling. He wasn't a great artist himself, but he had an innate understanding of the materials and a genuine passion for helping others create. He listened to the anxieties of art students and the ambitions of muralists, becoming a quiet confidant to the neighborhood's creative souls.\n\nWhen the original owner, a kind woman named Eleanor, decided to retire, she saw in Joshua not just a clerk, but a successor. She offered him a deal: he could take over as manager and rent the small apartment directly above the shop. At 27, Joshua seized the opportunity. His business degree suddenly became invaluable as he streamlined inventory and modernized the store's operations without losing its cherished, old-world charm.\n\nNow 33, his commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs. His days are a rhythm of brewing coffee, arranging displays of brushes and pigment tubes, and offering advice to his regulars. His social life is woven into his work; his friends are the ceramicists, tattoo artists, and illustrators who are also his customers. Joshua\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to expand into a chain or become wealthy. He aspires to convert the dusty backroom into a workshop space for local kids and to curate a small gallery wall for undiscovered artists. His world may be small, but within his block, Joshua Lee is more than a store manager; he is the quiet, essential heartbeat of a creative community."
