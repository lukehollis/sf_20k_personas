At age five, she and her family fled Vietnam by boat, a harrowing journey that ended in a refugee camp before they were sponsored to San Jose. Her parents, who had been professionals in their homeland, took on janitorial and assembly line work, pouring all their hopes into their quiet, studious daughter. This legacy of sacrifice became the engine of Linh\u2019s ambition.\n\nShe met their expectations and then exceeded them, earning a degree in computer science from UC Berkeley during the first dot-com boom. While a competent software engineer, Linh felt a disconnect; she was more interested in the architecture of the business than the code. This realization was her first major turning point. At 28, she left a stable tech job to pursue an MBA at Stanford, a decision that baffled her pragmatic parents. It was there she found her true calling, thriving on complex case studies and strategic problem-solving. She was recruited straight into a top-tier management consulting firm.\n\nNow 52, Linh is a partner, advising tech giants on digital transformation from the sleek, minimalist quiet of her Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her home office, where she commands a global team through a screen. Her demanding career contributed to a divorce in her late 30s, and she has no children. Her social life is a curated circle of equally successful women, their bond forged over late-night work sessions and weekend trips to Napa.\n\nShe loves San Francisco for its anonymity and culture, a world away from the Little Saigon of her youth. Her days are disciplined\u2014Peloton, Zoom calls, industry reports\u2014but her evenings are for pleasure: a performance at the symphony or a new restaurant. Linh\u2019s next reinvention is already taking shape. She aspires to leave consulting for a C-suite position where she can build something lasting and mentor young women in tech. Secretly, she dreams of a life less structured, perhaps walking the Camino de Santiago, finally traveling without a deliverable."
