The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants, she grew up amidst the fragrant chaos of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Richmond District. Her childhood was a symphony of Cantonese chatter, the rustle of produce bags, and the relentless work ethic that defined her family. Seeking refuge and order, she fell in love with libraries. This passion led her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master's degree in Library and Information Science, dreaming of a career in academic archiving.\n\nHer path diverged during the first dot-com boom. While working at a university library digitizing collections, Sarah had an epiphany: the nascent world of e-commerce was just the world\u2019s largest, most disorganized library. The principles of cataloging, metadata, and user-focused organization she had mastered were precisely what fledgling online retailers desperately needed. She took a leap, leaving the stability of academia for a scrappy startup. It was there she discovered her true calling, translating the logic of a library shelf to the infinite scroll of a digital storefront.\n\nNow 52, Sarah is the Director of E-commerce Strategy for a major tech firm. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a meticulously organized home office in her Cole Valley Edwardian. Her partner of fifteen years, a landscape architect named Ben, tends to their small, verdant backyard. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls and data analysis, but she grounds herself in routine: a morning walk through the Panhandle with their retriever, Dewey (a nod to the decimal system), and a mid-afternoon coffee from her favorite local cafe.\n\nHaving achieved financial security, Sarah\u2019s aspirations have shifted. She feels a growing desire to mentor young women, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds, trying to navigate the tech world. She sees her own journey\u2014from the Richmond District grocery to a Cole Valley directorship\u2014not as an endpoint, but as a bridge she is now obligated to hold steady for others to cross."
