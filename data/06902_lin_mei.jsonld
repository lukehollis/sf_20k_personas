The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling laundromat on Taraval Street, she learned early lessons in community and commerce. She watched families come and go, saw storefronts change hands, and felt the subtle shifts in the neighborhood\u2019s character. A quiet, observant child, she spent more time sketching the buildings and streetscapes in her notebook than playing. Her pivot point came at sixteen, when a beloved community garden was bulldozed to make way for a block of sterile, high-priced townhomes, displacing the shared space that had been the heart of her block. The feeling of powerlessness ignited a resolve to understand and influence the forces that shaped a city.\n\nThis resolve guided her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master of Urban Planning. Eschewing more lucrative private-sector jobs, Mei dove into public service, joining the San Francisco Planning Department. She found a deep satisfaction in the meticulous, often contentious work of shaping the city\u2019s future. For Mei, poring over zoning maps and environmental impact reports wasn't bureaucratic drudgery; it was a way to protect the soul of the city she loved, one policy and one project at a time. Now a Senior Planner, she is a respected voice on housing density and public open spaces.\n\nToday, Mei\u2019s life is a testament to the principles she advocates for. She lives in a modern Hayes Valley condo, a 0.0-mile commute that allows her to work from home or walk a few blocks to her Civic Center office. Her mornings begin with a stroll to a local cafe, sketchbook in hand, before a day of virtual meetings and digital blueprint reviews. Her long-term partner, an architect named Alex, shares her passion, and their evenings are often spent debating the merits of a new bike lane or the design of a proposed development over dinner.\n\nHer dream extends beyond her own career ladder. Mei aspires to spearhead a landmark project\u2014a large-scale, beautifully designed affordable housing initiative that integrates seamlessly into an existing neighborhood without causing displacement. She envisions a San Francisco that can grow without losing its character; a city of vibrant, equitable neighborhoods like the one that first raised her, but stronger, more resilient, and open to all."
