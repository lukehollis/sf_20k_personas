Raised in the quiet, academic enclave of Ann Arbor, Michigan, she was the only child of a history professor and a librarian. Her childhood was spent not with dolls, but with almanacs and encyclopedias, her mind naturally drawn to the elegant logic of systems. This innate curiosity propelled her east for college and eventually to a grueling PhD program in computational biology at MIT. There, amidst the pressure and near-burnout, she had a breakthrough\u2014not just in her research on genomic sequencing, but in understanding her own limits and resilience.\n\nHer move to San Francisco for a postdoctoral fellowship at UCSF was meant to be a temporary, career-building step. However, she found herself captivated by the city\u2019s relentless hum of innovation. Instead of pursuing a traditional academic track, Rebecca took a risk, joining a burgeoning biotech startup in Mission Bay. For over a decade, she has thrived there, rising to Senior Research Scientist. Her work is her passion: from the digital monastery of her home office, she deciphers the complex language of human DNA, searching for markers that could predict and prevent hereditary diseases.\n\nNow at 40, Rebecca\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to her standing desk in her sleek Mission Bay condo. Mornings begin with a run along the Embarcadero, the bay\u2019s cool air a clean slate for the day\u2019s complex data analysis. While her demanding career has left little room for long-term romance, she maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow scientists, a graphic designer, and a chef\u2014who ground her. Her connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal; she lives and works at the very epicenter of the biotech world.\n\nLooking forward, Rebecca aspires to see her research translate into a widely available clinical tool; a tangible legacy. Personally, a new longing is stirring\u2014a desire to cultivate a life beyond algorithms and datasets. She dreams of taking a sabbatical to travel through Southeast Asia, to learn pottery, to find a pattern not in code, but in the unstructured, beautiful chaos of the wider world."
