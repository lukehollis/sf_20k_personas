Born in Jakarta, Indonesia, he moved to Fremont with his family at age eight. His father, a civil engineer, instilled in him a deep respect for structure and function, while his mother\u2019s vibrant cooking and love for batik textiles taught him the value of artistry. This blend of the technical and the aesthetic became the blueprint for his future.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Industrial Design at San Jose State, initially drawn to creating sleek consumer products. However, during a summer internship at a metalworking shop, Budi discovered his true passion was not in the initial sketch, but in the complex dance of turning a concept into a tangible object. He was fascinated by the logistics, the problem-solving, and the translation of an architect\u2019s dream into steel, wood, and glass. This was a pivotal shift, guiding his career away from pure design and towards the management of creation.\n\nAfter years of working his way up from floor manager to project lead, Budi is now the Director of Operations at a high-end custom fabrication firm in the Dogpatch. He is the calm center of a chaotic world, the person who ensures a massive, architecturally integrated art piece is built to millimeter-perfect specifications and delivered on time.\n\nBudi\u2019s life in San Francisco is as intentional as his work. He lives in a meticulously organized Potrero Hill flat with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Alex. His 2.8-mile bicycle commute is a daily ritual, a moment of physical exertion and mental clarity before immersing himself in blueprints and build schedules. Evenings often involve recreating his mother\u2019s Indonesian recipes or quietly sketching furniture designs in a notebook.\n\nHe feels a deep kinship with San Francisco\u2019s maker culture, the city\u2019s industrial soul that hums beneath the tech gloss. At 47, Budi isn\u2019t chasing a startup exit. His dream is quieter: to one day open a small, personal workshop, perhaps crafting bespoke furniture. It would be a return to his roots\u2014a place where the engineer and the artist in him could finally work under one roof, guided by his own two hands."

His father was at one end, hunched over a drafting board, the sharp, clean scent of ink and paper filling the air as he finalized a bridge schematic. From the kitchen, the rich, complex aroma of his mother\u2019s beef rendang simmered, a promise of warmth and vibrant flavor. In that moment, Budi felt no conflict between the two worlds. He saw only a perfect, beautiful balance of structure and soul, a blueprint that would define the rest of his life.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during his summer internship, he stood mesmerized, watching a bead of molten steel fuse two massive plates together under a welder\u2019s steady hand. The air buzzed with energy and smelled of ozone. The foreman handed him the finished joint, still warm to the touch. It was heavy, solid, and real in a way no digital rendering had ever been. It was in that moment he understood his passion wasn't for the initial idea, but for the alchemy of turning that idea into a tangible, physical object.\n\n3.\nHe was thirty-two, and his first project as a lead was about to fail. A crucial measurement was off by a single, disastrous millimeter. Panic rippled through the team, but Budi felt a strange calm descend. He spent the next 36 hours on-site, fueled by coffee and sheer will, sketching and re-engineering a solution with the machinists. When the final piece clicked perfectly into place, the overwhelming relief was secondary to a deeper discovery: he thrived not just on precision, but on navigating the chaos when precision broke.\n\n4.\nOn one of their first dates, he and Alex were walking through the Presidio. Alex, a landscape architect, stopped to run his hand over a moss-covered retaining wall. He explained not just the beauty of its decay, but the genius of its original civil engineering\u2014how it was designed to settle and integrate with the land over time. Budi felt a profound sense of recognition. He wasn't just attracted to Alex; he felt deeply understood by someone who saw the world through the same lens of purposeful, enduring design.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a grueling week delivering a huge architectural piece, he came home exhausted. He found a scrap of walnut left over from a personal project and, on impulse, began shaping it with his hand plane. The simple, rhythmic rasp of the blade and the sweet scent of the wood shavings were more satisfying than the entire multi-million dollar installation. It was a quiet-but-total clarification. The goal wasn\u2019t to manage bigger projects, but to get back to this: the direct, honest conversation between his hands and the material."
