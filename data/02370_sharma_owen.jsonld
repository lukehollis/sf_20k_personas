Born in Daly City to Indian immigrants, his path was pre-written by his parents: a stable career in engineering or medicine. Owen, however, found his calling not in textbooks, but in the vibrant chaos of his mother\u2019s kitchen. He was mesmerized by her intuitive understanding of spices, the way she could turn simple lentils and rice into a feast that defined his childhood.\n\nTo appease his practical father, Owen dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college. He saw it not as a compromise, but as a secret blueprint. For the next two decades, he worked his way through San Francisco\u2019s culinary underbelly\u2014starting as a line cook in the Mission, then managing a small caf\u00e9 in the Financial District, all while saving every dollar and absorbing every lesson. He learned French technique, Italian simplicity, and Californian seasonality, but always returned to the foundational North Indian flavors of his youth.\n\nThe turning point came at 41. After his mother\u2019s passing, Owen cashed in his life savings and, with a reluctant blessing and a small loan from his father, he took over a narrow, long-vacant storefront in the Inner Richmond. The space came with a small apartment upstairs, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. He named the restaurant \u201cTara\u2019s Table,\u201d in honor of his mother.\n\nNow 53, Owen\u2019s life is his work. His days are a rhythm of early morning trips to the farmers' market, hours of meticulous prep, the controlled chaos of service, and the quiet satisfaction of closing up late at night. His marriage ended amicably years ago, a casualty of the all-consuming nature of the restaurant industry. His social life is woven into his profession; his regulars are his confidants, and his small staff, his surrogate family. Owen\u2019s dream is no longer for expansion, but for refinement and legacy. He hopes to one day find a young, passionate chef to mentor, someone to whom he can pass on his mother's recipes and the keys to the world he built for himself, one plate at a time."
