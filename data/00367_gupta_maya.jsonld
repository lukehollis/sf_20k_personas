Raised in the sun-drenched predictability of Cupertino, she was the daughter of two Indian immigrants who saw the Silicon Valley dream as a direct path paved with code and engineering degrees. Her father, a successful software architect, instilled in her a deep understanding of technology's logic and power.\n\nWhile her family anticipated a similar trajectory, Maya chose a different route. At UC Berkeley, she pursued sociology, fascinated by systems of people rather than systems of code. This divergence culminated in a Master of Public Health, a degree that baffled her parents but felt like finding a missing piece of herself. Her early career was a compromise: a project management role at a large tech firm. The work was stable but felt hollow, a gilded cage far removed from the societal problems she studied.\n\nThe turning point came during a volunteer stint at a free clinic in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin. She witnessed firsthand how technology, so abundant just miles away, failed the city's most vulnerable. Seniors struggled with digital appointment systems, and non-English speakers were lost in confusing healthcare apps. It was a stark revelation. Maya realized her unique background was not a contradiction, but a bridge.\n\nShe quit her corporate job and took a significant pay cut to become a Program Manager for a new tech initiative focused on community health. Now, at 38, her commute is a zero-mile walk to the sunroom-turned-office in her Inner Sunset apartment. Her days are a mix of Zoom calls with software developers and community organizers, meticulously planning programs that deliver health tech to underserved populations.\n\nHer life is deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Morning runs weave through Golden Gate Park, lunch is often a sandwich from a local cafe on Irving Street, and evenings might be spent with her long-term partner, Liam, a landscape architect, or at a pottery class. Maya\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder but about scaling impact. She envisions a future where she can launch her own non-profit, proving that technology's greatest purpose isn't disruption, but connection and care."
