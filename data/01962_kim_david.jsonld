The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery in the Outer Richmond, David was the vessel for their American Dream. He was supposed to be a doctor or a lawyer, but he compromised, earning a Bachelor's degree in Economics from UC Berkeley to please them. He dutifully took a junior analyst job in a Financial District high-rise, spending three years staring at spreadsheets, a profound emptiness hollowing him out day by day.\n\nThe turning point came during a particularly brutal corporate merger. At 27, he walked out of his office and never returned. The decision shattered his relationship with his father for nearly a decade. Adrift, David took a job waiting tables at a high-end Italian restaurant in North Beach to pay his rent. There, amidst the clatter of plates and the rhythm of service, he found an unexpected peace. He wasn\u2019t just good at it; he thrived on managing the controlled chaos, connecting with both staff and patrons.\n\nHe worked his way up, from waiter to captain, to assistant manager. For the past fifteen years, he has been the unflappable manager of a sophisticated cafe inside a large Union Square department store. It's a perfect blend of his worlds: the structure of a corporate retail environment and the human energy of hospitality.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is now one of cultivated simplicity. He lives in a modern, minimalist apartment on a high floor of the same building complex where he works, his 0.0-mile commute a source of daily calm. His routine is his sanctuary: a pre-dawn walk through the quiet downtown streets, mentoring his young, diverse staff, and a quiet evening with a book and a view of the city lights. While he reconciled with his father before his passing, his closest confidant remains his younger sister, a teacher in Oakland. He is single, having had one serious relationship end under the pressure of his career change years ago, and now finds community in the work family he has built. He is an observer of San Francisco\u2019s frenetic energy, a calm anchor in its commercial heart. Secretly, he still dreams of a small gallery-cafe of his own one day, a place where his forgotten passion for art history and his talent for hospitality could finally merge."
