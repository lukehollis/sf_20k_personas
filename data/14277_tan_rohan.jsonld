The son of a pragmatic Singaporean-Chinese engineer and a passionate Indian-American high school teacher, Rohan grew up in the sprawling suburbs of the San Gabriel Valley. His childhood was defined by the hypnotic drone of freeway traffic and the necessity of a car for every errand. He found his calling during a family trip to Singapore at sixteen. The seamless efficiency of the MRT system felt like a revelation, a stark contrast to the gridlocked frustration of the I-10. It was there, gliding silently between stations, that he decided he wouldn't just complain about traffic; he would fix it.\n\nThis newfound mission propelled him to UC Berkeley for his graduate degree in Urban and Regional Planning. While his peers were drawn to tech or finance, Rohan was captivated by transit maps and zoning codes. He saw San Francisco not as a gold rush town, but as the ultimate urban puzzle: a city of immense beauty and potential, hamstrung by its own geography and history.\n\nAfter graduating, he took a job with a city-contracted transportation firm and began his steady ascent. Now a Senior Transportation Planner, Rohan is one of the key minds behind projects aimed at improving bus rapid transit and expanding protected bike lanes. His biggest turning point was successfully advocating for a \"road diet\" on a major corridor, a contentious project that ultimately reduced collisions and improved bus times.\n\nHe lives his principles daily. From his apartment in Hayes Valley, he begins his day with a run, then takes a Muni bus the 2.1 miles to his downtown office, observing passenger flow and traffic patterns with a professional eye. He\u2019s in a long-term relationship with Clara, a landscape architect, and their dinner party conversations often revolve around public space and civic design.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city\u2019s flaws with a planner\u2019s clarity but loves it with a resident\u2019s heart. His aspiration isn\u2019t a corner office but a legacy: to one day ride a new light rail line he helped champion, knowing he left the city more connected, equitable, and breathable than he found it."

As it glided out of the station, he saw a city moving in effortless concert. It wasn't just efficient; it felt like a collective exhale, a deep sense of shared calm. In that moment, the gridlock of his childhood wasn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it was a problem with a beautiful, tangible solution. His future clicked into place between two stations.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe remembers the shouting at the community meetings for the road diet project. A man had jabbed a finger at him, calling him an out-of-touch idealist. Six months after the project\u2019s completion, Rohan stood anonymously at a bus stop on that same corridor. He watched an elderly woman cross the street without flinching at traffic and saw a child confidently coast by on a scooter in the new protected lane. The wave of quiet vindication he felt wasn't pride; it was relief. His work wasn't just lines on a map.\n\n***\n\n3.\nOn his third date with Clara, they sat in a parklet he\u2019d had a minor role in approving. As he explained the nuances of traffic calming, she began sketching the flow of people around them on a napkin, discussing how planting choices could make the space feel safer. He stopped talking, stunned. For the first time, someone wasn't just politely listening to his obsession; they were speaking the same language. The feeling was powerful and immediate: he wasn\u2019t alone in seeing the world this way.\n\n***\n\n4.\nFresh out of grad school and new to his firm, he waited forty minutes for a ghost bus in a miserable Financial District downpour. He felt like a total fraud, a planner who couldn\u2019t even navigate the broken system he was supposed to fix. The cold seeped into his coat, but a different kind of fire lit inside him. The frustration wasn't abstract anymore; it was his own soaked shoes and missed dinner. That night, his professional mission became a deeply personal crusade against every ignored schedule and shivering commuter.\n\n***\n\n5.\nDuring a recent morning run to the top of Corona Heights, he paused to catch his breath. Below, the city was waking up. He could trace the arteries he knew by heart: the slow crawl of traffic on Market, the orange spine of a Muni bus disappearing into the Castro. He saw the city not as a series of problems to be solved, but as a single, complex, breathing organism. A profound love, sharp and clear as the morning air, washed over him, reaffirming why every budget meeting and angry email was worth it."
