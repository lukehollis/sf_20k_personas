Raised in the meticulously planned suburbs of Irvine, he was the son of a dentist and a real estate agent, parents who valued stability and clear career paths. Ethan, however, was drawn to the sprawling, messy narratives of the past. He escaped to UC Santa Cruz, where he lost himself in European history, earning a Bachelor's degree that felt more like a personal passion project than a professional stepping stone.\n\nThe reality of Bay Area rent hit hard after graduation. While working as a barista in Oakland, Ethan discovered a different kind of system: the cafe\u2019s frustratingly buggy point-of-sale network. He found a surprising satisfaction in troubleshooting it, in tracing the logic and finding the broken link. This was a puzzle with a solvable answer, a stark contrast to the interpretive nature of history. It was a turning point. He used his savings to get A+ and Network+ certifications, trading dusty tomes for technical manuals.\n\nHis technical skills landed him a job in San Francisco. Now, at 35, he\u2019s a senior IT Systems Administrator for a mid-size tech firm, working entirely from his quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is both a blessing and a curse. It affords him the luxury of walking his dog in Golden Gate Park every morning, but it also creates a comfortable bubble that can be hard to break. His days are a routine of virtual meetings, ticket queues, and server maintenance, the digital hum a constant backdrop to his life.\n\nEthan\u2019s social circle is small but solid\u2014a weekly trivia night at a neighborhood pub with a few friends is his main outing. He appreciates San Francisco more as a resident than a participant, valuing the city\u2019s fog-laced quiet over its frenetic nightlife. While he\u2019s financially secure, a part of him still yearns for the narrative arc his life seems to have lost. His dream isn\u2019t to become a CTO, but to one day achieve a work-life balance that allows him time to travel to the historical places he once only read about, to find a connection that feels as real and tangible as the physical network cables he once learned to patch."
