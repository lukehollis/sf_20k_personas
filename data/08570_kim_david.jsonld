At 42, he is the picture of stability: a Senior Financial Analyst for a major firm, his days a disciplined cadence of video conferences and complex spreadsheets. He is the son his Korean immigrant parents, who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Los Angeles, had always hoped for\u2014successful, secure, and financially astute.\n\nWhat they don't know is that his graduate degree isn't an MBA, but a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University. He came to the city two decades ago not for its stock options, but for its Beat poetry legacy and vibrant literary scene. He spent his twenties in drafty apartments, workshopping short stories and believing a life of words was possible. That dream shattered when his father suffered a massive stroke, and the family business faltered. Overwhelmed by medical bills and a sense of duty, David abandoned his nearly-finished novel, took a crash course in finance, and clawed his way into a world of predictable returns. It was a trade he made consciously: his passion for his family\u2019s security.\n\nNow, his life is a study in quiet contradiction. He lives in Hayes Valley, surrounded by the arts\u2014the symphony, the jazz clubs\u2014but rarely partakes, feeling like a ghost observing a life he once intended to live. His social circle is small, consisting mostly of a few colleagues and one old friend from his MFA program who occasionally asks, \"Are you still writing?\" David always demurs, changing the subject.\n\nRecently, however, the silence of his work-from-home existence has become deafening. The man who traded his pen for a calculator is feeling the weight of that bargain. Late at night, after the markets in Asia have closed, he has started opening an old file on his laptop\u2014the novel he left behind. His hope is no longer for publication or fame, but something more fundamental: to finish the story and, in doing so, to reconcile the man he is with the man he was supposed to be."
