The daughter of a pragmatic American architect and a meticulous accountant who immigrated from Guangzhou, Mei grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Sunset District. Her childhood was a balance of two worlds: learning her father\u2019s love for structural integrity and her mother\u2019s reverence for precision and order. This dual inheritance shaped her path, steering her away from abstract fields and toward the tangible world of making things.\n\nShe pursued a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, drawn to the university's \"learn by doing\" philosophy. After graduating, she took a job at a large-scale medical device manufacturer in the South Bay. While the work was stable, she felt disconnected, a tiny cog optimizing a single process in a vast, impersonal machine. The turning point came during the pandemic, a period of introspection where she realized her true passion wasn't just optimizing systems but building them from the ground up.\n\nUsing a modest inheritance from her grandmother and her own savings, Mei made a bold move. She purchased a live/work loft in Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial bones resonated with her own sensibilities. This explains her zero-mile commute; her workshop, filled with the hum of a CNC mill and the faint, clean scent of cutting fluid, is on the ground floor, while her minimalist apartment is upstairs.\n\nHer company, \"Miller Machining,\" specializes in creating high-fidelity prototypes and small-batch parts for local robotics and biotech startups. Her days are a practiced routine: an early start with strong coffee, reviewing schematics, and then descending into her workshop to bring digital designs into physical reality. Her social life is small but strong, consisting of a tight-knit circle of other local makers, designers, and a few old friends who appreciate her intense focus.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched in steel and aluminum. She is part of the city\u2019s under-the-radar creator economy, providing a critical service to its innovation engine. Her dream isn\u2019t to build a massive corporation but to remain the best at what she does\u2014a master craftsperson known for her precision and reliability. She hopes to one day take on an apprentice, passing on the tangible skills that, to her, are the true heart of manufacturing."
