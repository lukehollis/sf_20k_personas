            "value": "Liam Gallagher\u2019s story begins not in Ireland, but in an orphanage in Seoul, South Korea. Adopted at nine months old by a loving, boisterous Irish-American couple from San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, his name was a testament to his new family\u2019s heritage. Growing up, Liam navigated a unique cultural space; he was the Asian kid with freckles who knew all the words to \"Danny Boy\" but felt a quiet, unanswered pull toward a homeland he couldn't remember. This duality\u2014of belonging completely yet feeling subtly separate\u2014planted the seeds for his future career.\n\nHis educational journey was a search for understanding, both of the world and himself. After completing his undergraduate degree at SF State, he felt drawn to the mechanics of human connection and healing. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work. It was during his clinical fieldwork, counseling families at a city hospital, that he found his calling. He saw how illness and trauma fractured not just individuals, but entire family systems, and he felt uniquely equipped to help bridge those gaps.\n\nA key turning point came at age 28 when he took a solo trip to Seoul. He didn\u2019t search for his birth parents, but instead immersed himself in the culture, food, and language. The trip didn\u2019t provide easy answers but gave him a profound sense of peace and integration. He returned to San Francisco not as a man split between two worlds, but as one forged by them. This newfound wholeness deepened his empathy and made him a more effective therapist.\n\nToday, Liam lives and works out of a serene, garden-level apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his living room to his home office, where he sees clients both virtually and in person. His days are structured: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, sessions with patients navigating grief and complex family dynamics, and evenings spent either cooking or meeting a close-knit group of friends for dinner. He is deeply connected to his neighborhood, a regular at the local library and the farmers' market. His dream is to establish a small group practice specializing in therapy for adoptees and their families, creating a space for others to navigate the same complex questions of identity that shaped him. Liam Gallagher is, in essence, a product of San Francisco itself: a mosaic of cultures, defined not by his origins, but by the unique and compassionate identity he has built."
