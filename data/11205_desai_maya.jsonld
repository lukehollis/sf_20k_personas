Her parents, immigrants from India, instilled in her a strong sense of community and a deep belief in social justice. Growing up, Maya saw firsthand the disparities in her city, fueling her passion for helping others.\n\nAfter high school, Maya attended UC Berkeley, earning a Bachelor's degree in Social Work. Her time at Berkeley exposed her to diverse perspectives and solidified her commitment to addressing systemic issues. Upon graduation, Maya began her career at a local nonprofit focused on youth empowerment, where she discovered her knack for program development and management.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Maya has dedicated her life to serving the San Francisco community. She's worked in various sectors, including education, healthcare, and social services, always striving to create positive change. A turning point came five years ago when she led a successful campaign to expand after-school programs in underserved neighborhoods, witnessing the direct impact of her work on children's lives.\n\nMaya's personal life is equally fulfilling. She shares a close bond with her family, still residing in the city. While she's navigated some challenging relationships in the past, she currently finds joy in her friendships, built through work and shared passions like hiking in the Marin Headlands and exploring new exhibits at SFMOMA.\n\nCommuting by bus each day, Maya is deeply connected to the rhythm of San Francisco. She appreciates the city's energy and diversity, finding inspiration in its resilience and innovation. Her current neighborhood, while gentrifying, still holds a strong sense of community that she actively contributes to through local initiatives.\n\nLooking ahead, Maya dreams of establishing her own nonprofit focused on intergenerational support and mentorship. She hopes to create a space where elders can share their wisdom and young people can find guidance and resources. Her current focus is on expanding her professional network and solidifying the strategic plan for her future endeavor.\n\nMaya's daily routine is a blend of demanding work and personal reflection. Early mornings are for planning and catching up on emails. Days are filled with meetings, program oversight, and advocating for those she serves. Evenings often involve community events or quiet time at home, reflecting on the day's challenges and triumphs, ever driven by her unwavering commitment to making San Francisco a more equitable city."

Seeing the neighborhood elders and children planting marigolds and tomatoes side-by-side, she felt a surge of hope and connection. It was a small victory, but it solidified her belief in tangible community impact. (Around age 30)\n\n2. There was a specific bus ride home from work, years ago, where a young man she'd mentored through the after-school program recognized her and excitedly told her he'd gotten into college. The pure joy in his voice, seeing the direct outcome of their work, brought tears to her eyes and reaffirmed her life's path. (Around age 35)\n\n3. She remembers the feeling of the crisp Marin Headlands air on her face, standing atop a bluff with friends after a challenging hike, the city skyline a distant jewel across the bay. In that moment of shared sweat and breathtaking beauty, she felt a profound sense of belonging and peace, a counterpoint to the demanding work she did. (Various times throughout adulthood)\n\n4. The first time she testified at City Hall for increased funding for youth services, her voice trembling at first, but growing stronger with each word as she spoke about the children she served. The fear of public speaking was overcome by the fierce dedication to her cause, a moment that empowered her deeply. (Around age 28)\n\n5. Sitting with her aging mother, listening to her stories of coming to a new country and building a life, Maya felt a deep well of gratitude and understanding. It was a quiet evening, but the weight of her mother\u2019s resilience and the legacy of her family\u2019s journey settled within Maya, shaping her vision for intergenerational support. (Recently)"
