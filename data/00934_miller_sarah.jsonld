Raised in a sprawling, car-dependent suburb outside Cleveland, Ohio, her world was one of manicured lawns, looping cul-de-sacs, and strip malls. Her parents, a high school teacher and a dental hygienist, valued stability and practicality, often perplexed by Sarah\u2019s habit of sketching imaginary cityscapes instead of playing outside. She felt a deep, unarticulated longing for density, for the serendipitous encounters that only walkable streets can provide.\n\nThis abstract interest found focus at Ohio State, where she pursued a degree in sociology, studying how communities form and function. A semester abroad in Copenhagen was her pivotal turning point. Experiencing a city designed for people\u2014filled with bike lanes, vibrant public squares, and seamless transit\u2014was a profound revelation. It wasn't just sociology; it was applied sociology. She realized she didn't just want to study communities; she wanted to build them. This epiphany led her to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning, a leap that felt both terrifying and inevitable.\n\nNow 31, Sarah is an urban planner for a small, progressive San Francisco firm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a core principle of her life; her office is a dedicated corner of her minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. She chose the neighborhood deliberately, fascinated by its transformation from a freeway-scarred corridor into a thriving, walkable community.\n\nHer days are a blend of digital modeling and grassroots engagement. She might spend her morning drafting proposals for pedestrian safety improvements on Valencia Street and her afternoon attending a heated community meeting about a new housing development. Her social life is woven into her professional one; her partner is a landscape architect, and her closest friends are a mix of city hall aides, transit activists, and architects she met in grad school.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to one day lead a transformative public space project, perhaps converting a neglected alley into a vibrant public plaza or redesigning a major park to better serve its diverse community. She sees the flaws in San Francisco\u2014the inequality, the bureaucracy, the staggering cost of living\u2014not as reasons to despair, but as complex problems demanding creative, human-centered solutions. Her life's work is an attempt to give others the sense of belonging and connection she craved as a child in the quiet suburbs."
