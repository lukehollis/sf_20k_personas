Raised by a public-school teacher father and an ER nurse mother, a sense of civic duty was his birthright. His childhood was a comfortable mix of rainy afternoons in Powell's Books and hiking trips along the Columbia River Gorge. He was observant and empathetic, the kind of kid who worried about the larger world beyond his neighborhood.\n\nHe chose the University of Washington for his undergraduate studies, pursuing a degree in International Relations. It was a junior year study abroad program in a small, rural community in Guatemala that acted as the catalyst for his future. For six months, he witnessed firsthand the immense gap between good intentions and effective healthcare delivery. He saw dedicated local doctors working with scant supplies and international aid efforts tangled in bureaucratic red tape. The experience ignited a passion not just to help, but to organize and facilitate. He returned to Seattle with a new focus, adding a Public Health minor to his degree.\n\nAfter graduation, San Francisco was a logical next step. It was a hub for the global health non-profits that bridged the gap between Silicon Valley philanthropy and on-the-ground needs. He landed a job as a Program Coordinator, a perfect fit for his meticulous nature and passion. His 0.0-mile commute is a function of his work-from-home status, his small apartment in the Mission District doubling as his office.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm of early morning runs through a still-sleepy Dolores Park, grabbing a cortado from a local cafe, and then logging on to coordinate logistics for medical teams in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. He lives with two roommates\u2014a UX designer and a musician\u2014and their lives are a constant, friendly collision of different worlds. Evenings are for unwinding at Mission Cliffs climbing gym or exploring the neighborhood's taquerias. Noah yearns to eventually move into field management, to be the person on the ground closing the gaps he once observed as a student. He hopes to build a life in San Francisco that feels permanent, transforming his transient existence into a deeply rooted one, all while making the world beyond his apartment a healthier place."
