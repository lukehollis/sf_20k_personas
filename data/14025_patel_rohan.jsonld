The only son of pragmatic Gujarati immigrants who settled in Fremont, his childhood was defined by a loving but strict focus on tangible success. His father, a software engineer, and his mother, a lab technician, envisioned a future for him in medicine or tech. Rohan, however, was an observant, empathetic child, more interested in the \"why\" behind his classmates' struggles than in calculus. He saw the silent burdens carried by other first-generation kids and felt a pull to understand, not just to achieve.\n\nThe definitive turning point was his volunteer work at a teen crisis hotline during his undergraduate years at UC Santa Cruz. The raw, unfiltered stories of adolescent anxiety, family conflict, and identity confusion resonated deeply. It was there he found his calling, a path that led him to defy his parents' wishes and pursue a Master's in Social Work at San Francisco State University. The initial disappointment from his family was a heavy weight, but it solidified his resolve. He became an LCSW, finding his niche within the San Francisco Unified School District, a world away from the lucrative tech sector his parents had hoped for.\n\nNow 37, Rohan lives a life of purpose. His day begins in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its foggy tranquility and access to Golden Gate Park. His 4.8-mile commute on the Muni N-Judah is his sanctuary\u2014a time for a mental health podcast and observing the city's diverse mosaic of residents. At the public high school where he works, he is a crucial anchor for students navigating everything from academic pressure to housing instability.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and fellow public service workers. Weekends are for hiking Mount Sutro, exploring hole-in-the-wall dim sum places, and infrequent, often frustrating, forays into the city\u2019s dating scene. Though his income of $105,000 requires careful budgeting in an expensive city, he feels wealthier than many of his tech-worker peers. His parents, having witnessed the profound impact he has on young lives, are now his biggest supporters. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a promotion, but to one day open a small group practice focused on providing affordable mental healthcare for immigrant families, bridging the very cultural and emotional gaps he navigated himself."

Rohan didn't just hear the words; he felt them in his own bones. In that shared silence across the phone line, his path illuminated. It wasn\u2019t about fixing problems, but about sitting with someone in their darkness. That call, at 20, was the moment his internal compass locked into place, pointing him away from his parents\u2019 dreams and directly toward his own purpose.\n\n2.\nThe memory of his father\u2019s face across the Fremont dining room table is still sharp. Rohan had just said the words \u201cMaster of Social Work.\u201d He saw not anger, but a deep, quiet disappointment\u2014a look that said he was throwing away their sacrifice. The weight of it was crushing, but beneath it, a new, unyielding resolve hardened within him. At 22, in that moment of profound parental disillusionment, he learned to stand on his own, his convictions becoming the foundation he would build his life upon.\n\n3.\nIt was the meeting with Maya\u2019s parents, immigrants who viewed his role with suspicion. He spent an hour not using clinical jargon, but simply listening to their fears, speaking a little of their shared language of expectation and hope. When the father finally nodded, a flicker of trust in his eyes, Rohan felt a success more profound than any stock option. At 32, that single parental nod was confirmation that he was building the exact bridge he had always dreamed of crossing himself.\n\n4.\nLast year, a student who hadn't spoken in his office for weeks finally looked up from his phone. He quietly admitted he wasn\u2019t sleeping because his family was about to be evicted. Rohan remembers the stillness of the room as the confession hung in the air. He connected them with the district\u2019s housing liaison that afternoon. The raw, tangible impact of that one conversation\u2014the feeling of being a lifeline\u2014is the currency he measures his life in. It\u2019s the memory that makes his modest Inner Richmond rent feel entirely worthwhile.\n\n5.\nHe often thinks of a foggy Tuesday morning on the N-Judah, around age 36. He was nestled by the window, watching the diverse faces of the city blur past, his podcast a low murmur in his ears. There was no grand event, just a sudden, overwhelming feeling of being exactly where he belonged. A social worker, on a public train, heading to a public school, a quiet and essential part of the city\u2019s complex, breathing ecosystem. In that simple commute, he felt a deep and abiding peace."
