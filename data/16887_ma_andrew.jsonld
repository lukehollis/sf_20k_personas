He was raised in the fog-shrouded avenues of the Outer Sunset, the only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Noriega Street. His childhood was a study in contrasts\u2014stacking produce and working the register after school, then retreating to his room to meticulously sketch cityscapes and product designs. His parents, valuing stability above all, hoped he\u2019d pursue business or engineering, but Andrew\u2019s heart was in form and aesthetics.\n\nBucking expectations, he enrolled at the California College of the Arts, immersing himself in a world his parents found frivolous. After earning his MFA in Design, he faced the harsh reality of being an artist in one of the world's most expensive cities. He spent his late twenties working for a small, idealistic design studio, loving the creative freedom but constantly stressed about rent. The turning point came at 31, when a major retail brand, impressed by his portfolio, offered him an entry-level visual merchandising role. It felt like selling out, but the steady paycheck was a siren song he couldn't ignore.\n\nTo his surprise, Andrew excelled. He discovered a talent for translating artistic concepts into commercial success, using his MFA training to craft compelling retail experiences. He climbed the corporate ladder steadily, finding a lucrative niche where his design sense was a powerful asset.\n\nNow 44 and a Director of Merchandising, Andrew lives a life of curated comfort in Hayes Valley with his partner, a landscape architect. His 3.5-mile bicycle commute downtown is a cherished daily ritual, a moment of kinetic peace before the high-stakes pressure of his job. His days are a blur of spreadsheets and strategy meetings, but his evenings are sacred\u2014spent cooking, visiting galleries, or sketching ideas in his notebook. His home is a testament to his design philosophy: minimalist, functional, and deeply personal.\n\nThough successful, a quiet creative restlessness remains. Andrew\u2019s ultimate dream is to leave the corporate world behind and open a small, beautifully curated home goods and design store with his partner\u2014a venture that would finally unite his parents\u2019 entrepreneurial grit with his own unwavering passion for design."

He was twelve, methodically building a perfect pyramid of them in his parents\u2019 Noriega Street store. While his body performed the ritual of family duty, his mind was redesigning the store\u2019s crude, hand-painted sign. On a discarded receipt, he secretly sketched a new logo\u2014a clean, perfect apple. It was a silent rebellion, teaching him that beauty could be a quiet escape from a pragmatic world, a personal act of creation amidst the mundane.\n\n2.\nTelling his parents he\u2019d chosen CCA over a business degree felt like a betrayal. They sat at the small kitchen table, the air thick with the aroma of their dinner and profound disappointment. His mother\u2019s silence was heavier than his father\u2019s strained questions about \"making a living.\" Looking at the worn linoleum floor, Andrew felt a chasm open between their world of stability and his yearning for form. In defending his choice, he learned that creating his own life would sometimes mean breaking their hearts.\n\n3.\nThe corporate job offer glowed on his laptop screen at 2 AM in his cramped studio. The salary was a number he could barely comprehend; it meant an end to the gnawing anxiety of rent. But clicking \"accept\" felt like a quiet surrender, not a victory. There was no celebration, just the immense, hollow relief of giving in. That night, staring out at the city lights, he grieved for the idealist he was leaving behind. It was a foundational lesson in the brutal compromises of adulthood.\n\n4.\nHe stood across the street from the downtown flagship, watching shoppers interact with a display he designed. It wasn't just products on shelves; it was a narrative told through light, texture, and negative space. He saw a woman pause, captivated by the composition. In that moment, the shame of \"selling out\" dissolved into a quiet pride. He realized his MFA wasn't wasted; it was a secret weapon. He wasn't a failed artist but a translator, turning the language of beauty into commercial success.\n\n5.\nCycling home over the Wiggle one evening, the setting sun casting long shadows, the disparate parts of his life clicked into place. The rhythm of his pedaling felt like the hum of the old grocery store coolers; the curated storefronts of Hayes Valley echoed his own sketches. He suddenly envisioned it with perfect clarity: a small shop, his partner arranging plants in the window, him stocking shelves with beautifully designed objects. It wasn't a fantasy, but a destination. The final design project, uniting his parents\u2019 hustle with his own heart."
