They instilled in him a powerful sense of resilience and a responsibility to uplift those around him. His childhood was a tapestry of block parties, spirited debates at the dinner table, and firsthand lessons in the systemic inequities that shaped his neighborhood.\n\nCollege at UC Davis initially pointed him toward a more lucrative corporate path, but a summer internship at a youth center in Sacramento changed his trajectory. He saw himself in the teens he mentored\u2014bright kids navigating immense challenges with little support. That experience was a turning point. He abandoned his business minor, completed his sociology degree, and enrolled at San Francisco State University to earn a Master of Social Work, determined to build systems of support rather than just climb a career ladder.\n\nFor the past eight years, Malik has lived in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his modern work life; as a Program Manager for a non-profit focused on educational equity, he manages outreach, writes grants, and coordinates mentorship programs from his sunny, book-filled apartment. His days are a disciplined mix of Zoom calls and deep-focus work, punctuated by long runs in Golden Gate Park, which he considers his backyard.\n\nMalik\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of former classmates and colleagues who share his values. They gather for dim sum on Clement Street or low-key game nights rather than hitting the trendy downtown bars. While he loves San Francisco\u2019s energy and diversity, he is deeply aware of its contradictions, seeing the city\u2019s staggering wealth and profound poverty as a call to action. His aspiration isn\u2019t a corner office but to see his program expand city-wide, creating a tangible legacy of opportunity. He hopes to one day build a family grounded in the same principles of community and care that he champions in his work every day."
