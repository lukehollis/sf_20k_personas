The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a meticulous dry-cleaning business in Fremont, she was raised on the quiet hum of pressing machines and the values of tireless work and precision. Growing up in the shadow of Silicon Valley, she was surrounded by a relentless focus on engineering and code, but her heart was always drawn to stories and the human connections that powered them.\n\nDefying expectations, Sarah pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature at UC Berkeley. She lost herself in Victorian novels and modernist poetry, fascinated by how structure and narrative could shape emotion and understanding. After graduation, however, that passion felt untethered to a career path. She drifted through a series of administrative jobs, feeling disconnected until a temp agency placed her at a chaotic, 20-person tech startup in SoMa. It was a turning point. While the engineers built the product, Sarah built the company\u2019s culture. She organized logistics, mediated disputes, and created an environment where people felt seen and supported. She realized her English degree hadn't been impractical; it had trained her to read people and orchestrate a coherent, thriving community.\n\nNow 31, Sarah is the indispensable Office Manager for a mid-sized software company. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her success in making remote work seamless. Her apartment in Hayes Valley is both her office and her sanctuary, a neatly organized space filled with books and local art. Her days begin with a pour-over from a local cafe and a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green before diving into a world of Slack channels and virtual team-building.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She knows the baristas by name, has a membership at SFJAZZ, and spends weekends hiking in the Headlands with a close circle of friends. While content, she dreams of bridging her two passions: she envisions opening a creative consulting firm that helps tech companies build more human-centric cultures. More immediately, she hopes to buy a small condo, planting a permanent root in the city that finally allowed her to write her own story."
