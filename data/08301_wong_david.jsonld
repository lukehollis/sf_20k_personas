            "value": "David Wong is a cornerstone of his community, a man whose life is as interwoven with the streets of San Francisco as the fog is with the Golden Gate. Born in 1970, he grew up in the Outer Richmond, the son of a bustling Stockton Street restaurant cook and a quiet, diligent garment factory seamstress. His childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition at home and American ambition at school, defined by the scent of his mother\u2019s sewing machine oil and the savory steam from his father's kitchen. His parents, sacrificing everything for his future, envisioned a lucrative career for him\u2014a doctor or an engineer.\n\nInitially, David tried to follow that path, enrolling in pre-med at SF State. However, the turning point of his life arrived not in a classroom, but on the city's streets during the height of the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s. Witnessing the fear, the grief, and the incredible resilience of community-led organizations providing care when others looked away, David felt a profound shift. He realized his calling wasn't in treating individual ailments, but in healing the community itself. He abandoned his pre-med track and later earned a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley, focusing on urban health disparities.\n\nHis career was a steady climb from the ground up: a case worker in the Tenderloin, then a program manager for a youth outreach service, and for the past twelve years, the Community Health Director for a clinic on the border of Chinatown and North Beach. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a modest apartment above the clinic, his work and life seamlessly integrated.\n\nNow 54 and divorced for over a decade, David's days are filled with grant writing, staff meetings, and, most importantly, walking his neighborhood. He knows the grocers, the seniors playing mahjong in Portsmouth Square, and the young families struggling with rent. He isn't just a director; he's a neighbor. His hope isn't for retirement or riches, but for something far more fundamental: to secure stable funding for the clinic and to see the next generation of community leaders step up. David Wong\u2019s dream is to one day look out from his apartment window and see a community that is not just surviving, but thriving."
