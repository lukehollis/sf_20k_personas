Born in Kolkata, India, he was adopted at eight months old by Mark and Eleanor Miller, a kind, academic couple from Marin County. Raised in a loving home filled with books and intellectual curiosity, Rahul\u2019s upbringing was quintessentially Northern Californian. Yet, he always navigated a quiet, internal dissonance\u2014an Indian face in a predominantly white community, a soul connected to a homeland he couldn\u2019t remember.\n\nHis sharp, analytical mind led him to a degree in Symbolic Systems at Stanford, followed by a Master\u2019s in Human-Computer Interaction. He was fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and technology, a field that felt like a reflection of his own life: bridging disparate systems to create a functional whole. Rahul rode the first dot-com wave, experiencing the exhilarating highs and the humbling crash. The bust taught him a crucial lesson: value is built on substance, not hype. He pivoted from volatile startups to consulting, where his calm demeanor and deep expertise made him a sought-after strategist.\n\nThe key turning point came at 38. Prompted by his own gnawing curiosity and a trip organized for work, he visited India for the first time since infancy. He didn't find his birth parents or any neat answers. Instead, he found the sensory overload of Mumbai and the quiet history in Delhi to be profoundly grounding. He didn't find a missing piece of himself; he realized he was already whole, just more complex than he\u2019d allowed.\n\nNow 51, Rahul lives a life of curated tranquility in a restored Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a deliberate daily routine: a morning walk through the Panhandle, deep work sessions solving complex cloud infrastructure problems for his clients, and evenings spent cooking or reading. Following an amicable divorce a decade ago, his closest connection is his daughter, a junior at UCLA, with whom he shares a bond built on mutual respect and dry humor. He\u2019s a regular at his local wine shop and has a small, tight-knit circle of friends from different chapters of his life.\n\nHaving achieved professional success, Rahul\u2019s aspirations are now about legacy. He mentors young engineers of color and is considering angel investing in tech that prioritizes ethics over growth-at-all-costs. San Francisco is no longer just a backdrop for his career; it\u2019s his chosen home, a city whose own complex identity of innovation and history finally mirrors his own."

            "value": "1.\nAt nine, for \"Heritage Day,\" he stared at a map of India his father, Mark, had brought. While others had grandparents' recipes, he had a single dot: Kolkata. He felt the familiar sting of difference, but then Mark put a hand on his shoulder. \"A part of your story, not the whole book.\" The moment didn't erase the gap, but it filled it with love. It taught him that his identity wasn't about distant origins, but about who chose to stand beside him.\n\n2.\nHe was 29 when the dot-com bubble burst, standing in the silent, cavernous office of his failed startup. The ping-pong table was gone, only faint scuff marks on the floor. The air, once electric with promises of changing the world, felt stale and heavy. It wasn't just a financial loss; it was the death of a belief system. He walked out not bitter, but sobered, vowing to build his future on the solid foundation of substance, not the intoxicating ether of hype.\n\n3.\nAt 38, he stood on a street corner in Mumbai, the cacophony of horns, spices, and a thousand conversations washing over him. He had come seeking a missing piece. Instead, in that sensory deluge, he felt a profound sense of recognition\u2014not of a place, but of a rhythm within himself. He didn't find a lost home; he found a deeper, more complex version of the one he already inhabited. The search for a neat beginning ended, replaced by an acceptance of his own intricate design.\n\n4.\nLast year, visiting his daughter at UCLA, she confessed her anxiety about her major. He didn't offer advice. Instead, he told her about his first failed company, the silence of the empty office. \"The best thing I ever did was get it wrong,\" he said with a wry smile. He saw relief in her eyes\u2014not from a solution, but from the permission to be imperfect. It solidified their bond as a quiet space built not on guidance, but on mutual respect for life's messy drafts.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his morning walk, the fog rolled thick and low through the Panhandle. A tech worker on a scooter zipped past a woman practicing tai chi. The mix of old and new, frenetic and calm, felt like a perfect exhale. At 51, he realized San Francisco wasn't just his address; it was his analogue. A city constantly reconciling its history with its future. This daily ritual wasn't routine; it was a confirmation that he was, finally and completely, home."
