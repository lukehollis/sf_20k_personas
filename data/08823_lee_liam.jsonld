Raised in the Outer Sunset, he is the only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who poured their life savings and endless labor into a beloved neighborhood noodle shop. Liam grew up watching his parents\u2019 exhaustion, the quiet anxiety that flickered in their eyes during a slow week. He saw their love expressed not in words, but in the relentless pursuit of a stability they never had.\n\nThough his heart was in the sweeping narratives of the past, leading him to a Bachelor's in History from UC Davis, a pivotal moment redirected his future. During his senior year, he found his father hunched over a pile of receipts, his face etched with worry over a sudden rent hike. In that instant, Liam made a pact with himself: he would master the language of money, not for greed, but for security. He took online finance certifications, leveraging his sharp, analytical mind to land an entry-level job at a downtown firm.\n\nNow 29, Liam is a successful financial analyst whose commute is a ten-step walk from his bed to his desk in a sleek SoMa high-rise. His days are a disciplined cycle of market analysis, client reports, and virtual meetings, the city\u2019s skyline a silent backdrop. His social life is curated; a tight-knit group of college friends for weekend dinners in Hayes Valley and occasionally awkward, app-facilitated dates that rarely feel authentic. He is a native San Franciscan who feels like an expatriate in his own city, the familiar working-class neighborhoods of his youth feeling worlds away from the gleam of his current life.\n\nLiam\u2019s dream is twofold. On the surface, he aspires to become a senior portfolio manager. But a deeper ambition gnaws at him: to use his financial acumen to help small, family-run businesses like his parents\u2019\u2014to create a fund that offers them the security he has so meticulously built for himself. He hopes to one day close his laptop, walk out of his apartment, and find a connection to San Francisco that isn't just based on its economic pulse, but on the resilient, hopeful spirit he first learned in a small Sunset noodle shop."
