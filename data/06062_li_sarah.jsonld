The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the salty Pacific wind on her walk to school. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career like medicine, Sarah found her calling in the nature that bordered her urban life\u2014the rugged trails of Lands End and the sprawling expanse of Golden Gate Park. She spent weekends observing tidal pools at Ocean Beach, unknowingly laying the foundation for her future.\n\nHer academic path was a deliberate move towards this passion. After earning a B.S. in Environmental Science, she pursued a Master's in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. A pivotal moment came during a graduate internship where she analyzed the environmental impact reports for a major development project. She realized she could be a bridge between corporate necessity and ecological responsibility. This insight led her to environmental consulting, a field where her analytical mind could translate complex data into actionable policy.\n\nNow 32, Sarah lives in a bright, second-floor apartment in Cole Valley, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to the park and its village-like atmosphere. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to a sunlit desk overlooking the street. Her day starts with a run through the Panhandle, followed by hours of data analysis, client calls, and writing reports for companies navigating California\u2019s stringent environmental regulations. She lives with her long-term partner, Ben, a software architect whose tech-world stability complements her more mission-driven career.\n\nWhile she finds satisfaction in her work, Sarah dreams of moving beyond the corporate world. Her ultimate goal is to join a Bay Area environmental non-profit, working on tangible restoration projects in the very ecosystems that inspired her as a child. For Sarah, San Francisco is more than a home; it's the complex, beautiful organism she has dedicated her life to understanding and protecting, one data point at a time."
