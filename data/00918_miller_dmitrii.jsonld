            "value": "Dmitrii Miller is a man built from his parents' opposing blueprints. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, his childhood home was a place of creative chaos and quiet order. His mother, a Russian immigrant with a poet\u2019s soul, filled their small house with the smell of oil paints and the sound of classical music. His father, a third-generation San Franciscan carpenter, occupied the garage, a sanctuary of sawdust, precision, and the hum of power tools. Dmitrii inherited his mother's observational quietness and his father's practical hands.\n\nFormal education never clicked. While his peers studied for the SATs, Dmitrii was more interested in dismantling a broken toaster or learning how to patch drywall. Forgoing college, he drifted through a series of hands-on jobs: bike mechanic, stagehand for a small theater, and eventually, a handyman for a property management company. It was there, in the guts of old buildings, that he found his calling. He possessed an intuitive understanding of systems\u2014how water traveled, how electricity flowed, how a building breathed.\n\nThe turning point in his life was landing his current role. He is the live-in Facilities Coordinator for a large, mixed-use warehouse conversion in SoMa that houses a tech company and several residential lofts. His commute is a walk down two flights of stairs. Dmitrii is the building\u2019s ghost in the machine, the steady hand ensuring everything functions. His daily routine is a quiet patrol: checking the boiler in the morning, responding to maintenance tickets, coordinating with electricians and plumbers, and ending the day with a final security walk-through of the rooftop.\n\nHis social life is woven into the fabric of the building; he knows the names of every resident\u2019s dog and which office team always clogs the communal sink. He is a familiar, reliable presence, though few know him well. Relationships have been fleeting, often complicated by his rootedness and quiet nature. His dream is not one of grandeur, but of legacy. He saves meticulously, hoping one day to buy a small workshop of his own, a space to build furniture\u2014a tangible connection to the father he lost too young. Dmitrii\u2019s San Francisco isn't found in postcards, but in the hum of an HVAC unit and the satisfaction of a problem solved. He doesn\u2019t just live in the city; he keeps its heart beating."
