The daughter of a Pakistani literature professor and a Dutch-American architect, she grew up in a Berkeley home filled with books, blueprints, and spirited debates about form versus narrative. Her childhood was a blend of weekend trips to SFMOMA and evenings spent listening to her mother recite Rumi, instilling in her a deep appreciation for the power of objects and stories to convey meaning.\n\nHer educational path was a deliberate one. After an Art History degree from UCLA, Saskia pursued her Master's in Museum and Curatorial Studies on the East Coast, eager to understand the institution from the inside. However, she found the traditional museum world too slow, its pace ill-suited to her dynamic vision. A key turning point came during an internship where she helped design a pop-up exhibit for a biotech firm. She discovered a passion for a new kind of curation: translating complex, modern ideas into compelling public-facing installations.\n\nThis discovery shaped her career. As Director of Exhibitions for a prestigious San Francisco firm, she now creates immersive experiences for tech companies, science centers, and urban developers. Her work is a high-stakes blend of artistic integrity and corporate communication, a challenge she thrives on. Her 2.8-mile commute on the Muni from her chic, minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley to her SOMA office is a cherished ritual\u2014a time to observe the city\u2019s rhythm before her demanding day begins.\n\nNow 39, Saskia has a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of artists, chefs, and tech innovators, who she connects with over dinners at small, neighborhood restaurants. While professionally fulfilled, a new dream is taking shape: to one day open a small, independent gallery dedicated to West Coast mixed-race artists, a space that reflects the complex, beautiful identity she has so thoughtfully built for herself. It would be her most personal exhibition yet."

That evening, her mother recited Rumi: \u2018The wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u2019 Suddenly, the empty spaces in the design weren\u2019t voids but possibilities for stories to enter. It was the first time she understood a structure could have a soul. That fusion\u2014of blueprint and poetry, form and narrative\u2014became the bedrock of her entire worldview.\n\n2.\nAt 26, interning, she was given an impossible task: make gene-editing technology feel human for a pop-up exhibit. The museum playbook felt archaic. One frantic night, surrounded by dry data, she sketched a walkthrough where light patterns mimicked DNA strands, reacting to visitors' movements. It was alive, a story told without a single wall of text. The thrill of that breakthrough was electrifying. She realized her purpose wasn't to archive the past, but to choreograph the present, turning data into a dynamic public dance.\n\n3.\nOne rainy Tuesday in her mid-thirties, the F-Market streetcar shuddered to a halt. Trapped between the gleaming new towers of SOMA and the faded pastel Victorians of the Castro, she watched the city through a rain-streaked window. In that single frame, she saw its chaotic, beautiful, contradictory harmony. A profound sense of belonging washed over her. The commute wasn't a chore; it was her daily immersion, the quiet intake of breath before the creative exhale of her demanding work.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, a tech CEO dismissed her pitch for an interactive cloud-computing exhibit as \u2018too poetic.\u2019 He wanted data, sterile and clean. Taking a breath, Saskia didn\u2019t show him more numbers. She told him a story about her parents\u2014the architect and the poet\u2014and how true understanding lives at the intersection of form and feeling. She won the contract with her narrative. It was a fierce, affirming moment, proving her unique perspective wasn't a liability, but her most valuable asset.\n\n5.\nLast year, in a small Mission gallery, she saw a sculpture by a Japanese-Mexican artist: traditional silk cords woven around industrial rebar. In its tension and harmony, she felt a jolting shock of recognition\u2014her own identity in physical form. The fleeting thought she\u2019d always had\u2014'a space for us'\u2014crystallized into a non-negotiable future. The gallery wasn't just a dream anymore; it was the final, most personal story she knew she had to curate. A home for complex beauty."
