At 46, his commute is a thirty-second walk from his small staff apartment to the patient wing of the \u201cSunset Senior Care\u201d facility, a world away from the bustling city just outside its gates. The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small laundromat in the Richmond District, David grew up steeped in the values of hard work and filial piety. His parents poured their meager savings into his education, hoping he would transcend the grind of their own lives.\n\nHis initial path was different. David\u2019s Associate's degree, a detail he rarely shares, is in Graphic Design. He once dreamed of creating logos and art for Bay Area startups, a ghost of a different life that flickers when he sees a sleek ad on a passing bus. That dream dissolved in his mid-twenties when his mother suffered a debilitating stroke. David became her primary caregiver, a role that reshaped his world. The sterile scent of hospitals, the language of medications, and the quiet patience required to assist with daily tasks became his new reality. In navigating her care, he discovered an unexpected aptitude and a profound sense of purpose.\n\nAfter his mother passed away, the design world felt hollow. He enrolled in a Certified Medical Assistant program, trading Adobe Suite for phlebotomy kits. His career as a CMA has been steady, defined by compassion rather than ambition. He eventually took the live-in position at Sunset Senior Care, a practical choice that eased his financial burdens in an impossibly expensive city. His professional and personal lives merged.\n\nNow, David\u2019s days are a cycle of checking vitals, administering medications, and offering a comforting hand. His social connections are primarily with his elderly patients, whose stories have become a part of his own, and a few fellow night-shift colleagues. His hope is a simple, quiet one: to one day save enough for a down payment on a small condo in the Outer Sunset, a place of his own just blocks from where he grew up. He doesn't dream of fame or fortune anymore; he dreams of opening a window to feel the salty ocean breeze, a private moment of peace earned one compassionate shift at a time."
