Born in Portland to a restless history professor and a textile artist, her childhood was a peripatetic journey across the Pacific Northwest. While her parents thrived on change, Eleanor craved stillness. She found it in the stories held by objects: a box of her great-grandmother's letters discovered in a dusty attic, the faded tintype of an unknown relative. These artifacts were anchors in a constantly shifting world, sparking a lifelong fascination with preserving the past.\n\nThis passion led her to pursue a Master's in Art History, focusing on archival studies. She chose San Francisco for its vibrant, layered history and was immediately captivated. After graduation, a turning point arrived not in her career, but in her personal life. The amicable end of a decade-long relationship with a fellow academic\u2014a man who shared her father\u2019s wanderlust\u2014solidified her resolve. She would not chase a moving target; she would build a sanctuary.\n\nHer sanctuary became the Beauregard Foundation, a small, private museum in a historic Pacific Heights townhouse dedicated to a forgotten school of Bay Area impressionists. For twenty years, she has been its Senior Archivist. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down an internal flight of stairs from her rent-controlled apartment, a rare perk offered with the position.\n\nEleanor\u2019s days are spent in the climate-controlled silence of the archive, piecing together artistic legacies from letters, sketches, and canvases. Her social life is quiet but meaningful: a weekly dinner with a curator from SFMOMA, correspondence with her sister in Seattle, and a warm acquaintance with the owner of her local bookstore. She is a woman who chose stability over adventure, finding profundity in the specific. Her greatest aspiration is not to travel the world, but to finally publish the definitive catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the foundation's collection\u2014a quiet, monumental testament to a life spent ensuring that beautiful things are not forgotten."
