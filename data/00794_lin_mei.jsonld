The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she spent her childhood stacking cans and bagging produce in her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Clement Street. It was there, observing the quiet battles of their customers\u2014elders struggling with language barriers, families stretching every dollar\u2014that the seeds of her calling were planted. She saw the gaps in the system long before she knew the words to describe them.\n\nDriven by this innate sense of duty, Mei pursued a degree in psychology at San Francisco State University, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. She began her career in the chaotic corridors of UCSF Medical Center, providing crisis counseling to patients and their families. For twenty years, she navigated the raw, unfiltered tragedies of life and death, her calm presence a steadying force in the storm.\n\nA key turning point was a difficult divorce in her late thirties, which left her a single mother to her son, Daniel. The experience deepened her empathy but also fortified her independence. She found solace in her rent-controlled apartment, a sanctuary she has lived in for over two decades. The pandemic was another inflection point, shifting her entire practice to a telehealth model. Now, her commute is a ten-step walk to a small, dedicated office in her home. Her days are a series of faces on a screen, a digital window into the anxieties plaguing the city.\n\nHer current life is one of structured solitude. Mornings start with oolong tea and a walk through Golden Gate Park before her sessions begin. Evenings are for cooking, reading novels from Green Apple Books, and weekly video calls with Daniel, now a student at UC Santa Cruz. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few colleagues who understand the unique weight of their work.\n\nThough content, Mei yearns for a future with less vicarious trauma and more personal adventure. She dreams of traveling through Southeast Asia, not as a tourist, but as a slow-moving observer. She hopes to find a way to use her skills that feels less draining\u2014perhaps leading support groups for other caregivers. At 49, Mei Lin has spent a lifetime healing the fractures in other people\u2019s lives; her next chapter, she hopes, will be about making herself whole."
