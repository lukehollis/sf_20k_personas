Born and raised in a quiet Philadelphia suburb, the son of an accountant and a librarian, Julian\u2019s upbringing was one of studious predictability. He dutifully followed an academic path, earning a Master's in Comparative Literature from Brown University. It was there, however, amidst dusty post-structuralist texts, that his true passion ignited. He spent more time directing visceral, experimental student plays than he did on his thesis, discovering a language in staging and performance that felt more truthful than any academic paper.\n\nHe abandoned the idea of a PhD and, in the late 2000s, moved to San Francisco, drawn by its legacy of avant-garde art. His early years were a blur of barista jobs, shared rooms, and fringe festival shows staged in warehouse spaces. The turning point came a decade ago when he and a small collective leased a dilapidated storefront, pouring their life savings and sweat into creating The Alembic Theatre, a 50-seat black box with a small loft apartment for him on the second floor. This unified his life and work, shrinking his commute to a single flight of stairs.\n\nJulian\u2019s current life is a cycle of creation. Mornings are for coffee and script analysis, afternoons for blocking and rehearsals, and evenings for performances that challenge and provoke his small but loyal audience. His personal relationships are often intense but secondary to the theater, which he refers to as his most demanding and rewarding partner. His true family is his core group of collaborators\u2014the lighting designer, stage manager, and actors who share his vision and his precarious financial existence.\n\nHe feels like a holdout from another era, a guardian of the Mission's artistic soul against the encroaching tide of tech homogeneity. His greatest fear is losing the theater to a rent hike. His deepest aspiration isn\u2019t Broadway fame, but simply to secure enough funding to keep the lights on, to continue creating work that matters in the city he loves, and to ensure that within the walls of The Alembic, art remains an essential, breathing part of San Francisco."
