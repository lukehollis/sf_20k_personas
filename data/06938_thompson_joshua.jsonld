Raised in a sterile, academic household in Sacramento, his parents\u2014a history professor and a lawyer\u2014mapped out a future for him that led straight through a prestigious university to a respectable career. Joshua, however, was always more interested in the sensory world; the earthy smell of his grandmother\u2019s garden, the texture of her sourdough starter, the vibrant color of a perfect heirloom tomato.\n\nHe dutifully enrolled at UC Davis, majoring in economics, but found his soul suffocated by theory. His escape was a part-time line cook job at a local bistro. There, amidst the chaotic symphony of clattering pans, searing heat, and intense pressure, he found his calling. The kitchen was a crucible where raw ingredients were transformed into something beautiful and visceral. After two years, he dropped out of college, severing financial ties with his disappointed parents and throwing himself entirely into the culinary world.\n\nHe worked his way through demanding kitchens in Napa before landing in San Francisco, drawn by its reputation for culinary innovation. It was here, at a small gallery opening, that he met his future business partner, a ceramic artist named Anya. They discovered a shared philosophy: that a meal could be as transformative and ephemeral as any performance art.\n\nToday, Joshua is the Executive Chef and partner at \"Forma,\" their celebrated restaurant-gallery in Hayes Valley. He lives in a minimalist loft directly above the space, his commute a single flight of stairs. His days are a blur of sourcing from local farms, obsessively developing menus that change with the gallery\u2019s installations, and leading his kitchen team with quiet intensity. His life is his work, a complete immersion. He dreams of earning a Michelin star, not for his ego, but as the ultimate validation of his philosophy. More privately, he hopes his parents will one day dine at Forma and finally understand that he didn't abandon their world for nothing\u2014he simply built his own."
