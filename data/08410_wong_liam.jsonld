Raised in the foggy Inner Richmond, his parents ran a small, beloved Chinese bakery, their days dictated by the pre-dawn glow of an oven. Liam grew up behind the counter, a quiet observer of the neighborhood\u2019s rhythms. While he respected his parents' tireless dedication, the tangible, flour-dusted world of their work felt distant from the digital landscapes that captivated him.\n\nHe chose to study Psychology at UC Davis, fascinated by the \"why\" behind human behavior rather than the \"what.\" After graduating, he felt adrift. A psychology degree didn't offer a clear path, and the thought of more schooling felt exhausting. He took a temp job doing entry-level customer support at a burgeoning tech startup to pay the bills. It was there he had his epiphany. He saw the raw data on user behavior\u2014click patterns, session times, drop-off points\u2014and realized it was a story waiting to be told. His psychology background gave him a unique lens to interpret the numbers, to see the human motivations driving them.\n\nFueled by this new purpose, Liam taught himself SQL and Python in his off-hours, quickly transitioning from support to a junior analyst role. Now, at 27, he is a skilled data analyst for a major tech firm. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is a tight, vibrant five-block radius in the Mission District. His day begins with a pour-over from a local cafe, followed by hours of wrangling data and building dashboards from his sunny apartment. Lunch is almost always a burrito from his favorite taqueria, and he breaks up the afternoon with a walk through Dolores Park.\n\nHis social life is anchored by his bouldering group, a tight-knit crew he meets at Dogpatch Boulders three times a week. It\u2019s a necessary physical counterpoint to his cerebral work. Liam dreams of eventually leveraging his skills for social good, perhaps analyzing data for a climate-focused non-profit or a city planning initiative. He\u2019s proud of the comfortable life he\u2019s built, but he still searches for the kind of tangible impact his parents achieved with every loaf of bread they sold."
