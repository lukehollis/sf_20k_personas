Growing up near Fresno, the daughter of a pragmatic almond farmer and a schoolteacher, she witnessed the delicate, often brutal, dance between agriculture, water rights, and nature. While she loved the land, she saw its limits being tested. This tension propelled her to UC Santa Cruz, where she immersed herself in ecological studies, trading dusty orchards for misty redwood groves. It was there her passion was codified into purpose.\n\nHer ambition led her to a Master's in Environmental Policy and Management from UC Berkeley, which cemented her place in the Bay Area. Maeve\u2019s early career at a large consulting firm was disillusioning; she spent more time helping corporations navigate loopholes than fostering genuine change, a practice she privately termed \u201ccompliance-washing.\u201d A major turning point came at 29 when she ended a long-term relationship with a partner in finance and quit her job in the same month. It was a terrifying, liberating shedding of a life that wasn't truly hers. She used her savings to launch her own freelance consultancy.\n\nNow, Maeve\u2019s life is defined by a ten-block radius in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to the standing desk in her living room, overlooking a foggy street. Her days are a disciplined mix of client calls, environmental impact reports, and walks through Golden Gate Park, her sprawling backyard. She knows the baristas at her local coffee shop by name and has a standing Thursday night trivia date with a tight-knit group of friends from her Berkeley days.\n\nThough professionally successful, Maeve feels a pull toward more tangible work. She dreams of moving beyond policy and reports to a hands-on a role, perhaps with a land trust or an urban greening initiative. Her ultimate aspiration is to see a project she designed\u2014a bioswale system, a community garden on a neglected lot\u2014come to life in her own city. For Maeve, San Francisco is not just a home; it's the ecosystem she is determined to help thrive."
