Raised in Daly City, her life revolved around her parents\u2019 small, beloved Korean restaurant, a place where she learned the rhythms of hospitality not by choice, but by necessity. From the age of twelve, her afternoons were spent refilling water glasses and taking orders, absorbing the controlled chaos of the dinner rush. She saw the restaurant as both a legacy and a cage.\n\nHer escape was a brief, uninspired stint studying communications at a state college. However, her father\u2019s sudden health decline pulled her back into the family business, not as a helper, but as its operational backbone. The sterile theories of her textbooks paled in comparison to the tangible satisfaction of managing inventory, placating a difficult customer, or orchestrating a perfectly timed service. She discovered a surprising talent for the industry she had tried to flee.\n\nThe turning point came at 28. A renowned chef, a regular at her parents' restaurant, offered her the manager position at his ambitious new project in San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley. It was a terrifying leap\u2014leaving the safety of her family\u2019s established world for the high-stakes, high-pressure fine dining scene. She accepted.\n\nNow, at 32, Mina\u2019s life is the restaurant. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a small, modern apartment directly above the establishment. Her days begin before dawn, accepting produce deliveries, and end long after the last table has paid, sharing a staff meal with her crew. Her social life is intertwined with her work\u2014friendships forged with chefs over new menu ideas and strained conversations with her parents who worry she works too hard.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal, confined to the few blocks around her home and work. She knows the barista at the corner caf\u00e9 by name and finds solace on quiet mornings in Patricia's Green. Her dream, simmering beneath the surface of daily exhaustion, is to one day open her own place. Not a replica of her parents' restaurant, but something new: a fusion of her inherited Korean culinary soul and the polished, innovative spirit of her adopted city."
