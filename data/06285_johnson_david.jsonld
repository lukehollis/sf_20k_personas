Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants, his upbringing was steeped in the scent of cardboard boxes and the chime of the bell on the door of \"Johnson's Sundries,\" the corner store his parents poured their life savings into. They chose an anglicized name for their son, hoping it would smooth his path. The family lived in the small two-bedroom apartment directly above the shop, a life of constant work where family and business were inseparable.\n\nHis educational journey ended abruptly. A diligent, if not stellar, student at a nearby public high school, David had vague plans for City College, perhaps studying business. The turning point came a month after his graduation ceremony. His father, worn down from decades of 14-hour days, suffered a serious health issue that forced him into semi-retirement. Without a second thought, David shelved his college applications and stepped fully into his role at the store. It wasn't a choice he agonized over; it was simply what a son did. He learned inventory, managed vendors, and mastered the art of stocking shelves\u2014a trade school education taught by necessity.\n\nNow, at thirty, David is the Assistant Manager in name but the de facto manager in practice. His commute is a single flight of stairs. His day starts before the fog burns off, accepting deliveries and preparing the store. He knows his customers by name\u2014the elderly Mrs. Chen who buys her preferred brand of tea, the group of surfers grabbing snacks after a session at Ocean Beach. His social life is limited; past relationships have fizzled, unable to compete with the store's relentless demands.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profoundly hyperlocal. He rarely ventures downtown, seeing the city not as a hub of tech and tourism, but as a mosaic of familiar faces and routines. His quiet dream is to travel. Tucked away in his closet is a shoebox full of travel magazines showcasing places like Kyoto and Patagonia. He hopes one day to run the store efficiently enough to take a real vacation, to see a world beyond the four corners of his block. Until then, he remains the steadfast, reliable heart of his small neighborhood, a quiet anchor in a city of constant change."
