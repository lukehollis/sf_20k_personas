            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is the quiet guardian of Golden Gate Elementary, a constant, unobtrusive presence who knows the school\u2019s rhythms better than anyone. His home is a small caretaker's apartment tucked behind the gymnasium, making his commute a simple walk across the basketball court. For Kenji, the school isn't just a job; it's his entire world.\n\nBorn and raised in the Richmond District, Kenji was the son of Japanese-American parents who ran a beloved neighborhood nursery. His childhood was filled with the scent of damp earth and blooming flowers. While he graduated from high school, his true passion was drawing. He spent two years at City College, honing his skills in illustration, dreaming of a life as a graphic artist. That dream was cut short when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. At 21, Kenji dropped out of college to run the family nursery, trading his sketchbook for ledgers and his artistic ambitions for filial duty.\n\nFor over a decade, he kept the business afloat, but the rise of big-box stores and changing neighborhood demographics slowly choked its viability. After selling the property, a middle-aged Kenji found himself adrift. A friend mentioned the custodian opening at the school, which came with the rare perk of housing\u2014an essential for staying in the city he called home. He took the job out of necessity, but over the years, found an unexpected purpose in it.\n\nKenji is a familiar face but a private man. A long-ago relationship with a fellow art student faded when their life paths diverged, and he never married. His connections now are the brief, friendly nods with teachers in the morning and the chorus of \"Hi, Mr. Kenji!\" from students. He finds satisfaction in the gleaming hallway floors, the impeccably clean classrooms, and the small garden he voluntarily tends near the entrance\u2014a nod to his family's past.\n\nHis hopes are now small, tangible things. He dreams of seeing the old oak tree on the playground survive another generation and aspires to maybe start a small gardening club for the students. In the evenings, after the last child has gone home and the school is silent, Kenji sometimes sits at his small kitchen table and sketches the quiet, empty playground from his window, a man who found his canvas not in a studio, but in the humble, everyday life of his corner of San Francisco."
