His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his second-floor apartment down to \u201cClement Curios,\u201d the well-ordered retail store he manages and owns. The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a bustling, chaotic grocery store on the same street, David\u2019s upbringing was a symphony of produce trucks, the clatter of the abacus, and the unspoken expectation that he would achieve a more prestigious, \"American\" success.\n\nHe tried. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, losing himself in the narratives of the past and earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History. He dreamed of becoming a museum curator, of spending his days among artifacts and quiet archives. But life intervened. His father\u2019s health declined sharply during his senior year, pulling David back into the family business. He learned inventory, managed suppliers, and discovered an unexpected talent for customer service, his calm demeanor a soothing counterpoint to his father's gruff efficiency.\n\nThe key turning point came after his father passed away. Instead of selling the storefront, David chose to honor his family\u2019s legacy by reshaping it. He closed the grocery and spent a year renovating, creating a curated sanctuary of artisanal home goods, local art, and unique stationery. He built the business he wanted, one that blended his historical appreciation for craft with modern aesthetics.\n\nNow, at 42, David\u2019s life is one of quiet rhythm. He knows the names of the delivery drivers, chats with the woman who runs the bakery next door, and considers his regulars to be his extended family. He is single, a status he finds both peaceful and, on occasion, lonely. His dream of curating a museum has been sublimated into the careful arrangement of his shop displays. His future aspirations are modest: to one day travel to the historical sites in Italy and Greece he only studied in books, and perhaps to find a partner who appreciates the small, beautiful world he has built for himself on Clement Street."
