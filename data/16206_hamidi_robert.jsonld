            "value": "Robert Hamidi is a man shaped by the subtle textures of the past. The son of an Iranian architect who fled the revolution and a pragmatic librarian from Ohio, Robert was raised in Berkeley. His childhood was a quiet tapestry woven from his father\u2019s nostalgic tales of Isfahan and his mother's love for the tangible history within library books. From his father, he inherited a reverence for intricate craftsmanship; from his mother, a methodical patience.\n\nHis path seemed academic at first. He pursued an Art History degree at UC Santa Cruz, enjoying the theory but feeling a disconnect from the objects themselves. The turning point came during a summer job at a dusty Oakland furniture repair shop. The moment he first held a splintered, 19th-century rosewood chair, he felt a jolt of purpose. He wasn't meant to write about history; he was meant to hold it, mend it, and preserve its story for the future. He pivoted, seeking apprenticeships with master restorers and learning the delicate arts of joinery, French polishing, and gilding.\n\nIn his late twenties, he moved to San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s rich, often-overlooked architectural history. He established a small workshop, first in the Mission and now in a larger, light-filled space in Dogpatch. His life is one of quiet deliberation. His 3.8-mile Muni ride from his Inner Richmond apartment is a daily ritual, a time for observing the city\u2019s present before immersing himself in its past. Having amicably ended a long-term relationship a decade ago, he finds his deepest connections in his work. His social circle is small and loyal, consisting of a few fellow artisans and trusted antique dealers.\n\nNow 52, Robert is a custodian of memories. He doesn't dream of wealth, but of legacy. His quiet aspiration is to be entrusted with restoring a piece of iconic San Francisco history\u2014a bench from the original Cliff House, perhaps, or a fixture from an old Barbary Coast saloon. More than anything, he hopes to one day find a dedicated apprentice, someone to whom he can pass on not just the skills, but the profound respect for the stories that live within wood and varnish."

It wasn't a gift, but a lesson. \"Each piece of wood, a different story,\" his father whispered, tracing the geometric patterns. Robert felt the seamless joints, the patient artistry. It wasn't just a box; it was a fragment of Isfahan he could hold. That day, he learned that history had texture, a tangible weight you could feel in your palms, a lesson his mother's books could only describe.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, the summer he abandoned art history without knowing it. The Oakland workshop owner handed him a splintered 19th-century chair. As his fingers traced the dry, cracked rosewood, a jolt went through him. It wasn't an artifact behind glass; it was a patient asking for help. The scent of old varnish, the heft of its history\u2014it was more real than any slide projection. In that instant, his future clicked into place. He wasn't meant to study history, but to save it.\n\n3.\nHe was 28, his first year in the Mission. The workshop was cold, smelling of solvent and ambition. A client brought him a small writing desk, its veneer blistered from a long-ago fire. For weeks, he worked, patching, sanding, polishing until the grain glowed again. The moment he applied the final coat of shellac, he didn\u2019t see a restored desk. He saw proof. Proof that he hadn't made a mistake, that he could build a life with his own two hands, one rescued memory at a time.\n\n4.\nHe was 42. After he and Eleanor packed her last box, the silence in the apartment was deafening. He walked for hours in Golden Gate Park, watching the fog consume the cypress trees. There was no anger, just a hollow ache. The next morning in his workshop, he began restoring a damaged cedar chest. Mending its fractured joinery felt like mending himself. He realized then that his truest, most enduring partnerships would always be with the splintered, silent storytellers entrusted to his care.\n\n5.\nJust last year, standing in his sunlit Dogpatch workshop, he caught his reflection in the deep, flawless finish of a restored mahogany tabletop. For a second, he saw not himself at 51, but the ghost of his father. He looked at his own hands, steady and knowing, and felt the weight of three decades of skill. A quiet panic bloomed in his chest\u2014not of mortality, but of silence. This knowledge couldn't end with him. The desire for an apprentice became more than a wish; it became his next restoration project."
