Growing up in Oakland, her world was shaped by the rhythms of the city, a perspective instilled by her father, a career AC Transit bus driver, and her mother, a high school history teacher. Dinner table conversations weren't just about homework; they were about union negotiations, city council decisions, and the way a rerouted bus line could either connect a community or isolate it. This upbringing planted a seed: systems, when managed with care, could be a powerful force for equity.\n\nAfter earning her bachelor\u2019s at UC Berkeley, Chava pursued a Master of Public Administration at San Francisco State University. It was here that her path crystallized. For her final thesis project, she designed a pilot program to improve transit accessibility for senior citizens in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. Seeing her theoretical work translate into tangible, real-world improvements for residents was a profound turning point, solidifying her commitment to public service.\n\nNow 37, Chava is a Program Manager at the SFMTA, where she feels she is honoring her family\u2019s legacy. Her 1.8-mile commute from her Lower Haight apartment to her office near City Hall isn't just a trip; it's daily field research. Riding the N-Judah or the 7 bus, she observes passenger flow, notes delays, and mentally cross-references rider complaints with the operational data on her desk. She\u2019s currently leading a project to optimize routes in the Richmond District, balancing efficiency goals with community needs\u2014a complex puzzle she finds deeply rewarding.\n\nHer life isn\u2019t all policy briefs. Chava maintains a close-knit circle of friends from grad school and a local hiking group. Weekends often involve jogs through Golden Gate Park or exploring the city\u2019s culinary scene. She\u2019s single, having ended a long-term relationship two years ago, which has allowed her to pour energy into her career and community. Her aspiration is to eventually move into a director-level position at SFMTA, where she can shape policy on a larger scale. For Chava, a successful career isn't measured by her income, but by her contribution to a more functional and equitable San Francisco\u2014a city that moves for everyone."

She watched his hands on the huge steering wheel, the way he greeted regulars by name, the calm authority in his voice. It wasn\u2019t just a job; it was a public trust. That day, smelling the diesel and feeling the hydraulic hiss of the doors, she understood her father didn't just drive a bus\u2014he held a piece of the city together.\n\n2.\nAt 24, she stood on a corner in the Bayview, watching an elderly woman named Mrs. Gable use the new shuttle stop Chava had proposed in her thesis. The woman, leaning on her cane, gave Chava a small, tired smile. \"It's a straight shot to the market now, dear. Thank you.\" In that instant, the spreadsheets and policy memos evaporated, replaced by the profound, grounding weight of real-world impact. It was the moment she knew public service was the only path for her.\n\n3.\nIt was her first solo hike after the breakup, two years ago. Reaching the top of the Lands End trail, the city unfolded below, framed by the Golden Gate Bridge. The ache of loneliness was suddenly replaced by a quiet, fierce sense of ownership. This city, with its complex, humming network of streets and lives, was her partner now. The view wasn't just a vista; it was a vow to commit herself fully to her work, to her community, to this place.\n\n4.\nLast year, during a heated community meeting in the Richmond, a man shouted that her route optimization plan would kill his family's small bakery. For a second, Chava felt defensive, clutching her data. But looking at his face, she saw her own father worrying about a contract negotiation. She put down her notes and just listened. This moment cemented her core belief: efficiency is meaningless if it breaks the delicate threads that connect a neighborhood. It taught her to lead with empathy first, data second.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, her N-Judah stalled in the tunnel. Passengers groaned, but the operator\u2019s voice came over the intercom\u2014calm, clear, and reassuring. In his steady tone, Chava heard her dad. She saw the lineage not of blood, but of service\u2014a chain of people showing up every day to keep the city moving. It was a quiet, powerful reminder that her policy work was for them, the people who, like her father, turn the key and drive into the morning."
