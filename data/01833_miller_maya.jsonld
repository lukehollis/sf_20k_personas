She saw firsthand how a person\u2019s health was a tapestry woven from threads of access, education, and economic stability. While her parents\u2014a pragmatic engineer and a patient elementary school teacher\u2014provided a stable, loving home, it was her grandmother's quiet struggle that ignited Maya's sense of purpose.\n\nThis drive propelled her through her undergraduate studies and eventually to the West Coast for a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area was a revelation, a vibrant ecosystem of progressive ideals and technological disruption that felt worlds away from Ohio. After graduating, she dove into the healthcare sector, taking a data analyst role at a large San Francisco hospital system. She spent years in the trenches, translating raw data into reports that, she hoped, would inform better policy.\n\nThe turning point was the COVID-19 pandemic. As her role shifted to managing community outreach and vaccination programs, the abstract data on her screen became the faces of her neighbors. The work was grueling and emotionally draining, but it solidified her commitment. It also led to a system-wide shift to remote work, which Maya embraced.\n\nNow 39, Maya\u2019s commute is a zero-mile journey from her bedroom to the standing desk in her Inner Sunset apartment. Her days are a rhythm of Zoom meetings, data analysis, and grant writing, punctuated by the familiar drone of the N Judah streetcar. Life is quieter now. She has traded frantic office lunches for midday runs through the fog-dusted trails of Golden Gate Park. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and former colleagues, revolving around dinners in the Mission or weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deeply neighborhood-centric. She knows the baristas at her local coffee shop, frequents the Sunday farmers' market on 9th Avenue, and feels a fierce loyalty to her quiet, foggy corner of the city. Maya dreams of one day launching a smaller, hyper-local nonprofit focused on senior health navigation\u2014a way to bring her career full circle, honoring the memory of her grandmother by directly serving the community she now calls home."
