The child of a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a dreamy Spanish-American graphic designer, she grew up in a home where care and creativity were equally valued. Her defining influence was her younger brother, Leo, a quiet boy who struggled to articulate his anxieties. At twelve, Kaia discovered that a box of crayons and a stack of paper could unlock his world in ways words never could. She watched, fascinated, as he drew his fears into monsters and his joys into sprawling, colorful landscapes. This was the moment her calling took root.\n\nThis revelation guided her educational path, from a psychology degree at San Francisco State University to a specialized Master's in Counseling Psychology with an Art Therapy concentration. Now a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, Kaia's work is a mosaic of San Francisco's needs. She spends her mornings at a middle school in the Mission, helping adolescents navigate trauma through clay and paint, and her afternoons at a community health clinic, offering support to adults grappling with loss and depression. Her 3.8-mile commute on the Muni bus is a cherished ritual, a liminal space where she listens to podcasts and mentally transitions between the intense emotional worlds of her clients.\n\nCurrently residing in a cozy Inner Richmond apartment, Kaia lives a life of intentional balance. Weekends are for herself: losing track of time at a community ceramics studio, sketching in Golden Gate Park, and exploring the city\u2019s culinary scene with her partner, a data analyst she met at a volunteer event. Her close friends, mostly fellow therapists from her graduate cohort, provide an essential network of mutual understanding and support.\n\nKaia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of service. She sees the city not just as a hub of innovation, but as a community with deep-seated challenges she is uniquely equipped to address. Her dream is to eventually open her own non-profit, a sliding-scale art therapy studio dedicated to serving the city\u2019s most vulnerable youth. For Kaia, success isn\u2019t measured by her income, but by the number of people she can help find their own voice, one brushstroke at a time."

He picked up a black crayon and a jagged, many-eyed monster began to form. It wasn't a tantrum or tears; it was a conversation. For the first time, she wasn't just his older sister; she was his translator. In that small, scribbled monster, she found her life\u2019s calling: to help people draw their own fears into the light.\n\n2.\nIn her first practicum during her Master's, a non-verbal teenager sat with arms crossed, rigid against a lump of clay. For weeks, nothing. Kaia felt a flicker of professional doubt. Then, one Tuesday, the teen silently began pinching the clay, forming a small, lopsided bird with a broken wing. The air shifted. It was a fragile offering, a silent story. That small clay bird taught her that progress isn\u2019t linear, but a slow, patient unfolding. It\u2019s a touchstone for her when sessions feel stuck.\n\n3.\nShe remembers a specific Thursday, leaving the Mission clinic heavy with a client\u2019s grief. On the 38-Geary, she watched the city slide by through the rain-streaked window. The rumble of the bus was a grounding hum. Instead of a podcast, she just listened. By the time she stepped off into the Richmond fog, the weight had settled, transformed from a burden into a quiet ache of shared humanity. That ride taught her the sacred importance of the space between her work and her life.\n\n4.\nIt was a blustery Saturday at a tree-planting event in the Presidio. Her hands were caked with mud when she met him. He was a data analyst, talking about root systems with the same passion she reserved for the human psyche. He didn't try to solve her work; he simply respected the care she put into it. They shared a thermos of coffee, and she felt a sense of ease, a balance she hadn't realized she was seeking. It was a partnership beginning not with romance, but with shared purpose.\n\n5.\nLast month, at the community ceramics studio, she lost a whole Saturday afternoon at the wheel. Her mind, usually full of client stories and diagnostic codes, went blissfully quiet. There was only the wet spin of clay under her hands, the subtle pressure and release. When she finally looked up, blinking in the late afternoon light, a row of simple, imperfect bowls sat before her. It wasn't about the final product, but about the profound peace of making something just for herself. It was her own therapy."
