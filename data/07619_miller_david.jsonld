Raised in the suburbs of Chicago, the son of a pragmatic mechanic and a librarian, David\u2019s upbringing was grounded and methodical. He inherited his father\u2019s talent for fixing things and his mother\u2019s love for organizing information, a combination that led him to a Master's in Library and Information Science\u2014an unconventional path into technology.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in 1997, drawn by the magnetic pulse of the dot-com boom. His first job was a chaotic trial-by-fire at a startup that promised to revolutionize pet supplies. David thrived, building their internal networks from scratch. He also fell in love, marrying a graphic designer who shared his optimism. The subsequent dot-com crash was a brutal turning point. His company folded, and the financial and emotional strain fractured his marriage, ending in a quiet divorce. Humbled and professionally adrift, David learned a crucial lesson: hype is fleeting, but infrastructure is essential.\n\nHe rebuilt his career step-by-step, choosing stability over volatile startups. His reputation for calm competence saw him rise steadily through the ranks, eventually becoming an IT Director. Now 54, David manages a global team from the quiet of his meticulously organized apartment in the Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute offers a predictable rhythm: a morning walk to a local panaderia for coffee, followed by a day of video calls, cybersecurity audits, and strategic planning.\n\nA long-term resident, David has a deep, almost anthropological appreciation for his neighborhood, having watched it transform around him. He knows the best taquerias and can point out murals that pre-date the latest wave of gentrification. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly tech veterans like himself who share a gallows humor about industry buzzwords. His dream is no longer about a big payout but about mentorship. He hopes to guide younger engineers, imparting the wisdom of resilience he learned long ago, before eventually retiring to a life with less screen time and more time spent exploring the California coastline."
