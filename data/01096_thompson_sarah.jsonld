The daughter of a pragmatic engineer and a homemaker, she was the sensitive child who felt everything deeply. While her family provided stability, she longed for a language to process the complex emotions she observed around her. This search led her to major in psychology at Ohio State University.\n\nA volunteer stint at a women's shelter during college was her pivotal turning point, igniting a passion that overshadowed her practical upbringing. She pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, trading Midwestern predictability for the Bay Area's vibrant, progressive pulse in the early 2000s. Her early career was forged in the emotionally demanding halls of a major San Francisco hospital, where she earned her LCSW licensure supporting patients and families grappling with chronic illness and end-of-life decisions. The intensity honed her skills but also threatened burnout.\n\nThe city-wide shift to remote work during the pandemic proved to be an unexpected liberation. Sarah discovered telehealth not only offered patients more comfort and accessibility but gave her a sustainable pace. She transitioned into a fully remote role within a large healthcare network, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her bedroom to her serene home office in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHer days now follow a quiet rhythm: a morning walk in the fog of Golden Gate Park, a cup of green tea, and then hours of holding space for others through a screen. Though single after a long-term relationship ended five years ago, Sarah is far from lonely, anchored by a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow therapists and neighbors. Her connection to San Francisco isn't in its chaotic energy but in its pockets of peace: the murals along the Balmy Alley, the quiet stacks of the Green Apple bookstore, and the bracing wind at Ocean Beach. At 44, her ambition is not for more, but for deeper. She hopes to one day lead a small support group for fellow caregivers, finding contentment not in changing the world, but in helping one person at a time find their footing within it."
