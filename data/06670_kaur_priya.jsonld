Born in a small village in Punjab, India, she immigrated to Sacramento with her family at age six. Her father, a traditionalist, envisioned a stable future for her in accounting or administration. Priya\u2019s heart, however, belonged to her mother\u2019s kitchen, a vibrant world of cardamom, saffron, and jaggery, where she learned that food was a language of love and memory.\n\nTo appease her family, Priya earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration and spent her twenties in a soul-crushing office job. The turning point came on her 30th birthday. Staring at a bland store-bought cake, she realized she was living someone else's life. The next day, she quit and enrolled in a basic pastry course at a local community college, quickly surpassing her peers. Her true education came from working her way up from the bottom in demanding Bay Area kitchens, absorbing techniques with fierce determination.\n\nPriya moved to San Francisco a decade ago, drawn by its culinary innovation and artistic spirit. She found her niche not in a restaurant, but at the intersection of food and fine art. Today, she is the Executive Pastry Chef and owner of \"Artifex,\" a high-concept studio that creates edible installations and exquisite desserts for gallery openings, museum galas, and private art collectors.\n\nHer home and workplace are one and the same: a stunning, open-plan live/work loft in Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial past and creative present mirror her own journey. Her days begin before dawn, surrounded by gleaming stainless steel and the warm scent of baking. Her social circle consists of artists, curators, and gallery owners who have become both clients and friends. Though deeply fulfilled by her craft, Priya sometimes feels a quiet solitude. Her future aspiration isn't to expand her business, but to author a cookbook that is part memoir, part art piece, immortalizing the family recipes that first set her on this path. She dreams of sharing her story, proving that the most beautiful life is the one you design yourself."
