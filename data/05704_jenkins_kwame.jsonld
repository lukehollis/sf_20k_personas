Born Kenji Tanaka in Fukuoka, Japan, he was adopted as an infant by David and Imani Jenkins, a loving African American couple and prominent community activists in Oakland. Raised in a home filled with the sounds of jazz, the ideologies of social justice, and the comforting aromas of soul food, Kwame\u2019s identity was a complex tapestry from the start. His parents, wanting him to connect with his heritage, enrolled him in Japanese language classes and sought out cultural festivals, creating a unique upbringing that blended two powerful, distinct cultures.\n\nSchool was a challenge; Kwame never felt he fully belonged in any single group. He drifted academically, eventually finding his footing not in a traditional four-year university, but in the culinary arts program at City College of San Francisco. The kitchen was the one place where his dual identity became a strength, not a conflict. He earned his Associate's degree and began a grueling climb through the Bay Area's demanding restaurant scene, working as a line cook and sous chef, absorbing techniques from a dozen different culinary traditions.\n\nThe turning point came in his late thirties. Tired of cooking other people\u2019s food, Kwame risked everything to open his own restaurant, a venture that would finally tell his story. He secured a live/work loft in the arts-focused Dogpatch neighborhood. Downstairs is his restaurant, \"Umoja,\" a Swahili word for \"unity.\" Upstairs is his simple, quiet apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his life and his art are inseparable.\n\nAt Umoja, Kwame is the Executive Chef, creating a menu that is a direct reflection of his soul: ramen with a smoked turkey broth, collard green gyoza, matcha-dusted beignets. It is Japanese technique fused with the heart of Black American cooking. His days are a whirlwind of sourcing from local markets, mentoring his young, diverse staff\u2014who he considers his family\u2014and overseeing every plate that leaves his kitchen. He maintains a deep bond with his elderly parents, who are his biggest supporters. Kwame\u2019s dream isn't for Michelin stars, but to create a space where everyone, regardless of their background, feels a sense of belonging, celebrated for the beautiful, complex sum of their parts."
