            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is a product of San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, the son of a third-generation Japanese-American auto mechanic and a bookkeeper. Growing up, his world was one of tangible problems and practical solutions. His father\u2019s garage was his classroom, where he learned the language of engines and the virtue of a well-organized toolbox. He wasn\u2019t academically inclined; the abstract world of university lectures held little appeal compared to the satisfaction of fixing something broken with his own hands.\n\nFollowing this inclination, he eschewed a four-year college for a more direct path, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Facilities Engineering Technology from City College of San Francisco. His career was a steady, upward climb: from maintenance technician at a downtown hotel to overseeing a small commercial property. He was reliable, meticulous, and possessed an innate understanding of a building\u2019s complex anatomy.\n\nThe defining turn in Kenji\u2019s life came eight years ago with a difficult divorce that sold the Daly City home he\u2019d shared with his ex-wife. Facing the city\u2019s brutal housing market and seeking stability, he took a unique position: live-in Facilities Manager for The Cambrian Club, a century-old private arts institution in Nob Hill.\n\nHis commute is zero; his life is intertwined with the grand, aging building he manages. He lives in a modest, modern apartment tucked into the club's fourth floor. His days are a quiet rhythm of troubleshooting the ancient boiler, coordinating with restoration experts, and ensuring the opulent Gilded Age ballroom is perfect for evening events. He is the building's caretaker and its confidant, knowing its secrets from the sub-basement to the copper-domed roof.\n\nSocially, Kenji keeps a small, tight circle\u2014weekly dim sum with his aging parents in the Richmond and a monthly poker game with friends from high school. He is on polite, first-name terms with the club\u2019s wealthy members but maintains a professional distance. His dream is not of wealth, but of reclaiming a personal space. He saves diligently, hoping to one day buy a small condo in the Sunset, a place with a garage where he can finally restore the vintage motorcycle he has in storage. For now, he remains the quiet guardian of a piece of old San Francisco, a man who lives in the heart of the city but feels most at home in its hidden, mechanical soul."
