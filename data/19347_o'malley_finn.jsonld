The son of an SFFD firefighter and a public-school secretary, Finn grew up understanding the city not as a tech playground, but as a complex ecosystem of services and people. His childhood was filled with bike rides through Golden Gate Park and the rhythm of a family dedicated to public service.\n\nWhile his high school friends dreamed of startups, Finn felt a different pull. A pivotal moment came during a mandatory volunteer day, where his group cleaned up a neglected neighborhood parklet. Seeing the immediate, tangible impact of their work\u2014the gratitude from elderly residents, the space transformed\u2014ignited a purpose in him. Forsaking the debt and abstract theories of a four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco. The Associate's degree in Public Administration felt direct and useful, a blueprint for the city he wanted to help build.\n\nHis work ethic earned him an internship with the Department of Public Works, which seamlessly transitioned into his current role as a Program Assistant. Now, from his small Panhandle apartment, Finn begins each day with a 2.3-mile bike commute to City Hall, a ride that gives him a street-level view of the infrastructure projects he helps coordinate. He spends his days immersed in permits, community outreach emails, and the surprisingly intricate logistics of street tree planting initiatives.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of other San Francisco natives, a group that prefers brewery trivia nights in the Mission to exclusive rooftop bars. He has a steady girlfriend, Maya, whom he met at CCSF and who is now pursuing a master\u2019s in urban planning at SF State. Their dates often involve analyzing new bike lane installations or debating the merits of a proposed public space.\n\nFinn\u2019s ambition isn't to get rich; it's to become a project manager within the DPW. He dreams of overseeing a major park renovation or a new public transit corridor, leaving a lasting, positive mark on the city that raised him. He represents a new generation of San Franciscan: not a transplant seeking fortune, but a native digging in deeper, committed to making his home work for everyone."

His father, off-duty but always a firefighter, pointed to the Dutch windmills at the edge of Golden Gate Park. \u201cThey used to pump water for the whole park, Finn,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cSomeone had to build them, and someone has to keep them running.\u201d Finn didn\u2019t understand the mechanics, but he understood the lesson: the city was a living thing that needed constant care from dedicated people. It was the first time he saw infrastructure as a form of love.\n\n2.\nThe high school volunteer day was a blur of trash bags and apathy until an old woman in a second-story window watched him wrestle a thorny, overgrown bush from the parklet\u2019s soil. When the roots finally gave way, she gave a slow, deliberate clap from her window. In that small, quiet applause, the abstract chore of \u201ccommunity service\u201d became intensely personal. He wasn\u2019t just cleaning; he was restoring a piece of someone\u2019s view, their daily life. That feeling of direct, tangible impact set the course for his entire future.\n\n3.\nIt was a late night in the CCSF library. He and Maya were hunched over a transit proposal for a class project. \"This is a food desert,\" she'd said, tapping a neighborhood on the map. \"This new bus line won't just help commuters; it gives people access to a real grocery store.\" He saw it then\u2014she didn\u2019t just see routes and budgets; she saw people's lives. In that moment, he knew his practical obsession with how the city works wasn\u2019t strange; it was a shared language of caring.\n\n4.\nAfter six months of navigating permits and neighborhood complaints, he stood anonymously across the street and watched a DPW crew plant the very first street tree his paperwork had approved. It was just a spindly Ginkgo sapling on a quiet Inner Richmond block. As the crew tamped the soil around its base, he felt a powerful, almost ridiculous sense of pride. All the spreadsheets and emails had resulted in this: a living, breathing thing that would provide shade long after he was gone. It made the bureaucracy feel worthwhile.\n\n5.\nCycling to City Hall down the Panhandle path, he passed the new, protected bike lane on Masonic. He remembered the contentious community meetings and the dozens of outreach emails he\u2019d helped draft. Ahead of him, a father was teaching his young daughter to ride in the safety of the lane, her wobbles contained by the concrete barrier. Nobody knew Finn had played a small part in its creation. That beautiful anonymity was the whole point. His job wasn't to be seen, but to make the city safer for them."
