The only child of Indian immigrants\u2014a software engineer father and a data analyst mother\u2014her childhood was a carefully structured path toward a prestigious STEM career. She was bright and dutiful, but her quiet empathy often felt at odds with the logical world of Silicon Valley. While her parents envisioned \"Dr. Sharma,\" Sarah was the one listening to a friend\u2019s heartbreak for hours or volunteering at a senior center, finding more fulfillment in connection than in code.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year at UC Davis. Her grandmother, living with them during a prolonged illness, was supported by a hospital social worker who navigated the family\u2019s fear and confusion with profound grace. Witnessing this impact, Sarah saw her future clearly. Defying her parents' expectations was the most difficult decision of her life, but she enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley, trading a future of certainty for one of purpose.\n\nNow 33, Sarah is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major San Francisco healthcare network. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development; since the pandemic, her work has been entirely remote. Her small, serene apartment in the Inner Richmond, with a bay window overlooking a quiet street, doubles as her office. Her days are a series of intense telehealth sessions, guiding patients and their families through the emotional maelstrom of chronic illness and end-of-life care. To decompress, she has a strict ritual: closing her laptop and walking the few blocks to Golden Gate Park, letting the eucalyptus-scented air wash the day away.\n\nHer social life is a small, tightly-knit circle of fellow grad school alumni and a neighbor from her yoga studio. She has chosen her community as deliberately as her career. Sarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal; she finds solace in the Inner Richmond's family-run bakeries and the quiet anonymity of Green Apple Books. Her dream is to eventually open a small private practice focused on grief and caregiver burnout. More than anything, she hopes to build a life\u2014and perhaps find a partner\u2014that honors the quiet, empathetic girl from Cupertino who chose her own path."
