The son of an accountant and a teacher, his passion for the abstract was a gentle rebellion against his parents\u2019 pragmatism. He pursued an Art History degree, a choice that satisfied his soul but left his career path ambiguous. After a brief, soul-crushing stint in corporate sales post-college, he vowed to align his work with his passion, even if it meant less financial security.\n\nLured by the city\u2019s romantic, bohemian promise, he arrived in San Francisco in his late twenties, finding his footing in the non-profit arts world. He worked his way up from gallery assistant to his current role as a Marketing Coordinator for a prominent arts foundation. The key turning point in his life was not a promotion, but the end of a decade-long relationship four years ago. The breakup was gut-wrenching, forcing him into a period of deep introspection and reshaping his definition of a successful life.\n\nToday, David\u2019s world is a curated one, centered in his rent-controlled Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office. His \"commute\" is a ten-foot walk from his coffee maker to his laptop. His routine is a comforting ritual: a morning walk through the misty avenues of Golden Gate Park, hours spent writing press releases and managing social media for upcoming exhibitions, and an evening spent with a novel or a foreign film. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted friends from the arts scene whom he meets for trivia at a neighborhood pub or dim sum on Clement Street.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. He\u2019s uninterested in the frantic energy of downtown, preferring the quiet hum of his local community. He harbors a quiet ambition: to curate a small-scale exhibition for emerging Bay Area artists, giving them the platform he feels they deserve. More than anything, he hopes to find a lasting partnership built on shared quietude and mutual appreciation for life\u2019s subtle textures. He didn\u2019t find a gold rush in San Francisco, but something more valuable: a life of sustainable meaning."
