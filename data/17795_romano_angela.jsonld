            "value": "Angela Romano is a San Franciscan in her bones, born and raised in a city that has changed dramatically around her. Growing up in North Beach, her childhood was scented with garlic and fresh focaccia from her family\u2019s small bakery, a neighborhood institution for two generations. She was expected to be the third, but watching the city\u2019s social fabric fray during her teenage years in the 90s pulled her in a different direction. A close friend\u2019s struggle with addiction and homelessness, a life that fell through the city\u2019s widening cracks, became Angela\u2019s defining turning point.\n\nInstead of business school, she pursued a Sociology degree at UC Santa Cruz, driven by a need to understand the systems that failed her friend. Her career path was a straight line from there. She started as an intake coordinator at a youth shelter, her empathy and quiet determination marking her as a natural advocate. Now, at 42, she is a Senior Case Manager, specializing in helping transitional-age foster youth navigate the labyrinth of housing, education, and employment.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute means her Inner Sunset apartment is both sanctuary and office. The line between work and life is a blurry one, drawn each evening when she closes her laptop and takes a long, restorative walk through Golden Gate Park. Her days are a relentless series of video calls and paperwork, fighting for resources for clients whose struggles mirror the ghosts of her past. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, her social life has become smaller but deeper, centered on a few close friends who understand the emotional weight of her work.\n\nAngela mourns the San Francisco of her youth\u2014the affordability, the family businesses like her own (long since closed), the sense of shared community. Yet, she remains fiercely loyal. Her dream isn\u2019t to leave, but to build something lasting: a small non-profit that offers more holistic support for the youth she serves. For Angela, her work isn\u2019t just a job; it\u2019s an act of resistance, a way to mend the city that raised her, one case file at a time."
