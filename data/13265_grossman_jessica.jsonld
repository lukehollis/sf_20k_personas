The daughter of a pragmatic Chinese-American mother and an intellectually curious Jewish-American father, she grew up in Berkeley, a child of two vibrant cultures. From a young age, Jessica was reserved, often finding it easier to communicate with a paintbrush than with words. Her parents, seeing her artistic talent as a hobby, encouraged a more \"stable\" career path, but they never stifled the creativity that filled her sketchbooks.\n\nThe turning point came during her undergraduate years at UC Santa Cruz. When her younger cousin struggled to process the sudden death of their grandfather, Jessica sat with him for hours, not talking, but drawing. Through shared illustrations of memories and feelings, her cousin began to open up, articulating a grief that had previously been silent. In that moment, Jessica saw her future path clearly. She pursued a graduate degree at the California Institute of Integral Studies, specializing in Marriage and Family Therapy with a focus on Expressive Arts, a discipline that perfectly merged her innate empathy with her lifelong passion.\n\nNow 29, Jessica is a licensed therapist working for a community health organization that partners with San Francisco schools. Her $92,000 salary affords a modest but comfortable life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a 3.5-mile MUNI bus ride, where she reviews case notes or listens to podcasts. Her days are spent helping children and families navigate trauma, anxiety, and learning disabilities through clay, paint, and collage.\n\nJessica\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in its neighborhoods. She loves the Inner Richmond for its proximity to Golden Gate Park, her go-to for decompressing after emotionally demanding days, and its incredible dim sum restaurants. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from her graduate program, with whom she shares dinners and gallery visits. While single, she values these deep friendships over casual dating. Her dream is to one day open a small, sliding-scale private practice and a community art studio, creating a dedicated space where more San Franciscans can find their voice, just as she found hers, through the transformative power of art."

Instead of words, Jessica drew a simple picture of their grandfather flying a kite in Tilden Park. She slid the paper over. Her cousin, his eyes welling up, took the pencil and drew a tiny, shaky stick figure next to the grandfather. It was the first time he had acknowledged his loss. That shared drawing wasn't just paper and graphite; it was a bridge, and in that moment, Jessica knew she would spend her life building them.\n\n2.\nHer first year as a therapist, she worked with a seven-year-old boy who hadn't spoken at school in months. One afternoon, he silently took a lump of gray clay and, with intense focus, molded a small bird with a broken wing. He held it up to her, his finger tracing the fractured part, and whispered, \"Hurt.\" A wave of profound validation washed over Jessica. This was it. This was the work. It solidified her belief that art was a key which could unlock the most guarded parts of a child\u2019s heart.\n\n3.\nVisiting her parents in Berkeley at 24, just before starting her Master\u2019s program, her mother was meticulously wrapping zongzi at the kitchen table while her father read. Jessica sketched the scene, capturing her mother's focused hands. Her dad looked up, not at the drawing, but at her. \"You see the world differently, Jess,\" he said quietly. \"It\u2019s a gift.\" That simple acknowledgment from her pragmatic father mended a part of her she hadn't realized was broken, affirming that her path, while unconventional, was right.\n\n4.\nAfter an emotionally devastating session last year, she found herself walking aimlessly into Golden Gate Park as the fog began to roll in. She stood before the Dutch Windmill, watching it disappear into the gray mist, and just breathed. The cool, damp air felt like it was physically washing the day's trauma away. The park ceased to be just a place; it became her sanctuary, a vital tool for her own mental health. That evening cemented her bond with the city, a place that offered quiet spaces for recovery.\n\n5.\nFor her 28th birthday, her small circle of friends from grad school took her to a gallery opening in the Mission. Amid the crowd, they found a quiet corner, talking less about the art on the walls and more about a difficult case they were all thinking about. Someone pulled out a napkin, and soon they were all sketching out therapeutic diagrams and ideas. In that moment, surrounded by people who spoke her unique language of art and empathy, Jessica felt a deep, grounding sense of belonging. This was her family."
