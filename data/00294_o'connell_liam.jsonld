Raised by a pragmatic nurse and a high school history teacher, Liam grew up in a household that valued stability and service. The defining event of his youth was watching his beloved grandmother\u2019s slow, heartbreaking decline from Alzheimer's disease. The experience planted a seed of purpose in him; he didn\u2019t just want to help people one-on-one, he wanted to understand the larger patterns of disease that affected whole communities.\n\nInitially a pre-med student, Liam found himself more drawn to spreadsheets and population studies than individual diagnoses. He pivoted, pursuing a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology from UCSF, a move that pulled him across the country and into the vibrant, chaotic world of San Francisco. He arrived just before the pandemic, and the global health crisis only solidified the importance of his chosen field.\n\nNow 24, Liam works as a Research Assistant for a UCSF-affiliated health consortium. His commute is a ten-step journey from his bed to his desk in his small Hayes Valley apartment. Days are a quiet hum of data analysis, literature reviews, and Zoom meetings, a digital existence that often feels detached from the bustling city outside his window. To combat the isolation, Liam has built a life of intentional routine. Mornings often start with a run through the Panhandle, and evenings are for forcing himself out of the apartment\u2014whether it's grabbing a burrito in the Mission with friends from his grad school cohort or trying to find the best trivia night in the Lower Haight.\n\nLiam feels like an active participant in San Francisco, yet still an outsider. He\u2019s tethered to the city by his career and a deep appreciation for its progressive energy, but he\u2019s acutely aware of the transience of his social circle and the financial pressures of living here. His ambition burns quietly but intensely. He dreams of eventually leading his own research on neurodegenerative diseases, honoring his grandmother's memory by contributing to the science that might one day prevent others from sharing her fate. For now, he\u2019s building his foundation, one dataset and one neighborhood walk at a time, hoping to transform his residency into a true sense of belonging."
