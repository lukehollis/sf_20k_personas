Born in Daly City to Pakistani immigrants, her engineer father and homemaker mother instilled in her a profound respect for education. Sarah, however, initially charted a different course, earning a degree in English Literature from UC Berkeley with dreams of working in publishing.\n\nThe turning point came during a post-graduate volunteer stint, tutoring recent immigrant children in a Tenderloin after-school program. Witnessing a child\u2019s face light up after finally grasping a difficult sentence unlocked a purpose within her that prose never had. She promptly enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master's in Education. She secured a fifth-grade teaching position at a local public school and, with a stroke of luck, a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment just three blocks away. She has been in both for the last 25 years.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. The 0.0-mile commute is a short walk past the Clement Street bakeries and produce markets, where she greets the parents of current and former students. Her key life events are not grand dramas but a collection of quiet, impactful moments: the heartache of a long-term relationship ending because her partner wanted to leave the city she could never abandon; the pride of seeing her first class of students graduate from college; and the constant, bittersweet challenge of teaching children whose families are struggling to afford the very city she calls home.\n\nNow at 50, Sarah is single, content, and deeply connected. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of fellow teachers and a book club that meets at a local cafe. Her great hope is to stay in her classroom until retirement, serving as a stable, guiding force for generations of San Francisco kids. She dreams of one day writing a children's book that captures the diverse, resilient, and beautiful spirit of her students, a final lesson plan for the city that shaped her."
