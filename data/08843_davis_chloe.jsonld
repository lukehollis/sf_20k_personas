Her father, Marco D'Avola, was a Maltese merchant mariner who fell in love with a Japanese ceramicist, Emi, while docked in Yokohama. He anglicized his surname to Davis upon immigrating to the US, settling in Seattle where Chloe was raised amidst the scent of saltwater and drying clay. Her childhood was spent not in playgrounds, but in her mother\u2019s studio, learning the language of form and glaze. Her father\u2019s stories of Mediterranean ports gave her a permanent sense of wanderlust for places she'd never seen.\n\nDrawn to California\u2019s vibrant culture, Chloe pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History at UC Santa Cruz, minoring in East Asian Studies to better understand her mother\u2019s artistic lineage. San Francisco, with its fog-draped hills and defiant creativity, felt like an inevitable destination. After graduation, a trip to Malta with her father became a pivotal moment. Witnessing the collision of European and North African cultures in her ancestral home solidified her life\u2019s purpose: to champion art that exists in the spaces between fixed identities.\n\nNow 28, Chloe lives and breathes her work. She secured a coveted gallery assistant position in the Mission District, a role that came with a unique perk: a small, rent-controlled studio apartment directly above the gallery. This explains her zero-mile commute; her life unfolds within a single city block. Her days are a routine of caffeine from a local roaster, carefully handling canvases, and speaking with artists whose ambitions mirror her own.\n\nHer social life is a small, curated collection of fellow artists and writers. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings, sharing cheap, delicious tacos with friends, or sketching alone in her apartment, surrounded by her mother\u2019s pottery. Chloe\u2019s dream is not one of wealth, but of influence. She is meticulously saving, learning the business from the ground up, with the ultimate goal of becoming a curator. She aspires to one day open her own space dedicated to showcasing emerging, cross-cultural artists\u2014artists like her mother, who build bridges with their work. For Chloe, San Francisco isn\u2019t just a city; it's the canvas on which she is slowly, deliberately painting her future."
