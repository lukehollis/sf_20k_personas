The only child of Chinese immigrants who poured their life savings and boundless hope into a small grocery store on Taraval Street, Ethan\u2019s upbringing was a study in sacrifice and expectation. He was their American dream manifest: Lowell High School, UC Berkeley for undergrad, and finally, a coveted MBA from Stanford. He followed the path laid out for him with dutiful precision, never questioning the destination.\n\nThe path led him to a prestigious management consulting firm, where he now works as a finance associate. Yet, his world has shrunk to the dimensions of his sleek SoMa high-rise. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life lived through a screen. His days are a blur of financial models, client presentations on Zoom, and Slack notifications pinging into the late evening. He has achieved the stability and prestige his parents always wanted for him, but feels utterly disconnected from the vibrant, tangible city just outside his window.\n\nThe turning point wasn\u2019t a single event but a quiet, creeping disillusionment that set in during his first year on the job. The abstract nature of optimizing corporate capital felt hollow compared to the memory of his parents counting cash at the end of a long day, their work directly feeding their family and community. His few social connections are with other consultants, their conversations inevitably circling back to career tracks and exit opportunities.\n\nNow, Ethan finds himself daydreaming not of a partnership, but of something tangible\u2014the scent of roasting coffee beans, the rustle of book pages. He fantasizes about using his business acumen to open a specialty cafe or a modern bookstore back in his old neighborhood, a place that fosters community rather than just maximizing profit.\n\nHis current routine is a disciplined cycle of work, solo runs along the Embarcadero to feel the bay breeze, and ordering food delivery. He is a native who feels like an expatriate in his own home. Ethan\u2019s deepest aspiration is to bridge the chasm between the life he was supposed to want and the one he is slowly realizing he needs, hoping to one day reclaim a piece of the city's soul\u2014and his own."
