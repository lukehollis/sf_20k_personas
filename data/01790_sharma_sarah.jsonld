The only child of Indian immigrants who sacrificed everything for stability, Sarah grew up under the heavy expectation of a practical career in medicine or engineering. Yet, her world was secretly colored by a fierce love for the arts, a passion she nurtured in library books and on clandestine trips to the de Young Museum. She pleased her parents by pursuing a sensible undergraduate degree but found her true calling during a semester abroad in Florence, where the sheer force of Renaissance art solidified her path.\n\nRejecting the pre-ordained route, she pursued a Master's in Arts Administration. Her early career was a grind of grant writing and curatorial assistance in underfunded galleries. The defining turning point came during the first dot-com bust. As she watched friends in \u201csecure\u201d tech jobs lose everything overnight, Sarah realized that no path was guaranteed, so she might as well dedicate herself to what she truly loved. This revelation fueled her ascent, and with a reputation for fierce advocacy and savvy fundraising, she eventually became the Executive Director of \u201cVanguardSF,\u201d a nonprofit dedicated to supporting emerging Bay Area artists.\n\nAt 52, Sarah lives in a spacious live/work loft in Dogpatch, the ground floor of which serves as VanguardSF's main office and gallery space. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her immersive lifestyle; her work and life are one. Mornings start with strong coffee and strategic planning, afternoons are for studio visits with artists, and evenings are a whirlwind of donor dinners and gallery openings. Though she has had significant relationships, she remains fiercely independent, her most profound connections being with the artists she champions and a tight-knit circle of fellow cultural leaders.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is that of a passionate transplant. She mourns the loss of its grittier, bohemian past but fights tirelessly to preserve its creative soul. Her ultimate dream is to secure a permanent endowment for VanguardSF, creating a self-sustaining legacy that will support Bay Area artists long after she\u2019s gone, ensuring the city\u2019s vibrant, artistic heart continues to beat."
