His parents, refugees who fled Saigon in 1979, arrived in San Francisco with nothing but memories of loss. They settled in San Jose, working multiple menial jobs before opening a small, beloved pho restaurant. David\u2019s childhood was a mix of aromatic broth, the clang of dishes, and the unspoken pressure to validate his parents\u2019 harrowing journey. He excelled in school not out of passion, but out of duty.\n\nThis relentless drive propelled him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree in economics, and then to Stanford for a Master's in Applied Mathematics. He was fascinated by systems, by the elegant logic that could model and predict complex human behavior. He saw the stock market not as a casino, but as the world\u2019s largest, most intricate data set. After graduation, he took a grueling job at a New York investment bank, but the 2008 financial crisis was his crucible. Witnessing the chaos and human cost firsthand, he retreated from the high-frequency trading world, seeking a more analytical, long-term approach.\n\nHe returned to the Bay Area and joined a boutique San Francisco firm, where he rose to Senior Portfolio Manager. Now, David\u2019s life is a study in controlled precision. He resides in a minimalist condominium in SoMa, his office a standing desk with three monitors overlooking the Bay Bridge. His 0.0-mile commute means his day starts at 5:00 AM with international market analysis, followed by a disciplined run along the Embarcadero before his team logs on.\n\nHis social circle is small and curated: a few trusted colleagues and a monthly dinner with his old Stanford roommate. Weekends often involve driving down to San Jose to help his now-retired parents, a ritual of love and obligation. At 45, David has achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of. Yet, he feels a quiet yearning for a different kind of return on investment. He wonders if his mastery of financial systems could be applied to something more meaningful\u2014perhaps angel investing in immigrant-founded startups or finding a genuine partnership that exists outside of a balance sheet. The city he lives in, a hub of radical innovation, has started to make him question his own."
