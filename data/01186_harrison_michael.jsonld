Born to a Filipina-Spanish mother and a father of indeterminate Irish-American heritage, he was raised on the road, a child of the West Coast\u2019s less glamorous corridors. His family was a constellation of temporary jobs and rented rooms, leaving Michael with no single culture or hometown to claim as his own. When asked about his background, he simply shrugs; he is a composite, belonging nowhere and therefore, in a strange way, everywhere.\n\nFormal education was a casualty of this transient life. He left what passed for a home at sixteen and learned his trade in the only institution that would have him: the restaurant kitchen. Starting as a dishwasher in a forgotten Central Valley diner, he found a chaotic order in the clatter of plates and the rhythmic shouting of orders. He learned to cook not from a textbook, but by watching, absorbing the muscle memory of a perfect dice and the alchemy of heat and fat. The kitchen was a meritocracy of grit, and he had plenty of that.\n\nHis arrival in San Francisco a decade ago was less a plan and more a final destination. He was drawn to the city's promise of anonymity, a place vast enough to get lost in. He found work in a bustling, nameless tourist-trap kitchen in a neighborhood teeming with life and desperation, likely the Tenderloin. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his world\u2019s compact nature; he lives in a single-room-occupancy hotel directly above the restaurant. His life is a vertical loop: from his stark room down to the sweltering heat of the line, and back up again.\n\nHis relationships are forged in the crucible of the dinner rush\u2014the shared cigarette with the prep cook, the nod of respect from the chef, the post-shift beer with the crew. It\u2019s a brotherhood of burns and exhaustion. Michael dreams not of owning a restaurant, but of quiet. He fantasizes about a small apartment in the Outer Richmond, where he could cook a meal for himself, slowly, with the sound of the foghorns in the distance. He longs for the simple luxury of a window that doesn't open onto a cacophony of sirens, a small piece of the San Francisco he helps feed but never gets to taste."
