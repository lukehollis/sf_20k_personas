His parents, who ran a successful almond farm, instilled in him a profound work ethic and the expectation of a practical, stable career. Darius obliged, earning an economics degree from Cal Poly, but his heart was never in spreadsheets. He was fascinated by systems, by how the interconnected parts of a city\u2014its transit, housing, and public spaces\u2014functioned as a living organism. This led him to pursue a graduate degree that bewildered his parents: a Master's in Urban Planning from UCLA.\n\nHe began his career with noble intentions, working for a Bay Area municipality. However, the slow grind of bureaucracy and political inertia quickly soured him. He watched the dot-com boom reshape San Francisco with a speed that city planning could only dream of. In a decisive turning point, Darius realized the underlying logic was the same: managing complex systems with limited resources toward a defined goal. He leveraged his systems-thinking background, took a few key certification courses, and pivoted into the tech world as a project manager.\n\nNow 45, Darius is a Senior Technical Project Manager who has never written a line of code but can expertly steer a team of engineers through a chaotic product launch. His 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic fixture he fully embraces. From his minimalist SoMa condo, which he shares with his partner Marco, an architect, he commands virtual teams across time zones. His days are structured by routine: a pre-dawn walk with their rescue terrier, Buster, to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by a block of focused work before the West Coast team logs on.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deeply hyperlocal. Living and working in SoMa, he sees the urban experiment he once studied playing out in real-time from his window. Though successful, a part of him longs to reconnect with his original passion. His quiet dream is to launch a small consultancy focused on \"civic tech,\" using his project management acumen to help municipalities build smarter, more equitable cities\u2014finally closing the loop on a journey that began on a farm far from the city he now calls home."
