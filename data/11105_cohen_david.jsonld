            "value": "David Cohen, a man of 53 with roots stretching back to Guangzhou, China, arrived in San Francisco as a child in the late 1970s with his parents and younger sister.  His father, a skilled mechanic, and his mother, a seamstress, worked tirelessly to build a new life in the city\u2019s vibrant immigrant community. Growing up in the Sunset District, David saw firsthand the impact of urban planning on the lives of his family and neighbors \u2013 the changing demographics, the need for accessible public transit, and the constant negotiation between development and preservation.\n\nThis formative experience fueled his decision to pursue higher education. He excelled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master's in Urban Planning. His early career was spent at a non-profit focused on affordable housing, giving him a deep understanding of the social equity woven into urban development. A turning point came in his late 30s when he transitioned to public administration, working for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). His dedication and nuanced perspective on transit infrastructure led to his current position as Director of Transportation Planning.\n\nDavid is a devoted husband and father. He met his Filipina-American wife, Elena, in graduate school; their shared passion for urban issues quickly blossomed into a lifelong partnership. They have two children, now in college, who also appreciate the complexities of city life. His closest friends are a diverse group he\u2019s accumulated throughout his life \u2013 former classmates, colleagues, and members of his community.\n\nCurrently, David\u2019s days are a blend of strategic planning meetings, navigating bureaucratic hurdles, and advocating for projects that improve the lives of everyday San Franciscans. His 5.5-mile Muni commute is more than just a ride; it's a tangible connection to the transit system he works to optimize. He and Elena own a comfortable home in the Outer Richmond, a neighborhood they cherish for its quiet streets and proximity to the ocean.\n\nDavid dreams of a San Francisco with a truly integrated, equitable, and sustainable transportation system \u2013 one that serves all its residents. His aspiration is to leave a lasting positive impact on the city that welcomed his family and became his home. He remains deeply connected to his neighborhood, actively participating in local planning discussions and finding solace in walks along Ocean Beach."

Seeing her bent over fabric, creating beauty from scraps, instilled in him a quiet respect for dedication and craft, a value he carries into his own work. (Childhood, early Sunset District years)\n\n2. Walking into Sproul Plaza at Berkeley for the first time felt like stepping onto a stage where ideas collided and the future was being debated. The energy was electrifying, a stark contrast to his quieter home life, and it ignited his passion for public service and urban possibility. (Early 20s, during college)\n\n3. Elena\u2019s smile across the seminar room, discussing zoning laws with surprising fervor, caught his eye. It wasn\u2019t just shared academic interest; it was the beginning of a partnership built on mutual respect and a shared vision for a better city, a feeling of finally finding his intellectual and emotional match. (Mid-20s, during graduate school)\n\n4. The first time he rode the 38-Geary line as Director, seeing the diverse faces, listening to the bus's hum, felt profound. This wasn't just a commute; it was the pulse of the city, and he felt an immense responsibility to make it better, a tangible connection to the lives he impacts. (Late 30s, early in SFMTA Director role)\n\n5. Standing with his now-adult children near Ocean Beach, watching the fog roll in, he felt a deep sense of peace and belonging. The city that had welcomed his family had also given him this life, and a quiet determination to protect its essence for future generations solidified within him. (Present day)"
