Born in Eastern Europe, he was adopted as an infant by the Lis, a second-generation Chinese-American couple in Fremont. Growing up, he was Ivan in a household of relatives named Wei and Mei, a Caucasian face amidst family celebrations in Cupertino. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, instilled in him a profound sense of civic duty and a quiet diligence. He watched them navigate the intricate, often frustrating, bureaucracy of local government for their small business, an experience that planted the seed of his future career.\n\nHis educational path was a straight line toward public service. After studying political science at UC Davis, a pivotal internship with a state assemblymember solidified his calling. He saw how thoughtful policy could genuinely improve lives, and how easily it could be derailed by inefficiency. This drove him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, where he focused on urban housing solutions. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted role as a legislative aide for a San Francisco Supervisor, finally moving into the city he\u2019d only studied from afar.\n\nNow, at 33, Ivan\u2019s life is his work. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a sleek, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley, a seven-minute walk from City Hall. His days are a blur of policy briefings, constituent calls, and drafting legislation. He\u2019s a quiet warrior in the bureaucratic trenches, respected for his meticulous research and calm demeanor. His social life has narrowed, a casualty of his ambition; a long-term relationship recently ended, strained by his 70-hour work weeks.\n\nIvan sees San Francisco not as a postcard but as a complex organism of competing interests he is trying to balance. His dream isn\u2019t to be the one in front of the camera, but to become a Chief of Staff\u2014the indispensable hand guiding the city\u2019s future. He channels his frustrations into long, early-morning runs through the Panhandle, clearing his head before another day of trying to nudge the needle of progress, one piece of legislation at a time."
