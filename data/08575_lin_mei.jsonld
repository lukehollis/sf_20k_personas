Her parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery for thirty years, instilling in Mei a profound sense of duty and a deep, observational love for the city\u2019s intricate social fabric. Excelling in academics, she pursued this passion, earning a Master's degree in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, her future seemingly as bright and clear as a rare, sun-drenched day in her hometown.\n\nMei\u2019s promising career at a city planning firm was cut short just as it began. Her mother was diagnosed with a debilitating illness, and without hesitation, Mei stepped back to become her primary caregiver. For nearly a decade, her world shrank to the size of their family home, her days measured not by project deadlines, but by medication schedules and small comforts. After her mother\u2019s passing, returning to the fast-paced world of urban planning felt impossible. The field had moved on, and she felt a step behind, her confidence eroded.\n\nNow, at 44, Mei has found a quiet harbor as a research assistant at UCSF. Living in a small, university-subsidized apartment in the Inner Sunset, her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her laptop. She spends her days analyzing demographic data and social trends for a tenured professor\u2014a ghost in the academic machine. She watches the city she once dreamed of shaping through spreadsheets and datasets, a passive observer. Her social life is minimal, consisting of polite exchanges with colleagues and weekly visits with her aging father.\n\nYet, a flicker of her old ambition remains. After her official work is done, Mei secretly curates her own research: a deeply personal study of the disappearing legacy businesses in San Francisco, inspired by her parents\u2019 long-closed grocery. It is her quiet rebellion, her hope to one day contribute something meaningful and her own to the city that holds her entire history."
