His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small bakery on Irving Street. From a young age, Alex understood the city not as a postcard, but as a complex organism of schedules and services. He witnessed his parents\u2019 anxiety over a delayed L Taraval, a tangible bottleneck that could affect their entire day.\n\nThis grounded upbringing fostered a pragmatic, civic-minded perspective. While his peers at Lowell High School dreamt of tech fortunes, Alex was drawn to the systems that governed their lives. He attended UC Berkeley, initially studying economics, but the 2008 financial crisis became a pivotal turning point. Seeing the widespread impact on working families, including his own, he shifted his focus. He realized he didn\u2019t want to manage wealth; he wanted to manage the public good. This led him to a Master of Public Policy, where he specialized in urban transit.\n\nHis career at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) felt like a homecoming. Starting as a data analyst and steadily working his way up to Senior Program Manager, Alex has dedicated himself to the unglamorous, essential work of making the city move. His current project involves optimizing bus routes in underserved neighborhoods\u2014a mission that feels deeply personal, a way of serving the communities he grew up in.\n\nAlex now lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley with his partner, Clara, a public school teacher. His 4.5-mile commute on the N-Judah is his daily field research. He doesn\u2019t just manage the system; he lives it, noting the overcrowded cars, the phantom \u201cghost trains,\u201d and the small moments of community among regular riders. Their weekends are spent hiking Mount Sutro, grabbing dim sum in the Richmond, or debating city politics with friends over beers at a neighborhood pub.\n\nHis aspirations are not for wealth or fame, but for function and equity. Alex dreams of a San Francisco where a world-class public transit system is a given, not a daily gamble. He sees his work as a quiet, vital form of civic duty, a lifelong effort to repay the city that raised him by making it just a little bit easier for everyone to navigate."

He stood with his father on the cold concrete island at 19th and Taraval, clutching a bag of still-warm pineapple buns. The L train was late again. He watched his father\u2019s shoulders slump, not with anger, but with a deep, weary sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the entire day. In that moment, Alex understood that a red line on a map wasn\u2019t a route; it was a promise that could be broken, with real consequences for his family.\n\n2.\nIt was October 2008, in his dorm room at Berkeley. The news blared about bailouts, but the real crisis came through the phone. He heard a tremor in his mother's voice she tried to hide, talking about fewer customers at the bakery, about \"watching every penny.\" The complex formulas in his economics textbooks suddenly felt like a hollow game. He saw the direct line from abstract financial systems to the fear in his mother\u2019s voice. That night, he changed his major, trading the theory of wealth for the practice of public good.\n\n3.\nHis first true victory at the SFMTA wasn't a promotion, but an email. A woman from the Excelsior wrote to say the 44 O'Shaughnessy was more reliable, that she could now count on it to get to her nursing job on time. Alex had spent weeks analyzing the data, modeling a tiny schedule change that his superiors called a \"minor tweak.\" Reading her words, he felt a quiet, profound validation settle in his bones. He wasn't just moving numbers on a screen; he was giving someone back twenty minutes of their day.\n\n4.\nHe and Clara were crushed into a rush-hour N-Judah, her head resting on his shoulder, exhausted from her day teaching. The train stalled in the tunnel, and a disembodied voice announced a \"delay.\" A collective groan filled the car\u2014the sound of a thousand altered plans. He felt a surge of fury that was intensely personal. This wasn't a system failure; it was a failure to care for Clara, for the tired man next to them, for the city he loved. His mission became less about policy and more about protection.\n\n5.\nOn a recent hike, they stood atop Mount Sutro as the fog rolled in, muffling the city's noise. Below, the ribbons of streetlights traced the paths of the bus routes he knew by heart. He saw the city not as a map, but as a circulatory system, and his job was to keep the blood flowing. He squeezed Clara's hand, feeling a sense of calm purpose. He didn't need to save the world. He just needed to make sure a teacher, a baker, or a nurse could get home on time."
