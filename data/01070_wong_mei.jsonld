Raised in the Sunset District, her childhood was defined by the scent of dried ginseng and chrysanthemum from her immigrant parents\u2019 small herbalist shop on Irving Street. She was the dutiful daughter, spending afternoons after school translating for customers and meticulously organizing inventory, absorbing her parents' lessons on practicality and hard work.\n\nThis pragmatism, however, warred with a secret passion. Mei Lin found her escape in the de Young Museum, losing herself for hours among European paintings and ancient American pottery. She pursued this love at UC Santa Cruz, surprising her parents by graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History. The reality of post-college life hit hard. The museum and gallery jobs she coveted were few, low-paying, and fiercely competitive. Pressured by the city\u2019s soaring cost of living and a desire not to disappoint her family, she made a difficult pivot.\n\nA family friend helped her land a position as an administrative assistant at a burgeoning SoMa tech startup. Now, at 25, Mei Lin\u2019s life exists in two distinct spheres. Her professional world is confined to the four walls of her small Inner Richmond apartment. With a 0.0-mile commute, her days are a digital rhythm of Slack notifications, scheduling meetings, and managing expense reports for people she\u2019s only ever met on Zoom.\n\nBut when the laptop closes, her real life begins. She escapes the digital confines for long walks through Golden Gate Park, sketchbook in hand, or takes the bus back to the Sunset for weekly family dinners. Her social circle is small\u2014a few close friends from college and her younger brother, a student at SF State. Mei Lin\u2019s tech salary is not for climbing a corporate ladder; it's a means to an end. She diligently saves, dreaming of one day opening a small, modern gallery-cafe, a space that could finally merge her parents\u2019 pragmatism with her own artistic soul. For now, she remains a quiet observer in her own city, navigating the currents of old San Francisco and its new tech-driven reality, hoping to carve a future that is truly her own."
