            "value": "David Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laced avenues, born and raised in the Inner Richmond. The son of a Chinese immigrant mother who ran a small sewing and alterations shop and a second-generation Irish-American longshoreman, David grew up straddling two worlds. His surname came from his father, but his home life was filled with the sounds of Cantonese and the aroma of his mother\u2019s cooking. His father\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack when David was 15 plunged the family into financial precarity and left a quiet, hardworking boy shouldering responsibilities beyond his years.\n\nSchool was never David's focus; the city itself was his classroom. While his grades were mediocre, he knew the MUNI lines by heart and could navigate the city\u2019s steepest hills on his skateboard with an easy grace. After graduating from George Washington High School, he drifted through a series of jobs\u2014deli counter clerk, bike messenger, warehouse stocker\u2014each one paying just enough to help his mother with the rent on their small apartment. The turning point came at 25, tired of the instability. He saw a posting for the SFMTA civil service exam. A city job meant a pension, benefits, and security\u2014things his family had never truly had. He studied for months and passed, accepting a position as a Parking Enforcement Officer.\n\nNow 35, David\u2019s life is one of routine and rhythm. His 0.0-mile commute means he lives in the district he patrols. He wakes before dawn in the same rent-controlled apartment he grew up in, has coffee, and walks out his door to begin his beat. He knows the merchants by name, the delivery truck schedules, and which hydrants are the most tempting for illegal parkers. To most, he is just a uniform, a source of frustration. But to his neighborhood, he is a quiet, constant presence.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful: weekly dim sum with his now-retired mother and beers with a handful of childhood friends at a local dive bar. His private passion is photography. On his days off, he wanders the city with a vintage film camera, capturing candid street scenes\u2014the ephemeral moments of life he observes daily from the other side of a uniform. David doesn\u2019t dream of leaving San Francisco or finding a new career. His aspiration is simpler: to keep his small corner of the city in order, to continue documenting its beauty, and to one day have saved enough to buy his mother\u2019s apartment, ensuring their story remains woven into the fabric of the neighborhood forever."
