Raised in a culturally Jewish, middle-class family, he was the quiet observer, attuned to the unspoken anxieties that simmered beneath the surface of suburban life. His father was a pragmatic accountant, his mother a high school English teacher. It was his uncle\u2019s silent, lifelong battle with depression that planted the seed for his future, showing him how easily a person could become isolated within their own mind.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from a New York state school, he felt a pull towards direct action. He enrolled in Columbia University\u2019s Master of Social Work program, drawn to the gritty, frontline reality of the field. In the late 1990s, feeling constrained by the East Coast, he moved to San Francisco, seeking a city that matched his progressive ideals and offered a sense of personal reinvention.\n\nDavid found his calling in community mental health, deliberately avoiding the lucrative world of private practice. For over two decades, he has worked with the city\u2019s most vulnerable: the unhoused, those navigating the labyrinthine public health system, and individuals battling severe mental illness and addiction. A marriage, strained by the city\u2019s expense and the emotional toll of his work, ended amicably a decade ago.\n\nSince the pandemic, his commute is zero. David now conducts his therapy sessions via telehealth from a dedicated room in his Inner Richmond apartment. His days are a structured rotation of intense, hour-long video calls, bookended by meditative walks in Golden Gate Park to decompress. He lives alone, finding solace in the neighborhood's quiet rhythm, its foggy mornings, and the small-town feel of Clement Street\u2019s markets. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of other healthcare professionals who understand the specific weight of their work.\n\nAt 52, David\u2019s aspirations are no longer grand, but essential. He dreams of maintaining his own mental health to avoid burnout, of seeing a few long-term clients achieve lasting stability, and perhaps learning to play the guitar that\u2019s been gathering dust in his closet. He is the city\u2019s quiet ballast, a testament to a San Francisco that operates on empathy, far from the headlines of tech and turmoil."
