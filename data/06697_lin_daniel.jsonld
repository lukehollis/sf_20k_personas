Raised in the meticulously planned suburbs of Cupertino, he is the son of Taiwanese immigrants who built their American dream on the bedrock of Silicon Valley pragmatism. His father, a software engineer, and his mother, an accountant, instilled in him the values of stability, hard work, and a clear, lucrative career path. They envisioned a future for him in tech or finance, a secure legacy for their only child.\n\nDaniel, however, found his passion not in code or capital, but in the past. At UC Santa Cruz, he defied his parents\u2019 gentle but firm guidance and declared a major in History. He fell in love with the grand narratives of civilizations and the intimate stories of forgotten people. But upon graduation, the weight of parental expectation and student loans felt heavier than his diploma. He made a pact with practicality, earning financial certifications online and leveraging his analytical skills to land a job as a Financial Services Representative.\n\nNow 25, Daniel lives and works in the same two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco's Richmond District. His 0.0-mile commute from his bed to his desk is a symbol of his life\u2019s current stasis. His days are a cycle of market analysis, client calls, and spreadsheet-filled silence, a world away from the historical sagas he craves. His roommate, a freelance graphic designer, fills the apartment with color and creative chaos, a constant, unspoken reminder of the path not taken.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deeply personal and historical. He spends his evenings and weekends on long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park or tracing the architectural ghosts of the Sutro Baths. He sees the city not as a hub of innovation, but as a living museum full of stories. Daniel\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a way to merge his livelihood with his love for the past. He secretly drafts applications for museum curator programs, aspiring to a future where his work doesn't just fund his life, but fulfills it."
