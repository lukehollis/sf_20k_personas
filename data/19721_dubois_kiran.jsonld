Raised by his Ojibwe mother, a pillar of their community, and his father of French-Canadian descent, Kiran grew up navigating two cultures. His childhood was steeped in the traditions of his tribe, but also marked by the stark realities of life on the reservation\u2014a close-knit community grappling with systemic challenges.\n\nThe turning point came when Kiran was nineteen. He watched his family struggle to navigate a maze of federal and state paperwork for his uncle's medical care, a frustrating battle that left a deep impression. He saw how broken systems could fail good people, and a quiet resolve formed within him: he wanted to be on the other side of that desk, to be the one who could actually help. He moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation for social progress and the promise of opportunity at City College of San Francisco.\n\nAt City College, he earned his Associate's degree in Social and Behavioral Sciences, a practical choice that led him directly to a position as an Eligibility Worker for the city. Now, Kiran\u2019s days are spent in an office near Civic Center, a world away from the open plains of his youth. His 4.8-mile commute on the Muni bus from his small apartment in the Inner Richmond is a daily meditation. He sees echoes of his community\u2019s struggles in the diverse faces of the clients he serves\u2014immigrants, seniors, and families at their most vulnerable.\n\nThough dedicated to his work, Kiran feels the constant pull of his heritage. He stays connected through events at the American Indian Cultural District and regular video calls with his younger sister back home. His social life is small but meaningful, built around a few friends from work and college. Kiran\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but efficacy. He hopes to eventually transfer to SF State to earn his Bachelor\u2019s in Social Work, aspiring to move into a policy role where he can help untangle the bureaucratic knots he once saw ensnare his own family. He wants to build a life in San Francisco, proving that you can leave home to find your purpose, without ever losing who you are."

The sweet, smoky scent filled the room as her hands, weathered but steady, worked the strands. She didn\u2019t speak of grand traditions, only of listening\u2014to the grass, to the wind, to the quiet stories of their people. He felt a profound sense of peace and belonging in that moment. It was a silent lesson in identity that became the anchor he holds onto now, a scent that means home.\n\n2.\nHe was nineteen when his uncle\u2019s diagnosis came. The kitchen table was buried under forms, a blizzard of sterile white paper. He remembers the sound of his father\u2019s sigh, a puff of defeated air, and the stony set of his mother\u2019s jaw as she tried to decipher the jargon. Kiran felt a hot, useless anger rise in his chest. It wasn't just paper; it was a wall. That night, the anger cooled into a hard resolve. He would learn the language of that wall, not to build it, but to tear it down for others.\n\n3.\nHis first week in San Francisco, Kiran stood at his apartment window in the Inner Richmond, watching the fog swallow the street. It was the opposite of the vast, clear North Dakota sky he knew. He felt utterly anonymous, a single face among millions, the prairie emptiness replaced by an urban crush. But mixed with the loneliness was a sharp thrill of purpose. He hadn\u2019t just run away from home; he had run *towards* something. That dense, gray fog was the blank page he had come here to write on.\n\n4.\nLast year, an elderly Cantonese woman sat across from his desk, clutching a benefits denial letter and near tears. Her son translated anxiously. Kiran ignored the pressure of the queue, gently circling the key phrases on the form and explaining the appeal process in simple terms. As they left, the woman bowed her head slightly, a silent thank you. In that moment, Kiran saw not a client, but his own family. He felt a quiet, powerful click of vindication\u2014he was finally on the right side of the desk.\n\n5.\nA few months ago at a street fair in the American Indian Cultural District, the rhythmic beat of a powwow drum vibrated through the pavement. For a dizzying second, Kiran closed his eyes and he was home, the scent of frybread in the air. Then a Muni bus hissed to a stop, pulling him back to the Bay. The juxtaposition didn\u2019t feel jarring, but true. It was the beat of his heart: one rhythm from his past, one from his present, both playing at the same time."
