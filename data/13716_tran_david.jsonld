Born in Portland, Oregon, he was adopted as an infant by a loving couple: a sharp-witted history professor and a free-spirited ceramicist. His surname is a cherished gift from his father, whose own parents had immigrated from Vietnam. Growing up in a house filled with books, political debate, and pottery wheels, David developed a mind that was both analytical and creatively inclined. He was the kid who organized his LEGOs by color and shape before building intricate, imaginative structures.\n\nHis path led him to UC Santa Cruz, where he initially felt lost amidst the sea of pure computer science majors. For David, coding for its own sake was dry. The turning point came in a third-year Information Science course on data ethics and visualization. Suddenly, he saw the potential: data wasn't just a string of numbers, but the raw material for a story. He found his calling in translating sprawling, complex datasets into elegant, intuitive visuals that could reveal hidden truths.\n\nAfter graduating, San Francisco was the only logical destination. He landed a job at a mid-sized tech firm in SoMa, quickly becoming the go-to specialist for making their user data not just legible, but beautiful. At 33, David lives a structured, fulfilling life. His 2.1-mile commute is a daily ritual on the MUNI F-line from his apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he loves for its blend of curated boutiques, top-tier restaurants, and genuine community feel.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and people he met through a local running club. Though professionally successful, David aspires to more. He dreams of leading a data visualization project for a major nonprofit, using his skills to illuminate complex issues like wealth inequality or climate change impact. He feels a quiet, persistent curiosity about his birth parents, a thread he may one day decide to pull. For now, he finds purpose in bringing clarity to chaos, both on-screen and off, building a life as carefully designed as one of his own infographics."

David remembers his dad putting down a heavy history book, his gaze soft. He explained that \"Tran\" was a gift, a connection to grandparents David never met, a story of a long journey from Vietnam. It wasn't about blood, but about a choice to build a family. In that moment, the name settled into his bones, not as a question, but as a foundation.\n\n2.\nThe smell of wet earth and his mother\u2019s quiet humming filled the pottery studio. At eleven, his first pot was a lopsided, clumsy thing. He was about to crush it when his mom stopped him, her hands covered in clay. \"It has character,\" she'd said, turning it over. \"Its flaws are what make it yours.\" That day, he learned that beauty wasn't in perfection, but in the honest, tangible result of trying\u2014a lesson he'd later apply to messy, chaotic datasets that needed a human touch.\n\n3.\nHe was 20, feeling adrift in a UC Santa Cruz computer lab, the code on his screen feeling lifeless. Then came the data ethics lecture. The professor projected a map, not of roads, but of global food distribution, visualized as pulsating rivers of light. The abstract numbers became a story of hunger and surplus. A jolt went through him. This was it. This was how you could make scattered data sing with meaning, how you could reveal truth. He had found his language.\n\n4.\nThe first time he crossed the finish line at Bay to Breakers with his running club, he could barely breathe. Lungs burning, surrounded by friends\u2014some in costumes, all laughing with exhaustion\u2014he looked across the cheering crowd toward the ocean. It was more than a race. It was a shared current of effort and joy, a feeling of being woven into the city's fabric. He wasn't just working in San Francisco; he was truly living there, his roots finally taking hold.\n\n5.\nLast year, David stayed late at the SoMa office, perfecting a dashboard. The elegant charts glowed, beautifully illustrating user churn. He felt a surge of pride, followed by a sudden, hollow echo. It was clean, clever, and ultimately, it was about selling a product better. He leaned back, picturing these same elegant lines showing housing inequity in the Bay Area or climate displacement. The thought was a quiet ache, a clear visualization of the man he was and the man he hoped to become."
