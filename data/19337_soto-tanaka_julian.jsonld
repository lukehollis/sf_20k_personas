The son of a third-generation Japanese-American engineer and a second-generation Mexican-American social worker, he grew up in Fremont, a sprawling Bay Area suburb where cultures coexisted but rarely intertwined. His paternal grandparents\u2019 stories of internment and his mother\u2019s work with immigrant families instilled in him a deep awareness of how civic structures could both uplift and oppress communities. This fascination led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies, eager to understand the systems that shaped the cities around him.\n\nAfter graduating, Julian intentionally sidestepped the lucrative pull of the tech industry. He felt a stronger calling to apply his knowledge directly to public service. A key turning point was an internship with the Oakland city planning department, where he witnessed the frustrating yet rewarding process of enacting municipal change. This experience solidified his career path, leading him to a management consulting firm that specialized in the public sector. Now, he helps government agencies in SF and beyond become more efficient, tackling complex problems in transportation, housing, and public works.\n\nToday, Julian\u2019s life is a testament to the urban principles he studied. He lives in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he chose for its walkability and vibrant community. His 1.2-mile walk to his SoMa office is a cherished daily ritual, a moving meditation through the city\u2019s core. Most evenings are spent with his long-term partner, Clara, an architect who shares his passion for urban design, or with a close-knit group of friends, often debating city politics over craft beer.\n\nConnected deeply to San Francisco, Julian sees the city not just as a home but as his life\u2019s work. While he finds his consulting job fulfilling, he dreams of eventually moving into a direct role within the city\u2019s government, perhaps at the SFMTA or Planning Department. His ultimate aspiration is to leave a tangible, positive mark on the city\u2014to help build a more equitable and functional San Francisco, one policy, one project, one crosswalk at a time."

His grandfather, usually so stoic, quietly pointed to a spot near the food court. \u201cMy family\u2019s barrack was right there.\u201d In that moment, Julian saw not a mall, but the ghost of the internment camp. The weight of that history, imprinted on a suburban landscape, settled in his bones. It wasn't just an abstract injustice anymore; it was a physical place. That day forged his resolve to understand how cities could hold both pain and progress.\n\n2.\nDuring his Oakland internship, Julian sat through a brutally hostile community meeting about a new bike lane. He was 22 and ready to quit, seeing only anger and futility. Then, his manager, after an hour of being yelled at, found a tiny point of compromise about sidewalk accessibility. The tension in the room didn't vanish, but it shifted. A flicker of possibility. Julian felt a jolt of astonished respect. He understood then that building a better city wasn't about visionary plans, but about patiently navigating human friction to find that one shared step forward.\n\n3.\nThe day he and Clara got the keys to their Hayes Valley apartment, they didn\u2019t inspect the paint or the floors. They just stood by the large window, listening. They heard the clatter of plates from the cafe below, the rumble of the #21 bus, and the murmur of conversation from the sidewalk. He felt a profound sense of clicking into place. This wasn\u2019t just a home; it was the physical manifestation of his studies, a deliberate choice to live within the vibrant, walkable, complex urban system he loved so much.\n\n4.\nOn a recent rainy morning walk to his SoMa office, he felt a wave of despair over a stalled project. Then, he saw a Public Works crew efficiently clearing a clogged storm drain, their yellow raincoats a slash of color in the grey. A few feet away, a beautifully intricate new sticker was slapped on a utility box. The city, in that instant, was both mundane function and spontaneous art. The feeling wasn't despair, but a deep, abiding affection. It reminded him that his work was part of this living, breathing, imperfect whole.\n\n5.\nVenting to his mother on the phone about a bureaucratic roadblock, he felt his frustration mounting. She listened patiently before saying, \u201c*Mijo*, remember the Rodriguez family? It took us two years to get their son enrolled in the right school program. Two years for one child.\u201d The comparison was humbling and immediate. His professional challenges suddenly seemed manageable. Her words cut through his cynicism, reminding him that behind every policy and project were real people, and their fight was always worth the time it took."
