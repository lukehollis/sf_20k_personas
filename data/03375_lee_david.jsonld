The first was the foggy, quiet Sunset District of his youth, where his parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small but bustling grocery store. They preached stability and security, worlds away from the unpredictable life of art he now leads. For them, success was a clear path: a good high school, a practical degree, and a respectable profession. David, their only son, obliged. He dutifully earned an Economics degree from UC Berkeley, poised to enter the city\u2019s burgeoning tech and finance scene of the late 90s.\n\nHis first career in corporate finance was short-lived and soulless. The pivotal moment came not with a grand epiphany, but with a layoff during the dot-com bust. For David, it was a profound relief. Using his severance, he abandoned spreadsheets for sketchbooks, taking art history classes at a community college and volunteering at a small, struggling gallery in SoMa. It was there, amidst the scent of turpentine and the quiet intensity of emerging artists, that he found his calling.\n\nOver two decades, he worked his way up from sweeping floors to curating shows, eventually becoming the manager of the now-respected gallery. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in the airy loft directly above the gallery space. His days are a quiet rhythm of emails and inventory in the morning, followed by meetings with artists and collectors in the afternoon. Evenings are often spent hosting openings or simply sitting alone in the silent gallery, absorbing the work.\n\nWhile respected in the Bay Area art community, his personal life is circumscribed by his work. Past relationships have buckled under the weight of his commitment to the gallery. His connection with his aging parents is loving but carries a permanent, gentle disappointment on their end. David\u2019s deepest relationships are with the artists he champions. His dream isn\u2019t of wealth, but of securing the gallery\u2019s future and discovering a groundbreaking artist whose career he can help launch. He is a guardian of a fading San Francisco, a quiet anchor for creativity in a city increasingly dominated by code."

While she tallied sales, he would sit on a crate of oranges in the back, sketching on discarded butcher paper. She never scolded him, but the relentless sound of the abacus felt like a quiet tally of his own deviations from the path they\u2019d set. It was the first time he understood that his parents\u2019 love and their approval were two different things. (Late childhood)\n\n2.\nThe day he was laid off during the dot-com bust, he walked out of the high-rise with his small box of office supplies and didn\u2019t go home. He went to the SFMOMA bookstore, the severance check still uncashed in his pocket. He bought a heavy book on German Expressionism, sat on a bench in Yerba Buena Gardens, and ran his thumb over the glossy, textured images. The cold dread he was supposed to feel never came. Instead, a quiet, thrilling freedom settled over him\u2014the feeling of a story finally beginning. (Early 2000s)\n\n3.\nIt was 2 a.m. in the struggling SoMa gallery, years before he would run it. A young sculptor, frantic before her first show, was on the verge of tears because a piece wouldn't hang right. David, who was only there to sweep, spent three hours with her, rigging a solution with fishing line and counterweights. When it finally held, she simply hugged him, exhausted and grateful. In that moment, smelling of turpentine and sweat, he knew he didn't want to sell art; he wanted to be its custodian. (Mid-2000s)\n\n4.\nHe recalls a specific argument with a past girlfriend in the loft above the gallery. She was rightfully angry that he\u2019d missed her birthday dinner to comfort a panicked artist. \"That space downstairs,\" she said, her voice echoing in the sparse apartment, \"it will always be more your home than this is.\" He had no defense, because he knew she was right. That painful silence after she spoke was the moment he accepted the profound loneliness that came with his chosen purpose. (About eight years ago)\n\n5.\nLast year, after a successful opening for a fiercely talented but unknown painter, he stood alone in the silent gallery. A single red \"sold\" sticker was affixed next to the artist\u2019s main piece\u2014the one David had fought to put front and center. It wasn't about the money. It was the knowledge that this sticker meant the artist could keep her studio for another year. In the quiet hum of the track lighting, he felt a deep, paternal satisfaction that was his version of success, the only one he ever truly wanted. (Last year)"
