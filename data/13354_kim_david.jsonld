Born David Miller in a working-class Sacramento neighborhood, his early life was marked by the instability of a single-parent household. Everything changed when he was ten. His mother married Jae-eun Kim, a kind, quiet immigrant who ran a small electronics repair shop. Seeking the stability and paternal anchor he craved, a teenage David chose to take his stepfather\u2019s surname\u2014a decision that would quietly shape his sense of identity and an early lesson in how belonging can be chosen, not just inherited.\n\nThis search for belonging became the bedrock of his career. He witnessed firsthand how one caring adult could alter a child's trajectory, inspiring him to pursue social work. After earning his MSW from UC Berkeley, David took a frontline position with the San Francisco Unified School District, working with at-risk adolescents. His calm demeanor and deep empathy, born from his own unsettled youth, made him a trusted figure for teens navigating chaos. Over two decades, he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a Program Director, where he now oversees mental health and support services across several schools.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the Outer Sunset, where he and his wife, Sarah, a landscape architect, bought a small home fifteen years ago. They have a 16-year-old daughter, Maya, who attends Lowell High School. His daily routine begins with a foggy, contemplative ride on the L-Taraval Muni line, a 14.8-mile journey that gives him time to read case files or simply watch the city wake up. He feels the weight of his administrative role, often missing the direct impact of one-on-one counseling, but finds purpose in building sustainable programs that will outlast him.\n\nAt 49, David dreams less of personal accolades and more of lasting impact. He hopes to see the programs he\u2019s developed continue to thrive and to one day travel with Sarah, perhaps walking the Camino de Santiago. He is a man who found his own stability and has dedicated his life to offering that same gift to San Francisco\u2019s next generation, a steady presence in a city defined by constant change."

His stepfather didn\u2019t say much, just placed a hand on his shoulder, his eyes glistening. In that quiet gesture, David felt the world shift. It wasn't about erasing his past, but building a future on a foundation of chosen love. It was the first time he truly felt anchored, the moment David Miller started becoming David Kim.\n\n2.\nIt was his first year with SFUSD, around 2001. A boy named Marcus hadn\u2019t spoken a word in three sessions. Then, one Tuesday, huddled on a bench at Mission High, Marcus quietly described his walk to school, a daily map of dangers David could barely fathom. David just listened, the city noise fading away. He felt not pity, but a profound recognition. This was it. This was why he was here: to be the one person who didn't flinch, who could hold the weight of a story.\n\n3.\nFifteen years ago, the first night in their Outer Sunset home. The boxes were everywhere, but he and Sarah had set up Maya\u2019s crib first. He remembers standing in the living room doorway, watching them both sleep as the foghorn moaned its lonely rhythm. He felt a stillness he'd chased his whole life. This wasn\u2019t just a mortgage; it was a stake in the ground, a promise of stability for his daughter. This quiet, foggy corner of the world was finally, truly, his home.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the budget meeting five years ago, a sterile conference room downtown. On the spreadsheet was the line item for an after-school art program\u2014the kind of small, vital lifeline he used to rely on. He saw the faces of kids who needed it. But the numbers didn\u2019t work. Signing off on the cut felt like a betrayal of his younger self. It was the day the weight of his job shifted from individual souls to entire systems, a heavier, more abstract burden he still carries.\n\n5.\nJust last fall, riding the L-Taraval home with Maya. She wasn't on her phone but was staring out at the passing neighborhoods, talking about a friend at Lowell who was struggling. The way she spoke\u2014with a fierce, quiet empathy\u2014it was like hearing an echo of his own heart. In that moment, watching his daughter navigate the complexities of caring for another person, he realized his most lasting program wasn't in a school district budget. It was her."
