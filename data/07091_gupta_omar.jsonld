Adopted as an infant by a loving, white schoolteacher couple from suburban Walnut Creek, he was raised a Miller but kept his given name. This duality defined his youth; he was the American kid with an Indian name, a cultural island with no map. His connection to the heritage he couldn't personally recall began, as it often does, with food. While his adoptive mother perfected American comfort classics, Omar found himself drawn to the vibrant spice aisles of the grocery store, experimenting with flavors that felt distantly familiar.\n\nHe tried to follow a conventional path, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Diablo Valley College. The diploma felt hollow. The turning point came during a listless temp job when, on a whim, he took a position as a dishwasher in a bustling Berkeley restaurant. The chaotic, creative, high-pressure energy of the kitchen was a revelation. He had found his place. Omar relentlessly worked his way up the line, his palate and ambition his only guides.\n\nAt 29, while working as a sous chef in San Francisco, he met his future business partner, a pragmatic front-of-house manager named Sarah. They bonded over a shared dream: a neighborhood restaurant that was ambitious but unpretentious. After years of saving, they secured a small space in the Mission District, with an apartment directly above it.\n\nNow 41, Omar\u2019s life is his restaurant, \"Juno.\" His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs each morning before dawn. His days are a rhythm of sourcing ingredients from the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market, prepping with his small, tight-knit staff, and overseeing the nightly service. His social life is woven into his work; his staff is his family, and the regulars are his community. While he has long since made peace with the mystery of his origins, his dream is to one day close the restaurant for a month and travel through India\u2014not to search for his birth family, but to finally taste the culture that gave him his name and his life\u2019s passion."
