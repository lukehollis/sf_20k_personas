The son of Soviet-era Russian immigrants who settled in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, Dmitri was raised on black bread, thick borscht, and the heavy expectation to achieve an intellectual\u2019s life his parents never could. He was a dutiful son, excelling in school and eventually enrolling at UC Berkeley. There, he lost himself in the dense, theoretical worlds of Foucault and Dostoevsky, earning a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature.\n\nThe degree, however, felt abstract, a ghost he couldn't grasp. To support his studies, he\u2019d taken a job as a busboy at Caff\u00e8 Rossi, a classic Italian restaurant in North Beach. He discovered an unexpected passion not for literary theory, but for the visceral choreography of a dinner rush. He loved the controlled chaos, the immediate problem-solving, and the tangible satisfaction of a well-run service. After graduating, faced with the prospect of a stuffy graduate program, he chose the clatter of plates and the warmth of the kitchen. His parents saw it as a failure; Dmitri saw it as finding his native language.\n\nHis career became his life. He rose from busboy to server, then to assistant manager. A key turning point was a failed engagement in his early thirties; his fianc\u00e9e claimed he was more married to the restaurant than to her, and he found he couldn't honestly disagree. When the longtime manager retired seven years ago, Dmitri was the only choice. The owner, an old Italian woman who admired his relentless work ethic, even offered him the small apartment above the restaurant.\n\nNow 42, Dmitri\u2019s commute is a single flight of stairs. His day begins with an espresso at a downstairs table before the staff arrives and ends late at night in his apartment, reading a novel with the faint, comforting sounds of the cleanup crew below. His social life is woven into his profession; the bartenders are his confidants, the regulars are his extended family, and the neighborhood vendors are his community. San Francisco isn't a sprawling city to him, but this specific, historic enclave. His dream is no longer to be a professor, but to one day buy Caff\u00e8 Rossi himself\u2014to finally own the small kingdom he has so lovingly managed for most of his adult life."
