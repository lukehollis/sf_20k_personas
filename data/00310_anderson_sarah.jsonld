Raised in the academic enclave of Ann Arbor, Michigan, by a history professor father and a librarian mother, her childhood was filled with books, inquiry, and the gentle expectation of intellectual pursuit. She followed this path to the University of Michigan, but diverged from her parents\u2019 humanities focus, earning a degree in Linguistics, fascinated by the structure and logic of human communication.\n\nThe true turning point came when she realized this passion could be applied to the nascent world of digital interaction. She moved across the country to pursue a graduate degree in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction. This was her bridge into technology, not as a coder, but as a translator between human intuition and machine logic. Her early career was spent as a UX researcher, where her ability to understand user behavior made her invaluable. She rose steadily, from researcher to manager, eventually landing her current role as Director of Research and Development.\n\nNow 47, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by the integrated work-life balance she meticulously designed. After an amicable divorce in her late thirties from an architect who wanted a life far removed from the tech world, she leaned into her career, creating a sanctuary in a minimalist Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not with traffic, but with fresh coffee and a view of the city waking up. Mornings are for deep work, leading her remote team through complex projects. Afternoons often include a walk to a local bakery or a yoga session to clear her head.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but curated. She loves the city's intellectual vibrancy and world-class food scene but eschews the frantic nightlife. Weekends are for hiking in the Marin Headlands with a small, tight-knit group of friends or losing herself in a new project at her pottery studio. Her aspirations are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. Instead, Sarah dreams of leveraging her position to champion ethical AI and mentor the next generation of women in tech, ensuring the future she helps build is as intuitive and humane as the systems she designs."
