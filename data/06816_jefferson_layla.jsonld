Adopted as an infant by a loving academic couple in the Sunset District, she was raised amidst foggy avenues and a home filled with books. Her parents, both professors, nurtured her curiosity but also instilled a powerful expectation for a prestigious academic path. Layla was their bright, artistic daughter, but they envisioned her potential being channeled into law or medicine, a future she felt was written in a language she didn't speak.\n\nHer educational journey was a quiet rebellion. She enrolled at UC Davis, ostensibly to study communications, but found herself drowning in lectures that felt disconnected from real life. After two years of struggling to fit into a mold that wasn't hers, she made a terrifying decision: she dropped out. The choice created a painful rift with her parents, who saw it as a failure. Seeking independence, Layla returned to San Francisco, crashing on a friend\u2019s couch and taking the first job she could find\u2014a stockroom position at a clothing boutique in Hayes Valley.\n\nThis was her turning point. Away from the pressure to perform academically, Layla discovered a natural talent for visual merchandising and a genuine love for connecting with customers. She had an intuitive eye for style and texture. Her hard work and creative flair didn't go unnoticed; she was promoted to sales associate, and eventually, to Assistant Store Manager.\n\nToday, Layla\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She lives in a small rent-controlled apartment directly above the boutique, her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. Her mornings start with coffee from a local cafe before she opens the shop, styling mannequins and curating new arrivals. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow creatives and service industry workers she\u2019s met in the neighborhood. While her relationship with her parents is slowly healing, her true dream is no longer about pleasing them. She aspires to one day buy the boutique from its retiring owner, creating a space that is entirely her own. Quietly, she also saves money for a trip to Korea, a pilgrimage to connect with a part of her identity she\u2019s only just beginning to explore."
