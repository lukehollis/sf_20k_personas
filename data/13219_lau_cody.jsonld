Adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese-American couple in Daly City, Cody grew up straddling two worlds. His home was filled with the aroma of his mother\u2019s cooking and the pragmatic expectations of his father, an engineer who hoped Cody would follow a traditional path. However, Cody\u2019s report cards were a constant source of gentle disappointment; he wasn\u2019t built for textbooks and theorems. His creativity found its outlet elsewhere\u2014in the dramatic styles he sketched in his notebooks and the bold haircuts he gave his friends using kitchen scissors.\n\nHis parents\u2019 eventual acceptance of his passion was his first major turning point. Instead of college applications, they helped him enroll in a cosmetology program in San Mateo right after high school. It was there Cody truly thrived, discovering a natural talent for color theory and precision cutting. He graduated at the top of his class and landed a junior stylist position at a suburban salon, but he knew his future was across the county line.\n\nAt 22, he took the leap, packing his life into a few boxes and moving into a small, rent-controlled studio in Hayes Valley. He hustled for a chair at a chic, minimalist salon just a few blocks away, impressing the owner with a portfolio that showed both technical skill and artistic vision. The city was his true education. His clientele grew through word-of-mouth, each person a new story and a new canvas. They didn't just come for a haircut; they came for the hour of conversation and connection with the attentive young man who made them feel seen.\n\nNow, Cody\u2019s life operates within a vibrant one-mile radius. His day begins with a walk to a local coffee roaster, followed by the short stroll to the salon. He spends his days on his feet, transforming clients and sharing stories, his income built on a foundation of loyal customers. Evenings are for cheap, delicious dinners with his tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow artists, servers, and creatives\u2014or simply decompressing in his apartment, sketching new hairstyle concepts. San Francisco isn\u2019t just a city to him; it\u2019s Hayes Valley. It's the familiar faces, the hum of traffic, and the freedom to be exactly who he is. His dream is to one day own his own small salon in the neighborhood, a space that reflects his unique history: a blend of precision, artistry, and heartfelt community."

His father, an engineer, stared at them for a long moment, then looked up and nodded slowly. \u201cThis is your path,\u201d he\u2019d said in Cantonese. The weight of years of unspoken disappointment lifted in an instant, replaced by a profound, tear-filled gratitude. That single moment of acceptance from his dad gave him the unconditional permission he needed to finally become himself. It was the summer after his high school graduation.\n\n2.\nHis first night in the Hayes Valley studio, he remembers sitting on the floor because he didn\u2019t own a chair yet. The city hummed with a life that was both terrifying and thrillingly his own. He ate cheap takeout from a box, the echoing emptiness of the room amplifying his solitude. But looking out the window at the streetlights, he didn't feel lonely; he felt the exhilarating, sharp-edged freedom of a blank canvas. At 22, he finally felt like his life was beginning on his own terms.\n\n3.\nHe recalls the interview for the chair at the Hayes Valley salon. The owner, a notoriously meticulous woman, silently flipped through his portfolio. Cody\u2019s hands were clammy. After what felt like an eternity, she looked up and said, \u201cYou have a good eye. But more importantly, you have good hands.\u201d The praise wasn\u2019t just about the job; it was validation from someone who understood his craft on a cellular level. It was the first time he truly felt like a professional artist, not just a kid with a passion.\n\n4.\nA year into his job, a client came in after a bad breakup, asking him to \"just cut it all off.\" As he worked, she quietly shared her story. When he turned her to face the mirror, revealing a sharp, asymmetric bob that framed her face with defiant confidence, she started to cry. Not from sadness, but from relief. In that moment, Cody understood his work wasn't just about hair; it was about helping someone reclaim a piece of themselves. It cemented his desire to create his own community space.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a friend\u2019s birthday last year, crammed into a tiny Tenderloin apartment with six others, sharing takeout cartons of Pad Thai on the floor. Laughter bounced off the walls as they debated art and complained about rent. Surrounded by his chosen family of fellow creatives, all of them broke but brilliant, he felt a deep, anchoring sense of belonging. This was his San Francisco\u2014not the landmarks or the tech money, but this vibrant, resilient circle of people who truly saw and supported each other."
