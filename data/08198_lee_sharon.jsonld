The daughter of Cantonese immigrants, she grew up in a bustling, drafty apartment in the Richmond District. Her parents ran a small laundry, their lives a testament to relentless work and quiet sacrifice. Sharon, a dutiful and bright daughter, was meant to be the one who broke the cycle. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, aiming for a degree in business administration, dreaming of a corner office with a view of the Bay.\n\nHer path veered sharply in her sophomore year when her mother was diagnosed with a debilitating illness. Without a second thought, Sharon left school to become her full-time caregiver. The next five years were a blur of appointments, medications, and quiet moments holding her mother\u2019s hand. Her own dreams were deferred, then forgotten. After her mother passed, Sharon, then in her late twenties and without a degree, felt adrift.\n\nA temp agency placed her in an administrative assistant role at a non-profit providing supportive housing in SoMa. It was meant to be a temporary stopgap, but Sharon found an unexpected calling. The work was organizing, scheduling, and listening\u2014skills she had honed as a caregiver. The organization offered a small, subsidized apartment on-site, a lifeline in an increasingly expensive city. That 0.0-mile commute became permanent.\n\nNow, at 53, Sharon has been with the non-profit for over two decades. She is its institutional memory, the steady, calming presence in a place of constant transition. Her colleagues are her family, and the residents are her flock. She knows who needs an extra blanket and whose birthday is coming up. Her personal life is quiet; a long-ago relationship fizzled out, unable to compete with the demands of her chosen life.\n\nHer current days are structured and serene. She wakes to the sounds of the city, tends to the potted jade plants on her windowsill, and walks downstairs to her desk. Her connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t through its trendy restaurants or tech boom, but through the resilient, often invisible, community she serves. Her aspirations are no longer of corporate success, but of seeing the non-profit secure its next grant and, perhaps one day, saving enough to visit her parents\u2019 ancestral village in Guangdong\u2014a quiet pilgrimage to understand where her story began."
