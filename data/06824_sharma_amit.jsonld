The only son of civil engineers who immigrated from Jaipur to Fremont, Amit grew up surrounded by the Bay Area\u2019s gospel of tech prosperity. His parents, having sacrificed much, envisioned a straightforward path for him: a computer science degree from a top UC, followed by a lucrative career at a major tech firm. Amit, however, was drawn to a different kind of problem-solving.\n\nThe turning point came during his teenage years, watching his grandmother navigate the American healthcare system. A proud woman who spoke little English, she struggled with managing her Type 2 diabetes. Amit saw her frustration with confusing insurance forms, impersonal doctors, and a lack of culturally competent nutritional advice. He witnessed how systemic cracks could swallow a person\u2019s dignity. It was a slow-motion crisis that ignited in him a passion for public service. He pursued a degree in public policy at UC Davis, and then a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, focusing on health policy and management.\n\nNow 33, Amit is a Policy Analyst for the San Francisco Department of Public Health. His 0.0-mile commute ends at the desk in the corner of his sunny Mission District apartment. His days are spent deep in spreadsheets and policy briefs, analyzing data to identify health disparities in communities from the Bayview to the Richmond. He finds deep satisfaction in knowing his work directly informs programs that could help a family just like his own.\n\nHis life is structured and intentional. Mornings start with strong coffee from a local cafe before diving into work. He breaks for lunch with a walk through Dolores Park, observing the city he\u2019s trying to serve. Evenings are for decompressing, often with a run with his club that meets at Kezar Stadium or a trivia night with a close-knit group of friends from grad school. While he\u2019s professionally fulfilled, he hopes to build a deeper personal connection, maybe finding a partner who shares his values. His dream isn\u2019t a stock-option windfall, but to one day lead an initiative that fundamentally improves healthcare access for San Francisco's immigrant and non-English speaking populations, ensuring no one feels as lost as his grandmother once did."
