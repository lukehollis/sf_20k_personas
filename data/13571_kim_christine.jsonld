The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store on Taraval Street, she grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of diligence and the unspoken expectation of a practical career. While her parents envisioned her as a doctor or lawyer, Christine was a contemplative child who found her voice not in words, but in the charcoal sketches she\u2019d secretly draw in notebooks behind the store counter.\n\nTorn between familial duty and her artistic spirit, she chose psychology at San Francisco State University as a compromise\u2014a respectable science of the mind. Her turning point came during a volunteer internship at a youth center, where she witnessed a child psychiatrist use drawing to help a non-verbal boy communicate his trauma. It was a profound revelation; Christine realized she could merge her two worlds. Pursuing a specialization in Art Therapy was a difficult conversation with her parents, but when they saw the passion and purpose in her eyes, they offered their quiet, steadfast support.\n\nNow 28, Christine lives in a modest two-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, which she shares with a high school friend. Her daily routine begins with a Muni bus ride across the city, where she works as an art therapist for a non-profit serving underprivileged elementary school students. Her days are a whirlwind of paint, clay, and emotional breakthroughs, helping children navigate anxieties they cannot otherwise express. It\u2019s emotionally taxing work, but seeing a child\u2019s confidence grow through their creations provides a satisfaction that a larger salary never could.\n\nHer evenings are for decompression: long runs through the Presidio, exploring new restaurants in Japantown with a tight-knit group of friends, or losing herself in her own large-scale abstract paintings that fill her side of the apartment. San Francisco is not just her home; it\u2019s the canvas of her life. Christine dreams of one day opening her own community art therapy center in the city, a sanctuary where art can heal, offering the same solace and voice to others that it has always offered her."

Hidden behind sacks of rice in her parents\u2019 store, she was sketching Mr. Choi\u2019s wrinkled hands as he paid for kimchi. Her father found her, his shadow falling over the page. Christine froze, expecting a scolding. Instead, he just looked at her drawing, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes, and then quietly restocked a shelf. In that silence, she first understood that love could be expressed through quiet acceptance, not just words.\n\n2.\nShe was twenty, an intern watching a silent seven-year-old named Leo. The resident psychologist gave him a black crayon, and Leo drew a house\u2014a chaotic scribble with jagged lines and a tiny figure locked inside. In that instant, the sterile science of psychology and the vibrant pulse of her art fused. It wasn\u2019t just a drawing; it was a voice, a key. It was the moment she saw her future not as a compromise, but as a calling she had to answer.\n\n3.\nExplaining \u2018Art Therapy\u2019 to her parents felt like translating a foreign language. She sat at their small kitchen table, the air thick with the smell of doenjang-jjigae and her own anxiety. After her nervous speech, her father was silent. But her mother, who rarely voiced opinions on her career, reached across the table and touched her hand. \u201cIf it helps the children,\u201d she said in Korean. It wasn't a cheer, but it was everything: permission, understanding, and a blessing from the person whose approval she craved most.\n\n4.\nIt was her first year at the non-profit. A girl named Sofia, who hadn't spoken since a fire at her home, spent a month painting only gray smudges. Then one Tuesday, she dipped her brush in yellow. She painted a tiny, brilliant sun in the corner of her gray paper. Looking up at Christine, she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s coming back.\u201d Christine felt a wave of relief so powerful it brought tears to her eyes on the Muni ride home. This was the proof; this was why it mattered.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a particularly draining week, she fled to the Presidio for a run. The air was sharp, and the fog was swallowing the tops of the cypress trees. As she crested a hill, the Golden Gate Bridge appeared through a break in the clouds, glowing under the last light. She stopped, breathing hard, feeling the city\u2019s cool, damp embrace. It was more than a view; it was a deep, restorative breath that assured her this city, her canvas, would always be there to hold her."
