            "value": "Rohan Sharma is a product of San Francisco\u2019s foggy Sunset District, born to Indian immigrants who carried dreams of their son becoming a doctor or engineer. From a young age, however, Rohan was more interested in the tangible world. While his parents pushed academics, he was the kid who took apart broken radios and tinkered with the family\u2019s aging desktop computer, fascinated by its intricate guts. School felt abstract and distant; the logic of a circuit board was concrete and satisfying.\n\nThe major turning point came not from a choice, but a necessity. The 2008 financial crisis hit his family hard, and the pressure of a four-year university degree felt like an impossible burden. Prioritizing family stability, Rohan graduated from high school and immediately entered the workforce. After a few years in retail, a friend told him about certification programs for data center technicians. It was a revelation\u2014a career that merged his hands-on skills with the city's dominant industry. He pursued the certification with a singular focus, finally finding a path that felt authentic.\n\nNow, at 30, Rohan\u2019s life has a steady rhythm. He lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a short bus ride from his parents, whom he visits every Sunday for his mother\u2019s chai and home-cooked meals. His daily commute is a 3.5-mile journey on the Muni to a nondescript building in SOMA where he spends his days in the chilly, humming ecosystem of servers that power the digital city. He finds a quiet pride in his work; while others write code, he ensures the physical infrastructure holding it all together doesn't fail.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of high school friends, fellow locals who share his experience of watching their city transform. They connect over video games and Golden State Warriors games, a comforting link to their shared past. Rohan\u2019s dreams are grounded and practical. He\u2019s diligently saving for a down payment on a small condo, hoping to own a piece of the city that is his by birthright. He yearns for a stability that feels increasingly rare in San Francisco, content to be a vital, unseen gear in the great machine of the Bay Area."

Rohan spent the weekend on the floor, the computer\u2019s guts spread out around him, guided by a diagram he printed at the library. When the boot-up chime finally sang through the quiet apartment, the relief on his parents\u2019 faces was a new kind of approval. It wasn't for a good grade, but for making something broken work again. In that moment, his strange hobby felt vital.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe still sees his father\u2019s face at the kitchen table in 2009, the year he graduated high school. There was no argument, just a quiet, apologetic explanation of why a four-year university was impossible. The weight of the financial crisis wasn\u2019t a news headline anymore; it was a closed door. The grief in the room was shared and solemn. Rohan\u2019s ambition instantly shifted from a vague dream to a concrete purpose: he would find a way to become a pillar for his family, not a burden.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis first day inside a functioning data center during his certification, age 22. The instructor opened the door and a blast of frigid, humming air hit him. It was a symphony of machinery, a constant, powerful roar that vibrated in his chest. For Rohan, it wasn\u2019t noise; it was the sound of order, a physical manifestation of the digital world. He felt an overwhelming sense of belonging. In that chilly, mechanical ecosystem, he knew he had found his place.\n\n***\n\n4.\nDuring a massive city-wide tech conference two years ago, a critical cooling unit failed on his watch. While CEOs gave speeches just blocks away, Rohan was alone in the deafening heat of the hot aisle, manually rerouting airflow to prevent a catastrophic shutdown. No one would ever know. But as he wiped sweat from his brow, he felt a profound, quiet satisfaction. He wasn't building the future, he was ensuring it had a physical place to exist.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, watching a Warriors game with his high school crew, his friend Mark announced he was being priced out and moving to Portland. The news hit Rohan with a surprising force, a feeling of personal loss. That night, he obsessively reworked his budget, calculating what it would take for a down payment. The desire for a condo became less about ownership and more about defiance\u2014a quiet, fierce promise to himself that he would not be exiled from his home."
