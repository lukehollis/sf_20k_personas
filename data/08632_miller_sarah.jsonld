Raised in the manicured suburbs of Walnut Creek, she was the daughter of a pragmatic accountant and a steady schoolteacher. They encouraged a stable path, so Sarah dutifully pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History\u2014a single, romantic deviation\u2014before channeling her organizational skills into the booming tech world of the late 1990s. For nearly a decade, she was a project manager, navigating the heady, volatile landscape of a dot-com startup from a soulless cubicle.\n\nThe dot-com bust was her liberation. The sudden collapse of her company, and the ephemeral nature of the wealth around her, prompted a profound re-evaluation. This period also saw the amicable end of her marriage to a finance professional who couldn't understand her growing desire for purpose over profit. At 31, Sarah left the corporate world behind, taking a significant pay cut to become an entry-level coordinator at a small arts non-profit. It was the best decision she ever made.\n\nNow 49, Sarah is the indispensable Administrative Manager for \u201cArtReach SF,\u201d a non-profit that provides art supplies and programs to underserved public schools. She is the calm, organizational bedrock upon which the creative mission is built. She doesn\u2019t teach the classes, but she makes sure the teachers get paid, the grants are filed, and the lights stay on. It\u2019s a role that perfectly marries her innate practicality with the passion for art she thought she\u2019d abandoned.\n\nSarah lives and works from her sun-drenched Victorian flat in the Mission District. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her kitchen to a small desk overlooking a shared garden. Her days are structured by Zoom meetings and the satisfying click of a well-managed spreadsheet, punctuated by walks to local taquerias and coffee shops. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from the non-profit world. While she sometimes dreams of finally taking that trip to Florence to use her degree, her truer aspiration is local: to help ArtReach secure enough funding to expand into another school district, ensuring another generation of children can find their own voice through art. In the vibrant chaos of San Francisco, Sarah has curated a life of quiet, meaningful impact."
