Born to Russian immigrants who settled in the Outer Richmond in the late 1990s, Sofia grew up in a world of dualities: speaking Russian within the warm, pelmeni-scented walls of their apartment and English in the bustling schoolyards. Her father, a taxi driver, and her mother, a home health aide, instilled in her a profound work ethic and an awareness of the struggles faced by non-English-speaking communities navigating American systems.\n\nThe pivotal moment in her life came during her teenage years. When her beloved babushka developed a chronic illness, Sofia became the de facto healthcare navigator for her family. She spent countless hours on the phone with insurance companies, translating medical jargon, and advocating for her grandmother\u2019s care. This frustrating, firsthand experience with the system\u2019s barriers ignited a passion within her. After earning her bachelor's degree from UC Davis, she pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, determined to fix the very system that had bewildered her family.\n\nHer background and education made her a natural fit for the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Now, as a Program Coordinator, she develops and manages outreach initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access for the city\u2019s diverse elderly and immigrant populations. The work is demanding but deeply fulfilling, a direct continuation of the advocacy she began for her grandmother.\n\nSofia now lives in a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley. The 0.0-mile commute reflects her hybrid work schedule; she spends most days working from her sunlit living room, with occasional walks to the DPH offices near Civic Center for meetings. Her lifestyle is a blend of her new independence and old roots. Mornings start with coffee from a local cafe, while weekends often involve taking the 21-Hayes bus back to the Richmond to share a meal with her parents. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of friends from grad school and a few childhood friends who, like her, stayed in the Bay Area.\n\nLooking forward, Sofia aspires to move from program coordination into a policy-making role. She dreams of drafting legislation that creates systemic change, ensuring no other family has to fight as hard as hers did for basic care. For Sofia, her work isn\u2019t just a career; it\u2019s a love letter to the city that raised her and a promise to the communities within it."
