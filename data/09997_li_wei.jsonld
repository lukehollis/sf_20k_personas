His father, a skilled tailor, and his mother, a meticulous seamstress, opened a small alterations shop in the Richmond District. Wei spent his afternoons after school helping out, learning the value of hard work and customer service.  Witnessing their dedication fueled his desire for a more stable, less physically demanding career.\n\nHe excelled in his studies, the pragmatic nature of business administration appealing to his grounded perspective. He earned his bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University, juggling classes with part-time work at a local hardware store. This early retail experience planted the seed for his future path.\n\nA turning point came in his late 20s when he was offered an assistant manager position at a large department store in Union Square. He thrived in the structured environment, demonstrating a knack for managing both inventory and people. Years later, after several promotions and a move to a smaller, more community-focused retailer in the Inner Sunset, he finally became a store manager at 53.

It wasn't just a garment; it was a small bridge between their worlds, a tiny victory in his new, sometimes bewildering, home.  It showed him the quiet satisfaction of craftsmanship, even if it wasn't his ultimate calling. He was fifteen.\n\n2. That rainy afternoon at SFSU, cramming for a business final. Seeing the city out the window, gray and sprawling, he felt a quiet determination solidify. This degree wasn't just for him; it was a step away from the tiring work he saw his parents endure, a path to something different, something stable. It cemented his focus and fueled his academic drive. He was twenty-one.\n\n3. Guiding an elderly couple through the hardware aisles at his part-time job. Their gratitude, a simple \"thank you, young man,\" resonated deeply. Helping people, even in small ways, offered a sense of purpose that went beyond transactions. This humble experience nurtured his innate customer service skills and reinforced his desire for a people-focused role. He was twenty-three.\n\n4. Receiving the assistant manager offer in Union Square. Standing on the bustling street, the store's grandeur felt overwhelming, but the envelope in his hand felt like a validation of years of hard work and quiet ambition. It was the tangible proof that his path was unfolding, a significant step towards the stability he craved. He was twenty-eight.\n\n5. The first \"welcome aboard, Wei\" from a new employee at his Inner Sunset store. It wasn't a grand pronouncement, but the weight of leadership, of being the one responsible, settled in a comforting way. This moment marked his arrival at his current stage, a culmination of his journey, a place where his quiet demeanor could guide and support others. He was fifty-three."
