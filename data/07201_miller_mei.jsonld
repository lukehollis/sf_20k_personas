The daughter of an American journalist and a tailor from Hong Kong, she was raised in the fog-kissed avenues of San Francisco's Richmond District. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the scent of her mother\u2019s sewing room\u2014a space filled with silks, patterns, and the quiet diligence of creating beauty by hand. This early exposure to craftsmanship shaped her more than any formal schooling ever could.\n\nAfter high school, Mei bypassed a traditional four-year university, finding its abstract nature unappealing. Instead, she earned an Associate's degree in Fashion Merchandising from City College, a practical choice that felt true to her roots. Her career began on the sales floors of various Union Square department stores, where she developed an impeccable eye for style and an intuitive understanding of clientele. It was during this time she had a brief, passionate marriage to a musician, Ethan Miller. The marriage ended amicably within a few years, but she kept the surname; it felt like a chapter she had earned, a part of her own unique tapestry.\n\nThe major turning point came twelve years ago when she was hired to manage \"Aperture,\" a high-end, independent boutique in Hayes Valley. The offer included the coveted prize of San Francisco real estate: the charming one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop. This is how her commute became zero miles. Her life is her work, and her work is her life. She wakes to the sounds of the neighborhood coming alive, walks downstairs into her curated world of minimalist Japanese design and avant-garde European labels, and spends her days as a stylist, therapist, and trusted confidante to her loyal customers.\n\nNow at 44, Mei\u2019s life is one of curated intention. Her social circle is small, comprised of other local shop owners and a few long-time clients. Her dream is no longer about finding a partner, but about legacy. The owner of Aperture is nearing retirement, and Mei\u2019s quiet, fervent hope is to one day buy the boutique herself. She envisions it as the culmination of her journey\u2014a tribute to her mother\u2019s hands and a testament to the life she has so carefully stitched together in the heart of the city she has always called home."
