At 50, his 0.0-mile commute is a symbol of a life distilled to its essentials.\n\nBorn and raised in a quiet Ohio suburb, David was the artistic son of a practical carpenter. His childhood was filled with the scent of sawdust and the sight of his father\u2019s capable hands, but David\u2019s own hands were drawn to pencils and paper. He sketched fantastical buildings and reimagined his neighborhood, dreaming of a career in architecture. He was brilliant, earning a scholarship to a prestigious design program, where the ghost of blueprints finally began to take solid form.\n\nThe turning point came during his third year. A sudden, debilitating stroke left his father unable to work, and the family\u2019s small contracting business teetered on the brink. With no other choice, David dropped out of college and returned home. For the next two decades, he exchanged his drafting table for a toolbox, managing projects, balancing books, and supporting his parents. The work was honest but hollowed him out, his architectural dreams relegated to late-night sketches in a dusty notebook.\n\nAfter his parents passed away and he sold the business, David felt unmoored. With a modest nest egg, he made a radical decision. He moved to San Francisco, a city he\u2019d only ever seen in magazines, drawn by its reputation as a haven for reinvention. He settled in the Mission District, captivated by its vibrant, chaotic energy.\n\nHe found humbling work as an Arts Program Assistant, organizing workshops and managing supplies for the very community center he now lives above. He\u2019s not the architect he once planned to be, but he finds a quiet satisfaction in helping a new generation find their creative voice. His social life is small but meaningful, built around a weekly figure drawing class and shared coffees with other local artists.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is no longer of designing skyscrapers. Now, he hopes to use his latent design skills to help the center secure a grant to build a small sculpture garden in their neglected back lot. It\u2019s a smaller dream, but it\u2019s entirely his own\u2014a chance to finally build something beautiful in the city that gave him a second chance."
