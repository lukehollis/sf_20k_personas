Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, she was the only child of hardworking Taiwanese immigrants who owned a small, beloved neighborhood grocery. Her parents envisioned a stable, respectable future for her\u2014a doctor or a lawyer\u2014but Sarah was always drawn to stories. She quietly rebelled by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in English Literature at SF State, losing herself in novels while her parents restocked shelves.\n\nHer post-college years were a drift. She worked at a bookstore and a small publishing house, but felt the city changing around her. The first dot-com boom was a tidal wave, and on a whim, she took a temp job as a technical writer for a fledgling startup to pay her escalating rent. Surprisingly, she thrived. Sarah discovered a unique talent for translating the complex jargon of engineers into clear, actionable plans. This accidental entry into tech became her career. Over two decades, she methodically climbed the ladder from writer to QA tester to her current role as a Project Coordinator, a human bridge between code and concept.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 38. The amicable split prompted her to sell the home she shared with her ex-husband in the East Bay and move back into the city proper, this time to a sleek one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. The move solidified her independence and deepened her reliance on her career. Today, her 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse. Her days are a disciplined cycle of Slack notifications, video calls, and project timelines orchestrated from her standing desk overlooking Patricia's Green.\n\nHer social life is a small, curated circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and a couple of old confidantes from her literary days. Evenings often involve a pottery class or a quiet dinner at a favorite local spot. Having witnessed San Francisco\u2019s dramatic transformation firsthand, Sarah feels like both a native and an outsider. She misses the city\u2019s grittier, artistic soul but acknowledges that the tech boom gave her a stable, comfortable life. Her future aspirations aren't about climbing higher, but about finding balance\u2014using her WFH flexibility to travel more, and perhaps, finally, to start writing that novel she\u2019s been outlining in her head for years."
