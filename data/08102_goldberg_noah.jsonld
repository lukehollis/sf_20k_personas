The son of a corporate lawyer and a landscape architect, Noah grew up in a home that looked perfect from the outside. The turning point came when he was 16. His older sister, Rachel, was hospitalized for a severe eating disorder, shattering the family's serene facade. Witnessing her struggle, and the profound impact of a compassionate social worker on her recovery, planted a seed in Noah. He saw a way to translate his innate empathy into tangible action.\n\nHe pursued a Psychology degree at UC Santa Cruz, drawn to the coast and a campus culture that encouraged questioning norms. It was there he committed to a clinical path, leaving behind his parents\u2019 hopes of him attending law school. He was accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program, which prompted his move across the bay into San Francisco proper. He thrived in the city's demanding academic environment, finding a cohort of like-minded peers who shared his passion for community-based mental healthcare.\n\nNow 24 and an Associate Clinical Social worker (ASW), Noah is accruing his supervised hours at a community health clinic in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; he lives in a small, modern apartment on the third floor of the same building where his clinic occupies the ground level. His days are a whirlwind of client sessions\u2014often with young adults grappling with anxiety and trauma\u2014followed by extensive note-taking and weekly supervision. To decompress, he runs through the Panhandle to Golden Gate Park or meets his small circle of friends, mostly fellow ASWs, for craft beer at a nearby bar where they can cautiously vent about the emotional weight of their work.\n\nNoah\u2019s primary goal is earning his full LCSW licensure within the next two years. His long-term dream is to open a small private practice focused on adolescent and young adult mental health, honoring the experience that first set him on this course. He is deeply tied to Hayes Valley, a neighborhood that represents both his professional beginning and his personal independence\u2014a life built not on idyllic appearances, but on the messy, meaningful work of healing."
