The only child of a Black union electrician and a mother of Black and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage who managed a church office, Jordan grew up in a home filled with lively debate, social consciousness, and a deep sense of community responsibility. Though a bright kid, he was often unfocused in school, more interested in the social dynamics of the hallways than in his textbooks.\n\nA high school social worker changed his trajectory. Seeing Jordan\u2019s innate empathy and ability to mediate conflicts between peers, she took him under her wing, showing him that his \"people skills\" were a professional asset. This mentorship was a revelation. Jordan enrolled at San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree in psychology, then earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nNow a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Jordan works for the San Francisco Unified School District, assigned to a high school in the Western Addition. He is the calm center for students navigating everything from academic pressure and family instability to identity crises and community violence. He sees the city\u2019s deep inequities firsthand and works tirelessly to be a bridge for kids who might otherwise fall through the cracks.\n\nHis day begins in his modest Inner Richmond apartment, with a short walk to the N Judah Muni line for his 2.8-mile commute. The ride is his quiet time to mentally prepare for the day. Evenings are for decompressing with his partner of six years, Alex, a landscape architect. They share a love for long jogs through Golden Gate Park and exploring the unassuming culinary gems on Clement Street.\n\nJordan feels deeply woven into the fabric of San Francisco. He\u2019s frustrated by its challenges but fiercely dedicated to its people. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s grounded and tangible. He hopes to one day launch a small mentorship program connecting Bay Area professionals with at-risk youth. More than anything, he wants to continue his work, providing the same beacon of stability and belief that a social worker once provided for him."

Instead of a lecture, she looked at him and said, \"Jordan, you don't just see the fight. You see the *why*. That's a gift.\" It wasn't praise; it was a map. In his junior year of high school, those words gave his innate empathy a name and a direction, setting him on the path that would define his life.\n\n2.\nIt was with a sophomore, Maya, who hadn't spoken a word in school for six months. Two years ago, after weeks of meeting in silence, she stared at the scuffed floor and whispered, \"It's just so loud at home.\" The two words were a dam breaking. In that quiet confession, Jordan felt the immense weight and privilege of his work. It was the memory he holds onto during the hardest days, a reminder that every silent moment can lead to a breakthrough.\n\n3.\nA foggy summer evening last year. He\u2019d come home from work carrying the weight of a student's crisis. His partner, Alex, didn't press, just handed him his running shoes. As they jogged through Golden Gate Park, their synchronized footsteps were the only sound he needed. Alex\u2019s steady presence beside him loosened the knot in his chest, a simple, profound anchor. He learned then that shared silence could be as healing as any conversation, solidifying the deep, restorative power of their bond.\n\n4.\nHe was maybe thirteen, at the dinner table in his Oakland home. His father, hands calloused from the day's work, argued passionately about a local proposition. His mother, sharp and thoughtful, countered with its effect on their community. Jordan didn't fully grasp the policy, but he absorbed the feeling: that caring was an action, that justice was something to be fought for, even over plates of spaghetti. It\u2019s where he learned that compassion required active participation.\n\n5.\nThe N Judah lurched toward the tunnel at Duboce Park just last week. Through the window, the city was waking up\u2014a jumble of fog, ambition, and struggle. He watched the faces of his fellow passengers, each carrying their own unseen burdens. In that slow, 2.8-mile commute, he felt his purpose settle inside him. He was heading not just to a job, but into the city's complex heart, bracing himself to hold a small, steady light for the kids waiting on the other side."
