Raised in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she was the dutiful daughter of first-generation immigrants who poured their life savings and boundless energy into a small shop selling pineapple buns and egg tarts. They saw education as the only path out of their life of relentless early mornings and flour-dusted hands, and Mei, sharp and observant, internalized their ambitions. She excelled in school, driven by a quiet determination to validate their sacrifices.\n\nThe turning point came not in a classroom, but in her family\u2019s living room. She watched her grandmother, visiting from Guangzhou, struggle mightily with a tablet Mei had bought her, her face a mask of frustration as she tried to video call relatives. Technology, which felt so intuitive to Mei, was an insurmountable wall for the person she loved most. This moment ignited a passion. She pursued a Master\u2019s degree in Human-Computer Interaction, determined to bridge the gap between human intuition and digital design.\n\nNow, at 29, Mei is a Research Associate for a major tech firm. Her commute is zero miles; her sleek SoMa apartment, with its floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bay Bridge, doubles as her office. Her days are a cycle of virtual meetings, data analysis, and writing reports on user behavior, all conducted under the sterile glow of dual monitors. While she earns more than her parents ever dreamed, she feels a profound disconnect. Her social life is a small constellation of grad school friends and occasional, awkward dates arranged through apps she critiques for work.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is a tale of two cities. She misses the familiar comfort of the Sunset, the weekend dim sum with her family, the tangible reality of her parents\u2019 craft. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to eventually use her expertise to start a nonprofit that designs accessible technology for the elderly, a tribute to her grandmother. She aspires to create something with her hands, not just her mind\u2014to find a balance between the city of her past and the isolating, promising future she currently inhabits."
