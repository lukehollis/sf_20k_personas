Born in Vallejo to a nurse and a shipyard worker, his upbringing was steeped in the values of hard work and looking out for your neighbor. He carried that ethos to San Jose State, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration, believing financial stability was the ultimate goal. He landed a logistics job in Silicon Valley, a success by any standard, but the work felt hollow, a daily exercise in optimizing spreadsheets that felt disconnected from the world.\n\nThe turning point came at 29. Volunteering at a food bank in East Palo Alto, he saw his organizational skills translate directly into feeding families. It was a revelation. Within a year, he quit his corporate job, took a massive pay cut, and moved to San Francisco, seeking work with purpose. He found it in the Western Addition, his grandparents\u2019 old neighborhood, starting as an outreach worker for a small community non-profit.\n\nNow 42, Marcus is the non-profit\u2019s Community Program Coordinator. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his commitment; he lives in a small apartment directly above the community center he manages. His days are a blur of grant writing, mentoring youth in the after-school program, and organizing wellness checks for the elderly residents who have known him for years. His personal life is intertwined with his professional one; past relationships often buckled under the weight of his dedication. He remains single, but his life is far from lonely. His family is the vibrant, resilient community he serves.\n\nMarcus\u2019s connection to San Francisco is street-level, forged in corner stores and community gardens. He dreams not of wealth, but of permanence\u2014of securing the funding to purchase the building, creating a permanent anchor for his community against the relentless tide of gentrification. He sees his work not as a job, but as a stewardship, protecting the heart and history of a neighborhood that feels like home."
