Raised in the Outer Sunset, she is the daughter of a pragmatic Hong Kong immigrant father who ran a small hardware store and a third-generation Irish-American mother who taught second grade. Her childhood was scored by the rumble of the N-Judah streetcar and the constant, rhythmic hush of the Pacific. Instead of cartoons, Mei was fascinated by the intricate dance of the city\u2019s public transit maps, tracing the colored lines with her finger and wondering why it took her grandmother nearly an hour to cross a few miles for a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nForgoing a traditional university path, Mei found her education on the streets themselves. During a gap year, she started a blog, \u201cSF Unknotted,\u201d where she used elegant data visualizations and compelling photography to illustrate the city\u2019s transportation inefficiencies\u2014the \u201cghost\u201d buses that never arrived, the dangerous intersections for cyclists, the forgotten corners of the city that transit barely touched. Her work, sharp and deeply human, gained a cult following among urban planning nerds and frustrated commuters. This online portfolio became her resume. A small, forward-thinking urban design firm, impressed by her raw talent and ground-level insights, hired her as a junior planner, valuing her practical knowledge over a formal degree.\n\nNow 26, Mei works from her apartment in the Inner Richmond, her commute a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to a desk tucked into a bay window overlooking Clement Street. Her days are spent analyzing traffic flow data, modeling Muni route adjustments, and designing safer pedestrian crossings. She lives with her childhood friend, Alex, and their social life revolves around local haunts\u2014spicy noodles at a hole-in-the-wall, long walks through Golden Gate Park, and debating city politics over beers at a neighborhood pub.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of postcard views, but of intricate systems. She sees the city as a living organism whose arteries are clogged. Her dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but the quiet satisfaction of untangling one of its knots\u2014of designing a bus route that gives a senior their independence back or a bike lane that lets a parent safely ride with their child. For Mei, improving the city\u2019s flow is the ultimate act of love for her hometown."

The bus was twenty minutes late, and Mei watched the hopeful, then tired, look on her grandmother\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it was a weight on her Po Po\u2019s shoulders. That quiet frustration planted a seed in Mei\u2014a fierce, protective need to fix the invisible systems that wore down the people she loved.\n\n2.\nAt thirteen, she spent a Saturday helping her father organize the hardware store. He showed her the wall of small drawers for screws and bolts, explaining that finding the right part quickly was everything. \"A city is like this, Mei,\" he\u2019d said, tapping a drawer. \"It only works if you can find what you need, when you need it.\" That simple, pragmatic lesson stuck. She wasn't just looking at maps anymore; she was seeing the city as a machine, full of tiny, essential parts that needed to fit together perfectly.\n\n3.\nShe was nineteen, standing at the corner of Geary and Masonic, camera in hand. A bus lumbered past, empty, followed thirty seconds later by two more, both packed. A cyclist nearly got doored. In that moment of choreographed chaos, the name for her blog bloomed in her mind: \u201cSF Unknotted.\u201d It wasn't just anger she felt, but a powerful, galvanizing clarity. This was her classroom, these streets were her teachers, and she had finally figured out how to present her coursework to the world.\n\n4.\nThe email that changed everything came late one night when she was twenty. It was from a mother in the Excelsior who had used Mei\u2019s heat map of dangerous intersections in a neighborhood meeting. They got their crosswalk. The email included a blurry photo of a child on a tricycle, safe on the corner that was once a hazard. Mei cried, not from pride, but from the overwhelming feeling of connection. Her data points had a face and a name. Her work wasn't abstract; it was real.\n\n5.\nJust last month, looking out her bay window, she saw an elderly woman with a grocery cart pause, then confidently cross Clement Street at the intersection Mei had helped redesign. The fresh, high-visibility paint seemed to carve out a small zone of safety just for her. No one would ever know Mei\u2019s role in that tiny, mundane moment of urban grace. For Mei, it was everything. It was the quiet, profound satisfaction that fueled her\u2014one untangled knot in a city she would always call home."
