            "value": "Mei Lin is a San Franciscan by birth and by heart, a product of the city\u2019s foggy western neighborhoods. Raised in the Outer Sunset, she is the daughter of a pragmatic Hong Kong immigrant father who ran a small hardware store and a third-generation Irish-American mother who taught second grade. Her childhood was scored by the rumble of the N-Judah streetcar and the constant, rhythmic hush of the Pacific. Instead of cartoons, Mei was fascinated by the intricate dance of the city\u2019s public transit maps, tracing the colored lines with her finger and wondering why it took her grandmother nearly an hour to cross a few miles for a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nForgoing a traditional university path, Mei found her education on the streets themselves. During a gap year, she started a blog, \u201cSF Unknotted,\u201d where she used elegant data visualizations and compelling photography to illustrate the city\u2019s transportation inefficiencies\u2014the \u201cghost\u201d buses that never arrived, the dangerous intersections for cyclists, the forgotten corners of the city that transit barely touched. Her work, sharp and deeply human, gained a cult following among urban planning nerds and frustrated commuters. This online portfolio became her resume. A small, forward-thinking urban design firm, impressed by her raw talent and ground-level insights, hired her as a junior planner, valuing her practical knowledge over a formal degree.\n\nNow 26, Mei works from her apartment in the Inner Richmond, her commute a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to a desk tucked into a bay window overlooking Clement Street. Her days are spent analyzing traffic flow data, modeling Muni route adjustments, and designing safer pedestrian crossings. She lives with her childhood friend, Alex, and their social life revolves around local haunts\u2014spicy noodles at a hole-in-the-wall, long walks through Golden Gate Park, and debating city politics over beers at a neighborhood pub.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of postcard views, but of intricate systems. She sees the city as a living organism whose arteries are clogged. Her dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but the quiet satisfaction of untangling one of its knots\u2014of designing a bus route that gives a senior their independence back or a bike lane that lets a parent safely ride with their child. For Mei, improving the city\u2019s flow is the ultimate act of love for her hometown."
