The only child of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the late 1960s, she was raised on principles of diligence, practicality, and community service. Her father, an accountant, and her mother, a librarian, instilled in her a love for order and a fascination with how disparate parts create a functioning whole. While her peers were chasing the nascent tech boom, Sunita was drawn to the tangible, kinetic world of logistics, earning her degree from Cal State East Bay.\n\nShe began her career not in a sleek corporate office, but in the gritty, complex world of public transit. She joined the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency as a junior planner in her twenties and never left. For Sunita, the city\u2019s network of buses, streetcars, and cable cars was the ultimate puzzle. Her defining career moment came during a massive system-wide computer failure in the early 2000s; while senior managers panicked, Sunita calmly used old-fashioned paper maps and manual dispatching protocols to get a skeletal service running, earning her a reputation as an unflappable problem-solver. This event accelerated her career, leading to her current role as an Operations Manager.\n\nNow 54, Sunita\u2019s life is as orderly as the transit schedules she oversees. Divorced for nearly a decade, she maintains a friendly relationship with her ex-husband and is immensely proud of their son, who now works as an urban planner in Chicago. She lives in a modest but comfortable apartment in Hayes Valley, a location chosen for its central access to multiple bus lines. Her 3.8-mile commute is a daily field test; she rides the 21-Hayes or the F-Market, observing passenger flow, operator performance, and timing with a critical eye.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is functional and profound. She sees the city not through its iconic postcard views, but through its circulatory system. Her quiet aspiration is to one day see a truly integrated, world-class transit network for the city she has dedicated her life to serving. On a personal level, she dreams of retirement, not to rest, but to travel the world\u2019s great railways, from the Trans-Siberian to the Orient Express, finally becoming a passenger on the systems she so deeply admires."

Her mother, the librarian, stood before the towering card catalog, explaining the Dewey Decimal System. It wasn't just numbers; it was a perfect, elegant logic that gave every book its precise home. In that moment, watching her mother navigate the system with such grace, Sunita understood that order was a form of magic. It was the first complex system she ever fell in love with, the foundation for her entire life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nThe control room screens were black, the year 2002. She recalls the electric tang of panic in the air, a feeling she didn't share. While senior staff saw catastrophe, Sunita felt a strange calm. Unrolling the huge, crinkled paper map of the city grid felt like coming home. With a phone pressed to her ear and a marker in hand, she wasn't just rerouting buses; she was reconnecting the city\u2019s lifeblood, piece by piece. That day, she learned her own internal system was her greatest strength.\n\n3.\nHer son, then about ten, was pressed against the window of a historic F-Market streetcar. He wasn't looking at the Ferry Building, but at the tracks, the overhead lines, the way the operator worked the controls. \"How do you know where they all are, Mom?\" he\u2019d asked, full of awe. A wave of profound love washed over her. He saw it. He saw *her* city, the moving parts, not the static landmarks. In his question, she felt truly seen, and knew her passion would live on.\n\n4.\nLast Tuesday, riding the 21-Hayes during the evening rush. The bus was crowded, the air thick with the day's fatigue. An elderly woman using a walker boarded, and without a word, three separate passengers shifted to make a clear path to a seat. Sunita watched the small, unspoken choreography unfold. It was a perfect, spontaneous instance of human logistics, a moment of civic grace. For her, this was the real San Francisco\u2014not a postcard, but a system of people, moving together, making it work for each other.\n\n5.\nThe night she finished her divorce papers nearly a decade ago, she didn't feel sad, just quiet. She stayed up late, watching a documentary about the Trans-Siberian Railway. Seeing the train carve a singular, determined path through that vast, wild landscape felt like a metaphor for her own next chapter. A powerful longing bloomed in her chest\u2014not for a destination, but for the journey itself. She decided then that her retirement would be one of motion, finally becoming a passenger on the world\u2019s great systems."
