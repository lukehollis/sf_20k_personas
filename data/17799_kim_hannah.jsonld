She spent her youth watching them navigate the complex, often bewildering, world of business permits, tax forms, and city regulations. They were brilliant at their trade but struggled against a bureaucracy that felt designed to be confusing. Hannah, fluent in both English and Korean, became their de-facto translator and advocate, a role that planted the seeds of her future career.\n\nThis firsthand experience with systemic barriers fueled her academic journey. She pursued her undergraduate degree at UCLA, but it was during her Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley that she found her true calling. The tech optimism of the Bay Area, combined with her passion for equity, pointed her toward a unique path: using technology to make government more humane and accessible. The turning point came during the pandemic, when she spent a frantic week helping her parents apply for a small business relief loan through a clunky, unreliable government portal. That frustrating experience became her mission.\n\nNow, Hannah is a Policy Analyst for San Francisco\u2019s Office of Digital Services. Her days are a blend of data analysis, user experience research, and stakeholder meetings, all focused on a single goal: untangling the city\u2019s digital knots. She takes the 22-Fillmore MUNI bus from her Inner Richmond apartment to City Hall, a 3.5-mile journey that gives her time to observe the city she\u2019s working to improve.\n\nHer personal life is intertwined with her professional one. Her close friends are fellow Berkeley grads working in nonprofits and civic tech, and their conversations often drift from weekend hike plans to debates on housing policy. Her partner, Alex, is an urban planner, and their dates frequently involve exploring different neighborhoods and analyzing public spaces.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond, Hannah loves her proximity to Golden Gate Park for morning runs and the diverse, family-owned restaurants that remind her of home. Her dream isn\u2019t a corner office but a tangible victory: a city service website that someone like her father can navigate easily, without needing a translator. She aspires to one day lead a digital initiatives team, building a government that serves its citizens with clarity and compassion, ensuring no one is left behind in an increasingly digital world."

Her father, his shoulders slumped in defeat, handed her a dense letter from the city. She painstakingly translated the jargon about a permit renewal, her stomach tightening with each confusing clause. The look of relief on his face when she finished was mixed with a weariness that broke her heart. That day, a quiet, protective anger took root in her: a resolve that bureaucracy should never feel like a punishment.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM during the pandemic's frantic first wave. The government relief loan portal had crashed for the third time. Her father, exhausted, just stared at the error message. \"It's okay, Appa,\" she said, her voice strained, but a hot, shameful fury burned in her chest. All their years of hard work were being dismissed by bad code. In that moment of shared helplessness at the kitchen table, her vague academic interest in civic tech crystallized into a non-negotiable mission. This was her fight now.\n\n3.\nOn an early date with Alex last spring, they walked through the Mission. He pointed out the design flaws in a new public plaza while she critiqued the QR code for city feedback, noting its lack of language options. They weren't just talking; they were seeing the city through the same compassionate, critical lens. In his passionate analysis of curb cuts and her frustration with digital access, she felt a profound sense of home. She wasn\u2019t just working on a problem; she was building a life around its solution.\n\n4.\nLast month, she watched through a one-way mirror as a senior citizen, a monolingual Cantonese speaker, used a new portal prototype she\u2019d helped design. The woman navigated the translated instructions\u2014the ones Hannah had fought for\u2014and submitted the form in under five minutes. A small, triumphant smile crossed the woman's face. Tears pricked Hannah's eyes. It wasn't a launch or a press release, but it was everything. It was tangible proof that compassion could be coded.\n\n5.\nRiding the 22-Fillmore to City Hall last week, she watched a young mother use her phone to find a city preschool program while an elderly man squinted at a paper notice taped to the bus shelter. Hannah saw her entire mission in that single frame: the digital promise, the persistent divide, and the people who exist in the gaps between. The 3.5-mile journey across the city wasn't just a commute; it was a daily, grounding reminder of exactly who she was working for."
