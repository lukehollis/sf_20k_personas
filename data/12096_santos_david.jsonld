Growing up in a pragmatic, working-class Portuguese-American family in Modesto, he was a quiet, observant child, more fascinated by the \"why\" behind people's actions than the mechanics of the family\u2019s almond farm. This innate curiosity led him to study psychology at UC Davis, a world away from his upbringing. He pursued his passion further, earning a Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology from The Wright Institute in Berkeley.\n\nFor a decade, David worked as a practicing therapist, primarily with at-risk youth. While rewarding, the emotional weight of individual trauma became immense. The turning point came after a particularly grueling case where he felt hamstrung by a broken system. He realized he could have a broader impact by fixing the framework rather than patching up the individuals it failed. This epiphany spurred his transition into clinical research, where he could use data and program development to effect systemic change.\n\nNow, at 47, David is the Director of Clinical Research for a consortium that develops evidence-based educational and mental health programs for Bay Area schools. His days are a mix of data analysis, team management, and grant writing. His commute is a quintessential San Francisco experience: a 20-minute ride on the N-Judah from his quiet Cole Valley apartment to his office near Civic Center.\n\nDavid\u2019s personal life is stable and curated. A long-term relationship ended amicably five years ago, a casualty of diverging career paths, and he has since found comfort in a smaller, close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of academics and healthcare professionals. Weekends often involve hiking on Mount Sutro, browsing the Clement Street Farmers' Market, or losing himself in a new exhibit at the de Young Museum. He feels a deep connection to his neighborhood\u2019s village-like atmosphere, a peaceful anchor in the bustling city.\n\nHis greatest aspiration is to see one of his research initiatives adopted as a state-wide policy, creating lasting, positive change for thousands of children. Personally, while content, he quietly hopes for a new depth of connection, a partnership built on shared intellectual curiosity and the quiet comforts of a life well-lived."

The other men spoke in a mix of Portuguese and tired English. David wasn't interested in the broken pipe; he was transfixed by the look of determined exhaustion on his father's face. In that moment, he understood his path wasn't in the soil, but in deciphering the invisible burdens people carry, finding the \"why\" behind their weariness.\n\n2.\nAt thirty-two, he sat in his parked car after a session, the rain on the windshield blurring the Oakland streetlights. He\u2019d just spent an hour with a teen whose resilience was being systematically crushed by the system. David felt a chilling sense of futility, like he was bailing out a sinking ship with a teaspoon. The individual work felt hollow. He needed to stop bailing and start trying to fix the hull of the ship itself. That decision, born of frustration, reshaped his entire career.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon, five years ago. He and his partner stood in their nearly-empty apartment, surrounded by boxes. There was no shouting, just a quiet, logistical conversation about who would take which books. A profound, clean sadness settled over him. It wasn't a failure, but a mutual, gentle acknowledgment that their paths had diverged too far. That quiet ending taught him that love can conclude with respect, leaving not a scar but a respectful space for something new to grow.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, the N-Judah emerged from the Sunset Tunnel into the sudden, golden light of Cole Valley. David looked out at the familiar cafes and people walking dogs. Coming from the city\u2019s noisy core into this pocket of calm felt like a deep, satisfying exhale. He realized then that San Francisco wasn't just a backdrop for his career; the quiet rhythm of his neighborhood had become the pulse of his own life. This was home in a way the Central Valley never was.\n\n5.\nLast year, an email landed in his inbox from a principal in the East Bay. Attached was a short video of middle schoolers practicing a mindfulness exercise from his team's new program. Seeing the abstract data points from his research\u2014attention span, emotional regulation\u2014manifest as calm, focused children on a small screen was overwhelming. It was a tangible victory, a quiet affirmation that leaving the therapist's chair to redesign the whole room had been the right decision."
