His story, however, began amidst the sprawling farmlands of the Central Valley. Born to Punjabi Sikh immigrants who cultivated almonds and high expectations, Harpreet\u2019s upbringing was a blend of faith, community, and the unyielding rhythm of the seasons. While his parents saw patterns in the weather, Harpreet was fascinated by the intricate geometry of a leaf, the unseen code of life itself.\n\nThis curiosity propelled him out of the valley and into academia. He pursued a degree in computational biology at UC Davis, where he first learned to translate the messiness of life into the clean logic of algorithms. His ambition led him to a Ph.D. program at Stanford, a turning point that immersed him in the hyper-competitive, innovative heart of the Bay Area. It was there he found his calling: using machine learning to identify genetic markers for rare diseases.\n\nNow 30, Harpreet is a research scientist for a Mission Bay biotech startup, though his commute is a mere ten steps from his bed to his desk. His days are a disciplined cycle: a pre-dawn run through the cool fog towards the Panhandle, a strong cup of homemade chai, and then hours of intense focus, the quiet hum of his high-powered computer his only companion. He hunts for correlations in terabytes of genomic data, searching for a breakthrough that could change lives.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of contrasts. He thrives on the city\u2019s intellectual energy and diverse food scene\u2014often meeting his small circle of graduate school friends for ramen in the Mission\u2014yet his work requires monastic seclusion. He\u2019s deeply connected to his family, calling them weekly, but feels a gentle distance from the agricultural world he left behind. Harpreet dreams of leading his own research team, of publishing a paper that redefines a corner of his field. More quietly, he hopes to find a partner who understands his consuming passion, aspiring to build a life that honors both his heritage and the groundbreaking future he is trying to code into existence."
