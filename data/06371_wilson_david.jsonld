The son of a history teacher and a hardware store owner, he was raised on principles of fiscal prudence and Midwestern work ethic. While his peers were drawn to manufacturing, David was fascinated by systems and efficiency, a path that led him west for an MBA at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business in the early 1990s.\n\nHe initially entered corporate finance, but the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom was irresistible. David wasn't a programmer; he was the rare adult in the room who understood balance sheets. He translated chaotic venture capital into structured growth plans, a skill that allowed him to not only survive the subsequent bust but to become indispensable. His career became a steady climb through the ranks of established tech giants, moving from financial analyst to his current senior role as Director of Capital Programs.\n\nHis professional ascent, however, came at a personal cost. A marriage, strained by 80-hour workweeks and the relentless pressure of IPOs, ended amicably over a decade ago. His greatest pride is his daughter, now studying art history at NYU, though he harbors a quiet regret for the time his career stole from her childhood. The pandemic was his most recent turning point, dissolving his daily Caltrain commute and confining his vast professional world to his Cole Valley Victorian.\n\nNow, David\u2019s 0.0-mile commute defines his life. Mornings begin with a walk to a neighborhood caf\u00e9, followed by a day of global Zoom calls from his home office, orchestrating multi-million-dollar infrastructure investments. His connection to San Francisco has become hyper-local; he knows the trails in Sutro Forest better than the streets of the Financial District. He has achieved the financial security he once craved, but now finds himself aspiring to something less quantifiable. He dreams of mastering the Fender Stratocaster gathering dust in his study, taking a long trip to Italy with his daughter, and finding a local, meaningful project to invest his time in\u2014one measured in community impact, not shareholder returns."
