Born in Daly City to a stoic Irish-American father who worked the docks and a vibrant Filipina mother who was a master of stretching a dollar, Bridget was raised on a foundation of hard work and familial duty. The O\u2019Connell name was her father\u2019s, but her spirit, her features, and her innate sense of care came directly from her mother.\n\nHer dream was to be a teacher. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, finding joy in literature and history, but life intervened. When her mother fell ill, Bridget, the eldest, left her studies to help. The part-time jobs weren\u2019t enough, so she pursued a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification\u2014a practical path born from necessity. She discovered a quiet aptitude for the work, a patience she didn\u2019t know she possessed.\n\nThe true turning point came a decade ago. After a string of financially precarious years working double shifts at a nursing home and a relationship that crumbled under the weight of her exhaustion, she answered an ad for a live-in caregiver. The position offered stability and a roof over her head in an increasingly impossible city. This explains her 0.0-mile commute: her life and work are contained within the walls of a grand, aging Victorian in the Inner Richmond, where she cares for a sharp-witted but frail 92-year-old woman.\n\nHer San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or trendy restaurants. It is the four-block radius around her residence: the Clement Street Farmers' Market on Sundays, the corner grocer who knows her by name, and the quiet solitude of Golden Gate Park on her bi-weekly days off. Her connections are few but deep\u2014her patient, a weekly phone call with her brother in Sacramento, and a shared nod with other caregivers at the park.\n\nAt 50, Bridget\u2019s dreams are modest but fiercely held. She longs for a small apartment of her own, a space where she isn\u2019t always on call. She dreams of finishing a single college course online, just for herself, and one day visiting the village in the Philippines her mother always spoke of. Her hope is not for wealth, but for a quiet autonomy\u2014a life that, for the first time, would be entirely her own."
