Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and an accountant father, she grew up in a world of balanced ledgers and Dewey Decimal Systems. This environment fostered a love for order and narrative, leading her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature. She loved deconstructing novels, finding flawed character arcs and plot holes the way her father found rounding errors.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco at 24, not for a specific job, but for the vibrant energy and a college friend\u2019s spare room. Her English degree felt useless in the burgeoning tech scene until she landed a temp job in customer support for a small software startup. There, she discovered her true calling. She wasn't just solving user problems; she was meticulously categorizing their complaints, identifying patterns, and tracing them back to underlying bugs in the code.\n\nThis knack for spotting inconsistencies was her entry into Quality Assurance. She built her career brick by brick, moving from QA tester to team lead, and finally to her current role as a Quality Control Manager. A key turning point was the dissolution of a serious relationship in her late twenties, which forced her to ground her identity solely in her career and friendships, making her fiercely self-reliant.\n\nNow, at 39, Sarah\u2019s 0.0-mile commute defines her routine. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its foggy quiet and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her day starts with a walk to a local bakery for coffee, a small ritual to force her out of the house before a day of Zoom calls managing her remote team. She combats the isolation of remote work with a weekly pottery class and a non-negotiable Friday night dinner with a tight-knit group of friends.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but hyperlocal. She rarely ventures downtown, preferring the familiar comfort of her neighborhood. She dreams of one day buying a small condo in the city, a tangible symbol of her hard-won stability. A quieter, more distant dream is to one day open a small, curated bookstore\u2014a final, perfect synthesis of her literary past and her meticulously organized present."
