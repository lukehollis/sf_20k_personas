The only son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of his parents' small grocery store. They envisioned a straightforward path for him: a STEM degree from Berkeley, a lucrative tech job, and the stable, comfortable life they had sacrificed everything to provide. David dutifully followed their script, enrolling in computer science at UC Berkeley, but found the code and algorithms felt hollow. It was his volunteer work at a Berkeley-based housing rights organization that truly sparked something within him.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. After spending a week helping a family navigate the labyrinthine bureaucracy to avoid eviction, he felt a clarity that programming had never offered. He changed his major the next semester, eventually earning a Master of Social Work (MSW). His parents were initially devastated, viewing his choice as a rejection of their dreams.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, David has been a live-in case manager at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin, which explains his zero-mile commute. His small, spartan apartment is in the same building as the residents he serves, blurring the line between his work and his life. His days are a relentless cycle of crisis de-escalation, connecting residents to mental health services, navigating benefits systems, and celebrating small victories\u2014a month of sobriety, a re-established family connection.\n\nHis all-consuming job has come at a personal cost. A long-term relationship ended years ago, unable to withstand the constant emotional toll and lack of boundaries. Now, his closest connections are a tight-knit group of fellow social workers who understand the gallows humor and profound exhaustion of their field. His relationship with his aging parents has healed; seeing his unwavering dedication, they now express a quiet, profound pride.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of picturesque cable cars or Golden Gate vistas. It is the raw, unfiltered reality of the Tenderloin. He knows the city by its chorus of sirens, its street-corner congregations, and the resilient humanity that perseveres against all odds. His dream isn\u2019t to get rich or escape; it\u2019s to secure funding for a small rooftop garden for his residents, a quiet space of green amidst the concrete. It\u2019s a small, tangible hope in a life dedicated to mending the city, one person at a time."
