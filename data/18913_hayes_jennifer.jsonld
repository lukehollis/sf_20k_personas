Raised in the fog-drenched avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she was the only child of Taiwanese immigrants. Her parents, who ran a small neighborhood pharmacy, preached the gospel of hard work and stability, hoping she would pursue medicine. Jennifer, however, was always more fascinated by the intricate dynamics between people than by biology. She saw the silent workplace struggles of her parents and their customers, planting the seed for her future career.\n\nAt UC Berkeley, she found her calling in psychology, eventually earning a Master's in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from San Francisco State University. Her first job was in Human Resources for a rising tech firm during the initial dot-com boom of the late 90s. It was a whirlwind of stock options, lavish parties, and a feeling of endless possibility. It was also where she met and married a software engineer, David Hayes, blending her family name with his.\n\nThe dot-com bust of 2001 was her crucible. She was tasked with laying off hundreds of colleagues, witnessing firsthand the human cost of poor leadership and abrupt change. The experience was shattering but clarifying. She left the corporate world, divorced David amicably a few years later, and used her severance to launch her own consultancy. She kept the name Hayes for the sake of professional continuity and for her son, Leo.\n\nToday, Jennifer is a highly sought-after executive coach. From her tasteful Hayes Valley condo, she walks 1.5 miles each morning to her minimalist office space, a ritual that grounds her. Her days are filled with coaching C-suite executives on empathy, resilience, and effective communication. She is successful, living a life of curated intention. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of professional women, and she maintains a close, long-distance relationship with Leo, now at college in New York.\n\nJennifer\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and layered. She has watched it morph from a scrappy, bohemian hub to a global tech capital, holding both nostalgia for the past and appreciation for the present. Her aspiration is no longer about climbing a ladder but deepening her impact. She dreams of writing a book on compassionate leadership and taking on more pro-bono work for local non-profits, ensuring the city that shaped her continues to be a place where people can thrive."
