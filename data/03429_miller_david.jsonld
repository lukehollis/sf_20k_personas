Born in Fremont to first-generation Korean immigrants, his engineer father and homemaker mother saw the name as a key to unlocking an American future free from the friction they had experienced. From a young age, David absorbed their ambition. He was quiet and studious, finding a natural elegance in the logic of mathematics, a stark contrast to the chaotic social hierarchies of school.\n\nHis path seemed pre-written: a STEM degree and a stable job in Silicon Valley. He dutifully enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s economics program but found himself drawn more to the complex statistical models than the macroeconomic theories. This led him to a Master\u2019s in Statistics at Stanford, where he fell in love with machine learning. He wasn\u2019t a coder by heart; he was a pattern-seeker, a storyteller who used data as his language. His career ascent was swift, landing him a Senior Data Scientist role where he now translates billions of user interactions into predictive models from the comfort of his apartment.\n\nThe mandated shift to remote work was the defining turning point of his adult life. The 0.0-mile commute dissolved the boundary between his work and his world, and initially, he felt adrift. But he soon discovered a freedom he never knew he craved. He shed the performative hustle of office life and started building a life within a ten-block radius of his Hayes Valley apartment.\n\nHis days now follow a quiet rhythm. A meticulously prepared pour-over coffee starts a morning of deep work. A midday run to Alamo Square clears his head. His evenings are his rebellion against the digital world. He found an unexpected solace in the tactile, messy art of pottery at a local studio, where the focus required to center clay on a wheel silences the unending stream of data in his mind. His social life is small but meaningful\u2014a few friends from college and newer acquaintances from the studio.\n\nAt 38, David has achieved the success his parents dreamed of, but his own aspirations have shifted. He no longer dreams of a promotion. He dreams of using his skills for a climate tech non-profit, of taking a three-week trip to Japan without his laptop, and of finding a partner who understands that a perfect evening can be a shared silence, watching the city lights flicker on from his window."

It wasn't his passion, but it was the logical step, the next node in the path his parents had mapped. His father had smiled then, a rare, uncomplicated expression of pride. In that moment, David felt the full weight of his American name\u2014a tool for his parents' dream. He accepted it not with joy, but with the quiet resolve of a son fulfilling a contract he never signed.\n\n2.\nThe VP of Product called his model \u201cmagic\u201d after a presentation. David was 32, and the algorithm he built was saving the company millions. He should have felt triumphant. Instead, sitting in his car in the sterile parking garage, he just felt empty. He had successfully predicted the behavior of ten million strangers, but couldn't predict his own profound indifference. That hollow victory was the first hairline crack in the foundation of the life he was supposed to want.\n\n3.\nThe first day of the mandated work-from-home, his apartment was utterly silent. The usual 7 AM hum of the city preparing for its commute was gone. He sat before his monitors and felt a wave of vertigo, as if the office had been the north star of his life and it had just vanished. There was no boundary, no destination, no performative hustle to put on. That terrifying, formless freedom was the moment the map of his life was erased, forcing him to draw his own.\n\n4.\nHis first lump of clay on the pottery wheel was a disaster. He tried to force it to center, applying the same intense logic he used for data models, but it just wobbled and collapsed. He expected frustration, but what came was a deep, belly laugh. He was covered in wet clay, a complete failure by every metric, and yet he felt more present than he had in years. It was the first time he understood the joy of a process that couldn't be optimized.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, watching the lights on the Bay Bridge flicker on, the thought of taking a three-week trip to Japan surfaced not as an escape, but as a possibility. He imagined walking through Kyoto without his laptop, without a single dataset to analyze. The thought didn\u2019t create anxiety about work; it sparked a quiet, breathtaking sense of desire. It was the memory of a future he was finally allowing himself to want, a life measured not in achievements, but in moments of unplugged peace."
