Born and raised in a working-class Irish-American neighborhood in South Boston, his upbringing was defined by practicality. His father, a union carpenter, and his mother, a school administrator, preached the value of a steady job and a college degree as the unquestionable path to stability.\n\nLiam dutifully enrolled in a business program at a state college, but his trajectory was derailed during his sophomore year when his father suffered a serious on-the-job injury. Liam dropped out to work full-time, helping his family navigate the financial and emotional fallout. The temporary measure became permanent; the momentum was lost. Once his father recovered, Boston felt too small, filled with the ghosts of a future he\u2019d been forced to abandon. Seeking anonymity and a fresh start, he followed a friend to San Francisco at age 22.\n\nHe landed a stockroom job at a high-end men's clothing boutique in Hayes Valley, a world away from the Boston docks. But his ingrained work ethic and natural, easygoing charm didn't go unnoticed. He moved to the sales floor, then became an assistant manager, and finally, at 26, the Store Manager. He now lives in a small apartment above a bakery just three blocks from work, making his commute a short, familiar stroll.\n\nHis daily routine is a ritual: the smell of fresh bread waking him, a coffee from his regular spot, the ten-hour shifts managing inventory and staff, and an after-work beer at a nearby bar where he knows the bartenders by name. His social circle is tight, a mix of fellow service industry workers who understand the grind.\n\nLiam is good at his job, but a quiet dissatisfaction simmers beneath the surface. At 27, he feels the weight of his \"some college\" status in a city obsessed with credentials. He dreams of finishing his degree online or, more ambitiously, leveraging his retail experience to open a small, unpretentious neighborhood bar of his own\u2014something with the soul of Boston in the heart of San Francisco. He loves the city for allowing him to reinvent himself, yet he often feels like an outsider looking in, managing the lifestyle for others while still figuring out how to build his own."
