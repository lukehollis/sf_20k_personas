Born in Fremont to first-generation Indian immigrants, he grew up in the shadow of Silicon Valley\u2019s pragmatic ambition. His father, a software engineer, envisioned a similar path for Anil, filled with logic and lucrative code. But it was his mother, a homemaker who filled their suburban home with the vibrant colors of her saris and the intricate melodies of classical sitar music, who quietly nurtured his soul. For Anil, art wasn't a frivolity; it was an essential, structured system, as complex and beautiful as any algorithm.\n\nHis choice to pursue a Bachelor's in Arts Management was a quiet rebellion, a compromise between his father\u2019s practicality and his own passion. He landed an internship at SFMOMA during college and never truly left. He found his calling not in creating art, but in creating the space for it to be seen. Anil excelled at untangling the logistical knots of multi-million-dollar exhibitions, coordinating everything from international shipping to the precise lighting on a sculpture. His turning point came during the monumental Matisse/Diebenkorn exhibition; while curators debated aesthetics, Anil was the calm center of the storm, managing the complex operations that made the show a seamless success. His promotion to Director of Operations followed two years later.\n\nToday, Anil\u2019s life is a curated balance. He lives with his partner of eight years, David, an urban planner for the city, in a tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. His 2.8-mile commute on the Muni F-line is a daily ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s kinetic energy before immersing himself in the controlled environment of the museum. Evenings are often spent trying new restaurants in their neighborhood or hosting small dinner parties.\n\nAt 43, Anil feels a deep sense of accomplishment, but he isn't complacent. His dream is to pioneer a new wing at SFMOMA dedicated to digital and interactive art, a nod to the tech world he sidestepped but never fully abandoned. He aspires to create a legacy that makes the institution more accessible and dynamic, ensuring that the next generation, regardless of their background, can find their own story within its walls."

The meticulous turning of the pegs, the precise tension of each string\u2014it clicked in his mind. Across the room, his father\u2019s code scrolled on a screen, another system of logic. Anil didn\u2019t see a conflict. He saw two beautiful, intricate systems creating order from abstract rules. This was his first, silent argument for a life in the arts; a defense he would carry with him for decades. (Age: 10)\n\n2.\nHis first real day as an SFMOMA intern wasn't in a pristine gallery, but in the loading bay. He watched the team methodically uncrate a massive sculpture, their movements a quiet, practiced choreography of logistics and care. The air was thick with the smell of wood and the hum of machinery. In the organized, purposeful chaos, he felt a profound sense of belonging. This was his calling: not the spotlight, but the complex, crucial structure that held it up. (Age: 20)\n\n3.\nIn the chaotic final hours before the Matisse/Diebenkorn opening, a critical piece of lighting hardware was stuck in customs. While curators paced anxiously, Anil felt a surge of calm focus. He spent three hours on the phone, navigating international shipping codes and charming a port agent. When the dispatch notice finally came through, the relief in the room was palpable. It wasn't the art that thrilled him, but the victory of his system over chaos. That night, he knew he was a master of his craft. (Age: 36)\n\n4.\nHe remembers the first evening in their Hayes Valley apartment with David. Boxes were everywhere, but they had placed one perfect Noguchi lamp in the center of the living room. As dusk settled, they sat on the floor, sharing takeout and mapping out their future home on a napkin. David, the planner, drew the lines; Anil, the curator, envisioned the flow. It was the first exhibit they had ever co-created, an installation of their life together. It felt profoundly, peacefully complete. (Age: 37)\n\n5.\nRiding the F-line home last year, he watched a young woman on her phone. She wasn't scrolling social media; she was using an app to digitally paint over the passing cityscape, creating fleeting, augmented art. The idea struck him with the force of a revelation. This was the bridge he needed to build. Not just digitizing existing art, but creating a space for the art born from code itself\u2014a full-circle return to the tech world he\u2019d sidestepped, but on his own terms. (Age: 42)"
