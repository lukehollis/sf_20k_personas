A third-generation Japanese-American, she grew up in the sprawling quiet of a San Jose suburb, a landscape defined by cul-de-sacs and the necessity of a car. Her parents, a pharmacist and an engineer, had built a stable life far from the agricultural toil of their own parents in the Central Valley. For Sarah, life was a series of scheduled car rides, and she developed a fascination with the unseen systems that dictated where people could go, and how easily.\n\nThis fascination guided her to UC Berkeley, where she embraced a car-free life out of necessity. Relying on BART and AC Transit was a revelation. It was here, while pursuing a B.A. in Sociology, that she realized her true calling wasn't just observing society, but shaping its physical pathways. She saw public transit as a societal equalizer, a complex organism of schedules, infrastructure, and human behavior. This conviction led her to a Master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning, equipping her with the technical skills to turn her sociological insights into actionable policy.\n\nNow 37, Sarah is a transportation planner for a city government agency. The irony of her 0.0-mile commute is not lost on her. From her second-floor apartment in the Inner Richmond, she analyzes traffic data and helps design the future of Muni routes\u2014projects that affect millions of daily journeys. Her own routine is hyperlocal. Mornings start with coffee from a cafe on Clement Street, followed by hours immersed in digital maps and policy documents. Her lunch break is often a walk through Golden Gate Park, observing how people navigate its paths.\n\nThough dedicated to her work, Sarah maintains a curated social life with a close circle of friends from grad school, meeting for weekly dim sum or hiking in the Marin Headlands. Her dream is to see the Bay Area connected by a genuinely seamless public transit system, a vision she works toward one project at a time. Privately, she hopes to one day take a sabbatical to study the transit masterpieces of Tokyo and Zurich, not as a tourist, but as a student, always searching for a better way to keep her city moving."
