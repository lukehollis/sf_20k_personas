Raised in a quiet, predictable Ohio suburb by a teacher and an accountant, David always felt a pull toward something more chaotic and creative. He pursued this feeling through a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature, consuming novels and poetry while his parents quietly wished he\u2019d chosen business.\n\nIn 1999, at age 25, he was lured by the siren song of the dot-com boom. With a suitcase and a head full of literary theory, he landed in San Francisco, sharing a cramped apartment in the Haight. He found his footing not as a coder, but as a \"translator\"\u2014a technical writer who could make complex software understandable. He weathered the subsequent crash by freelancing, learning resilience as companies folded overnight. This era cemented his career path: he had a knack for shaping words and strategy, which naturally evolved into content management.\n\nThe key turning point in his personal life was his marriage in his early thirties and subsequent divorce a decade later. The split was amicable but hollowing, leaving him with a beautifully restored Edwardian apartment and a profound sense of solitude. It was during this period he fully embraced his Inner Richmond neighborhood, finding comfort in its quiet residential feel, a world away from the downtown tech scene.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is one of routine and contentment. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to a small home office overlooking a patch of green_space. His mornings start with strong coffee and a walk through Golden Gate Park before he logs on to manage a remote team for a mid-sized SaaS company. Socially, he keeps a tight circle: a bi-weekly poker night with friends from his early SF days and a nodding acquaintance with the owner of his local pub.\n\nThough financially secure, David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t professional advancement. It\u2019s personal. Tucked away in a cloud drive is the half-finished screenplay he\u2019s been chipping away at for years\u2014a gritty noir set in the very San Francisco he first fell in love with. He aspires not to move up, but to finish it, to create one lasting story that is entirely his own."
