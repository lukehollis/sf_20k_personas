Raised in Portland, Oregon, by an engineer father and a high school math teacher, her childhood was loving but steeped in practicality. Art was a hobby, not a future. Yet, Sarah found her true language in the hushed halls of the Portland Art Museum. This quiet rebellion led her east for a Master's in Art History from Boston University, a deliberate move to immerse herself in a world far from the sensible Pacific Northwest of her youth.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by the city\u2019s legacy of counter-culture and its vibrant, raw art scene. She landed a junior position at a small, ambitious gallery in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood then just beginning its transformation. Sarah\u2019s discerning eye and fierce dedication did not go unnoticed. The pivotal moment of her career came a decade later when the gallery's eccentric founder retired, choosing Sarah not just to manage the space, but to inherit its spirit. He sold her the gallery and the loft apartment above it, cementing her life and work into a single address.\n\nNow, at 47, Sarah\u2019s commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days begin with the scent of coffee and turpentine, overseeing installations and negotiating with collectors. Her evenings are often spent hosting openings, where her social circle of artists, critics, and patrons convenes. A significant long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of her all-consuming dedication; the gallery became her most demanding and rewarding partner. Living above her work means she is never truly off the clock, but she finds solace in the silent, moonlit gallery after closing, alone with the pieces she champions.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is tethered to this small kingdom in Hayes Valley. She has watched the neighborhood evolve, becoming sleeker and more expensive, and feels a protective duty to keep its artistic soul alive. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer about personal ascent but about legacy: to discover an overlooked Bay Area artist and launch their career, ensuring the creative energy that first drew her to the city continues to thrive."
