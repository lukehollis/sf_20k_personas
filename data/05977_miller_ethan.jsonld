            "value": "Ethan Miller\u2019s life is a quiet study in order and efficiency, a reflection of both his upbringing and his profession. Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants who had Anglicized their name from Mehta to Miller, Ethan was raised on the principles of stability and practicality. His parents, a software engineer and a dental hygienist, envisioned a secure future for him, one built on a sensible degree and a steady career.\n\nFollowing their wishes, Ethan attended San Jose State University, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration. He didn't have a burning passion for it, but he had a natural talent for seeing patterns and creating systems. This aptitude led him, almost by accident, into logistics after graduation. He discovered a quiet satisfaction in orchestrating the complex dance of global supply chains, solving puzzles of shipping containers and delivery routes from behind a screen. He was good at his job, and for fifteen years, that was enough.\n\nThe key turning point was the pandemic. As the world\u2019s supply lines fractured, Ethan\u2019s methodical work life became a chaotic, 24/7 crisis management role. The stress was immense, but it also solidified his value, allowing him to transition to a fully remote position. This shift fundamentally altered his connection to San Francisco. No longer just a place he commuted to, the city became his entire world.\n\nNow, at 39, Ethan lives and works from a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute offers a structured, solitary freedom. His days follow a rhythm: a morning briefing with his team in Asia, hours spent optimizing routes, and a mandatory mid-afternoon walk through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. He has a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly met through a weekly trivia night at a neighborhood pub.\n\nWhile his career provides financial comfort, the burnout from the pandemic left a lingering question of purpose. Ethan finds himself dreaming of something more tangible. Looking out his window at the fog rolling down Arguello Boulevard, he daydreams about leaving the abstract world of logistics behind. His secret aspiration is to one day open a small, specialized bookstore\u2014a physical space built on curation and community, a quiet haven of his own making."
