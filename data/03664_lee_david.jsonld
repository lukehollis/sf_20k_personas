The son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up amidst the clatter and fragrance of his family\u2019s small grocery store in the Richmond District. His parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned a straightforward path for him: medicine or law. David, however, was drawn to stories. He spent his youth devouring books, fascinated not by commerce, but by the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\nTo his parents' mild disappointment, he pursued a Bachelor's in History at San Francisco State University. While they fretted about his job prospects, David found a parallel passion building and troubleshooting computers, a lucrative hobby that paid his way through college. He discovered a surprising overlap between his passions: both history and IT required understanding complex systems, identifying patterns, and explaining them to others. This unique skill set\u2014the patient logic of a systems analyst combined with the narrative clarity of a historian\u2014made him a natural leader. He entered the tech industry through a side door, starting in helpdesk support and steadily climbing the ranks.\n\nNow, at 38, David is an IT Manager for a major tech firm, his 0.0-mile commute a permanent perk of the post-pandemic world. His apartment in Mission Bay is a clean, minimalist space overlooking the water, a world away from the crowded shelves of his childhood. His days are a disciplined rhythm of virtual meetings, system management, and solo walks along the Embarcadero. A key turning point was a breakup two years ago with a long-term partner who craved a more adventurous, less structured life. The split left him feeling isolated but also gave him the space to reconnect with himself.\n\nThough financially secure, a quiet restlessness persists. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t another promotion, but to finally merge his two worlds. He spends his evenings and weekends slowly developing a historical strategy game based on the Portola expedition and the founding of San Francisco. For David, the city isn't just a hub of innovation; it's a living archive. He remains deeply connected to its past, still visiting his parents in the Richmond every Sunday, a man whose future is built on code but whose heart is still lost in the pages of history."

Tucked behind the heavy burlap sacks, he would hide his library book on the fall of Rome. His parents saw a future in invoices and inventory, but in that small, dusty space, David discovered entire civilizations. It wasn't defiance, just survival\u2014the first secret world he built for himself. This taught him that the most important worlds are often the ones you keep hidden from view.\n\n2.\nAt his parents\u2019 small kitchen table, age nineteen, he finally said it: \u201cMy major is History.\u201d He watched his father\u2019s shoulders slump just a fraction, his mother\u2019s smile tighten. There was no anger, only a quiet, heavy \"Oh.\" In that moment, David felt the weight of their sacrifice and the sharp, liberating edge of his own choice. It wasn't rebellion; it was the difficult work of navigating love and self, a lesson in forging his own path with respect but without apology.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-seven, facing a chaotic server outage that stumped senior engineers. Everyone saw tangled code; David saw a timeline. He mapped the cascading failures on a whiteboard like a military campaign\u2014the initial incursion, the weak points, the chain of consequences. When he found the root cause, he knew. For the first time, his two worlds weren't separate. He wasn\u2019t a historian playing with computers; he was a systems analyst with historical perspective, and that knowledge gave him his confidence.\n\n4.\nThe first weekend after she left, his Mission Bay apartment felt vast and silent. He walked the Embarcadero, the gray water matching his mood. She had called his life a \"beautiful, predictable system,\" and now the system felt empty. But as he watched the rigid lines of the cranes against the sky, a strange peace settled in. This structured world wasn't a cage; it was his. The loneliness was sharp, but it was also clean, leaving room for something new to grow.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a Sunday drive after visiting his parents, he stopped at Twin Peaks. He held up his phone, an old Spanish map of the bay overlaid on the camera view. He saw not just towers and traffic, but the ghost of Portola\u2019s path, the logic of the Presidio\u2019s placement. It hit him then\u2014a jolt of pure clarity. This wasn't just history to be read; it was a system to be played, a strategy to be won. His restlessness finally had a name: the blueprint for his game."
