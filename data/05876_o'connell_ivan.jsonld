The son of a stoic Russian literature professor from St. Petersburg and a pragmatic Irish-American nurse from Boston, Ivan was raised in Berkeley amidst towering bookshelves and quiet observation. His name itself was a compromise, a nod to both sides of his heritage. He grew up feeling like a gentle mediator between his parents\u2019 distinct cultural temperaments, a role that would unknowingly shape his future.\n\nHis educational journey began predictably, pursuing a literature degree at UC Santa Cruz to please his father. But the abstract world of literary theory felt hollow. The turning point came when his mother suffered a debilitating stroke. Ivan, then 24, spent months in the hospital, witnessing not just the medical procedures but the emotional fallout. He was profoundly moved by the hospital social worker who guided his family through the labyrinth of fear, grief, and bureaucracy. It was a revelation; here was a way to apply intellectual rigor to the tangible chaos of human life.\n\nAbandoning his PhD track, Ivan enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at SF State. He found his calling in the demanding environment of hospital social work, specializing in crisis intervention and palliative care. For fifteen years, he navigated the front lines of human vulnerability.\n\nNow 46, Ivan\u2019s life has found a new rhythm. The pandemic shifted his practice entirely to telehealth, reducing his commute to the ten steps from his kitchen to the study in his Inner Richmond apartment. His days are a sequence of video calls, acting as an emotional cartographer for patients navigating illness and loss. He lives with his partner of twelve years, Marcus, a landscape architect whose work with earth and plants provides a grounding counterbalance to Ivan\u2019s work with the psyche.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. He decompresses on long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park and knows the vendors at the Clement Street Farmers Market by name. His aspiration isn\u2019t grand ambition, but sustainability\u2014for his clients\u2019 mental health and his own. He dreams of maintaining this hard-won balance, finding solace in his quiet neighborhood, his stable relationship, and the profound, demanding work of helping others heal."
