Raised in Daly City, in the shadow of San Francisco's fog, his father was a small-time contractor and his mother a bookkeeper. From them, David inherited a respect for well-made things and a pragmatic approach to life. While not an academic standout, he had a preternatural talent for perspective drawing and a love for the clean logic of architectural plans.\n\nInstead of a four-year university, he chose a more direct path, enrolling at the City College of San Francisco. There, he earned an Associate's degree in Architectural Drafting, mastering the art of the T-square and technical pen just as the industry was undergoing a seismic shift. David embraced the transition to computers, finding the exactitude of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) deeply satisfying. He became the guy who could translate an architect's sweeping vision into a buildable, practical reality\u2014a crucial but often invisible role.\n\nA key turning point came in his late thirties when a 12-year relationship ended, leaving him to reassess his quiet life. Instead of seeking a new partner, he doubled down on his independence. He secured a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a sanctuary he has now occupied for over a decade. His 0.0-mile commute began during the pandemic and never ended, a change his introverted nature welcomed.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are structured and peaceful. He wakes early, makes coffee, and walks through Golden Gate Park before settling at his workstation. His world is the hum of his high-powered PC and the intricate dance of lines on his multiple monitors. He finds a quiet satisfaction in his work, digitally preserving the bones of the city he calls home. His social life is small but sturdy, consisting of a few old friends from his drafting days for occasional dinners in the neighborhood. His dream isn't to design a skyscraper but to one day travel to Spain to see Gaud\u00ed's architecture in person. For now, he is content with his ordered world, finding beauty in the details and stability in the city\u2019s foggy embrace."

His dad didn't use a nail gun, but a handsaw and chisel, creating a perfect dovetail joint. David ran his small finger over the seamless connection, feeling the absolute precision of it. It wasn't just wood; it was an idea made solid and true. That quiet respect for a well-made thing settled deep in his bones, shaping his entire approach to work and life.\n\n2.\nAt City College, he spent a whole semester mastering the technical pen, his knuckles often stained with ink. Then, he sat before his first CAD program. With a click, a line didn\u2019t just appear; it snapped perfectly to an endpoint. He zoomed in, forever, and the line remained pure and sharp. There was no smudge, no imperfection. It was a moment of profound clarity, the clean logic he\u2019d always craved. He knew then he would never look back from the digital world.\n\n3.\nThe night after his partner of twelve years moved out, the silence in their apartment was a physical presence. He stood in the empty living room, the echo of his own breathing seeming unnaturally loud. He expected crushing loneliness but instead felt a strange, quiet expansion. This space, with all its memories, was now solely his to define. It wasn't a bitter end but the unnervingly calm beginning of his own sovereignty, a path he chose to walk alone.\n\n4.\nSigning the lease for his Inner Richmond apartment, he felt a relief so profound it was almost physical. He walked into the empty one-bedroom, a key cold in his palm. Sunlight, muted by the fog, filtered through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. This wasn't a grand triumph, but a deep, anchoring sense of security. He had found his sanctuary, a rent-controlled haven from the city\u2019s chaos. This was where he could finally, truly settle.\n\n5.\nThe first Monday of the pandemic lockdown, he woke up not to an alarm, but to the gulls crying over the park. He made his coffee and, instead of commuting, walked straight into Golden Gate Park. The fog was thick, muffling the world in a peaceful grey hush. There was no rush, no train, no office. Just him, his thoughts, and the quiet hum of a city on pause. It wasn't fear he felt, but a deep, surprising contentment. He had stumbled into the life he was always meant to live."
