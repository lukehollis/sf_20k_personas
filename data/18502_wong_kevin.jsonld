Born to parents who immigrated from Hong Kong in the 1970s, his childhood was scored by the clang of the wok and the chatter of Cantonese in their small but beloved Clement Street restaurant. While they dreamed of him becoming a doctor, Kevin was drawn to the quieter, more complex world of human connection. The turning point came in high school when his best friend\u2019s family navigated a devastating mental health crisis. Kevin saw firsthand how a compassionate social worker provided an anchor in the storm, and his path was set.\n\nHe pursued his undergraduate degree at UC Davis but returned home for his Master of Social Work at SFSU, feeling a pull to serve the community that raised him. For over two decades as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Kevin has been a vital link between the city\u2019s educational and healthcare systems. He works primarily with high school students, a pragmatic idealist helping teens navigate everything from academic pressure and family trauma to accessing gender-affirming care. His work is emotionally taxing, but he sees it as paying forward the support his friend once received.\n\nKevin\u2019s life is intentionally grounded. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute from his Inner Richmond apartment to the high school where he\u2019s based is a daily ritual of decompression, trading the weight of his work for the wind off the Panhandle. He shares his life with his partner of twelve years, Marcus, a landscape architect whose calm demeanor balances Kevin\u2019s empathetic intensity. Their evenings are spent cooking, walking their rescue terrier in Golden Gate Park, or unwinding with a close-knit circle of friends.\n\nAt 46, Kevin has no grand ambitions for wealth or power. Having witnessed the city\u2019s booms and busts, his hopes are more intimate. He dreams of establishing a small mentorship program connecting retired San Franciscans with first-generation students. For Kevin, a successful life isn't measured by an IPO, but by the stability he can offer others\u2014a steadying hand in the ever-changing, challenging, and beautiful city he will always call home."

The air, thick with the scent of ginger and his father\u2019s White Flower oil, felt sacred. While his parents tallied receipts, he\u2019d trace the patterns on the worn linoleum, feeling both immense love for their sacrifice and the quiet, certain knowledge that this world of clanging woks wasn't his. It was the first time he understood that his path would have to be different, a realization carrying both guilt and a nascent sense of freedom.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, sitting in his best friend\u2019s silent kitchen, the world had shrunk to the hum of the refrigerator. His friend\u2019s mom was weeping, and Kevin felt a suffocating helplessness. Then the social worker arrived. She didn\u2019t offer platitudes; she offered a plan. Her calm voice was an anchor in the chaos, a single point of order. In that moment, watching a stranger restore a sliver of dignity to a shattered family, Kevin\u2019s future clicked into place. He wasn\u2019t meant to heal bodies, but to mend fractures in people's lives.\n\n3.\nTheir first date, a walk through the de Young\u2019s sculpture garden, felt different. He and Marcus talked for hours, but it was the silence he remembered most. Standing before a hulking metal form, Marcus explained how negative space gave the piece its power. Kevin felt a jolt of recognition. After a day spent absorbing the frantic energy of traumatized teens, Marcus\u2019s calm, sturdy presence was the negative space he desperately needed. It felt less like a spark and more like coming home. This happened when he was thirty-four.\n\n4.\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon three years ago when a former student, one he\u2019d guided through a wrenching family court battle, walked into his office. She was a poised SF State sophomore now, home for a visit. She didn\u2019t say much, just \"I wouldn't be here without you,\" and handed him a coffee. As she left, Kevin looked out at the bustling schoolyard, a profound, bone-deep sense of purpose washing over him. The exhaustion of his work felt less like a burden and more like fuel.\n\n5.\nLast fall, after a brutal session with a student facing eviction, he pedaled furiously home. The cold wind off the Panhandle bit at his face, a welcome sting. As he crested the small hill near Willard Street, the setting sun ignited the windows of the pastel houses. The physical strain and the sudden, breathtaking beauty of his city seemed to scour the anguish from his mind. This daily ritual wasn't just a commute; it was a necessary act of exorcism and renewal, his private bargain with San Francisco."
