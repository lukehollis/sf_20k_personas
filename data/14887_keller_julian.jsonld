The son of a pragmatic aerospace engineer and a free-spirited ceramics artist, he grew up surrounded by homogenous tract homes that felt disconnected from both history and nature. This environment sparked a lifelong fascination with creating spaces that possessed integrity and a sense of place. He fled south for a Bachelor's in Architecture at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, before cementing his future in the Bay Area with a graduate degree from UC Berkeley in the early 90s.\n\nHe landed in San Francisco just as the first dot-com boom was igniting. His early career was a whirlwind of designing flashy, ephemeral office spaces for startups that often disappeared overnight. The crash in 2001 was a formative lesson. While his firm downsized, Julian remained, his design philosophy now hardened into a belief in sustainability, human-centric design, and architectural honesty over fleeting trends. This conviction guided his steady rise to Principal Architect at a respected firm, where he now leads teams on complex mixed-use and civic projects.\n\nNow 53, Julian\u2019s life is a curated study in urban harmony. He lives in a meticulously restored Russian Hill apartment, its bay windows framing views of Coit Tower and the bay. His 1.1-mile walk to his Financial District office is a daily ritual, a moving meditation through the city\u2019s textures and gradients, often punctuated by a stop at his favorite North Beach cafe. His marriage to a landscape architect, a classmate from Berkeley, ended amicably a decade ago; they remain friends, co-parenting their now-adult daughter who studies urban planning in New York. His social life is a tight circle of fellow creatives and professionals, often revolving around gallery openings, symphony performances, or quiet dinners.\n\nHaving achieved financial security and professional respect, Julian\u2019s aspirations have shifted toward legacy. He dreams of designing a landmark public building\u2014a library branch, a community arts center\u2014a structure that gives back to the city that has defined him. For Julian, architecture is no longer about building a career, but about building a better, more enduring San Francisco."

His client\u2019s logo, a jaunty, optimistic swoosh, was a ghost on the wall where it had been hastily removed. He felt a profound, hollow shame. It wasn\u2019t just a failed project; it was proof of his own transience. That day, standing in the dust of someone else\u2019s broken dream, he vowed to only build things meant to last.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe first morning in his Russian Hill apartment, sunlight streamed through the old bay window, illuminating the grain of the newly refinished hardwood floors. He was 39, recently divorced, and starting over. Looking at Coit Tower, he felt a deep, anchoring calm he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been chasing since childhood. This wasn't a tract home; it was a conversation with a century of city life. In that quiet moment, he finally felt he had built a place of permanence, starting with his own.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe was on a video call with his daughter last fall. She was talking excitedly about a Jane Jacobs passage, then pointed her laptop out her dorm window to show him a crowded New York street corner, explaining its \"intricate ballet.\" In her academic passion, he saw a perfect fusion of his pragmatism and his ex-wife\u2019s organic sensibility. A wave of pride washed over him, so intense it felt like a physical warmth. His legacy, he realized, wasn't just in steel and glass, but in her eyes.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOn a rainy Tuesday about five years ago, his walk to work was interrupted by a sudden downpour. He ducked under the rickety awning of a tiny shop on a North Beach side street. While waiting, he truly saw it for the first time: the intricate, worn tile work at the entrance, the soft patina on the brass handle. He felt a quiet communion with the anonymous craftsman from decades ago. This moment solidified his belief that the city\u2019s soul wasn\u2019t in landmarks, but in these honest, human-scaled details.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe thinks of a foggy evening at UC Berkeley in 1992, standing on a hill with his future wife. The San Francisco skyline was a phantom, appearing and disappearing in the mist. He felt a powerful, almost frightening sense of ambition. It wasn\u2019t the desire to add another silhouette to the view, but to understand the dense, layered soul of the place. That view, shrouded in uncertainty and possibility, was the moment he stopped running from Orange County and started running toward building a life in San Francisco."
