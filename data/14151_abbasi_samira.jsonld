Born in San Jose to Iranian immigrants who fled Tehran in the early 80s, she grew up in a home filled with the aromas of saffron and cardamom, and the weight of stories left behind. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a librarian, instilled in her a deep respect for both technology and the preservation of history. This dual inheritance became the foundation of her future.\n\nHer educational journey was a straight line from a suburban high school to UC Berkeley. Initially undeclared, Samira found her calling during a work-study job at the Bancroft Library. Tasked with digitizing fragile, handwritten letters from Gold Rush-era migrants, she was captivated. It wasn't just data entry; it was resurrection. She saw the digital ghosts of hopes and hardships and knew she wanted to be their steward. This led her to a graduate degree from Berkeley\u2019s prestigious School of Information, where she specialized in digital curation and preservation.\n\nUpon graduating, she landed a coveted position as a Digital Archivist for a major cultural institution in San Francisco, earning a comfortable salary that afforded her a life in the city she\u2019d always admired from afar. A key turning point was leaving her parents' orbit and finding her own small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. The daily 3.4-mile Muni ride to her Civic Center office is a cherished ritual\u2014a time to listen to history podcasts while the city\u2019s foggy landscape rolls by.\n\nHer social life is intimate, centered around a small circle of friends from grad school and her long-term partner, Liam, a landscape architect she met at a Golden Gate Park cleanup event. They share a passion for uncovering the hidden beauty in things\u2014he in neglected public spaces, she in forgotten digital files.\n\nSamira\u2019s dream is not one of climbing a corporate ladder but of pioneering a significant community project: an open-access digital archive of Bay Area immigrant stories, ensuring that the histories of families like her own are never lost to time or server failure. For Samira, San Francisco is not just a place to live; it's a living document she is dedicated to preserving, one byte at a time."

Not with anger, but with a quiet, bottomless grief for the lost faces\u2014grandparents, aunts, a baby she\u2019d never meet. The scent of saffron rice filled the air as her mother spoke. It wasn't just a book; it was evidence of a life she couldn't fully share. In that moment, Samira felt the weight of those ghosts and unknowingly vowed to one day build them a new home.\n\n2.\nIt happened her sophomore year at Berkeley, in the hushed quiet of the Bancroft Library. Her fingers, covered by white cotton gloves, traced the faded cursive of a woman writing to her brother from a dusty mining camp. The ink felt alive, a fragile electrical current connecting her to a forgotten soul's hope. An overwhelming sense of responsibility washed over her. It was then she knew her purpose wasn't just to read history, but to ensure its voice could never be silenced again by time or indifference.\n\n3.\nHer parents had just left, the scent of housewarming ghormeh sabzi lingering in her tiny Inner Richmond apartment. Samira stood at the bay window, watching the fog swallow the streetlights. The silence was absolute, a stark contrast to the constant hum of her family home. It was a terrifying, exhilarating void she now had to fill herself. For the first time, she felt not like a visitor to San Francisco, but a resident\u2014a small, new entry in the city's vast, living ledger.\n\n4.\nThey were at a Golden Gate Park cleanup, both wrestling a plastic tarp from a tangle of ivy. Liam paused, wiping dirt from his brow, and pointed to a patch of tiny, resilient wildflowers growing beneath a gnarled cypress root. \"They always find a way back,\" he\u2019d said with a small smile. In his fascination with that hidden, stubborn beauty, she saw a perfect reflection of her own work with digital ghosts. It was a moment of profound recognition, the start of their shared language.\n\n5.\nIt was a Tuesday morning on the Muni, the 5-Fulton rumbling towards Civic Center. A podcast host was describing the loss of Ellis Island's early passenger manifests in a fire. The casual mention of an entire generation's arrival story, turned to ash, hit her with physical force. She looked out at the diverse faces reflected in the window. Her community archive project wasn't just a nice idea; it was an emergency response. The Bay Area's stories were just as fragile, and she knew she had to save them."
