From a young age, she possessed a steady, calming presence, the one her friends turned to for advice. This innate impulse to help led her to SF State in the early 90s to study social work, eager to trade suburban comfort for the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy.\n\nHer life plan, however, was beautifully derailed by David Wei, a charismatic architecture student who saw the city not as buildings, but as a living poem. Theirs was a whirlwind romance, and by 22, Heather was pregnant and deeply in love. She paused her studies, confident she would return. But tragedy struck with brutal swiftness when David was killed in a construction site accident just months before their daughter, Lily, was born. Suddenly a single mother, Heather\u2019s life became a matter of pragmatic survival. She took an entry-level administrative job at the university\u2019s student health clinic, a position that allowed her to use her empathetic nature without the degree she never had time to finish.\n\nOver two decades later, Heather is the unflappable Patient Services Coordinator at that same clinic. Her $82,000 salary is the result of slow, steady advancement, just enough to afford her cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her life is a study in routine: the foggy morning wait for the 38 Geary, the familiar rhythm of scheduling appointments for anxious students, and quiet evenings with a book. The city, once a symbol of her future with David, is now the scaffolding of her resilience. Her connection to him remains through their daughter Lily, now a student at UCLA, and through her quiet appreciation for the Victorian architecture David so admired on her walks through the neighborhood.\n\nNow, with Lily independent, Heather feels a gentle stirring of deferred dreams. She contemplates finishing her degree online, not for her career, but for herself. She imagines traveling to the places in Asia David had sketched in notebooks. Heather Wei\u2019s hopes are not grand, but they are profoundly her own: to finally move beyond surviving and begin, at 48, to fully live."

He didn't just look at it; he spoke of it like a living thing, a testament to beauty after disaster. As he traced the dome against the twilight sky, she fell in love not just with him, but with his city, a place of living poems. It was the moment her predictable Sacramento life dissolved into a future of magnificent possibility, a feeling she would chase for decades.\n\n2.\nA week after his death in 1995, pregnant and numb, she opened his sketchbook. It fell open to a detailed drawing of a Victorian on her street, with a small, penciled-in note: \u2018Future home for the Weis.\u2019 The finality of it was a physical blow, more real than the phone call or the funeral. In that instant, the vibrant, poetic city he'd given her went silent and gray. Her dreams vanished, replaced by the stark, immediate need to simply survive for the baby he would never meet.\n\n3.\nOn a walk through the Inner Richmond around 2003, eight-year-old Lily suddenly stopped. \"That one\u2019s a Queen Anne, right Mama?\" she asked, pointing to a turreted Victorian. David\u2019s words, filtered through years of Heather\u2019s bedtime stories, were coming from their daughter\u2019s mouth. It was a gut-punch of grief and overwhelming love. In that moment, she knew her resilience wasn\u2019t just for her; it was the bridge that carried David\u2019s spirit across time to their child, her most vital, unspoken job.\n\n4.\nOne foggy morning in the late 2000s, rattling along on the 38 Geary, she looked out at the familiar storefronts. For years, the trip had felt like a measure of how far she hadn\u2019t gone. But on that day, it felt different\u2014it was a testament to her endurance. The predictable route, the faces of other commuters, the hiss of the doors\u2014this wasn\u2019t failure, it was the scaffolding that had held her and Lily up. This routine was the quiet, unglamorous shape of her strength.\n\n5.\nLast fall, in the profound quiet of the apartment after Lily left for UCLA, she found a box of David\u2019s old notebooks. Tucked inside was a series of sketches not of buildings, but of temples in Thailand and markets in Vietnam\u2014places he dreamed they\u2019d see. Tracing the faded pencil lines, she felt not grief, but a flicker of a new purpose. The sketches were no longer a memory of a lost past, but a possible map for her own future. It was the first time she thought about traveling for herself."
