Born in Fremont to a pragmatic Chinese-American engineer father and an idealistic Indian-American high school teacher mother, his upbringing was a blend of high expectations and compassionate intellectualism. The Lee household valued stability and success, with the unspoken assumption that Arjun would pursue a lucrative career in tech or medicine. He was a dutiful son, excelling in school and enrolling at UC Berkeley to study sociology, a compromise between his interests and a \"practical\" social science.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. Arjun watched his older cousin, once the vibrant heart of family gatherings, spiral into a devastating battle with opioid addiction and the bewildering bureaucracy of public health services. He witnessed firsthand the gaps in the system\u2014the cultural incompetence, the long wait times, the lack of follow-up. This raw, painful experience ignited a fierce sense of purpose that overshadowed his parents' career plans. He knew he couldn\u2019t build apps while people in his own community were falling through the cracks. Against his father\u2019s wishes, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning a Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 29, Arjun lives and works from his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute offers no separation between his work and his life, which feels fitting for a job that consumes his emotional energy. As a case manager for a non-profit, he supports transitional-age youth, many of whom are grappling with homelessness and mental health issues. His days are a marathon of video calls, frantic emails, and remote client check-ins.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is rooted in its services and its green spaces. He processes the trauma of his work with long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park, finding solace under the cypress trees. His social life revolves around a tight-knit \u201cfound family\u201d of grad school friends who understand his world. On weekends, they decompress over dim sum on Clement Street or explore the city\u2019s hidden stairways. Arjun\u2019s dream is to eventually move from direct service into policy, advocating for systemic changes to better fund and support community-based care. He hopes to one day make his parents proud, not by meeting their original expectations, but by showing them the profound value of the path he chose for himself."

Arjun watched him shrink, overwhelmed not just by addiction, but by the cold, impersonal system meant to help. The wait stretched for hours. In that sterile silence, a hot, clarifying rage replaced his academic theories. That day, sociology became insufficient. He knew he had to get inside the broken machine, not just study it from afar, cementing the purpose that would derail his parents\u2019 plans.\n\n2.\nThe silence after he told his father he was applying for his MSW was heavy, thick with disappointment. \"A social worker?\" his dad finally said, the words landing like stones. \"Arjun, we gave you everything so you wouldn't have to 'struggle'.\" He saw not anger, but fear in his father's eyes\u2014fear for his stability. Standing his ground was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done. It was the first time he truly chose his own definition of success, a painful but necessary cleaving that defined his independence.\n\n3.\nHis phone buzzed late one Tuesday\u2014a picture message from a former client he\u2019d helped into transitional housing. It was a photo of a slightly lopsided, freshly-baked cake on a clean kitchen counter. The text just said, \"First one I ever made in my own place. Thx Arjun.\" He stared at the screen, the exhaustion of the day melting away. It wasn't a policy victory or a big grant, but it was everything. It was the quiet, tangible proof that his work created spaces where people could simply *be*.\n\n4.\nAfter a brutal call with a teen in crisis last year, he couldn\u2019t breathe in his apartment. He just ran. He pushed himself hard through Golden Gate Park, the damp air burning his lungs, until he reached the Dutch Windmill. Leaning against the cool structure, gasping, he watched the fog snake over the ocean. The vastness of the water and the ancient silence of the cypress trees absorbed his frantic energy. It was a physical release, washing away the second-hand trauma and reminding him that he was small, but still standing.\n\n5.\nIt was a Sunday, crowded and loud at a dim sum place on Clement. Steam fogged the windows. Over baskets of har gow and siu mai, his friends didn\u2019t offer solutions to his work stress. They just listened, then seamlessly shifted the topic to a terrible movie they\u2019d all seen. In that moment, surrounded by the clatter of plates and easy laughter, he felt his armor dissolve. This was his family, forged in shared social work trauma and sustained by unconditional support. They didn\u2019t need him to be strong; they just needed him there."
