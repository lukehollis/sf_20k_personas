Her mother\u2019s long, brave battle with a chronic autoimmune disease meant Sarah became a caregiver by age ten, learning to navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system, decipher complex emotions, and offer comfort when professionals could not. This early, intense education in empathy set her life\u2019s course.\n\nShe moved to the Bay Area for her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn by its reputation and the magnetic pull of a city that promised acceptance and complexity. Her early career was a trial by fire in the chaotic environment of a major San Francisco hospital. For over a decade, she worked with patients and families at their most vulnerable, absorbing their trauma and celebrating their small victories. While fulfilling, the constant exposure led to profound burnout, a turning point that arrived just before the pandemic.\n\nRecognizing the need for self-preservation, Sarah transitioned to a telehealth role within the same healthcare network. Now, her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her kitchen to the spare bedroom of her Inner Richmond apartment, a space she has converted into a calm, professional office. Her days are a structured rhythm of back-to-back video sessions, providing therapy and support to patients navigating illness from the safety of their homes. This shift saved her career, allowing her to continue her vital work without sacrificing her own well-being.\n\nLiving alone after a long-term relationship ended two years ago, Sarah has cultivated a quiet, deliberate life. Her mornings often start with a misty walk through Golden Gate Park, a vital ritual to clear her head before immersing herself in the emotional lives of others. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few trusted friends, mostly fellow healthcare workers who understand the unique pressures of her field.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to eventually open a small, specialized private practice focused on supporting families of chronically ill children, bringing her life experience full circle. For now, she finds a hard-won peace in her routine, a quiet anchor in a bustling city, using her own resilience to help others find theirs."
