Born in Seoul, South Korea, he was adopted at eight months old by a compassionate, middle-class couple from Marin County. His upbringing was loving and secure, filled with hikes on Mount Tamalpais and the unmistakable fog horns of the Golden Gate. Yet, seeing a different face in the mirror fostered a quiet, persistent questioning of his place in the world, a feeling that would ultimately define his professional path.\n\nAfter earning a sociology degree from UC Santa Cruz, David felt a pull to understand the systems that shape lives. This led him to San Francisco State University, where he completed a Master of Social Work. His own journey of reconciling his Korean birth and American upbringing fueled a deep empathy for those feeling fractured or displaced. He found his calling as a Clinical Social Worker at a major San Francisco hospital, a role he has held for over fifteen years.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. The amicable but painful separation from his college sweetheart forced a profound recalibration. While once defined by his work, David shifted his focus to co-parenting his now 16-year-old daughter, Maya, and finding a sustainable rhythm for his own life. This shift is reflected in his commute: mostly non-existent. He conducts telehealth sessions from a dedicated corner of his cozy Inner Sunset apartment, the sounds of the N Judah streetcar a familiar backdrop. He walks the few blocks to the hospital only for critical in-person cases.\n\nHis life is one of structured care\u2014for his patients and his daughter. Mornings start with strong coffee and a walk through the fog-dampened streets to Golden Gate Park before his sessions begin. Afternoons are for case notes and check-ins with Maya about her school day. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and one old friend from his University days.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of quiet integration. He loves the city not for its glamour, but for its pockets of community. His hope for the future is not grand; it is to see Maya thrive and, perhaps one day, to take a trip with her to Seoul\u2014not to find what was lost, but to share the story of who he became."

A classmate, squinting in the sun, asked why his parents didn't \"look like him.\" It wasn\u2019t mean, just a question, but it landed like a stone in his chest. In that moment, the loving world his parents built developed a faint, invisible seam. It was the first time he truly understood he was a story with two different beginnings, a realization that would quietly guide his entire life\u2019s inquiry into belonging.\n\n2.\nHe recalls an early case, about twelve years ago. He sat with a teenage girl, a recent refugee, who spoke of feeling like a ghost haunting someone else\u2019s home. David saw his own quiet, lifelong questions reflected in her eyes. It wasn't just about clinical diagnosis; it was about bearing witness to another\u2019s fractured identity. In her silence, he felt the profound click of purpose. This wasn't just a job; it was his way of mending the world, one shared feeling of displacement at a time.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the first night in his Inner Sunset apartment, five years ago. Boxes were everywhere, the air thick with the ache of separation. His daughter Maya, then eleven, was silently helping him make her bed. He paused and just held her, the rumble of the N Judah passing outside. The grief was immense, but in that embrace, his world clarified and contracted to a single, fierce mission: her. His career was important, but from that night on, being her father became the undisputed center of his gravity.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a walk just last week. Morning fog clung to the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park, muffling the city's hum as he sipped his coffee. There was no grand epiphany, just a profound sense of rightness. This city wasn't a stage for ambition but a home, its moods and rhythms woven into his own. He felt less like a resident and more like a quiet part of its steady, breathing ecosystem. In that moment, he felt completely, peacefully settled in his own skin.\n\n5.\nHe remembers Maya looking up from her history homework a few months ago. \"Dad,\" she asked, \"if we go to Seoul, would you try to find your birth parents?\" He saw not just teenage curiosity, but genuine care. \"No,\" he said, a warmth spreading through him. \"The trip wouldn't be about finding them. It would be about showing you where *I* began.\" The past was no longer a question to be answered, but simply the first chapter of a story he was ready to share."
