The only child of a Black American jazz musician from the Fillmore and a second-generation Japanese American ceramicist from Japantown, Sora grew up in Oakland in a home filled with the sounds of Coltrane and the quiet scent of clay. Her parents taught her that art wasn't just an object, but a story of identity and resilience. This philosophy became her compass.\n\nHer path was forged at UC Berkeley, where an Art History degree felt less like a choice and more like a calling. After graduating, she embraced the grind, working low-paying assistant jobs at small Bay Area galleries. Her turning point came at 31 when she curated a small but critically acclaimed exhibition titled \"Intersect,\" showcasing contemporary artists exploring mixed-race identity. This caught the eye of a major San Francisco institution, and her climb began. Now, as Director of Curatorial Affairs at a prestigious SoMa museum, she shapes cultural conversations, a responsibility she carries with immense pride and weight.\n\nSora\u2019s personal life is currently in a state of quiet recalibration. Recently separated after a decade-long relationship, she finds solace in her routine. Her mornings begin with the rumble of the N Judah, a 4.8-mile journey from her calm Inner Richmond apartment to the downtown bustle. The commute is her time for reflection, reading catalogues or simply watching the city\u2019s diverse faces blur past. She cherishes her neighborhood for its proximity to Golden Gate Park, where she walks among the eucalyptus trees, and for the authentic food on Clement Street that reminds her of her complex heritage.\n\nThough respected and successful, Sora feels her most important work is still ahead. She dreams of curating a landmark international exhibition that re-centers narratives away from the European canon, giving voice to the artists her younger self desperately sought. She envisions a future where she can mentor the next generation of curators of color, ensuring the stories told on museum walls are as rich and varied as San Francisco itself."

From the other room, her father\u2019s saxophone plays a mournful, searching melody. Sora understands, for the first time, that these two things are not separate. The feeling of the spinning wheel under her palms and the sound of the horn weaving through the air become one memory, one identity. It\u2019s the moment she learns that a life, like art, can be built from different, beautiful pieces.\n\n2.\nAt 26, exhausted and underpaid, she was deinstalling a show at a small gallery near Laney College. It was 1 a.m. and she felt utterly invisible. Then she saw it: a small, overlooked photograph of a child looking into two different mirrors, their reflection split. The artist\u2019s statement spoke of navigating colliding worlds. It felt like someone had reached into her own heart and put it on the wall. This quiet validation wasn't just inspiring; it was a directive. She had to create more of these spaces.\n\n3.\nThe opening of \"Intersect\" was a blur of faces and praise, but the only thing she truly remembers is a woman standing before a canvas, her shoulders shaking. Sora watched as the woman\u2019s partner put a hand on her back. Sora later learned they were both mixed-race, and seeing their stories reflected with such dignity was overwhelming. At that moment, her ambition shifted from professional success to a profound, almost sacred duty. Her work wasn\u2019t just curation; it was affirmation. This happened when she was 31.\n\n4.\nHer first night alone in the Inner Richmond apartment, just last year. After her partner left, the silence was an active presence, a hollow ache in the room. She stood by the window, watching the fog swallow the streetlights on Arguello. Instead of feeling erased, she felt\u2026 quiet. The city\u2019s muffled hum was a comfort, not an intrusion. It was the stark, terrifying, and necessary beginning of her own story, unedited by anyone else. It was the first time in a decade she felt solely responsible for her own peace.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on the N Judah. A young woman with a T-shirt from the Museum of the African Diaspora was intensely reading a book on Japanese textile art. She had headphones on, her head bobbing slightly, and Sora imagined she might be listening to jazz. Sora saw her younger self in that passenger\u2014the same hunger, the same synthesis of cultures. A powerful sense of responsibility washed over her. Her success wasn't the summit; it was the foundation upon which others like this young woman could build."
