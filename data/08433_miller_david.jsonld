Raised by an emotionally reserved engineer father and a librarian mother, David\u2019s childhood was quiet and orderly. The family\u2019s emotional landscape was truly navigated by David\u2019s younger sister, whose severe anxiety cast a long shadow, planting a seed of purpose in him that would take decades to germinate.\n\nInitially, David followed a practical path, earning a graduate degree in Information Systems from UC Davis. He moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s and found success during the first dot-com boom, but the work felt hollow. The seismic crash of 2001 was his turning point. Seeing the human fallout of the bust, he realized he was more interested in the people breaking down than the code that failed them. At 32, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing an Education Specialist (Ed.S.) degree in School Psychology.\n\nHis career began in the trenches of the SF Unified School District, but David saw the limits of the system\u2014kids falling through cracks due to logistical and scheduling barriers. The pandemic accelerated a change he was already considering. Today, his 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his modern practice. From a book-lined home office in his rent-controlled Inner Sunset apartment, he provides tele-psychology services to students in under-resourced rural districts across Northern California.\n\nDivorced for nearly a decade, a casualty of the emotional demands of his work, David lives a solitary but not lonely life. His days are structured: a morning walk through Golden Gate Park, a coffee from the cafe on Irving Street, and then hours of patient, on-screen sessions with children and teenagers. His social life consists of a small circle of old friends and the familiar faces in his neighborhood.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is not of retirement, but of refinement. He hopes to develop better digital tools to help non-verbal students express themselves and to create a model for tele-psychology that feels as intimate and effective as a face-to-face meeting. For David, San Francisco is no longer a city of ambitious startups, but a quiet haven from which he can finally do the work that truly matters."
