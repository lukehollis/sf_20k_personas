Born in the Mission District to his Nicaraguan mother, Elena, his surname comes from the man who raised him: his stepfather, Mr. Wong, a kind and industrious Cantonese grocer. His biological father was a brief, complicated chapter in his mother's life, leaving David with his Latino heritage but little else. David\u2019s childhood was a rich sensory blend\u2014the sizzle of his mother\u2019s *gallo pinto* mingling with the earthy scent of dried mushrooms from his stepfather's shop on Stockton Street. He became a fluent bridge between two cultures, equally at home navigating Lunar New Year festivities and vibrant Carnaval parades.\n\nUninterested in the family grocery business, David pursued a Bachelor's in Rhetoric at San Francisco State University, fascinated by the art of communication and persuasion. He graduated just as the first dot-com boom was igniting the city. He wasn't a coder, but his calm demeanor and ability to translate complex engineering jargon into clear business objectives made him invaluable. A key turning point was surviving the dot-com bust; while friends chased fleeting startup glory, David found stability, methodically building a career as a production manager. He discovered his talent wasn't in inventing the next big thing, but in reliably getting it made.\n\nNow 48, David\u2019s life has settled into a comfortable rhythm. He works from his quiet Noe Valley condo, the 0.0-mile commute a welcome calm after decades of navigating MUNI. Divorced for five years, his primary companion is a scruffy terrier mix named Buster. His daily routine is structured by international video calls and project deadlines, but his connection to his roots remains strong. Every Sunday, he drives to Chinatown for dim sum with his aging stepfather, and he still cooks his mother\u2019s recipes, filling his modern kitchen with the aromas of his Mission childhood. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer professional, but personal: he hopes to start mentoring young, first-generation tech workers, offering the steady guidance that bridges ambition and reality, much like the name he proudly carries."
