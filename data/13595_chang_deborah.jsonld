Born in a cramped apartment in Chinatown to Taiwanese immigrants, her childhood was filled with the scents of her mother\u2019s cooking and the relentless hum of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Stockton Street. They envisioned a path for her paved with financial security\u2014a doctor or a lawyer. But Deborah saw the daily struggles of her neighbors, the kids who slipped through the cracks, and felt a different calling. Against her parents\u2019 wishes, she enrolled in San Francisco State University\u2019s Social Work program, a decision that caused a quiet but palpable rift in her family for years.\n\nHer career began in the trenches as a caseworker in the Mission District, navigating bureaucratic red tape to find housing for families and safe spaces for teens. It was demanding, emotionally draining work, but it affirmed her purpose. She married in her late twenties, had her son, Alex, and for a decade, tried to balance the immense pressures of her job with family life. The turning point came with her divorce at 38. It was an amicable but painful split that forced a new chapter of fierce independence. She threw herself into her work, climbing the ranks with a reputation for being a tough, pragmatic, and deeply empathetic leader. Her parents, now retired, finally saw the impact of her work and replaced their early disappointment with a quiet, profound pride.\n\nToday, Deborah lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is a ritual of city life: a brisk walk to the N Judah line, her commute a time for reading or simply watching the city wake up. As Program Director, her days are a whirlwind of grant writing, staff management, and advocating for the youth her organization serves. Evenings are for unwinding with a walk in Golden Gate Park or dinners with a close-knit group of friends, fellow veterans of the non-profit world. With Alex now away at college, her hopes are less for herself and more for her legacy: to secure a permanent endowment for her center, ensuring it will be a sanctuary for San Francisco\u2019s youth long after she\u2019s retired. She finds contentment not in wealth, but in the stability she\u2019s built and the countless lives she has quietly, steadfastly, changed."

A neighborhood boy was a few cents short for a soda, and her father impatiently waved him away. Later, Deborah snuck a candy into the boy\u2019s hand. The flicker of surprised joy in his eyes felt more valuable than the till's earnings. That secret act of defiance planted a seed: a person\u2019s needs were more important than their net worth, a truth that would steer her life away from her parents' path.\n\n_\n\n2.\nThe silence at the kitchen table was a physical weight. She was 18, the SF State acceptance letter laid between her and her parents like a border. When she finally said the words, \u201cSocial Work,\u201d her mother just turned her back to the sink. In that quiet, profound disapproval, Deborah felt the weight of their dreams for her shatter. It was the moment she chose her own path, a lonely but defining first step toward the woman she was determined to become.\n\n_\n\n3.\nEarly in her career, she finally secured a small, clean apartment for the Flores family, moving them out of a dangerous SRO. She\u2019ll never forget seven-year-old Marisol running into her own room for the first time, spinning in a circle with her arms outstretched in pure, unbridled joy. That single image became her fuel. It was then, in her mid-twenties, that Deborah learned to measure success not in promotions, but in the safe spaces she could create, one family at a time.\n\n_\n\n4.\nShe was 38, eating takeout noodles on a cardboard box in her new, empty Inner Richmond apartment. The distant moan of a foghorn felt like the loneliest sound in the world. A wave of terror washed over her\u2014divorced, a single mom, completely on her own. But underneath the fear was a fragile, unfamiliar resolve. This space, this life, was hers to build. That night, sitting in the quiet dark, her fierce independence was born not from strength, but from necessity.\n\n_\n\n5.\nLast year, during a Sunday visit, her retired father wordlessly slid a newspaper clipping across the table. It was a small article about a grant her youth center had won. He just tapped it with his finger and grunted, \u201cGood article.\u201d Decades of unspoken disappointment dissolved in that single, understated gesture. It wasn\u2019t praise so much as a final, profound acknowledgment. In that moment, the rift that had defined her early adulthood finally, quietly, healed for good."
