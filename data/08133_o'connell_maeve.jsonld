Raised in a quiet town outside Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a librarian mother and a carpenter father. Her childhood was analog: built on the Dewey Decimal System, the scent of sawdust, and the wet green of the Pacific Northwest. She was a meticulous child, finding satisfaction not in chaos but in the perfect organization of her bookshelf and rock collections.\n\nThis love for structure led her to pursue an English degree, but a pragmatic streak inherited from her parents pushed her toward a more practical application. She earned a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), intending to follow in her mother's footsteps. Her turning point came during a graduate internship digitizing a university\u2019s historical archives. She discovered a profound talent for finding stories not just in texts, but in the metadata\u2014the patterns of access, the connections between records, the digital footprints left by researchers.\n\nA savvy tech recruiter saw her unique skill set\u2014the ability to organize vast, unstructured information and derive meaning from it\u2014as a perfect fit for Silicon Valley. Maeve traded library stacks for data stacks, moving to San Francisco six years ago. Now a Senior Data Analyst, her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bed to the standing desk in the bay window of her Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHer life is a deliberate blend of the digital and the analog. Days are spent querying databases and building dashboards, but her evenings are for tangible creation at a local pottery studio, her hands covered in clay. She has a small, close-knit circle of friends, preferring intimate dinners and book club meetings over loud bars. Her connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; she knows the baristas at her corner coffee shop, the best dim sum on Clement Street, and the quietest trails in Golden Gate Park. While she\u2019s proud of her career, Maeve dreams of a future where her analysis serves a different purpose\u2014perhaps mapping cultural trends for a museum or helping a non-profit optimize its community outreach. She seeks to find the human narrative that exists beyond the numbers."
