The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a bustling grocery store in the Sunset District, she learned about supply chains and human traffic before she could drive. She watched the daily ballet of delivery trucks, MUNI buses, and neighbors on foot, internalizing the city's rhythm as her own. This practical education in urban logistics, combined with the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake shattering the city\u2019s concrete arteries, cemented her path.\n\nShe pursued a Master of Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley, viewing transit not as a problem to be solved, but as the city\u2019s circulatory system. For nearly three decades, she\u2019s been a steady hand within the city\u2019s planning department, rising to her senior role through meticulous work and an unwavering belief that a city\u2019s humanity is reflected in how it moves its people. Her career has been a quiet war against inefficiency, her victories marked by new bike lanes on Folsom or a more logical bus route in the Excelsior.\n\nMei-Ling\u2019s life is as deliberately designed as one of her transit corridors. After an amicable divorce years ago, she bought a condo in Hayes Valley. Her commute is a zero-mile journey from her bedroom to her desk, a work-from-home reality that gives her a unique, almost meta-view of the systems she manages. Her daily routine involves analyzing traffic data and GIS maps, but it\u2019s her afternoon walks through the neighborhood\u2014observing sidewalk vendors, delivery e-bikes, and people waiting for the 21 Hayes\u2014that provide her most crucial data.\n\nHer social life consists of a small circle of fellow civil servants and a strained but loving relationship with her son, Leo, a tech founder who believes the city\u2019s problems can be solved with an app. This generational friction defines her private life. While Leo dreams of disruption, Mei-Ling aspires to create something lasting: the completion of the Geary Bus Rapid Transit project. She doesn\u2019t dream of retirement, but of standing on a platform she helped design, watching a bus pull away smoothly, carrying San Franciscans toward a city that simply works."
