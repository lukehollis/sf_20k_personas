A second-generation San Franciscan, he was raised in the Sunset District, the son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small but beloved neighborhood grocery store. He spent his youth stacking produce and watching his parents navigate a complex financial world with resilience and limited English. This firsthand view of their fiscal struggles ignited in him a quiet determination to understand and master the system that so often felt opaque to them.\n\nHe pursued an Economics degree at San Francisco State University, not for the love of theory, but for its practical power. He started his career as a bank teller, learning the ground-level mechanics of money before moving into the world of real estate finance. The 2008 financial crisis was his professional crucible. Then a junior loan officer, he witnessed the devastation firsthand\u2014colleagues lost jobs, and families, much like the ones he grew up with, lost their homes. The experience solidified his mission: he wouldn\u2019t just sell loans; he would be a steadfast guide, ensuring his clients understood the gravity and responsibility of their commitments.\n\nNow 44, Alex is a Senior Mortgage Loan Officer working from his modern condo in Mission Bay. His commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his home office, a space of dual monitors and quiet focus. His days are a disciplined rhythm of market analysis, client calls, and meticulous paperwork. His anchor in this high-pressure world is his long-term partner, a landscape architect who reminds him to appreciate the city\u2019s natural beauty. Their evenings often involve long walks along the Embarcadero, leaving the world of interest rates behind.\n\nWhile he has achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of, Alex feels a growing pull to give back. He envisions a future where he leverages his expertise to create a financial literacy program for new immigrant communities, a way to honor his parents' journey. He is a man who understands both the old and new San Francisco\u2014the quiet family neighborhoods of his youth and the gleaming towers of his profession\u2014and hopes to build a bridge between them."
