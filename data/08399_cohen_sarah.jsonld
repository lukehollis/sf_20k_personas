Born in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, she is the daughter of a Korean immigrant mother, a brilliant home cook who filled their apartment with the scents of gochujang and sesame oil, and a third-generation Jewish-American father who taught her the comfort of a perfectly made matzo ball soup. Her childhood was a multicultural tapestry of flavors, a constant, delicious dialogue between two worlds.\n\nBowing to practicality, Sarah pursued a Bachelor's degree in Communications at UC Davis. She was a good student, but the path felt hollow. Corporate recruiting events left her cold; spreadsheets couldn't compete with the memory of her mother\u2019s bubbling kimchi jjigae. The turning point came during a post-graduation trip to Seoul. Immersed in the vibrant, chaotic energy of the Gwangjang Market, watching vendors expertly craft dishes passed down for generations, she realized her true calling wasn't in a boardroom, but in a kitchen.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, she abandoned her corporate job search and took a position as a prep cook in a demanding Mission restaurant. It was a grueling education, but she thrived, working her way up the line. There, she met Leo, a passionate front-of-house manager who shared her vision. Together, they saved every dollar, dreaming of a place of their own.\n\nToday, Sarah is the co-owner and head chef of a celebrated restaurant in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her apartment above the establishment, her life lived to the rhythm of service. Her day starts with calls to farmers and ends long after the last table is cleared. The restaurant is her canvas, where she paints with the flavors of her heritage\u2014dishes like braised short rib with tteokbokki and brisket bao with a dill-infused schmear. Her friendships are forged in the fire of the kitchen with her staff and cemented over late-night drinks with Leo.\n\nHer aspiration isn\u2019t a sprawling empire, but perfection on a single plate. She dreams of earning a Michelin star, a testament to her unique culinary voice. More than that, she hopes to create a sustainable business that allows her and Leo to one day enjoy the city they work so tirelessly to feed."
