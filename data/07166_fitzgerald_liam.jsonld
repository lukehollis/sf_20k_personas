The son of a union electrician and a public-school teacher, Liam grew up in a household that valued tangible results and community service. While his family built things with their hands and minds, Liam was always drawn to the bigger picture\u2014the invisible systems that shaped how people lived together. This fascination led him to a B.A. in Sociology, where he spent more time studying city maps and demographic shifts than specific theories.\n\nThe true pivot came during a post-graduate year spent backpacking through Europe. In the dense, walkable cores of Amsterdam and Copenhagen, he saw how deliberate design could foster human connection and sustainable living. It was a revelation. He returned to the U.S. with a singular focus, earning a Master of Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. The Bay Area was supposed to be a stepping stone, but the beautiful, chaotic, and deeply flawed urban fabric of San Francisco captured him completely.\n\nHe joined the SF Planning Department as a junior planner, full of academic idealism. His key turning point was a bruising, multi-year battle over a proposed affordable housing project in the Sunset District. He saw his elegant designs and data-driven arguments get torn apart by neighborhood politics and bureaucratic inertia. The project was ultimately downsized into near irrelevance. The defeat tempered his idealism with a hardened pragmatism, teaching him that progress in San Francisco is won inch by painful inch.\n\nNow 37, Liam is a Senior Urban Planner. He lives his work, quite literally. His small apartment in a modern Hayes Valley mixed-use building is a short walk from his office at City Hall, rendering his commute nonexistent. His daily routine involves poring over zoning codes and environmental impact reports, followed by evenings spent observing the city\u2019s lifeblood\u2014walking through different neighborhoods, nursing a beer at a local dive bar, or attending a community meeting as a citizen rather than an official.\n\nHis personal relationships are often secondary to his civic devotion; his longest-standing relationship feels like it's with the city itself. Liam\u2019s dream isn\u2019t personal wealth, but leaving a tangible mark: a successful transit corridor, a thriving new public plaza, or a block of genuinely mixed-income housing. His greatest aspiration is to help San Francisco live up to its progressive ideals, and his deepest fear is that he\u2019ll spend his entire career in meetings, watching the city he loves choke on its own potential."
