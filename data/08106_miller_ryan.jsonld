The son of a Filipina nurse and a white American mechanic, his upbringing was a blend of cultures, defined by family loyalty and a no-nonsense work ethic. His childhood was spent navigating the MUNI system, eating lumpia at family gatherings, and helping his dad tinker with engines in their small garage.\n\nHis path seemed set for a creative career after high school. Enrolled in the industrial design program at SF State, he filled sketchbooks with innovative furniture and product ideas. But during his sophomore year, a turning point arrived when his mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and the family\u2019s financial stability faltered. Setting his ambitions aside, Ryan left school to find immediate work, landing a stockroom job at a boutique home goods store in North Beach.\n\nHe proved reliable and observant, his quiet creativity finding an outlet in merchandising and store displays. He quickly rose from the stockroom to the sales floor, and eventually to his current role as Assistant Store Manager. Today, his life is contained within a few city blocks. He lives in a small studio apartment directly above the shop, making his commute a simple flight of stairs. His days are a familiar rhythm of unlocking the front gate, managing inventory, charming regulars with his gentle demeanor, and closing up long after the sun has set over Coit Tower.\n\nThough Ryan is proud of supporting his family, a quiet restlessness hums beneath the surface. His social life consists of after-work beers with his small staff and occasional meetups with a few high school friends. After work, he sometimes pulls out his old sketchbooks, a bittersweet reminder of a different path. He dreams of one day returning to school, or perhaps using his retail experience to launch his own small design brand. Ryan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal; he loves the city not for its tech glamour, but for the familiar faces in his neighborhood and the quiet hum of life on the streets he calls home."
