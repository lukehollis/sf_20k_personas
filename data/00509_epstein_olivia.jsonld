            "value": "Olivia Epstein\u2019s life is a testament to culinary alchemy, a fusion born from her very heritage. Raised in Marin County, she was the daughter of a Korean-American ceramicist mother and a Jewish-American history professor father. Her childhood home was a symphony of flavors and aromas: her mother\u2019s bubbling kimchi jjigae on the stove, alongside her father\u2019s attempts to perfect his grandmother\u2019s brisket recipe. This blend of cultures wasn\u2019t a conflict but a conversation, a daily lesson in how disparate elements could create a beautiful, cohesive whole.\n\nShe attended UCLA, initially drawn to the structured world of art history. She loved the stories behind objects, the way a canvas or sculpture could convey a culture\u2019s soul. However, she found her true passion not in sterile galleries but in the chaotic, vibrant kitchens of West LA restaurants where she worked to pay her tuition. There, she realized that a plate was its own canvas, and a well-crafted meal was a story told through taste and texture. This was the turning point; she abandoned the path to museum curation for the relentless rhythm of the hospitality world.\n\nAfter graduating, Olivia moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a culinary incubator. She threw herself into the industry, working every position from line cook in a bustling Mission taqueria to front-of-house manager at a refined Hayes Valley bistro. It was there she met her business partner, a sommelier with a keen financial mind. Combining Olivia\u2019s culinary vision with her partner\u2019s business acumen, they spent two years meticulously planning. With a small business loan and a significant investment from Olivia\u2019s supportive family, they secured a location in Hayes Valley, with a small apartment directly above it.\n\nToday, at 26, Olivia lives and breathes her restaurant, \u201cSobremesa.\u201d Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs, where the scent of coffee and baking bread is her alarm clock. Her days are a blur of menu development, staff management, and connecting with regulars. The menu is a direct reflection of her upbringing\u2014think pastrami Reuben bao buns and kimchi-spiced matzo ball soup. Her hope is not for a vast empire, but to perfect this single space, making it a beloved neighborhood institution. Olivia Epstein didn't just find a career in San Francisco; she built a home, a community, and a tangible expression of her own identity, one plate at a time."
