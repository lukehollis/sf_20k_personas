Raised in Marin County, she was the daughter of a Korean-American ceramicist mother and a Jewish-American history professor father. Her childhood home was a symphony of flavors and aromas: her mother\u2019s bubbling kimchi jjigae on the stove, alongside her father\u2019s attempts to perfect his grandmother\u2019s brisket recipe. This blend of cultures wasn\u2019t a conflict but a conversation, a daily lesson in how disparate elements could create a beautiful, cohesive whole.\n\nShe attended UCLA, initially drawn to the structured world of art history. She loved the stories behind objects, the way a canvas or sculpture could convey a culture\u2019s soul. However, she found her true passion not in sterile galleries but in the chaotic, vibrant kitchens of West LA restaurants where she worked to pay her tuition. There, she realized that a plate was its own canvas, and a well-crafted meal was a story told through taste and texture. This was the turning point; she abandoned the path to museum curation for the relentless rhythm of the hospitality world.\n\nAfter graduating, Olivia moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a culinary incubator. She threw herself into the industry, working every position from line cook in a bustling Mission taqueria to front-of-house manager at a refined Hayes Valley bistro. It was there she met her business partner, a sommelier with a keen financial mind. Combining Olivia\u2019s culinary vision with her partner\u2019s business acumen, they spent two years meticulously planning. With a small business loan and a significant investment from Olivia\u2019s supportive family, they secured a location in Hayes Valley, with a small apartment directly above it.\n\nToday, at 26, Olivia lives and breathes her restaurant, \u201cSobremesa.\u201d Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs, where the scent of coffee and baking bread is her alarm clock. Her days are a blur of menu development, staff management, and connecting with regulars. The menu is a direct reflection of her upbringing\u2014think pastrami Reuben bao buns and kimchi-spiced matzo ball soup. Her hope is not for a vast empire, but to perfect this single space, making it a beloved neighborhood institution. Olivia Epstein didn't just find a career in San Francisco; she built a home, a community, and a tangible expression of her own identity, one plate at a time."

            "value": "1.\nShe recalls being ten, standing in the doorway between the kitchen and dining room on a chilly Marin night. The air was a fragrant battleground: the sharp, fermented funk of her mother's kimchi jjigae bubbling on the stove, and the rich, sweet-savory aroma of her father\u2019s brisket resting on the counter. In that moment, watching the steam from both dishes swirl and mingle in the air, she didn't feel conflicted. She felt complete. It was her first, unspoken lesson that two distinct stories could create a single, beautiful scent of home.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in a steamy West LA kitchen, long after her last art history final. The chef, seeing her exhaustion, quietly slid her a plate with seared scallops, a purple cauliflower pur\u00e9e, and glistening roe. \"Make it look like something,\" he grunted. As she arranged the components, her mind flashed to Kandinsky\u2014the composition, the color, the energy. In that instant, the sterile gallery felt a million miles away. She realized a plate was a more intimate canvas than any she had studied. That night, she chose the kitchen over the museum forever.\n\n3.\nHer first six months in San Francisco were a blur of grease and exhaustion at a Mission taqueria. One frantic Friday, buried in tickets, she felt tears welling. The head cook, a formidable woman named Elena, caught her eye. Without a word, Elena slid a perfectly folded al pastor taco onto a napkin and pushed it toward her. \"Breathe, then cook,\" she said in Spanish. That small act of sustenance and solidarity wasn't just about food; it was about survival and belonging. It taught Olivia that a kitchen's strength is its family.\n\n4.\nStanding in the empty, dusty Hayes Valley space at 24, the silence was deafening. The keys felt impossibly heavy in her hand, each one a link in a chain of debt and family expectation. Her business partner smiled, but Olivia could only hear the echo of their footsteps and the frantic pounding of her own heart. The terror was immense, but beneath it stirred a profound, thrilling certainty. This empty box wasn't just a location; it was the physical manifestation of her entire life, waiting for her to give it a soul.\n\n5.\nA few months after Sobremesa opened, an elderly man, a weekly regular, stopped her on his way out. He had finished her kimchi matzo ball soup. \"You know,\" he said, his eyes crinkling, \"my Bubbe would've hated this.\" He paused, then smiled warmly. \"But she would have understood it completely.\" In that single sentence, Olivia felt the entire purpose of her work crystallize. It wasn't about fusion for novelty's sake, but for the sake of connection\u2014a conversation between generations and across cultures, all in one bowl."
