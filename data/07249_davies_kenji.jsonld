This duality defined his path. He chose not to follow his father into architecture but pursued a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, drawn to the logic of designing systems for people. However, the magnetic pull of the late-90s dot-com boom proved irresistible. He took a \u201ctemporary\u201d job organizing a software launch, and his natural ability to manage complex variables and personalities saw him pivot permanently into tech.\n\nThe key turning point in Kenji\u2019s life was not a moment of success, but one of burnout. Around age 35, after leading a grueling, high-stakes project, he realized he'd become a machine of Gantt charts and stakeholder management, losing the human-centric focus of his original studies. He quit his job, traveled through Japan for three months, and reconnected with his mother\u2019s side of the family, finding peace in the deliberate, patient craft of ceramics.\n\nUpon returning, he didn\u2019t abandon tech but approached it differently. He joined a consulting firm that allowed for more project variety and, crucially, a fully remote setup. Now, at 44, his life is contained within the walkable blocks of his Hayes Valley neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute consists of moving from his kitchen coffee maker to the standing desk in his second bedroom. His days are a disciplined mix of client calls and focused work, punctuated by a necessary lunchtime walk to Patricia\u2019s Green or a coffee from his favorite local cafe.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom he\u2019s known for over a decade\u2014remnants from the pre-gig-economy San Francisco. He\u2019s a regular at a nearby wine bar, more an observer than a participant in the neighborhood\u2019s buzz. His deepest aspiration is to finally merge his two worlds: leveraging his project management expertise for a civic tech or urban renewal project, proving that the systems he builds can create tangible, positive change in the city he has called home for two decades."
