Born and raised in the city\u2019s foggy Richmond District to a Filipina mother who worked as a nurse at St. Mary's and an Irish-American father who drove a Muni bus, Theresa\u2019s world was a blend of lumpia, Gaelic stubbornness, and the hum of the 38 Geary line. She grew up believing that hard work was the most noble pursuit, a value instilled by parents who sacrificed everything for a foothold in America.\n\nHer educational journey was brief but practical. After graduating from George Washington High School, she enrolled in business classes at SF State, imagining a future in an office downtown. That dream was cut short when her father suffered a heart attack, forcing Theresa to drop out and take a full-time job to support her family. The job was at a small, independent home goods store in Hayes Valley, initially just a temporary measure. But life had other plans. Theresa discovered an innate talent for retail\u2014a sharp eye for merchandising, a calming presence with difficult customers, and an unshakeable reliability. She never went back to college, instead climbing the ladder from stockroom clerk to, eventually, store manager.\n\nNow 51, Theresa\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric of the store she manages. Her modest apartment is directly above the shop, making her commute a short walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a familiar rhythm: unlocking the front door as the morning light hits the street, brewing coffee, arranging new displays, and greeting the neighborhood regulars who have become her de facto family. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, unable to withstand the gravity of her commitment to her small corner of the world.\n\nTheresa watches the new, glittering San Francisco rise around her quiet bastion of curated ceramics and artisanal soaps. She feels a deep, protective love for her city, mixed with a gentle melancholy for the past. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; she hopes to one day buy the store from its aging owner, securing her legacy. And perhaps, finally, take a trip to the Philippines to see the village her mother always described, connecting the beginning of her family\u2019s story with the chapter she continues to write."
