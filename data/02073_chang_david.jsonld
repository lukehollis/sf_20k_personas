            "value": "David Chang was meant to be an engineer, just like his father. Raised in the quiet suburbs of Cupertino, his Taiwanese immigrant parents instilled in him the values of diligence, practicality, and the pursuit of a stable, high-earning career. He fulfilled their expectations for years, excelling in math and science and eventually earning an undergraduate degree in Economics from UC Berkeley. But a single elective in art history his final semester had planted a dangerous seed. While his peers pursued finance, David secretly spent his weekends at the Berkeley Art Museum, feeling more at home among modern sculptures than spreadsheets.\n\nThe turning point was his application to graduate school. He was accepted into a prestigious MBA program, a moment of immense pride for his family. Two weeks before the deadline, however, he declined the offer and, to their profound disappointment, enrolled in an MFA program for Arts Administration at a small, respected East Coast university. This act of rebellion defined his path. He learned the language of endowments, marketing, and strategic planning, not for corporations, but for struggling museums, dance companies, and theaters.\n\nAfter a decade in New York, David returned to the Bay Area, drawn by the unique challenge San Francisco presented: a city flush with tech wealth yet whose cultural institutions were starving. He established his own consultancy from his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his bedroom to his home office, overlooking a meticulously maintained Japanese maple on his balcony.\n\nNow 48, David is a vital, if unseen, force in the city\u2019s art scene. His days are a disciplined mix of Zoom calls with museum boards and late nights drafting grant proposals. He\u2019s divorced, a casualty of his unwavering focus years ago, but maintains a close circle of friends\u2014chefs, artists, and architects\u2014with whom he shares dinners and attends gallery openings. His great ambition is not wealth, but legacy: to build sustainable financial bridges between the new money of Silicon Valley and the fragile soul of San Francisco's art world, ensuring the city he loves doesn\u2019t lose its creative heart."
