His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this, as he lives in the apartment directly above \u201cWong\u2019s Curated Wares,\u201d the stylish home goods and gift shop he manages. Born to parents who emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1980s, Liam grew up amidst the scent of cardboard boxes and the diligent hum of his family\u2019s first business, a humble variety store. He was the quiet, artistic son, expected to excel academically and pursue a stable, respectable career far from retail.\n\nHe honored their wishes, for a time. Liam enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design. He dreamt of a sleek downtown loft and a job at a top design agency in SoMa, a world away from the foggy avenues of his childhood. He excelled, his portfolio filled with minimalist branding and bold digital art, and graduation felt like a launchpad to a life he had designed for himself.\n\nThe turning point came abruptly during his senior year. His father suffered a heart attack, a serious but non-fatal event that forced the family to re-evaluate everything. Seeing his parents\u2019 exhaustion and fear, Liam made a choice. He put his design portfolio away and stepped behind the counter, not out of defeat, but out of a deep, complicated sense of love and duty.\n\nNow, at 29, Liam is the Retail Operations Manager. He used his design skills to rebrand the old variety store into the modern, curated boutique it is today, blending his minimalist aesthetic with his parents\u2019 traditional sensibilities. His days are a routine of inventory management, supplier calls, and interacting with the neighborhood regulars who have watched him grow up. His social life is quiet, often limited to a drink with a local supplier or catching up with the owners of the bakery next door.\n\nWhile a part of him still misses the life he almost had, Liam has found a new aspiration: to make the store a legacy. He dreams of expanding online, creating his own product line, and honoring his parents' sacrifice by building something both lasting and beautiful. His connection to San Francisco isn't one of trendy bars or tech campuses, but of the foundational, familial bedrock of a neighborhood that knows his name."
