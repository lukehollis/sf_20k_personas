His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to the drafting table that dominates his living space, a testament to a career built from home.\n\nBorn in a quiet Connecticut suburb, Julian was the son of a pragmatic civil engineer who valued function over form. His childhood was one of straight lines and predictable outcomes, yet Julian found himself drawn to the flourishes his father dismissed\u2014the intricate cornice on a neighbor\u2019s house, the sweeping curve of a bridge. He initially tried to follow a conventional path, earning an undergraduate degree in economics, but a post-graduation backpacking trip through Europe became his Damascus Road. In the cathedrals of Florence and the art nouveau facades of Prague, he discovered his calling.\n\nHe returned to the States and enrolled in an MFA program for illustration, much to his father\u2019s quiet disappointment. In the late 1990s, he was drawn to San Francisco, a city whose Victorian and Edwardian architecture felt like a living museum. He established himself as an architectural illustrator, initially with pen and paper, then making a reluctant but necessary pivot to digital tools. He found his niche creating renderings for boutique firms that appreciated an artist's touch, blending modern technology with old-world sensibility.\n\nHis personal life has been similarly understated. A long-term relationship with a software developer named Mark ended a decade ago, a casualty of diverging paths as the city\u2019s tech boom reshaped its soul. Since then, Julian\u2019s connections have been curated and small: the barista at his local Hayes Valley coffee shop, a few old friends from the art scene. His days are structured\u2014a morning walk with his dog in the park, hours lost in detailed work, and evenings spent with a book or a foreign film.\n\nAt 50, Julian isn't aspiring to wealth or fame. His dream is to complete a personal project: a large-format book of meticulously hand-drawn illustrations documenting San Francisco\u2019s most treasured, and often endangered, historic buildings. It is his way of preserving the city he fell in love with, creating a permanent record of its beauty before it\u2019s erased by the relentless march of progress."
