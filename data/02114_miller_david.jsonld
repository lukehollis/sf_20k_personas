The son of two University of Michigan professors, he was raised on a diet of Socratic debate and the quiet expectation of academic achievement. His early idealism led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown, dreaming of optimizing city infrastructures and untangling bureaucratic knots for the public good.\n\nHowever, the slow pace and low pay of government work clashed with his sharp, restless intellect. A pivotal internship introduced him to the world of management consulting, where a recruiter sold him a different version of his dream: faster results, bigger impact, and exponentially greater rewards. He took the offer, moved to San Francisco just before the first dot-com boom, and began applying his systems-thinking mind to corporate, rather than civic, problems. He excelled, quickly climbing the ladder. His ambition, however, cost him his marriage in his late thirties; his ex-wife tired of competing with his clients for his attention.\n\nNow, at 49, David is a Principal at a top-tier firm. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to the standing desk in the bay window of his meticulously renovated Cole Valley flat. His life is a routine of precision: 6 AM coffee while scanning global markets, followed by a relentless schedule of Zoom calls with a C-suite clientele. His breaks are disciplined runs through Golden Gate Park, the structured paths a mirror of his own life.\n\nDavid has a deep, if somewhat detached, affection for San Francisco. He appreciates the city's beauty from his window and the quiet, village-like feel of Cole Valley, where he can walk to grab dinner or a bottle of wine. His social life is small and curated, consisting of a few long-time friends who understand the demands of his world. A ghost of his former idealism haunts him. Lately, he finds himself looking past the profit margins and toward the city's intractable problems, wondering if it's too late to apply his considerable skills to the purpose he long ago abandoned. His quiet aspiration is to pivot one last time, perhaps by joining a civic-tech board or mentoring social entrepreneurs, to finally balance his ledger between success and significance."
