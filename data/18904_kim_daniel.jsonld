The son of Korean immigrants, Daniel grew up watching his father, a carpenter, transform raw wood into precise, elegant forms. This deep appreciation for craftsmanship, combined with his mother\u2019s meticulous management of their family dry-cleaning business, instilled in him a dual sense of artistry and discipline.\n\nHe pursued this passion formally, earning his Master of Architecture from Cal Poly. His early career at a large LA firm, however, felt creatively suffocating. It was a turning point in 1998 that brought him to San Francisco, drawn by its challenging topography and rich architectural vernacular. Here, he found his footing at a smaller, more innovative firm, where his talent for blending modernism with historical context could flourish.\n\nNow a Principal Architect, Daniel specializes in sustainable urban infill projects. His daily 5.5-mile commute on the N Judah from his Cole Valley home is a cherished ritual. It's a time for quiet observation and sketching in his Moleskine, his thoughts uninterrupted as the city slides by. He and his wife, a curator he met at an SFMOMA opening, have raised their teenage daughter in the meticulously restored Edwardian they call home\u2014a personal project where every detail reflects his design philosophy.\n\nLife is a comfortable rhythm of early mornings at local cafes, demanding days collaborating with clients, and cherished evenings with his family. Yet, Daniel remains driven. He dreams of designing a significant public building, a legacy piece like a library or community arts center that gives back to the city that fostered his career. A more personal aspiration is to one day design and build a minimalist family cabin in Sea Ranch, a quiet retreat that would bring his life\u2019s work full circle, echoing the simple, profound craftsmanship he first learned from his father."
