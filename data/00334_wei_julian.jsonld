The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved bakery in the Outer Sunset, Julian grew up surrounded by the scent of pineapple buns and the quiet mandate to achieve a stability his parents never had. He was a dutiful son, but his true passion was the city itself\u2014its complex grid, its history etched in architecture, its ever-shifting social tectonics. This love led him to a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, where he dreamed of designing equitable, beautiful public spaces.\n\nThe turning point was a disillusioning post-graduate internship with the city. He saw his idealistic proposals get buried under mountains of bureaucracy and political maneuvering. Meanwhile, friends with quantitative skills were landing high-paying jobs in finance. Feeling the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifices, Julian made a sharp pivot. He leveraged his analytical mind, honed by studying urban systems, and landed a job as a financial analyst. The work was abstract, but the results were concrete and lucrative.\n\nNow, at 39, Julian lives a life of disciplined isolation in a sleek Rincon Hill condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the standing desk in his living room, where multiple monitors glow with market data before the sun rises over the Bay Bridge. His days are a torrent of numbers, conference calls, and intense focus. The career switch cost him a long-term relationship years ago; his ex-girlfriend said he was \u201calways logged on,\u201d not just to his computer, but to a world she couldn\u2019t enter.\n\nSan Francisco is no longer a place of potential parks and plazas for him. Now, he sees it as a portfolio. He traces the flow of venture capital through SoMa and charts the real estate fluctuations in his own neighborhood from his window. His social life consists of a tight circle of old friends and sporadic, transactional dating app experiences. Yet, his old dream hasn't entirely died. Julian\u2019s secret aspiration is to accumulate enough capital to start his own social impact fund, one focused on sustainable urban development. He hopes to one day use the language of finance\u2014the only one he feels he truly commands\u2014to finally build the city he once dreamed of."
