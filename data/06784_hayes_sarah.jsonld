Raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a librarian mother, her artistic inclinations were seen as a charming but impractical hobby. She found her escape and her language in the hallowed halls of Reed College, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History. It wasn't the creation of art that called to her, but the story behind it\u2014the context, the artist's struggle, and the bridge to an audience.\n\nIn 1996, drawn by a magnetic pull towards a more dynamic cultural scene, she moved to San Francisco. Sarah landed a junior role in the marketing department at SFMOMA, just as the first dot-com boom was cresting. She thrived, learning to translate the esoteric world of conceptual art into compelling narratives for the public. Her key turning point arrived with the bust in the early 2000s. Facing institutional cutbacks, she took a leap, founding her one-woman consultancy. She had identified a crucial need: brilliant artists and small galleries who were lost when it came to branding and outreach.\n\nHer personal life saw its own boom and bust. A passionate, whirlwind marriage in her late thirties to a talented but troubled jazz musician ended in an amicable but soul-altering divorce. The experience solidified her need for independence and a space that was entirely her own.\n\nToday, that space is a meticulously curated apartment in Hayes Valley, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a sun-drenched desk surrounded by works from former clients. Her days are a blend of focused work\u2014crafting proposals and digital strategies\u2014and neighborhood ritual. She starts with an espresso at a local caf\u00e9, takes midday walks through Patricia\u2019s Green, and often ends her evenings at a gallery opening or a performance at SFJAZZ, seamlessly blending her professional and social worlds. Her friendships are deep and interwoven with her career, a tight-knit circle of artists, chefs, and curators. At 51, Sarah feels a deep sense of contentment, but her ambition has shifted. She now dreams of establishing a small foundation to provide seed grants for emerging Bay Area artists, cementing her legacy as a vital connector in the city that allowed her to build a life on her own terms."
