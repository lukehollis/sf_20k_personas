The son of a first-generation Filipina nurse and a second-generation Armenian-American history professor, Ben grew up in a home filled with the aromas of both adobo and dolma. His mother\u2019s tireless compassion and his father\u2019s analytical view of societal structures instilled in him a unique blend of empathy and pragmatism. Conversations around the dinner table weren't just about school, but about healthcare access, historical injustices, and the intricate ways systems either helped or failed the communities around them. This upbringing made filling out forms a unique challenge; he always checked \"Other,\" feeling it was the only box that could contain his entirety.\n\nInitially, Ben thought he would follow his father into academia. But a pivotal undergraduate internship with a state assembly member changed his trajectory. He saw how policy, debated in Sacramento, had tangible consequences on the streets of his neighborhood. The theoretical became urgent. This revelation propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's in Public Policy, focusing on urban planning and housing.\n\nNow, at 26, Ben's life is a testament to that focus. He lives in a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a stone's throw from the golden dome of City Hall. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing him to be completely immersed in the political heart of San Francisco. As a legislative aide to a City Supervisor, his days are a whirlwind of constituent calls, policy research, and late-night prep sessions for board meetings. He\u2019s neck-deep in the city's most contentious issues, from homelessness initiatives to public transit funding.\n\nHis social life is intertwined with his work; drinks with fellow aides and policy wonks are a common way to decompress. On weekends, he escapes the political fray by either hiking in the Marin Headlands or driving back to Daly City for his mother\u2019s cooking and his father's counsel. Benjamin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of power, but of impact. He aspires to one day draft and pass a landmark piece of housing legislation that could meaningfully reshape San Francisco\u2019s future. He sees the city not just as his home, but as his responsibility\u2014a complex, frustrating, and beautiful puzzle he is determined to help solve."
