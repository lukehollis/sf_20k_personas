Her parents, immigrants from Guangzhou, ran a small but beloved neighborhood grocery store. From a young age, Mei learned the language of inventory and the importance of a balanced ledger, values they hoped she would carry into a stable, secure profession like accounting or medicine.\n\nWhile she honored her parents' work ethic, Mei harbored a more dynamic ambition. She excelled in school, channeling her organizational skills not into spreadsheets, but into leading group projects and debate clubs. She attended UC Berkeley, choosing a Business Administration degree as a pragmatic compromise between her parents' desire for security and her own knack for leadership. After graduation, she landed a junior role at a mid-sized tech company.\n\nA pivotal moment arrived five years into her career when a corporate restructuring eliminated her entire department. The sudden instability was a shock, but it crystallized her resolve. Rather than seek another identical role, she enrolled in a part-time MBA program and aggressively networked her way into the competitive world of tech consulting. Now, as a Project Manager, she thrives on the high-stakes pressure of guiding enterprise clients through complex digital transformations.\n\nAt 35, Mei\u2019s life is a testament to her drive. She traded the quiet streets of the Sunset for a sleek apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start with a coffee from a local artisan cafe before diving into a marathon of Zoom calls from her home office. Evenings are for unwinding at a nearby yoga studio or cooking with her long-term partner, a software engineer she met through friends. Her social circle is a blend of lifelong friends from her school days and sharp, ambitious colleagues.\n\nThough successful, Mei dreams of creating something of her own. Her ultimate goal is to launch a boutique consulting firm focused on helping women-led startups scale their operations. She feels a deep, layered connection to San Francisco\u2014a city that holds both her family\u2019s immigrant past and her own self-made, tech-fueled future."
