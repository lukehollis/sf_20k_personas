At 35, the label \"None\" next to race/ethnicity on a form feels more accurate than any other. Born in Tokyo to an Indian diplomat father and a Swedish sculptor mother, Ryan's childhood was a nomadic tapestry of international schools and temporary homes in Cairo, Berlin, and Buenos Aires. He never felt attached to any single culture, instead becoming a quiet observer of them all, a third-culture kid who belonged everywhere and nowhere.\n\nHis formal education ended with a pastiche of international baccalaureate credits that never coalesced into a degree. At 24, with his parents retiring to their respective homelands, Ryan felt profoundly adrift. Drawn by its reputation as a haven for misfits and transplants, he landed in San Francisco with two suitcases and a vague desire to stop moving. He found work as a clerk in a small, eclectic Hayes Valley shop that sold vintage prints, obscure philosophy books, and artisanal home goods\u2014a physical manifestation of his own scattered upbringing.\n\nThe store became his anchor. The owner, an older woman who saw a kindred spirit in Ryan, mentored him. When she retired five years ago, she helped him secure a loan to become the new manager and primary leaseholder. This was his key turning point: the moment he chose to plant roots. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this choice; he lives in the small apartment directly above his shop.\n\nRyan\u2019s life now operates on a hyper-local scale. His day begins with coffee from the cafe next door, where the barista knows his order. He meticulously arranges the shop, creating narratives with the objects he sells. His social life consists of conversations with regulars, weekly dinners with a small circle of friends\u2014a graphic designer and a chef\u2014and a quiet relationship with a musician who appreciates his calm, centered nature. Ryan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or fame, but to one day own the building itself. For a man raised on the entire globe, his greatest aspiration is to fully possess his own small, carefully chosen corner of San Francisco."
