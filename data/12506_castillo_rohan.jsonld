Raised by Filipino immigrant parents\u2014a pragmatic nurse and a diligent civil engineer\u2014his upbringing was a study in structure, discipline, and the pursuit of a stable American dream. Family gatherings were loud, filled with the aroma of lumpia and the expectation that Rohan would follow a similarly secure path.\n\nHis pivot came at UC Berkeley. While accepted into a solid program, he was drawn to the ambitious energy of his peers at the Haas School of Business. A summer internship exposed him to the world of management consulting, and he was instantly captivated. It wasn't the steady career his parents envisioned; it was a high-stakes arena of complex problem-solving and rapid advancement. The allure of shaping corporate strategy proved irresistible. Securing a junior consultant position at a top firm straight out of college felt like both a personal triumph and a quiet rebellion.\n\nNow, Rohan\u2019s life is a meticulously managed project. His day starts before sunrise in his minimalist Hayes Valley apartment, followed by a quick Muni ride downtown. His work is a blur of spreadsheets, client presentations, and intense brainstorming sessions, often stretching late into the evening. He thrives on the pressure, viewing each challenge as a puzzle to be solved. His social life is a curated extension of his professional one, consisting of a tight circle of fellow young professionals he met at Cal. Weekends are for decompressing: trail running in the Headlands, exploring a new tasting menu, or simply recharging for the week ahead.\n\nDespite his success, Rohan feels a sense of duality. He\u2019s building a life his parents are proud of, yet one they don\u2019t fully understand. The 2.8-mile commute back to Hayes Valley each evening feels like crossing into a different world from his office, and the occasional trip back to Daly City for a family dinner feels like another world entirely. His ambition is clear: make Partner before he\u2019s 35. But underneath that goal is a deeper desire to prove that his high-risk path can build a foundation as strong and lasting as the one his parents so carefully laid for him."

His father unrolled a massive blueprint for a retaining wall on the dining table, the smell of paper and graphite filling the air. \u201cThis is the math, Rohan. This is how you build something that lasts.\u201d Rohan traced the rigid, perfect lines with his finger. He felt the weight of that stability, the pride in his father\u2019s work, but also a strange, quiet claustrophobia. He knew then he wanted to build things, but not out of steel and concrete. That day, he learned to respect foundations while yearning to escape them.\n\n2.\nIt was 10 PM during his summer internship at Cal. The conference room whiteboard was a chaotic mess. The senior partner, exasperated, tossed him a dry-erase marker. \u201cYou see the gap, Castillo. Show us.\u201d In that moment, mapping out a new market entry strategy, the abstract puzzle clicked into a beautiful, logical form. The thrill was electric, more real than any engineering schematic. It was the first time he felt truly powerful, commanding ideas instead of materials, and it sealed his deviation from his parents\u2019 path.\n\n3.\nHe got the official job offer call while walking across Sproul Plaza. His chest swelled with a pride so sharp it almost hurt. He immediately called his mother, the joy bubbling in his voice. \u201cConsulting? Is that\u2026 stable?\u201d she\u2019d asked, her love laced with caution. He heard the unspoken question: *Why not something we understand?* The victory felt enormous and, for the first time, deeply lonely. He knew then that his success would be something he\u2019d have to translate for the people he loved most.\n\n4.\nLast quarter, after a grueling all-nighter, his team finally cracked the client's biggest logistics issue. Standing at the panoramic window of their 40th-floor office, watching the first Muni buses snake through the sleeping city, he felt a profound sense of ownership. He wasn\u2019t just a resident of the city; he was a force shaping its commerce, one complex problem at a time. This view, this feeling of quiet mastery over the systems below, was the dividend on his high-risk investment in himself.\n\n5.\nTwo Sundays ago, leaving his parents' house in Daly City, his mom pressed a heavy bag of Tupperware into his hands. \u201cFor your week, *anak*,\u201d she said, packed with lumpia and adobo. The familiar weight felt like an anchor. Back in his silent, minimalist Hayes Valley apartment, the fragrant steam filled a space designed for none of it. The gesture was pure love, but it also felt like a quiet verdict on a life that didn\u2019t leave time for cooking, a life they still felt they needed to care for."
