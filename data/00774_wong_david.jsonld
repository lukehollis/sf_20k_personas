            "value": "David Wong is a product of the classic San Francisco immigrant dream, albeit one generation removed. He was raised in the fog-draped avenues of the Sunset District by parents who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. Their lives were a testament to grueling 14-hour days, and they instilled in David a singular drive: achieve the stability they never had. For them, success was a respectable, high-paying job, a world away from stocking shelves and haggling over produce prices.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct response to this pressure. After an undergraduate degree at UCLA, he pursued a Master\u2019s in Information Science at UC Berkeley. It was a compromise, blending his genuine fascination with how people interact with technology with the practical need for a lucrative skill. A key turning point came in his final year when a promising startup idea\u2014a platform to connect local artisans with tech-firm buyers\u2014fizzled out due to a lack of business acumen. The failure stung, pushing him away from the risk of entrepreneurship and toward the structured, high-impact world of management consulting for a top-tier firm.\n\nNow, David lives in a gleaming Hayes Valley condo, a universe away from his childhood home. His 0.0-mile commute means his apartment doubles as his office, an altar of productivity with dual monitors and an ergonomic chair. His days are a disciplined cycle of intense, 80-hour workweeks spent advising tech giants on strategy, punctuated by solo runs to Alamo Square and ordering takeout from the trendy restaurants below. His social life, strained by a recent breakup with a partner tired of competing with his clients for attention, consists mostly of networking events and occasional drinks with colleagues who share his ambition.\n\nThough he has achieved the financial success his parents dreamed of for him, David feels a quiet dissonance. He is a master at creating frameworks for other people\u2019s innovations. His own creative spark, the one that animated his graduate studies, feels distant. His deepest aspiration isn't to make partner, but to one day step off the consulting treadmill and build something of his own\u2014something tangible and lasting, finally proving to himself that the ghost of that failed startup doesn't define him."
