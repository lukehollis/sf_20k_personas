The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Outer Richmond, she grew up translating a world of utility bills and official notices for her parents. She witnessed firsthand the quiet struggles of families navigating a new country, an experience that planted the seeds of a career built on empathy rather than the high-profit path her parents had hoped for.\n\nHer academic journey was entirely local: UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree in sociology, followed by a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University. The catalyst for her career was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake; seeing her community rally to support the vulnerable solidified her calling. Her early career was spent on the front lines as a caseworker in the Mission District, facing the raw realities of poverty, addiction, and systemic neglect. These years were grueling, leading to a brief, early marriage that buckled under the weight of her professional stress and a partner who couldn't comprehend her dedication.\n\nThe divorce was a painful turning point, but it freed her to focus entirely on her work. Irina channeled her energy into climbing the professional ladder, not for power, but for impact. Now, as a Clinical Program Director, she manages teams that provide crucial support to at-risk youth. Her days are a cascade of budget meetings, staff supervision, and crisis management.\n\nIrina lives in a modest Noe Valley condo, a quiet sanctuary from her demanding job. Her 5.5-mile Muni commute on the J-Church line is a cherished ritual\u2014a time to read fiction and disconnect before her workday begins. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly comprised of fellow social workers who understand the unique pressures of their field. While she loves the city's beauty and progressive spirit, she carries a deep frustration with the ever-widening gap between the wealthy and the families her organization serves. Her dream isn\u2019t retirement, but to secure enough funding and mentorship to ensure her programs outlast her tenure, leaving a legacy of care in the city that shaped her."

She was ten, translating a formal letter from the city about a business license renewal for her father. Seeing the flicker of fear in his proud eyes as he struggled to understand the bureaucratic language, she felt a profound weight settle on her small shoulders. It wasn't a burden, but an anointing. In that moment, she ceased to be just a daughter and became a bridge, a role she would embrace for the rest of her life.\n\n2.\nOctober 17, 1989. The world shook, and in the aftermath, Irina stood on a cracked sidewalk in the Mission, watching neighbors form a human chain to pass water bottles and blankets from a corner store. There was no hierarchy, no agenda\u2014just raw, immediate, human care. The image burned into her mind, a chaotic but beautiful tableau of collective action. The abstract sociological theories from her Berkeley classrooms suddenly had a heartbeat. She knew then, with absolute certainty, what her life's work had to be.\n\n3.\nThe final argument with her husband wasn't a shouting match, but a quiet, devastating admission. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with the entire city\u2019s problems,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice flat. She looked at him and felt not anger, but a deep, sorrowful clarity. He was right. Her commitment wasn't something he could rival; it was the very core of her being. The divorce was painful, but that moment was liberating. It gave her permission to stop apologizing for her purpose and to finally, fully, invest in it.\n\n4.\nEarly in her caseworker career, she remembers finding a spot in a shelter for a 16-year-old girl who had been sleeping in Golden Gate Park. The girl, who hadn't spoken more than a few words, simply looked at Irina and started to cry\u2014silent, exhausted tears. Irina didn't hug her or offer platitudes; she just stood there, bearing witness to a moment of fragile safety. That memory is a stone in her pocket, a reminder of what a single victory feels like and why the larger, systemic fight is so crucial.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on her morning J-Church ride, her book sat unopened in her lap. As the streetcar rumbled past Dolores Park, she watched a sleek, unmarked bus for a tech company glide by. Inside, young professionals laughed, heads bent over laptops. Her heart felt a familiar pang\u2014not of envy, but of a deep, abiding frustration at the two cities she inhabits simultaneously. It hardened her resolve. Getting to her office wasn't just a commute; it was crossing a border to fight for the other San Francisco."
