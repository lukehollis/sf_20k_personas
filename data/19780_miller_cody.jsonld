Growing up in a working-class Modesto family, his world was shaped by the constant, quiet anxiety surrounding his younger sister\u2019s chronic asthma. He watched his parents navigate a labyrinth of insurance paperwork, specialist appointments, and emergency room visits, often feeling helpless. He saw firsthand how a family\u2019s well-being was tied not just to love, but to their ability to understand and access a complex, often unforgiving, healthcare system.\n\nAfter a listless year post-high school working retail, a particularly bad asthma attack landed his sister in the hospital for a week. The turning point wasn't the scare itself, but the hospital\u2019s social worker who sat with his parents, patiently connecting them to a new community assistance program. Seeing that tangible act of guidance lit a fire in Cody. He promptly enrolled in a Human Services program at a local community college, driven by a newfound purpose.\n\nWith his associate's degree in hand, he moved to San Francisco at 24, drawn to its concentration of non-profits and its progressive ethos. The city was a shock\u2014loud, expensive, and exhilarating. After a few lean years, he landed his current role as a Community Health Worker, embedding with schools in the Mission District. He became the person he wished his family had had: a guide helping low-income families access everything from dental care and food stamps to mental health counseling.\n\nNow 33, Cody\u2019s life is a testament to mindful living in an expensive city. He shares a drafty but beloved apartment in the Mission with a roommate, and his daily 2.5-mile commute on the J-Church Muni is a time for podcasts and mental preparation. His social life revolves around a weekly basketball game at Dolores Park and gatherings with a close-knit group of friends, most of whom also work in public service. He doesn\u2019t dream of a tech salary or a luxury condo. Instead, he aspires to eventually complete a bachelor's degree in social work and move into program management, widening his impact. For Cody, success isn\u2019t measured by his income, but by the stability and health of the community he now calls home."

A social worker sat with his exhausted parents, her pen moving calmly across a form, untangling a knot of red tape he thought was permanent. It wasn't a miracle; it was a map. In that quiet act of guidance, Cody felt his own directionless anxiety sharpen into a clear, bright point of purpose. He finally knew what he had to do.\n\n2.\nThe J-Church lurched past Dolores Park just after he moved to the city at 24. The world outside the rattling window felt impossibly loud and expensive, a world away from Modesto\u2019s flat heat. For a moment, a wave of \u201cwhat have I done?\u201d washed over him. But then he saw the sheer, vibrant mix of people on the street. It wasn\u2019t a welcome, but a challenge. In that moment, the fear solidified into resolve. He would figure this place out.\n\n3.\nHe was 27, new to his job. A mother at a Mission elementary school, speaking halting English, was terrified of the cost of her son\u2019s dental care. Cody spent hours walking her through the Medi-Cal paperwork. A month later, she stopped him in the hallway, her son grinning with a newly-filled cavity. She just touched his arm and said, \u201cGracias.\u201d In that simple gesture, he felt the full-circle weight and worth of his work, finally becoming the person his own family had needed.\n\n4.\nLast summer, after a hard-fought basketball game at Dolores Park. Sprawled on the grass, sweaty and exhausted, listening to his friends\u2014a teacher, a non-profit lawyer\u2014joke about their tiny apartments and shared struggles. The city skyline was hazy in the evening light. He realized this was his wealth. Not money, but this easy camaraderie, this unspoken understanding of a life built on purpose instead of profit. In that moment, he felt profoundly, unshakably rich.\n\n5.\nOn the phone a few months ago, his sister mentioned training for a 5k. He stopped walking, the sounds of the Mission fading. He pictured her as a child, tethered to an inhaler, the wheeze in her breath a constant family soundtrack. Her casual mention of running\u2014an act of freedom he never thought possible for her\u2014was the greatest measure of success he could imagine. It was the quiet, healthy future his family, and now he, had worked for."
