Born and raised in the Richmond District, she is the only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood laundromat. Her childhood was a symphony of whirring machines, the scent of steam, and the weight of her parents' expectations. They preached the gospel of stability and security, virtues purchased with their relentless labor. For them, a government job with a pension was the ultimate American dream.\n\nInitially, Mei resisted. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, captivated by the world of graphic design. For two exhilarating years, color theory and typography were her native languages. It was a vibrant, personal rebellion against the grayscale practicality of her upbringing. But a turning point arrived swiftly and without mercy: her father suffered a major health crisis, forcing the sale of the family business. With their nest egg shattered, Mei\u2019s dream became a luxury they could no longer afford. She left school to find work, landing an administrative assistant position with the Department of Public Works. It was stable, it was secure, and it was a quiet betrayal of the artist she had hoped to become.\n\nNow, at 38, Mei\u2019s life is a model of contained efficiency. She lives in a modest, city-owned apartment complex adjacent to her office, making her commute a 30-second walk across a concrete courtyard. Her days are a structured rhythm of processing permits, managing schedules for street repair crews, and ensuring the city\u2019s essential functions run smoothly. She is excellent at her job, her reliability a source of quiet pride. Her social life is small but meaningful; she cares for her aging parents, who now live in a small apartment in the Sunset, and meets a few high school friends for dim sum twice a month.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep and unglamorous. She sees the city not through its tourist landmarks, but through pothole reports and tree-trimming schedules. Yet, the old dream flickers. In the evenings, she fills sketchbooks with intricate designs inspired by the city\u2019s architecture. Her greatest hope is not to leave her job, but to save enough to finally finish her degree online, not for a new career, but for herself\u2014a quiet, personal reclaiming of the vibrant colors she once tucked away."
