His parents, a real estate lawyer and a dental hygienist, envisioned a stable, conventional path for him. Caleb obliged, enrolling at San Francisco State University to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Communications, a practical choice he thought would lead to a career in public relations.\n\nHis turning point came during a required service-learning course in his junior year. Assigned to a food pantry in the Tenderloin, Caleb was confronted by a reality far removed from his upbringing. It wasn\u2019t the poverty that shocked him, but the intricate, resilient lives of the people he met and the systemic barriers they faced daily. The stories he heard\u2014of lost jobs, health crises, and bureaucratic dead-ends\u2014felt more urgent and real than any marketing campaign. His Communications degree suddenly felt hollow.\n\nAfter graduating, Caleb abandoned the PR track and took an entry-level administrative job at a non-profit focused on supportive housing. He learned the system from the ground up, displaying a natural empathy and a dogged patience for navigating red tape. Over a decade, he worked his way up to Case Manager.\n\nCaleb\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his all-in commitment: he lives in a subsidized staff apartment within the very supportive housing complex where he works. His days are a blur of client check-ins, crisis intervention, and mountains of paperwork, helping formerly homeless individuals manage their health, finances, and sobriety. His life and work are completely interwoven.\n\nThis immersion has come at a cost. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his emotional exhaustion. His social circle is small, comprised mainly of fellow social workers who understand the immense pressures of the job. His hope is not for personal wealth, but for systemic change\u2014for a San Francisco that provides more than a precarious safety net. He dreams of seeing his clients achieve genuine, lasting stability. In the evenings, Caleb looks out his window not at a glittering skyline, but at the complex\u2019s courtyard, seeing the faces of the people who are not just his clients, but his neighbors."
