Born in Daly City to a Japanese immigrant father, a meticulous landscape gardener, and a second-generation Mexican-American mother, a fiery union organizer for hotel workers, Hiroko\u2019s upbringing was a blend of quiet discipline and vocal advocacy. She learned the value of a well-tended garden and a well-argued point. Watching her mother navigate a grueling, three-bus commute into San Francisco each day instilled in her a deep, personal understanding of how a city\u2019s transit system is its lifeblood.\n\nLacking the means for a traditional four-year university, Hiroko took a clerical job with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) at nineteen. She wasn\u2019t supposed to have a career there, but her sharp mind saw patterns in bus schedules and inefficiencies in routes that academics with advanced degrees missed. She absorbed everything, from late-night maintenance reports to heated public feedback meetings. Mentors noticed her practical genius, encouraging her through internal certifications and promotions. Over three decades, she climbed the ladder on sheer competence and grit, moving from clerk to analyst to her current role as a Transit System Planning Manager.\n\nA turning point was her divorce a decade ago, an amicable split that left her with a quiet condo in the Inner Richmond and a renewed focus on her work. The 0.0-mile commute of her now hybrid role allows her to be deeply embedded in her community. Her days start with a walk in Golden Gate Park, observing the morning rush she helps orchestrate from afar. She then spends hours analyzing data, her goal always the same: to shave ten minutes off a commute for someone like her mother, to create a new route connecting a forgotten neighborhood.\n\nHer social life is small but solid\u2014a book club with other career women and weekly dinners with her aging father. Hiroko dreams not of retirement, but of legacy. She wants to see the Central Subway extension, a project she has poured years into, running at full capacity. Her greatest aspiration is to one day ride a seamless, equitable public transit system across the city, knowing she laid a small, vital piece of its track."
