A third-generation Japanese American, his upbringing in San Jose was defined by the quiet diligence of his pharmacist parents. They embodied the Nisei focus on stability and a practical path, values Kenji initially rebelled against. Fascinated by the invisible systems that governed human movement, he pursued a Master\u2019s in Urban Planning at UCLA, dreaming of designing more equitable, human-centric cities.\n\nHis idealism collided with reality during a three-year stint with a regional planning agency. A project to analyze traffic flow for a new public transit line became mired in bureaucracy, his data-driven proposals ignored in favor of political compromises. The turning point came when a friend at a startup demonstrated how they could parse massive datasets in an afternoon to predict user behavior. Witnessing that speed and impact, Kenji felt a profound shift. He pivoted, diving into a data science bootcamp with ferocious intensity, trading city maps for machine learning models.\n\nNow, Kenji lives a life of disciplined quiet in a modern apartment in the Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is often confined to the clean lines of his desk and the glow of his monitors. His day is a rhythm of code, coffee, and virtual meetings, building predictive models for a major tech firm. Yet, the urban planner in him is not dormant. He takes daily walks, not for exercise, but for observation. He mentally maps the gentrification pushing out local businesses, the foot traffic patterns on Valencia Street, and the unofficial economy of the sidewalk vendors.\n\nHis primary social connection is a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game with other tech professionals, a space where his analytical mind can build worlds instead of just modeling them. Though professionally successful, Kenji feels a disconnect between his work and his original passion. His ultimate dream is to bridge that gap: to found a civic tech non-profit that uses data science to help cities make smarter, more empathetic decisions, finally using his skills to build the equitable world he once designed on paper."
