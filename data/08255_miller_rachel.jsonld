Her childhood was defined by the loving but frantic orbit around her older brother, whose descent into addiction cast a long shadow over their family. While her parents cycled through denial, anger, and helplessness, Rachel became a quiet observer, learning the language of pain and the inadequacy of good intentions. It was this formative experience that set her on a path not of judgment, but of understanding.\n\nShe left the Midwest for the progressive energy of the Bay Area, earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Her initial career was in the trenches of a large San Francisco hospital, a chaotic environment where she guided patients and families through the shock of life-altering diagnoses and chronic illness. It was demanding, soul-crushing work, but it affirmed her purpose. A key turning point came with the pandemic, which saw her role shift entirely to telehealth. Now, her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her kitchen to a small office in her Inner Sunset apartment.\n\nRachel\u2019s life is a study in controlled calm. Her days are spent in front of a screen, her voice a steady anchor for patients across the city. She lives alone, having ended a long-term relationship two years ago with a partner who couldn't navigate the invisible weight of her work. To decompress, she takes long, meandering walks through Golden Gate Park, finding solace in the misty eucalyptus groves. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, composed mostly of other healthcare professionals who understand the concept of vicarious trauma without needing it explained.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deeply personal; she chose this city as a place to heal herself by helping to heal others. At 42, Rachel dreams of a future with more balance. She fantasizes about opening a small private practice focused on grief counseling and, more simply, of finally adopting the rescue dog she\u2019s had bookmarked for months. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration for a life where she can offer comfort without carrying all of its weight home."
