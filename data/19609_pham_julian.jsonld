The son of a Vietnamese boat refugee who built a new life as a mechanic in Sacramento and an Irish-American librarian, Julian grew up navigating the quiet spaces between two cultures. His childhood was a blend of ph\u1edf and shepherd's pie, of Buddhist altars and Catholic holidays. This constant act of translation, of being an observer, naturally led him to a Communications degree from San Francisco State University, where he hoped to find a vocabulary for his own blended identity.\n\nHis early career was a series of junior marketing roles, writing copy that never quite felt authentic. The turning point came during a project to overhaul a confusing company intranet. Julian discovered his true talent wasn't just creating content, but organizing it into intuitive, human-centered systems. This revelation steered him toward a career in content strategy, where he thrived on bringing order to digital chaos. Now, as a Senior Content Strategist, he\u2019s the person who ensures information is clear, accessible, and useful\u2014a role he sees as an extension of his lifelong effort to build bridges of understanding.\n\nJulian\u2019s life is anchored in his NoPa apartment. His daily routine begins with strong coffee and a walk through the Panhandle, followed by a 3.8-mile ride on the N-Judah, where he deconstructs podcast narratives or reads design articles. After work, he might meet friends\u2014his chosen family\u2014for drinks in the Mission or decompress at a local pottery studio, his hands covered in clay. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, he\u2019s rediscovering his own rhythm in the city that finally feels like home.\n\nSan Francisco, with its fog-laced hills and eclectic communities, is the only place he hasn\u2019t felt like an outsider. Here, his \"otherness\" feels like a strength. Julian's aspirations are less about climbing the corporate ladder and more about finding depth. He dreams of using his skills to consult for non-profits, finding a lasting partnership, and one day visiting Vietnam to connect with the half of his story he only knows through his father\u2019s quiet recollections."

The scent of jasmine mingled with the pine from the Christmas tree his mother was decorating. He saw the photos of his Vietnamese grandparents next to a nativity scene. In that quiet moment, he didn't feel torn, but uniquely positioned\u2014the silent keeper of two separate worlds held together in one Sacramento home. It was the first time he understood his life would be about building bridges, even if only he could see them.\n\n2.\nIt happened late one Tuesday, around age 26, staring at a whiteboard. He was supposed to be writing copy for a broken company intranet, but instead, he was drawing boxes and arrows. Suddenly, the chaos clicked into a clean, logical flow. It wasn't about finding the right words; it was about creating the right path. For the first time, his professional life felt as intuitive as his personal one. It was a profound relief, the moment he stopped translating and started architecting understanding.\n\n3.\nOne foggy morning on the N-Judah, a couple of years after moving to the city, it hit him. He was just another face in the crowd, surrounded by a tech worker reading in Mandarin, an artist sketching, and two old friends chatting in Spanish. No one was trying to place him. His blended background wasn't a puzzle to be solved, but simply a part of the city's complex fabric. On that 3.8-mile ride to work, the profound feeling of anonymity felt, ironically, like being truly seen for the first time.\n\n4.\nThe breakup conversation happened at their shared kitchen table in NoPa just six months ago. There was no shouting, only a quiet, sad acknowledgment that the life they\u2019d built together felt like a beautifully designed system with a fatal flaw\u2014it wasn't his. Handing over the spare key felt less like a loss and more like reclaiming his own blueprint. It was the painful but necessary act of clearing a space he didn't realize he needed, a blank page waiting for a new story.\n\n5.\nDuring a visit home from SF State, his father was fixing a neighbor\u2019s car, knuckles greasy. Julian asked about Vietnam, and his dad, usually so reserved, paused. He didn't talk about the war or the boat, but about the specific taste of the broth from a street vendor in old Saigon, the scent of star anise in the humid air. In that moment, Vietnam transformed from a history lesson into a sensory, tangible place. It planted a seed of need\u2014to one day taste that broth and understand his father\u2019s first home."
