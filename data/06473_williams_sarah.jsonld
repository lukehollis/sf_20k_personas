Raised in Fresno by a pragmatic high school history teacher and a no-nonsense CPA, her childhood was stable, predictable, and devoid of overt emotional expression. The turning point came at sixteen when her grandmother entered hospice care. Sarah witnessed a social worker navigate her family\u2019s grief, offering not pity, but practical tools and profound compassion. In those quiet, difficult moments, Sarah found her calling.\n\nShe pursued a psychology degree at UCLA before being accepted into UC Berkeley's prestigious Master of Social Work program, a move that permanently anchored her to the Bay Area. Her early career was a trial by fire: grueling years in child protective services, followed by a demanding role at a community health clinic in the Tenderloin. These experiences hardened her but never extinguished the empathy that drove her. Eventually, she transitioned into a more structured role as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker within a large hospital system, specializing in counseling patients and families navigating chronic illness and end-of-life care.\n\nHer personal life has been a quieter journey. A marriage in her early thirties ended amicably after seven years, a mutual decision that they were better friends than partners. Now, at 47, her life is her own. The pandemic shifted her entire practice to telehealth, eliminating her commute and transforming a spare bedroom into her clinical space.\n\nSarah lives in a cozy, book-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her days follow a distinct rhythm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park as the fog burns off, followed by hours of video sessions, holding virtual space for people on their hardest days. Evenings are for disconnecting\u2014a glass of wine, a good novel, or dinner with her small, tight-knit circle of friends. Her connection to San Francisco is deep; she loves the city's intellectual rigor and natural beauty but is also intimately aware of its systemic pains through her work. Her aspiration is no longer to climb a career ladder, but to distill her decades of experience. She dreams of writing a book on compassionate caregiving and creating workshops to mentor the next generation of social workers, ensuring the quiet, essential work she values continues long after she closes her laptop for the final time."
