            "value": "Born Kim Min-jun in Busan, South Korea, Kevin O\u2019Connell\u2019s life began with a transpacific flight. Adopted as an infant, he was raised by the O\u2019Connells, a loving, boisterous Irish-American family in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. He grew up surrounded by Celtic music, Catholic holidays, and doting parents who celebrated his heritage but couldn't fully answer the quiet questions he had about his identity. This dual existence instilled in him a deep empathy and a keen eye for those who feel like outsiders.\n\nPressured by a well-meaning desire for him to have a stable career, his parents encouraged him toward tech. Kevin dutifully enrolled in computer science at SF State, but found the code colorless and sterile. The definitive turning point came during his sophomore year when he started volunteering at a community center childcare program to fulfill a course requirement. Amid the controlled chaos of finger painting and story time, he felt a profound sense of purpose he\u2019d never found in a lecture hall. He dropped out of college, a difficult decision that initially disappointed his parents, and pursued a certificate in early childhood development.\n\nNow 24, Kevin is a teacher's aide at a small, cooperative preschool in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his integrated life; he lives in a small in-law unit behind the school itself, a coveted arrangement that makes city living affordable. His days are a whirlwind of mediating disputes over toy blocks, wiping noses, and finding joy in a four-year-old\u2019s crookedly drawn sun. His social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of other educators and local artists who, like him, value community over capital. He still has Sunday dinner with his family in the Sunset, the anchor of his week.\n\nKevin\u2019s dream is not one of wealth but of impact. He hopes to return to college, this time on his own terms, to get a degree in Early Childhood Education. His ultimate aspiration is to open his own play-based preschool in the city, one that intentionally celebrates a multiplicity of cultures and makes every child feel seen. Quietly, he also dreams of one day visiting Busan, not to search for his past, but to simply stand in the city where his story began."
