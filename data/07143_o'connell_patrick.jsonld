Born in Oakland to a union electrician father and a public-school teacher mother, his childhood was steeped in the practical, blue-collar realities of the Bay Area. He watched San Francisco from across the water, a glittering, complex organism of wealth and decay. The true turning point came in 1989. As a teenager, witnessing the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake\u2014the buckled freeways, the fractured neighborhoods, and the community-led efforts to rebuild\u2014ignited a fascination with how cities heal and evolve.\n\nThis drove him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree, followed by a Master of Urban Planning from UCLA. He resisted the lure of private development, drawn instead to public service. Patrick started his career in San Francisco\u2019s Planning Department in the late 90s, just in time to witness the first dot-com boom reshape the city\u2019s DNA. He saw neighborhoods transform overnight and learned hard lessons about the clash between innovation, housing, and historic preservation. Through diligence and a deep institutional knowledge, he steadily climbed the ladder, earning the Director position a few years ago.\n\nHis personal life has been quieter. An amicable divorce a decade ago left him with a close relationship with his adult daughter, who ironically moved to Austin for a more \"livable\" urban experience\u2014a fact Patrick finds both painful and professionally motivating. He lives in a sleek, modern Hayes Valley condo, a stone's throw from City Hall. His zero-mile commute is a walk past the symphony hall and through the vibrant, sometimes chaotic, streets he helps manage.\n\nPatrick\u2019s days are a marathon of meetings with developers, activists, and politicians. Evenings are often spent at tense community forums. His dream isn't grand; it's pragmatic. He hopes to navigate the city\u2019s treacherous political waters to foster more equitable housing solutions and preserve the city's unique character without fossilizing it. He carries the immense weight of San Francisco's future on his shoulders, deeply in love with the complicated, frustrating, and beautiful city he has dedicated his life to serving."
