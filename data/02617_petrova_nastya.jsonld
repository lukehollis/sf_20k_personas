Growing up with practical, overworked parents, that kitchen was her only sanctuary, a place where the simple alchemy of water, yeast, and heat felt like magic. Her formal education ended with basic schooling; her real learning happened at her grandmother's side, memorizing the feel of perfectly kneaded dough and the scent of caraway-seeded rye bread.\n\nAt nineteen, an au pair position in a wealthy Pacific Heights home offered an escape route to San Francisco. The culture shock was immense, trading grey skies and factory smoke for brilliant Pacific light and the casual opulence of her host family. For two years, she cared for their children, quietly observing, saving every dollar she could, and feeling a homesickness not for her town, but for the simple act of creating something warm and nourishing with her hands.\n\nWhen her contract ended, the thought of returning was unbearable. She found a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, its kitchen barely large enough for her ambition. Armed with her grandmother\u2019s recipes and a fierce will to remain, she began baking. Her business started with a friend\u2019s request for a birthday cake, then grew through word-of-mouth. Soon, she was supplying a few local corner cafes and taking special orders online, her apartment perpetually fragrant with cinnamon and caramelized sugar.\n\nNow 32, Nastya\u2019s life is a cycle of pre-dawn hours spent kneading dough on her countertop, the rhythmic work a form of meditation. Her 0.0-mile commute is the walk from her bedroom to her kitchen. Her social life is woven into her work; she knows the baristas who sell her scones by name and has a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends who were first customers. Her connection to San Francisco isn't in its landmarks, but in its neighborhoods\u2014the foggy Richmond streets where she makes her deliveries on foot, the Clement Street Farmers Market where she finds inspiration.\n\nHer dream is not expansion, but permanence: a small, sunlit bakery of her own, perhaps in the Outer Sunset. A place with a proper deck oven and a window where she can see the sky. For Nastya, success is not wealth, but the quiet triumph of building a life, one perfect loaf at a time."
