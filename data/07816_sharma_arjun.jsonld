His parents, having arrived from Punjab in the late 1970s, instilled in him a familiar dream: stability through a career in engineering or medicine. Arjun, bright and dutiful, initially followed this path, earning an undergraduate degree in computer science. He landed a coveted job as a tech consultant just as the dot-com bubble reached its peak, a world of lavish parties and ephemeral stock options that left him feeling profoundly empty.\n\nThe bubble\u2019s pop was his turning point. Witnessing the wreckage of an industry built on hype, Arjun craved work with tangible, human impact. He turned his back on Silicon Valley and enrolled in a Master of Public Policy program at UC Berkeley. It was here he found his true calling, focusing on the social implications of the technology he once helped build. This academic pivot defined his professional life: for the past fifteen years, Arjun has been the Program Director for \"Bridging the Bay,\" a non-profit dedicated to providing digital literacy and career training to underserved youth and new immigrants.\n\nNow 45, Arjun\u2019s life is deeply rooted in San Francisco's Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to the spare room he converted into a home office, a change he embraced post-pandemic. His days are a mix of Zoom grant meetings, mentoring sessions with program participants, and strategic planning. He lives with his partner of ten years, Clara, a landscape architect he met volunteering at a community garden. Their evenings are often spent trying new restaurants on Valencia Street or walking their terrier mix, Buster, through the vibrant, mural-lined alleys.\n\nArjun feels a profound connection to the city\u2019s complex soul\u2014its clash of immense wealth and deep-seated inequality fuels his work. His dream isn\u2019t one of personal wealth, but of scale. He hopes to expand Bridging the Bay\u2019s model to other cities, creating a national network that ensures technological progress doesn't leave the most vulnerable behind. For Arjun, success is measured in the lives he can help stabilize, a far more enduring metric than the fluctuating stock tickers of his past."
