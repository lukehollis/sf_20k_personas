A second-generation Taiwanese-American, her childhood was a masterclass in supply and demand, inventory management, and the precise art of stocking shelves so the ripest peaches were always front and center. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable profession like medicine or law, Sarah, ever the pragmatist, chose a Communications degree from San Francisco State University, feeling it was broad enough to keep her options open.\n\nHer career began, as many in San Francisco do, with a foot-in-the-door temp job at a burgeoning tech startup in the late 90s. While coders built the digital world, Sarah found her calling managing the physical one. She organized hardware shipments, coordinated office moves, and untangled international shipping nightmares. She discovered that her childhood knack for knowing exactly how many cartons of milk were in the back room translated seamlessly to knowing how many server racks were stuck in customs. By her early thirties, she had carved a niche for herself, formally moving into logistics and steadily climbing the ladder through several companies.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties when a seven-year relationship ended. Her partner wanted to leave the Bay Area\u2019s intensity for a quieter life in the Pacific Northwest; Sarah, however, felt an unbreakable tie to the city\u2019s electric, chaotic energy. The breakup was painful but clarifying. She poured her focus into her career, becoming a Senior Logistics Manager, and cultivated a tight-knit circle of friends, many met during her early startup days.\n\nNow, at 46, Sarah\u2019s world is contained within her chic Hayes Valley condo. The 0.0-mile commute means her day starts not with traffic, but with a walk to a local bakery for coffee and a pastry, followed by a ritualistic check of global shipping trackers. Her apartment\u2019s second bedroom is a command center, where she juggles Zoom calls with suppliers in Asia and freight partners in Europe. To offset the digital strain, she finds solace in analog pursuits: a weekly pottery class in the Mission and tending to an impressive collection of houseplants. Her connection to San Francisco is layered\u2014she\u2019s a native who has watched neighborhoods transform, a tech professional who shapes its global reach, and a resident who treasures her small, walkable corner of the city. Her future aspiration isn't a higher title, but greater balance: leveraging her remote work flexibility to travel not for business, but for inspiration, maybe even setting up a small pottery studio of her own one day."
