Growing up in a quiet, orderly suburb of Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of two accountants who valued clear columns and balanced ledgers. Emotions, however, were messy, unquantifiable variables best left unexamined. This sterile emotional landscape pushed Anya outward, seeking the complexities her family life lacked. She found them in books, then in people.\n\nHer undergraduate degree in psychology felt too theoretical. A volunteer stint at a crisis hotline during her senior year became her turning point. The raw, urgent needs she encountered on the other end of the line gave her a profound sense of purpose that abstract theories never could. She moved to San Francisco for her Master of Social Work at SF State, drawn to the city's chaotic compassion and its visible struggles.\n\nAfter graduating, Anya worked for several years as a discharge planner at a major hospital. The work was vital but felt like pushing paper against a tidal wave of systemic failure. She craved a deeper connection. This led her to her current role, a unique position as the live-in Licensed Social Worker for a supportive housing facility in SoMa, home to formerly unhoused seniors with complex medical and psychological needs.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of her life. Her small, spartan apartment is on the third floor; her clients and office are on the first two. Her life is sutured to her work. Her morning coffee is often interrupted by a resident needing help with medication, and her evenings are spent a wall away from the community she serves. Her closest relationships are with her residents\u2014like Mr. Henderson, a retired jazz musician she helps manage his diabetes, and Maria, whose stories of the old Mission District are a form of oral history.\n\nAt 39, Anya feels the weight of her choice. Friendships outside the facility have become difficult to maintain, as her reality is so far removed from theirs. Her hope is not for a promotion or a larger salary, but for something simpler: balance. She dreams of a small cottage, perhaps in the Sunset, with a garden and a life where she isn't constantly on call. For now, however, she remains an anchor in the storm for others, finding her purpose in the few feet between her front door and theirs."
