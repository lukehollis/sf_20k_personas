Born in Fremont to immigrants from Shanghai, she grew up in the back of their small electronics repair shop. While other kids played, Wei was fascinated by the organized chaos of components and schematics, learning early that every piece had a purpose and a path. This instilled in her a profound appreciation for systems.\n\nShe pursued this interest with quiet determination, earning a business degree from UC Davis and immediately enrolling in an MBA program at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, specializing in Supply Chain Management. She saw it as the ultimate puzzle: moving the right things to the right place at the right time, on a global scale. Her career began at a mid-size consumer electronics firm, where she quickly distinguished herself.\n\nThe true turning point came during the initial chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. As supply chains fractured worldwide, Wei thrived. While others panicked, she worked 18-hour days, her apartment in Noe Valley illuminated by the glow of her laptop. She rerouted shipments through obscure ports and chartered planes, becoming a legend within her company. That performance led to her current role as Director of Global Sourcing, managing a complex web of international suppliers.\n\nToday, Wei\u2019s life is a disciplined rhythm. Her mornings begin before dawn with calls to Europe. Her commute on the J Church Muni line is her sanctuary\u2014a 25-minute window to listen to economics podcasts or simply watch the city wake up. Evenings are often spent on calls with Asia, but she carves out time for her small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other professionals she\u2019s known since her MBA program.\n\nHaving achieved the financial stability her parents dreamed of for her, Wei\u2019s aspirations are shifting. San Francisco, once just a hub of opportunity, is now her home. She loves the weekend farmers' market on 24th Street and hiking in the Marin Headlands. Her next goal isn\u2019t a promotion, but a purpose. She hopes to join the board of a non-profit, applying her formidable logistical skills to humanitarian aid, finally solving the kind of supply chain problem that truly matters."

Her father unrolled a schematic for a broken radio, his finger tracing a path on the paper. \"Here,\" he said, \"this is where the power stops.\" To Wei, it was magic. The world wasn't random; it was a system of invisible pathways that could be understood and repaired. In that moment of shared, quiet focus, she felt a profound sense of order. She knew then that she would spend her life making things connect correctly.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in April 2020, her Noe Valley apartment glowing from three monitors. After a frantic 18-hour day, she got the confirmation: a charter plane full of components had cleared a tiny port in Vietnam. A wave of pure, adrenalized triumph washed over her. While the world was fracturing, she had held a single, crucial piece of it together. It wasn't just a professional victory; it was the moment she realized her meticulous nature was a superpower in a world of chaos.\n\n3.\nOne ordinary Tuesday on the J Church, rattling past Dolores Park, the morning sun finally broke through the fog and flooded the car. Her economics podcast was detailing market fluctuations, but Wei was struck still by the quiet beauty of the scene. People walking dogs, heading to work. This commute, this city\u2014it wasn't just a strategic location for her career anymore. A deep, unexpected feeling of contentment settled in her. It was the moment San Francisco truly became home.\n\n4.\nShe was at a small dinner with her friends from Haas. For once, the conversation wasn\u2019t about career ladders or market trends, but about a friend\u2019s sick parent and another\u2019s dating fears. Wei mostly listened, feeling a knot in her chest she hadn't known was there slowly unwind. She realized her carefully managed life needed this unstructured, inefficient, vital system of support. It taught her that the most important networks aren\u2019t built on efficiency, but on shared vulnerability and trust.\n\n5.\nLast winter, she saw a news report about an earthquake overseas. The camera panned over crates of medical aid, stranded on a tarmac due to customs issues and poor planning. A sharp, visceral frustration seized her. She solved logistical nightmares like that every day for her company. In that instant, her ambition pivoted. Her next great puzzle wouldn't be for profit. It would be applying her skills to a supply chain that carried not components, but hope."
