Born in a Malaysian refugee camp in 1975, she arrived in San Francisco as an infant with parents who carried little more than the clothes on their backs and a fierce will to survive. They settled in the Tenderloin, where the city\u2019s cacophony was both a threat and a promise. Lien, the eldest of three, quickly became her family\u2019s anchor. While her parents worked grueling hours cleaning offices and washing dishes, she navigated the American world for them, translating at appointments and helping raise her younger siblings.\n\nSchool was secondary to survival. Lien was practical, not studious, and after graduating from Mission High, she entered the workforce. She cycled through unfulfilling service jobs until her late twenties, seeking the stability her parents never had. It was her late husband, Mark Feldman, a gentle social worker she\u2019d met at a community event, who suggested she apply to Muni. \u201cYou know this city better than anyone, Lien,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re tough enough for it.\u201d\n\nHe was right. Becoming a transit operator in 2003 was her turning point. The steady paycheck, union benefits, and pension offered a security she\u2019d only dreamed of. Tragically, Mark passed away from cancer just a few years later, leaving Lien heartbroken but not broken. She kept his name and threw herself into her work, finding a strange solace in the rhythm of her route and the hum of the engine.\n\nNow, at 49, Lien is a veteran operator. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, taking the 38R Geary Rapid to her depot each morning. Her bus is her domain, a rolling microcosm of the city she\u2019s served for over two decades. She knows the regulars, handles disruptions with a firm calm, and feels a quiet pride in moving San Francisco. Her aspirations are simple: retire in a decade, travel to Vietnam to see her parents\u2019 homeland, and help her nieces and nephews navigate the city she knows so intimately, one stop at a time."

Lien had to translate the doctor\u2019s calm, terrifying words, phrases she barely understood but felt the weight of. In that moment, watching her mother\u2019s eyes search her own for answers, she sealed a part of her childhood away. That day, she learned that strength wasn't about being unafraid; it was about shouldering the fear for those you love.\n\n2.\nMark was stirring honey into her tea one rainy evening in their drafty Nob Hill studio, circa 2002. He said it so simply: \u201cYou should drive for Muni.\u201d Lien almost laughed, but he was serious, his gaze steady. \u201cYou know this city. You\u2019re tough.\u201d In his eyes, her lifetime of navigating the city for her parents wasn\u2019t a burden, but a superpower. His faith in her was a key, unlocking a door to a future she hadn\u2019t dared to imagine for herself.\n\n3.\nHer first solo run in 2003, gripping the enormous wheel of the 5 Fulton. Her knuckles were white. When the doors hissed open and the first passengers boarded, a current of profound responsibility shot through her. With every stop, the fear receded, replaced by a quiet, solid competence. The engine\u2019s hum was the sound of a steady paycheck, of a pension, of her feet finally finding solid ground. This bus was her domain, and for the first time, she felt powerful.\n\n4.\nA month after Mark\u2019s funeral, the grief was a silent passenger buckled in beside her. Driving the pre-dawn Geary route, the city was still asleep, quiet enough for her to hear her own shattered thoughts. But the rumble of the engine was a steady heartbeat when hers felt faint. The bus had to keep moving forward, stop by stop, and so, she discovered, did she. That relentless rhythm was a harsh, necessary comfort that kept her from falling completely apart.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young woman, clutching a phone with a map, looked near tears. In her panicked mix of English and Vietnamese, Lien heard her own childhood. She pulled the bus over safely past the stop, her voice calm and firm. \u201c\u0110\u1eebng lo,\u201d she said in Vietnamese. \u201cI know this city.\u201d Helping the girl find her way felt like protecting the small, overwhelmed child she once was. It was the deepest meaning her job had ever held: she was no longer lost, but the one who guided others home."
