Born to an Oaxacan immigrant mother and a French-American academic father, her childhood in the Mission District was a vibrant fusion of cultures\u2014the scent of mole and fresh pan dulce mixing with heated intellectual debates around the dinner table. This duality shaped her profoundly, teaching her to appreciate both deep-rooted community and structured, critical thinking. The true turning point came in 1989. As a teenager, she witnessed the Loma Prieta earthquake shatter the city's infrastructure, an event that instilled in her a lifelong obsession with how cities withstand, break, and heal.\n\nThis obsession propelled her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master's in Urban Planning. Joining the San Francisco City Planning Department was a calling, not just a job. She spent two decades climbing the ladder, her data-driven, unsentimental approach earning her respect, and sometimes ire. Her demanding career contributed to an amicable divorce in her early forties, a painful but necessary recalibration that left her with a singular focus on her work and her son, who is now away at college.\n\nNow 51, Sofia is the Deputy Director. Her 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in the bay window of her meticulously restored Noe Valley Victorian, a home she sees as both a sanctuary and a case study. Her days are a marathon of virtual meetings, poring over zoning codes, environmental impact reports, and architectural blueprints. Her morning ritual is a brisk walk through her neighborhood, but it is never just for exercise; she\u2019s constantly observing the delicate urban fabric\u2014the new parklet, the fight over a proposed condo development, the way sunlight hits a public staircase she helped approve years ago.\n\nSofia's ultimate aspiration isn't just the Director title, though she sees it as the next logical step. Her dream is to leave a legacy of smart, equitable, and resilient design. She hopes to steer San Francisco away from reactionary policies and toward a future where heritage and progress can coexist, ensuring the city that forged her remains a livable, vibrant home for generations to come."
