The son of a pragmatic, White architect father from Ohio and a second-generation Chinese-American graphic designer mother, Caleb grew up in Berkeley surrounded by books and unspoken emotional complexities. His parents, loving but reserved, communicated through intellectual debate rather than open feeling. From a young age, Caleb became a keen observer of subtext, learning to read the tensions and affections that simmered beneath the surface of his family\u2019s polite, academic life. This innate skill became his calling.\n\nA close friend\u2019s severe struggle with depression in high school was the turning point that solidified his path. Witnessing the profound impact of professional help, Caleb pursued psychology with unwavering focus. After completing his undergraduate degree at UC Santa Cruz, he moved across the bay to the University of San Francisco for his Master\u2019s in Counseling Psychology. San Francisco, with its dense, interwoven communities, felt like the right place to put his skills to use. He landed a position as a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist at a non-profit community health clinic in the Mission District, working with families navigating immense stress.\n\nNow 26, Caleb\u2019s life is a study in deliberate balance. He lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose blend of cultures feels like home. His daily routine is structured: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, then the 38-Geary or N-Judah Muni line to the clinic, a commute he uses for reading fiction\u2014a necessary escape from the intense realities of his work. His days are filled with holding space for others\u2019 trauma and triumphs, a draining but deeply rewarding process.\n\nHis social circle is small but deep, comprised mainly of friends from his graduate cohort who understand the pressures of their field. Dating is sporadic; he finds it challenging to transition from a therapeutic mindset to one of personal vulnerability. Caleb\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but mastery. He aspires to one day open a small private practice specializing in cross-cultural couples counseling, drawing from his own lived experience. He sees San Francisco not just as a city, but as a complex ecosystem of relationships he is uniquely equipped to help nurture."

His father doesn't speak, but his shoulders relax, a subtle nod of agreement passing between them. In that silent exchange over architectural plans, Caleb learned love\u2019s primary language wasn\u2019t words, but a shared, unspoken understanding. It taught him to listen to the quiet spaces, a skill that would one day define him.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, he sat on the carpeted floor of his friend Maya\u2019s bedroom. She stared at a wall, trapped in the thick fog of her depression. He didn't offer advice; he just stayed, a quiet anchor in her silent storm. After an hour, she whispered, \"Thanks for not leaving.\" The profound weight of his simple presence\u2014of bearing witness without trying to fix\u2014was a revelation. It was the moment psychology went from an interest to a calling.\n\n3.\nHis first week of grad school at USF, age twenty-two. He was on a crowded N-Judah train heading downtown. He watched an elderly Cantonese woman and a young skater navigate a conversation with a mix of broken English, gestures, and laughter. They were creating a temporary, beautiful language all their own. A deep sense of rightness settled in him; this dense, complex tapestry of human connection was exactly where he was meant to be.\n\n4.\nJust last year, at twenty-five, he was in a session with a family from the Mission. The teenage daughter, silent for weeks, finally broke down, her fear of failing her parents spilling out in tears. Her stoic father, without a word, reached across the space between them and gently placed a hand on her arm. The fragile hope in that room was electric. It was a draining, powerful reminder that his job wasn't to solve but to hold the space for a family's own quiet miracle.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after a stilted date where he'd defaulted to his therapist's toolkit\u2014observing, questioning, but never revealing\u2014he sat by his Inner Richmond window. The fog swallowed the streetlights, and a familiar loneliness crept in. He realized he was an expert at fostering vulnerability in others but a novice at his own. The city felt vast, and his professional expertise offered no map for the territory of his own heart."
