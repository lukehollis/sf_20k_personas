She was raised in the Outer Sunset, the daughter of first-generation immigrants who ran a small, beloved Cantonese restaurant. Her childhood was a symphony of clanking woks, the murmur of regulars, and the pressure to achieve a stability her parents never had. They envisioned a future for her in medicine or law, a tangible profession with a clear path.\n\nHowever, at UC Davis, Mei fell in love with Sociology. She was fascinated by the systems that shape human behavior, the patterns hidden within communities. It was a rebellion of the quietest sort, choosing a path of understanding over one of predetermined prestige. After graduating, the reality of the job market hit hard. The pressure from her family, coupled with her own desire for independence, led to a pivotal compromise. She enrolled in a grueling six-month data analytics bootcamp, realizing she could apply her passion for societal patterns to the booming tech industry. It was a pragmatic pivot, one that secured her a role analyzing user behavior for a major tech firm.\n\nNow 35, Mei works from her meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley. With a zero-mile commute, her days have a comfortable rhythm. She starts with a foggy morning walk to a local bakery for coffee before logging on, spending her hours translating raw data into human stories. While she excels at her job, finding satisfaction in decoding digital trends, she keeps the tech world at arm's length. Her social life is intentional and curated, centered on a weekly pottery class where she met her partner, a landscape architect, and a tight-knit circle of friends from college.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is layered. She loves the creative energy of Hayes Valley but finds deep comfort in visiting her parents in the Sunset, the familiar taste of their cooking a direct link to her past. Her aspiration is to eventually bridge her two worlds: to use her data skills for a nonprofit focused on urban planning or housing advocacy, turning her analytical-eye back to the sociological questions that first captured her imagination. She dreams of a future where her work doesn't just optimize clicks, but actively helps shape a more equitable city."
