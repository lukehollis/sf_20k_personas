Her grandparents, who ran a small grocery store on Post Street, shared quiet stories of pre-war vibrancy and the stark silence of the internment camps. These tales cultivated in Sarah a deep sense of history and a quiet determination to preserve the culture that had endured so much. While her parents embraced the Bay Area\u2019s tech-driven future\u2014her father a software engineer, her mother a high school math teacher\u2014Sarah found herself drawn to the past.\n\nHer educational journey at UC Davis began with an undeclared major, a concession to her practical parents. A turning point came in an elective Art History course focusing on Meiji-era woodblock prints. It was a revelation, connecting the abstract history of her ancestors to tangible beauty. She immediately declared a major in Art History with a minor in Asian American Studies, focusing her thesis on the artistic expressions of post-internment Japanese-American communities.\n\nAfter graduation, Sarah secured a coveted internship at the fictional Pacific Arts Museum, a small institution nestled between Hayes Valley and Japantown. Her passion and unique academic background made her indispensable. When the Program Coordinator position opened up, she was the natural choice. The job came with a rare perk: a small, rent-controlled apartment built into the museum\u2019s upper floor, a remnant from its time as a private collection. This reduced her commute to zero and intertwined her life completely with the institution she loved.\n\nHer days are a blur of activity: planning community workshops, coordinating with local artists, and leading school tours. Evenings are often spent in the quiet hum of the archives, losing herself in research. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow creatives and old high school classmates who ground her.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to one day curate her own major exhibition, telling the story of Bay Area Asian artists through the decades. For now, she finds fulfillment in making art accessible, in seeing a child\u2019s eyes light up at a centuries-old sculpture. Living within the museum\u2019s walls, she feels less like an employee and more like a guardian of the stories and legacies she is sworn to protect."
