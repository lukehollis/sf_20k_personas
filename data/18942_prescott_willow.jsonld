Raised in a home that prioritized appearances, she became an expert at reading the subtle emotional currents beneath her parents\u2019 strained civility. Her father, a successful but emotionally distant architect, and her mother, a gracious hostess who buried her own unmet needs, unknowingly trained Willow to be an observer of unspoken truths. She was the family\u2019s silent emotional barometer, a role that felt both natural and burdensome.\n\nInitially enrolling at UC Berkeley to study economics as a practical compromise, Willow felt adrift. A single elective course in developmental psychology felt like a homecoming, giving a name and framework to the dynamics she had navigated her entire life. She switched her major, finally feeling a sense of purpose. She then pursued her Master\u2019s in Counseling Psychology at San Francisco State University, committing to the city that felt more honest and alive than the curated world she\u2019d left behind. The grueling years of associate work, juggling low-paying agency jobs to accumulate licensure hours, solidified her resolve.\n\nA key turning point came at 28, just as she was preparing to launch her private practice. Her long-term relationship with a software engineer crumbled under the weight of his demanding startup career and her own emotional needs. The breakup was devastating but also clarifying. It forced Willow to apply the therapeutic tools she offered others to her own grief and self-discovery, ultimately making her a more empathetic and grounded practitioner.\n\nNow, at 32, Willow\u2019s commute is a walk from her bedroom to her home office in a cozy Inner Sunset apartment. The 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse; it allows for autonomy but demands strict boundaries. Her days are structured by back-to-back telehealth sessions, guiding couples and individuals through their own complex lives. To decompress, she runs in Golden Gate Park at dawn and deliberately disconnects in the evenings with novels and small dinner parties with a close-knit circle of friends. Willow feels deeply connected to her neighborhood, frequenting its small markets and cafes. Her dream is to one day find a partnership as balanced and healthy as the ones she helps her clients build, proving to herself that the work she does for others is truly possible for herself."
