The daughter of a frequently transferred corporate manager, Deborah grew up across the Midwest, never staying in one place long enough to grow deep roots. She sought permanence in the timeless world of art, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History from a small liberal arts college in Ohio. Her dream was to work in a grand museum, surrounded by the quiet beauty of the past.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco in the early 1990s, drawn by its romanticism and cultural vibrancy. However, her junior curatorial assistant job proved to be more about cataloging artifacts in a dusty basement than engaging with art. A brief, ill-fated marriage in her late twenties ended as amicably as it began, leaving her feeling adrift. The turning point came when she started volunteering at a community center's after-school arts program. There, surrounded by the chaotic, joyful energy of children smearing finger paint, she found a sense of purpose the hallowed halls of a museum never provided. She discovered her true calling wasn't in preserving the past, but in shaping the future.\n\nThis revelation led her back to school for an early childhood education certificate. For the past twenty years, Deborah has been the heart of \u201cSunset Sprouts,\u201d a small, play-based preschool she runs from the ground floor of a classic Edwardian building. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down an internal flight of stairs from her cozy one-bedroom apartment to the classroom below. Her days are a whirlwind of storytelling, mediating disputes over shared toys, and wiping away tears. Her social life is woven into her work; former students\u2019 parents have become close friends, and she\u2019s on a first-name basis with the owner of the local bakery and the librarians at the neighborhood branch.\n\nNow 53, Deborah\u2019s aspirations are modest but deeply felt. She dreams of one day taking a trip to Florence to see the masterpieces she once studied, a pilgrimage to connect her past self with the content woman she has become. More than anything, she hopes to continue being a stable, loving presence in her small corner of San Francisco, a permanent fixture in the lives of the children who pass through her door."
