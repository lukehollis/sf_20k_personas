The only son of a meticulous carpenter and a compassionate community health worker, his upbringing was a blend of practicality and empathy. His parents, second-generation Mexican-Americans, instilled in him a profound respect for tangible work and community service, always emphasizing that education was the key to a different kind of life\u2014one built with the mind, not just the hands.\n\nInitially, Ethan heeded their call in his own way, pursuing a B.A. in Sociology at UC Santa Cruz, fascinated by the systems and stories that shape human societies. However, during a frustratingly anecdotal senior thesis project, he hit a wall. He craved empirical proof, a way to see the patterns he theorized about on a grander scale. This intellectual pivot was his turning point, leading him to a Master's in Information Science at UC Berkeley. There, he discovered his true talent: finding the human story within mountains of data.\n\nUpon graduating, he was swept into San Francisco's booming tech industry. As a Senior Data Scientist, Ethan now spends his days in his quiet Mission District apartment, his commute a mere 0.0 miles. His routine is disciplined: a morning pour-over from a local roaster, deep-focus work sessions modeling user behavior, and midday walks with Pixel, his rescue terrier, through the neighborhood\u2019s mural-lined alleys.\n\nHis work is abstract, but his life is grounded. His long-term partner, Maya, an art restoration specialist, ensures their conversations extend far beyond algorithms and KPIs. Their social circle is a curated mix of tech colleagues and friends from the arts, a balance that keeps him from disappearing into the industry echo chamber.\n\nEthan feels deeply connected to the Mission, its vibrant culture a faint echo of his San Diego roots. While he excels in the corporate world, a dream simmers beneath the surface. He aspires to one day launch a \"data for good\" consultancy, using his skills to help nonprofits and city planners tackle complex social issues like housing and public health\u2014a modern application of the values his parents taught him, trading a carpenter\u2019s hammer for the powerful, precise tool of data."
