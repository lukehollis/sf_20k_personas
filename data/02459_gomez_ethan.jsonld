The only son of a meticulous carpenter and a compassionate community health worker, his upbringing was a blend of practicality and empathy. His parents, second-generation Mexican-Americans, instilled in him a profound respect for tangible work and community service, always emphasizing that education was the key to a different kind of life\u2014one built with the mind, not just the hands.\n\nInitially, Ethan heeded their call in his own way, pursuing a B.A. in Sociology at UC Santa Cruz, fascinated by the systems and stories that shape human societies. However, during a frustratingly anecdotal senior thesis project, he hit a wall. He craved empirical proof, a way to see the patterns he theorized about on a grander scale. This intellectual pivot was his turning point, leading him to a Master's in Information Science at UC Berkeley. There, he discovered his true talent: finding the human story within mountains of data.\n\nUpon graduating, he was swept into San Francisco's booming tech industry. As a Senior Data Scientist, Ethan now spends his days in his quiet Mission District apartment, his commute a mere 0.0 miles. His routine is disciplined: a morning pour-over from a local roaster, deep-focus work sessions modeling user behavior, and midday walks with Pixel, his rescue terrier, through the neighborhood\u2019s mural-lined alleys.\n\nHis work is abstract, but his life is grounded. His long-term partner, Maya, an art restoration specialist, ensures their conversations extend far beyond algorithms and KPIs. Their social circle is a curated mix of tech colleagues and friends from the arts, a balance that keeps him from disappearing into the industry echo chamber.\n\nEthan feels deeply connected to the Mission, its vibrant culture a faint echo of his San Diego roots. While he excels in the corporate world, a dream simmers beneath the surface. He aspires to one day launch a \"data for good\" consultancy, using his skills to help nonprofits and city planners tackle complex social issues like housing and public health\u2014a modern application of the values his parents taught him, trading a carpenter\u2019s hammer for the powerful, precise tool of data."

His dad held a plank, tracing a pencil line. \u201cMide dos veces, corta una vez,\u201d he\u2019d said, tapping the wood. Ethan felt a profound respect for that irreversible moment of the saw blade meeting the wood. It was a lesson in precision and consequence he now applies before running any code, knowing that a clean, well-measured dataset is the foundation upon which everything else is built. He still measures twice.\n\n2.\nThe library at UC Santa Cruz had felt like a tomb. Surrounded by books on urban displacement, his thesis felt hollow, built on anecdotes instead of evidence. He remembers the intense frustration, the feeling of powerlessness against the scale of the problem. In that moment of intellectual despair, a sharp, clarifying hunger was born: a need to see the systems, not just read the stories. He didn't just want to describe the world; he wanted to quantify it, to prove it. That failure was the first step toward Berkeley.\n\n3.\nAt the SF SPCA, he saw a small, shivering terrier trying to make himself invisible in the back of the kennel. Their eyes met, and the detached world of models and metrics dissolved. All he felt was an overwhelming, protective urge. Taking Pixel home wasn't a decision, it was an imperative. The rescue\u2019s simple, tangible needs\u2014a walk, a meal, a warm lap\u2014became a non-negotiable anchor, grounding his abstract, digital days in the real, immediate world of his Mission neighborhood.\n\n4.\nHe remembers Maya showing him a 17th-century canvas in her studio. She pointed to a delicate web of cracks in the varnish, calling it \u201ccrazing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the map of the painting\u2019s life,\u201d she\u2019d explained, a story of age and environment. He saw an instant parallel to his work: the outliers and flawed data points he\u2019d been trained to scrub were also part of a story. Because of her, he started looking for the humanity in the imperfections, not just the pattern in the clean data.\n\n5.\nOne afternoon, he walked past a long, quiet line outside the food bank on 16th Street, then went home to optimize a user engagement model for a luxury shopping app. The dissonance was sickening. The immense power of his tools felt so profoundly misapplied, almost wasted. The abstract success on his screen felt meaningless compared to the tangible need on his street. That specific, jarring contrast ignited the dream of his own consultancy\u2014a way to finally point his tools toward problems that truly mattered."
