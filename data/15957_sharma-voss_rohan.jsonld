He was raised in Berkeley by his mother, a pragmatic biochemist from Delhi, and his German-American father, a literature professor who saw poetry in everything. Their home was a lively intersection of scientific inquiry and artistic passion, a dynamic that shaped Rohan\u2019s path. He grew up understanding that creativity needs structure to thrive, and structure is meaningless without a creative soul.\n\nInitially a history major at UCLA, Rohan found his calling during a summer internship at a campus museum. He was less captivated by the artifacts themselves than by the complex dance of funding, curating, and public engagement required to share them. This revelation led him to a graduate degree in Arts Administration from New York University. He began his career in Chicago, quickly building a reputation for developing innovative, community-focused programs that boosted attendance and secured grants.\n\nA key turning point was his father\u2019s passing five years ago. Sorting through his father's extensive library, Rohan felt the profound weight of preserving cultural legacy. This solidified his professional mission, and he pursued his current role as Director of Programs at a prominent San Francisco art museum with renewed purpose.\n\nToday, Rohan lives in Hayes Valley with his partner of eight years, David, a landscape architect. Their life is a curated blend of culture and quiet domesticity. His 4.5-mile commute on the Muni is a cherished ritual, a time to observe the city's rhythm before immersing himself in the structured world of the museum. He spends his days managing budgets, mentoring staff, and envisioning exhibitions that challenge and inspire.\n\nRohan loves San Francisco for its inherent contradictions\u2014a hub of tech-fueled futurism that fiercely protects its counter-culture history. His ultimate aspiration is to become the Executive Director of a major cultural institution, a role where he can fully synthesize his parents' legacies: building sustainable, impactful homes for art and ideas. He dreams of ensuring that in a city obsessed with the next big thing, the timeless power of human creativity always has a place to flourish."

His mother held a tube of ultramarine paint, explaining the chemical composition of the pigment with scientific precision. At the same time, his father read a poem about the color of the sea, his voice filling the room with wonder. In that moment, the world wasn't divided into art and science; it was a single, beautiful whole. It taught him that every masterpiece has a blueprint, and every blueprint needs a soul.\n\n2.\nDuring his college internship at the UCLA museum, he wasn\u2019t captivated by the Mayan pottery but by a binder left on a curator's desk. It was a grant proposal, its pages filled with budgets, outreach strategies, and demographic targets. He saw the intricate architecture holding up the art, the unseen scaffolding that allowed history to be shared. In that spreadsheet, he found a new kind of poetry\u2014the practical magic of making culture sustainable. He changed his career path the following semester.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, sorting through his father\u2019s books, his hands were coated in the dust of legacy. He found a worn copy of Walt Whitman, and tucked inside was an old grant application his father had helped him draft for a college project. On the cover, his dad had scrawled, \"For your structures.\" The simple note unlocked a torrent of grief and purpose. His work was no longer a career; it was a solemn promise to build worthy homes for the stories his father cherished.\n\n4.\nJust last year, on a foggy Saturday, David finally perfected the native plant arrangement on their small Hayes Valley balcony. As his partner explained the careful balance of light, soil, and form with an architect's quiet passion, Rohan felt a profound sense of peace. This was their own small-scale exhibition: a curated, living art piece built on structure and love. It was the feeling of home he strived to create for others at the museum\u2014a space intentionally designed for beauty to grow.\n\n5.\nOn the rattling N-Judah one morning last spring, he saw it. A young coder in a sleek jacket was designing an app, while beside her, an old woman meticulously sketched the foggy skyline in a tattered notebook. The city's core contradiction, side-by-side. It wasn't a conflict to be solved, but a dynamic to be embraced. He felt a surge of determination: his job was to be the bridge between them, ensuring the sketchbook always had as much value as the screen."
