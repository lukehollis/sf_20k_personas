Raised in Fremont by first-generation Indian immigrant parents, she was the dutiful older sister. Her father, a software engineer, envisioned a similar path of stability for her. However, Priya\u2019s world pivoted around her younger brother, Rohan, who was diagnosed with autism at a young age. She became his translator, his advocate, and his calm in a world that often felt too loud.\n\nThis experience led her to enroll in Psychology at SF State. Yet, the abstract theories felt distant from the hands-on, patient work she did with Rohan daily. During her sophomore year, a family health crisis strained their finances, and the pressure mounted. Priya made a difficult choice: she left university. It wasn't an act of surrender, but of redirection. She quickly earned her certification as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT), realizing she could make an immediate impact without a lengthy degree.\n\nNow 24, Priya lives in a cramped but sunny Inner Sunset apartment with two other roommates, a nursing student and a graphic designer. Her days are framed by the rumble of the N Judah streetcar, which she takes 3.5 miles to the specialized school where she works. Her job is demanding\u2014managing tantrums, celebrating micro-milestones, and providing the structured support her young clients need to navigate their world. The $58,000 salary requires careful budgeting, with joys found in shared homemade dinners, free Tuesdays at the de Young Museum, and long walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nPriya feels at home in San Francisco\u2019s blend of ambition and acceptance. The city doesn\u2019t judge her non-linear career path. Her social circle is small but deep, built on shared experiences of trying to build a meaningful life in an expensive city. Her deepest connection remains with her family, especially Rohan, who is the constant reminder of her \"why.\" Priya\u2019s dream is to eventually return to school, on her own terms, to become a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). She aspires to one day open a small, culturally-sensitive clinic in the Bay Area, creating a space for families like her own to feel seen and supported."

Rohan, then seven, was rocking in a corner, hands over his ears, his small face crumpled in distress. While the adults fluttered helplessly, Priya led him to a quiet hallway. She didn't speak. She just sat on the floor and began rhythmically tapping a pattern on his knee. He slowly stilled, his breathing evening out. It wasn\u2019t just love she felt, but competence. In that quiet hall, she realized she was his anchor, a skill that felt more important than anything else.\n\n2.\nThe decision to leave SF State crystallized not in a classroom, but over the phone. Her father, his voice thin with worry, explained the cost of her mother\u2019s new medical treatments. Priya looked at her psychology textbook, full of theories that felt worlds away from the immediate, pressing weight of her family\u2019s need. She felt a profound, aching clarity. Leaving school wasn\u2019t quitting; it was choosing. It was the moment she understood that true duty sometimes meant veering off the expected path to take care of her own. This occurred when she was 20.\n\n3.\nHer first solo session as an RBT, aged 21. A five-year-old boy, non-verbal and prone to fits of frustration, had refused to engage for an hour. Priya\u2019s supervisor was watching. Instead of pushing, she noticed him tracing the pattern on the rug. She got on the floor and traced it with him. After five silent minutes, he looked up and handed her a blue block. That tiny, offered gift felt more validating than any academic grade. It was the moment she knew, with bone-deep certainty, that she was exactly where she was meant to be.\n\n4.\nIt was a foggy Tuesday, just last year. Priya and her two roommates, all of them exhausted and broke, scraped together enough cash for a cheap bottle of wine. They sat on the floor of their tiny living room, lit by a single lamp, listening to the N Judah rumble past. They didn\u2019t talk about their dreams or anxieties, just shared stories from their week. The simple, shared warmth in that cramped space made San Francisco feel like home. It wasn\u2019t about ambition, but about finding a pocket of peace together in the hustle.\n\n5.\nLast month, during a visit to Fremont. Rohan, now a teenager, proudly showed her a detailed drawing he\u2019d made of the Golden Gate Bridge, every cable rendered with intense focus. He pointed to a small figure on the bridge and said her name: \"Priya.\" Seein herself through his eyes\u2014not as a caretaker, but as part of his world, a landmark in his personal map\u2014was overwhelming. That moment solidified her dream. The clinic she wanted to build wasn't just for families like hers; it was for every Rohan to find his voice."
