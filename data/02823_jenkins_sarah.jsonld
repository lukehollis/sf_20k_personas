The daughter of an accountant and a history teacher, she was raised on a diet of fiscal responsibility and historical facts, yet all she ever wanted was to get lost in the abstract splotches of a Rothko painting. Her escape was a graduate program in Art History, a choice her parents funded with loving skepticism. It was her ticket out, and she landed in San Francisco, drawn by its faded bohemian promise.\n\nHer initial foray into the art world was a letdown. As a junior administrator at a prestigious downtown museum, she found the work sterile and corporate. The turning point came when she volunteered to help a scrappy community arts group in the Mission District install a mural. In the vibrant chaos of spray paint, shared food, and community collaboration, she found her purpose. She quit her museum job within the month.\n\nNow, at 43, Sarah is the Executive Director of the \"Mission Arts Alliance,\" a small but influential non-profit. Her commute is zero because her rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment, crammed with books and artwork by local artists, doubles as her office. Her days are a relentless cycle of grant writing, donor schmoozing, and championing emerging artists who would otherwise be priced out of the city.\n\nA long-term relationship dissolved years ago over the classic SF dilemma: stay in the city's vibrant heart or leave for suburban stability. Sarah chose the city. Her social life is now a tight-knit circle of artists, activists, and fellow non-profit warriors\u2014her chosen family, bonded by a shared love for a city that is constantly trying to shrug them off.\n\nHer dream isn't a personal one of wealth or fame, but one of permanence for her organization. She works tirelessly to secure a major legacy grant, one that would buy a small building and create a permanent, protected cultural space in the neighborhood. Sarah Jenkins doesn't want to own a piece of San Francisco; she just wants to ensure a small, colorful part of its soul can never be sold."
