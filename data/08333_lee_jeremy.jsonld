Born in Fremont to Taiwanese immigrants, his childhood was steeped in the pragmatic expectations of the Silicon Valley suburbs. His father, a hardware engineer, and his mother, a lab technician, envisioned a future for him in medicine\u2014a stable, prestigious career. Jeremy played along, enrolling as a biology major at UC Davis, but he found no passion in the sterile logic of organic chemistry.\n\nHis turning point came during his sophomore year. In a moment of quiet rebellion, he switched his major to Communications. It was a choice that baffled his parents, but for Jeremy, it felt like his first truly authentic decision. He discovered a talent for untangling complex ideas and presenting them clearly, a skill that proved invaluable when he landed an entry-level job at a burgeoning San Francisco startup after graduation. He wasn't a coder, but he could translate the engineers' work for the marketing team and executives. He was a natural bridge-builder. This aptitude guided him into project management, where he has steadily climbed the ladder for the last decade.\n\nThe 2022 tech layoffs were a second, more sobering turning point. Watching talented colleagues lose their jobs overnight stripped away any lingering startup romanticism. It solidified his preference for stable, well-managed projects over chaotic growth-at-all-costs environments.\n\nNow, at 36, Jeremy\u2019s life is centered in his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His commute is a zero-mile journey from his bedroom to his home office, a change he embraces. His days are structured by Scrum meetings and project timelines, but punctuated by personal rituals: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, a lunchtime run through Golden Gate Park, and evenings spent experimenting with recipes from his mother\u2019s cookbook. Recently single after a long-term relationship ended over differing life goals, he finds a solitary comfort in the city's foggy embrace. His connection to San Francisco is less about the frenetic downtown core and more about the quiet rhythm of his neighborhood.\n\nJeremy\u2019s dreams are no longer about external validation. He aspires to mentor junior project managers, fostering a healthier work-life balance than the one he experienced. He hopes to one day take a sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage of personal discovery far removed from Gantt charts and stakeholder updates."
