They arrived in Fremont from Gujarat, India, in the late 1980s, trading familiarity for the promise of the Bay Area. His childhood was spent in the aisles of their small grocery store, where he learned the language of inventory, overhead, and the quiet dignity of hard work. While his parents preached the safety of medicine or engineering, Rohan was captivated by the tangible growth he saw around him\u2014the apricot orchards of his youth being replaced by sprawling tech campuses and housing developments.\n\nHe pursued an Economics degree at UC Davis, a pragmatic choice that felt like a bridge between his parents' world and his own ambitions. The 2008 financial crisis struck just as he graduated, a pivotal moment that seared the importance of risk assessment into his psyche. Watching established firms crumble, he pivoted from abstract economic theory to the concrete world of real estate investment, viewing it as a more resilient, tangible asset class. He started as a junior analyst at a downtown SF firm, meticulously working his way up over the next decade.\n\nToday, Rohan lives with his long-term partner, Maya, a landscape architect, in a thoughtfully decorated apartment in Hayes Valley. His day begins before sunrise with a strong cup of filter coffee and a review of Asian market futures. His 2.6-mile commute on the Muni Metro is his sanctuary\u2014a time for finance podcasts and mental preparation. At work, he is known for his calm demeanor and an almost surgical ability to dissect a deal, identifying value where others see only risk\u2014a skill honed by watching his parents stretch every dollar.\n\nDespite his success, Rohan feels a quiet disconnect from the sheer scale of capital he manages. His dream isn't just to climb higher in his firm, but to launch his own small fund focused on developing mixed-use, \"missing middle\" housing in overlooked Bay Area neighborhoods, echoing the community-centric spirit of his parents' store. San Francisco is more than his workplace; it\u2019s the landscape of his ambition. He sees the city not as a spreadsheet of property values, but as a complex, living entity he hopes to one day help build more equitably."

The air was thick with the sweet scent of crushed fruit and diesel. It wasn't just sadness he felt, but a profound curiosity about how the familiar could be so completely erased and replaced. That day, land ceased to be a playground and became a blueprint for the future. It was his first, unspoken lesson in development, planting a seed about who gets to decide what gets built.\n\n2.\nIn his early teens, he would sit at the small desk in the back of the grocery store, his father's finger tracing lines in a worn ledger. Rohan saw how a few cents saved on imported basmati rice, multiplied over a month, funded their life. His father never spoke of risk, but showed him how to master it with diligence. It wasn't just accounting; it was a lesson in making something from almost nothing, a surgical precision he would later apply to multimillion-dollar properties.\n\n3.\nIt was late 2008, his new UC Davis diploma feeling worthless. He stood on California Street, staring at a \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign plastered across the lobby of a financial firm he\u2019d once idolized. The abstract market had evaporated, leaving behind this stark, physical failure. In that moment of city-wide anxiety, he felt a powerful pull toward the tangible assets around him\u2014the concrete and steel. He decided then to invest his life in things he could physically touch, things that provided shelter.\n\n4.\nHe was walking through the Mission with Maya a few years ago, rattling off cap rates for a new luxury condo building. She stopped him, pointing not at the glass tower, but at a small, shared courtyard where a family was grilling. \"That's the real return on investment, Ro,\" she\u2019d said. The comment rewired his perspective. His spreadsheets showed financial data, but she revealed the human data\u2014the life that happened in the spaces between buildings. His dream of a different kind of fund began there.\n\n5.\nHe was the youngest person in the boardroom, his first multi-million dollar proposal on the table. The partners saw only risk in the neglected Dogpatch warehouse. Rohan, however, saw the echo of his parents\u2019 store: good bones, a loyal community, overlooked potential. He calmly laid out the long-term value, his voice steady. When the deal later proved immensely profitable, the quiet nod from his boss was more validating than any bonus. It confirmed his instinct: to find value where others only see blight."
