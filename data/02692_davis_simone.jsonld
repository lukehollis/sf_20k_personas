The daughter of a Black jazz musician and a white academic, she grew up across the bay in Oakland, caught between her father\u2019s improvisational creativity and her mother\u2019s structured world. This mixed heritage left her feeling slightly outside of any single category, a feeling that shaped her independent spirit. Traditional high school felt suffocating; she wasn\u2019t a poor student, but she was profoundly bored by its rigid structure and yearned for a hands-on outlet.\n\nHer turning point came at 19 when, instead of applying to colleges, she enrolled in a cosmetology program. It was a revelation. Here, creativity had a practical, tangible result. Her innate understanding of shape, color, and texture, combined with a natural ability to connect with people, made her a standout. After graduating, she moved to San Francisco, securing an apprenticeship at a chic downtown salon. For years, she honed her craft, building a fiercely loyal clientele who came as much for her impeccable cuts as for her empathetic ear.\n\nThe next major shift occurred when the owner of a small, struggling salon in Hayes Valley decided to retire. Simone, then 30, pooled all her savings and took a massive leap, buying the business and rebranding it as \u201cCerise Salon.\u201d The risk paid off. She transformed the space into a neighborhood sanctuary\u2014a bright, minimalist hub of style and conversation.\n\nNow at 36, Simone\u2019s life operates within a five-block radius. She lives in the apartment directly above her salon, her commute a simple walk down a single flight of stairs. Her days are a blur of managing stylists, consulting with clients, and taking her own appointments. She knows the barista at her corner coffee shop by name and swaps gossip with the owner of the boutique next door. Her social life is an extension of her work; her clients have become her friends, her staff a chosen family. She\u2019s content in her self-made world, but dreams of creating an apprenticeship program for young people like her\u2014creatives who don\u2019t fit the traditional academic mold, helping them find their own path to a vibrant, independent life in the city she loves."
