Adopted as an infant by Sean and Mary Fitzgerald, a loving Irish-American couple, his name became a curious and wonderful summary of his life: a Korean face with a name straight from County Cork. He was raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, where the scent of the sea mingled with dim sum from Clement Street. His childhood was spent stocking shelves and dusting curiosities in his father\u2019s small lifestyle goods shop, a neighborhood institution simply called \"Fitzgerald's.\"\n\nOut of a sense of filial duty, Liam enrolled at San Francisco State to study business. He was a decent student, but his heart wasn\u2019t in textbooks; it was in the meticulously arranged displays and customer conversations back at the store. The turning point came during his sophomore year when his father, Sean, was diagnosed with a fast-moving cancer. Without a second thought, Liam dropped out of college to help his mother care for his father and run the shop full-time. The theoretical world of business school was replaced by the harsh reality of balancing ledgers, ordering stock, and keeping his family\u2019s legacy afloat.\n\nAfter his father passed away two years later, Liam officially took over. Now, at 33, his commute is a short flight of stairs from his modest apartment down to the shop floor. He renamed it \"The Richmond Curio,\" a nod to both its legacy and his modern touch. His days are a quiet rhythm of opening the store, chatting with multi-generational regulars, and curating new items. His social life is small but deep, consisting of weekly dinners with his mother and drinks with a few old high school friends at a local pub.\n\nLiam is deeply rooted in his corner of San Francisco, a true neighborhood local who feels like a stranger in the gleaming towers downtown. While he cherishes the life his parents gave him, a quiet dream flickers within him: to connect with the heritage he knows only from photographs. His future aspiration isn\u2019t to escape, but to evolve. He hopes to one day travel to South Korea and begin sourcing goods from local artisans, weaving the story of his birth culture into the fabric of the shop his father built."

It taught him that his identity wasn't a contradiction to be solved, but a story to be owned.\n\n2.\nHe was fourteen, clumsily arranging a new shipment of brass compasses. His father stopped him, gently turning one in his worn palm. \"Every object has a story, son. Our job is to help people find the one they're meant to take home.\" Sean then showed him how to create a narrative on the shelf. That afternoon, Liam understood the shop wasn\u2019t about selling things; it was about curating pieces of a life. It was a purpose that college textbooks could never instill.\n\n3.\nThe call came while he was studying for a macroeconomics midterm. His mother\u2019s voice was thin, the word \"cancer\" an impossible bomb that shattered the library's quiet hum. He closed his textbook, walked out of the SF State campus, and never went back. There was no agonizing decision; it was a simple, gut-level knowledge. His real education wasn't in that lecture hall, but in the shop on Clement Street, beside the man who gave him everything. This pivot wasn\u2019t a sacrifice, but a profound clarification.\n\n4.\nThe first morning he turned the key in the lock after the funeral, the silence was a physical weight. The brass bell on the door chimed, and instinct made him look toward the counter for his father. The emptiness was vast. Standing there, surrounded by a life's work, he felt a crushing sense of loss and a fierce surge of duty. He took down the old sign that day. \"The Richmond Curio\" wasn't an erasure of \"Fitzgerald's,\" but a promise that the story would continue, now in his hands.\n\n5.\nLast winter, an elderly Korean woman, a new regular, admired a celadon vase. \"It reminds me of home,\" she said softly, then spoke a few words in Korean, assuming he'd understand. He could only offer a polite, blank look. The moment, small and fleeting, left a quiet ache that lingered for days. It was then the vague dream of visiting Busan solidified into a concrete need. He had to find pieces of that home\u2014not just for the shelves of his shop, but for himself."
