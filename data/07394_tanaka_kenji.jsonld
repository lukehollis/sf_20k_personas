A third-generation Japanese American, he grew up in a quiet Sacramento suburb, the son of a pragmatic accountant and a meticulous elementary school teacher. They instilled in him a powerful work ethic and a respect for precision. His path seemed set for a stable, predictable career until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake shook his 17-year-old world. Witnessing the fragility of infrastructure ignited in him a passion for building things that were not just strong, but sustainable.\n\nThis newfound purpose led him to UC Davis for Civil Engineering and then to Stanford for a Master's in Environmental Engineering, where he fell in love with a city that felt alive with both natural beauty and revolutionary ideas. Realizing he could have a greater impact leading teams than designing turbines, he later earned an MBA from Berkeley. This pivot launched his career as a project manager in the burgeoning renewable energy sector.\n\nFor over a decade, Kenji\u2019s life was a whirlwind of blueprints, stakeholder meetings, and deadlines, a journey he shared with his long-term partner, Chloe. However, the same intense focus that propelled his career contributed to their amicable separation; their paths simply diverged. Now, at 47, his life is more contained but no less meaningful.\n\nHis home in the Inner Sunset is also his office. The 0.0-mile commute means his days begin not with traffic, but with a ritualistic run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park. The rest of the day is a remote flurry of Zoom calls and Gantt charts, managing solar and wind projects across the state. Evenings are for quietude: experimenting with Japanese recipes passed down from his grandmother, reading dense non-fiction, or meeting his small running club for a beer at a local brewery.\n\nKenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal. He sees his work as a direct contribution to protecting the Bay Area\u2019s future. His dream is to oversee the completion of a landmark offshore wind farm, a legacy of clean energy visible from the coast. While his professional life is meticulously planned, his personal future remains an open, unwritten page, one he is content to explore one foggy morning run at a time."
