Her younger brother\u2019s diagnosis with a rare autoimmune disease when she was twelve plunged her family into a world of clinical jargon, mounting bills, and quiet desperation. Sarah became a premature adult, learning to navigate the emotional minefield of chronic illness and acting as a buffer for her overwhelmed parents. This experience planted a seed: a deep-seated need to help others navigate the very systems that had once bewildered her own family.\n\nAfter completing her undergraduate degree in psychology, she was drawn to the progressive social landscape of the West Coast, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program. Her first decade of professional life was a trial by fire. As an LCSW at a major San Francisco hospital, she worked with patients and families facing sudden, life-altering diagnoses. The work was vital but draining, a relentless cycle of trauma, grief, and bureaucratic red tape that led to profound burnout.\n\nThe turning point was unexpected: the global pandemic. Forced into telehealth, Sarah discovered a new, more sustainable way to practice. The 0.0-mile commute from her bedroom to her home office in the Inner Sunset was a revelation. Working from the quiet of her own apartment, she found she could connect more deeply with clients, free from the hospital's chaotic energy. She never went back.\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by a hard-won balance. Her mornings often begin with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park with her partner, Alex, a software engineer who provides a grounding, logical counterpoint to her emotionally charged work. Her days consist of back-to-back video sessions, her voice a calm anchor for clients across the city. She is a regular at the small cafes and bakeries on Irving Street, her neighborhood providing a tangible sense of community that counteracts the digital nature of her job. Her aspiration is no longer to climb a career ladder, but to deepen her impact, perhaps by developing a support program for families of the chronically ill\u2014a way of finally closing a loop that began in her Ohio childhood."
