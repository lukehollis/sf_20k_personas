The only child of first-generation Korean immigrants, she was raised in the Inner Richmond amidst the scent of starch and ambition emanating from her parents\u2019 dry-cleaning business. They preached the gospel of stable professions\u2014medicine and law\u2014as the ultimate validation of their sacrifice. Sarah, however, was drawn to systems and ideas, not symptoms and statutes.\n\nIn a quiet act of rebellion, she pursued a Master\u2019s in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, dreaming of architecting change within government. The slow grind of bureaucracy, however, quickly soured her idealism. It was the dot-com boom of the late 90s that offered a new path. A fledgling tech consultancy, impressed by her sharp, analytical mind, hired her to help startups navigate market entry. Here, her pragmatism flourished. She discovered a talent for cutting through noise to find a company's core value, a skill that saw her rise with meteoric speed. Today, she is a Partner at a top-tier global firm.\n\nHer key turning point was a burnout-induced sabbatical at 38. Traveling alone through Southeast Asia, she realized the life she\u2019d built was a fortress, successful but solitary. Upon returning, she didn't abandon her career but reshaped it. She bought her minimalist Pacific Heights flat, deliberately creating a zero-mile commute to reclaim her time. Her days are now a disciplined rhythm: a pre-dawn run through the Presidio, followed by a relentless schedule of video calls shaping the strategies of tech behemoths from her sun-drenched home office.\n\nThough her calendar is packed, her social circle is intentionally small, comprised of a few trusted friends from her Berkeley days. She remains single by choice, finding fulfillment in her independence and deep, albeit infrequent, connections. Her aspiration is no longer about climbing higher, but about building sideways. She dreams of leveraging her capital and strategic acumen to fund and mentor female-founded companies, a way to finally merge the policy-driven idealism of her youth with the powerful pragmatism of her present."
