He was raised in the Outer Sunset, the child of a pragmatic electrical engineer who emigrated from Taiwan and an Irish-American librarian from Sacramento. His father filled their home with schematics and the quiet expectation of academic excellence, while his mother filled it with stories and a love for the city\u2019s fog-laced literary history. This duality\u2014the precise world of data and the nuanced world of narrative\u2014would come to define David\u2019s life.\n\nHe pursued a biology degree at UC Berkeley, but the dot-com boom of the late 90s revealed a new path. Fascinated by the intersection of life science and information technology, he pivoted, earning a graduate degree in the nascent field of Computational Biology from Stanford. His career began at the lab bench, writing algorithms to model protein folding. Over two decades, his intellect and quiet leadership propelled him upwards. Today, as a Director of R&D at a Mission Bay biotech firm, he manages teams of brilliant scientists, a role he finds both rewarding and subtly melancholic; he sometimes misses the pure, focused joy of solving a single, complex problem.\n\nA key turning point was his father's passing ten years ago, an event that prompted David to embrace a leadership role with a sense of duty and legacy. Around the same time, he met his partner, Marcus, a landscape architect, while volunteering at the SF Botanical Garden. They built a comfortable life together in a classic Cole Valley Edwardian.\n\nHis daily routine is grounded. He forgoes a car for the N Judah MUNI line, a 6.5-mile journey he uses to read non-fiction or simply watch the city wake up. Evenings are for cooking with Marcus, walking their rescue terrier in Golden Gate Park, and conversations that drift from scientific ethics to urban planning. At 51, David has achieved the success his father dreamed of, but now his aspirations are his own. He hopes to transition into a mentorship role, guiding the next generation of scientists, and dreams of taking a sabbatical to travel along the Silk Road, finally connecting with a part of his heritage he knows only through books and his father\u2019s quiet recollections."

On his right, his mother\u2019s library copy of a Saroyan story, smelling of old paper and fog. He\u2019d trace a circuit with one finger, then the curve of a letter with the other. It wasn\u2019t a division, but a quiet understanding that his world had two languages. The memory is a blueprint for his own mind, the foundation of how he learned to see both the data and the story within it.\n\n2.\nIt was a Berkeley computer lab in 1998, smelling of stale coffee. He should have been memorizing cell mitosis, but he was transfixed by the screen next to him. A computer science major was rendering a clunky, rotating protein. In that moment, the abstract chaos of biology suddenly clicked into the elegant logic of code. It was a profound revelation, a single flash of insight that rerouted his entire future from the wet lab to the algorithm. For the first time, his two worlds spoke the same language.\n\n3.\nMonths after his father\u2019s funeral, the grief was a low, constant hum. He was mindlessly pulling weeds at the Botanical Garden when Marcus, a fellow volunteer, quietly said that soil holds memory. David looked up from the damp earth, the scent of eucalyptus sharp in the air. The phrase landed with the weight of scientific truth and poetic grace. It didn't erase the sorrow, but it planted something new beside it. It was the moment his life began to grow again, reaching towards an unexpected light.\n\n4.\nHe stood in his glass-walled office in Mission Bay, watching his team celebrate a data breakthrough. There was a surge of pride, a deep satisfaction in his role as their director. But beneath it was a quiet ache, a phantom-limb sensation for the keyboard, for the singular focus of wrestling with an algorithm himself. He was the architect of the project, no longer the builder. That evening marked his understanding that leadership was a rewarding, yet profoundly lonely, craft\u2014a translation of his own passion rather than its direct expression.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, on the N Judah. The train burst from the Sunset Tunnel into the late afternoon light of Cole Valley. He lowered his book on quantum mechanics and just watched. The city slid past\u2014the languages, the faces, the colliding worlds in each block. He suddenly pictured the route not as a MUNI line, but as a caravan path stretching east. The vague dream of the Silk Road solidified into a clear, insistent desire. It was a yearning to follow a different kind of schematic, one that led back to his father\u2019s world."
