Her parents, a librarian and a high school history teacher, provided a stable, book-filled home, but she always felt a gentle dissonance\u2014a Korean face in a predominantly white world. This feeling wasn't one of pain, but of curiosity, a puzzle that would come to define her professional calling.\n\nHer path led her to San Francisco State University for a degree in Social Work, a choice directly inspired by her desire to understand the systems that shaped her own life. During an internship, she saw the limitations of traditional talk therapy with traumatized children who lacked the words for their experiences. It was a revelation. She discovered art therapy, a medium that transcended language, and pursued a specialized certification. Now, she works at a community health clinic in the Mission District, helping kids process their worlds through the messy, joyful chaos of finger paints and clay.\n\nA key turning point came in her late twenties. After years of contemplation, she decided *not* to search for her birth family. She realized her identity wasn't a mystery to be solved, but a reality to be lived. She was Maya Hayes, a Californian, a San Franciscan, a woman shaped by the love she was given. This acceptance brought a profound sense of peace and purpose.\n\nMaya lives in the Inner Richmond, treasuring its fog-laced mornings and proximity to Golden Gate Park, her backyard for weekend strolls and quiet reflection. Her 2.5-mile bike commute to the Mission is a daily ritual, a transition from the calm of her neighborhood to the vibrant, demanding energy of her work. Her life is grounded by a close-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014with whom she shares potlucks and hikes. Her dream is to one day open her own non-profit, a dedicated art therapy studio for underserved youth, creating a sanctuary of healing and creativity in the city that finally gave her a true sense of belonging."

Her father\u2019s kind eyes, her mother\u2019s wide smile, and her own round face, the only one with dark, almond-shaped eyes. There was no sadness, only a quiet hum of difference. She felt a surge of love for these two people who chose her, and a simultaneous awareness of a story that began before them. It wasn\u2019t a gap to be filled, but an extra layer to who she was, a curiosity that shaped her empathetic worldview.\n\n2.\nAt 21, she was an intern sitting with a seven-year-old boy who wouldn't speak about the fire. Frustrated with her questions, she slid a tub of red and yellow finger paint toward him. He plunged his hands in, smearing the colors across the paper in a chaotic, desperate swirl. He didn\u2019t say a word, but his entire body unclenched. In that mess of color, Maya saw a language beyond words. In that moment of shared, silent understanding, she knew she had found her life\u2019s work.\n\n3.\nIt happened on her 28th birthday, sitting alone beneath a cypress tree in Golden Gate Park. The letter to the adoption agency was half-written in her lap. For years, the question of her birth family was a low, constant hum. But watching a family fly a kite, she felt a profound stillness. Her identity wasn't in a file in Seoul; it was here, in the love she\u2019d been given and the life she had built. She tore up the letter, feeling not loss, but the quiet, liberating peace of acceptance.\n\n4.\nOn a Tuesday morning in her early thirties, she was biking down the Wiggle. The frantic energy of the Mission pulled her forward as the serene fog of the Inner Richmond receded behind her. She saw the faces of the city: the tech worker on a scooter, the mom pushing a stroller, the muralist touching up a wall. She wasn't an observer. A wave of belonging washed over her so powerfully she almost laughed. This city, in all its chaotic beauty, was finally and completely her home.\n\n5.\nLast fall, crammed into her friend\u2019s kitchen for a potluck, the conversation turned to her work. She described a girl who had finally crafted a clay figure of herself smiling. Her friend, a grant writer, simply said, \"You should have your own space for this, Maya. We can help.\" Surrounded by her chosen family, the dream of her own studio morphed from a distant wish into a tangible plan. It wasn't just her dream anymore; it was a promise she suddenly felt empowered enough to keep."
