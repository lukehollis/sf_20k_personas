Raised in a quiet suburb of Portland, Oregon, by a high school history teacher father and a librarian mother, her childhood was filled with books, museum visits, and a deep appreciation for the humanities. This led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History, a choice her practical parents supported with a gentle, unspoken concern for her future job prospects.\n\nUpon graduating, their concern proved valid. Entry-level museum work was scarce and low-paying. Sophia found a foothold not in a gallery, but in its back office, managing a project to digitize a local museum\u2019s vast photography collection. It was here she discovered her true talent: bringing order to chaos. She excelled at creating timelines, managing budgets, and translating the needs of art curators to the software developers building the digital archive. This unexpected intersection of art and logic became her turning point.\n\nA recruiter, impressed by her unique skill set, headhunted her for a junior role at a technology consulting firm. She moved to San Francisco eight years ago, initially feeling like an imposter among a sea of computer science graduates. However, her ability to manage complex projects and communicate with diverse stakeholders saw her rise quickly. Now, at 35, she is a sought-after Project Manager, leading teams on multi-million dollar software implementations.\n\nSophia\u2019s life is centered in her Hayes Valley apartment, a meticulously decorated space that doubles as her office, given her 0.0-mile commute. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls and digital dashboards, broken up by walks to local cafes for coffee and a necessary change of scenery. She has cultivated a close-knit group of friends outside of tech, connecting with people through a local pottery class and a book club.\n\nWhile financially successful, Sophia feels a persistent pull back to her original passion. Her ultimate dream is not to climb the corporate ladder, but to eventually leverage her tech expertise for the art world\u2014perhaps leading a major digital initiative for a world-class museum or developing technology that makes art more accessible to all. For now, she finds her balance in the vibrant, chaotic, and ever-innovating city she calls home."
