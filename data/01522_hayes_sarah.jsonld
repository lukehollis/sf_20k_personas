Born to a Filipina mother who worked two nursing jobs and an Irish-American father who drove for Muni, she grew up in the dense, family-oriented landscape of the Excelsior District. Her childhood was a mosaic of Filipino family parties, the rumble of the M Ocean View, and the quiet tension of a household perpetually one paycheck away from crisis. School was a challenge; while bright, the instability at home made focusing on academics feel like a luxury she couldn't afford.\n\nShe graduated from high school without a clear path and bypassed college, instead taking barista and retail jobs to help her family. The turning point came at 21 when a close family friend, struggling with addiction and housing insecurity, was lost to the city\u2019s streets. The helplessness Sarah felt ignited a fierce, protective instinct. She began volunteering at a drop-in center for youth in the Tenderloin, her lived experience and natural empathy proving more valuable than any degree. Her dedication was quickly recognized, and she was hired as a support staffer, eventually working her way up to a case manager role through on-the-job training and certification programs.\n\nNow 26, Sarah\u2019s life is uniquely intertwined with her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this: she lives on-site in a small, subsidized apartment within the supportive housing facility where she works. Her days are a blur of crisis management, client advocacy, and navigating a broken system. The line between her personal and professional life is almost nonexistent; the struggles of her clients are the sounds she hears through her apartment walls at night.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, consisting of a few friends who also work in nonprofits and understand the emotional toll. She sees her mother on Sundays, a ritual that recharges her. Sarah dreams of a quiet life\u2014an apartment in the Sunset with a small garden, where the sound of the ocean, not sirens, lulls her to sleep. She holds onto the hope of one day pursuing a social work degree online. For now, she remains tethered to the city\u2019s difficult heart, her existence a constant battle against the same forces she fights for others, fueled by a stubborn love for the San Francisco that exists beyond the postcards."
