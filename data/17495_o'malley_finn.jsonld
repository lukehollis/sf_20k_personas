The son of a career bus driver and a public-school teacher, Finn grew up understanding the urban ecosystem from the ground up. He saw firsthand how a reliable transit line could be a lifeline for a family and how poor planning could isolate entire communities. This intimate knowledge of the city\u2019s circulatory system fueled his academic path, leading him from a state university in Massachusetts to a prestigious graduate program in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe move to the Bay Area was a definitive break from his East Coast roots. Finn was mesmerized by San Francisco's complex topography and vibrant, distinct neighborhoods. After graduating, he eagerly accepted a junior planner position with a city transportation agency. For over a decade, he has dedicated himself to the intricate puzzle of moving people through San Francisco. Now a Senior Transit Planner, he\u2019s known for being stubbornly data-driven yet possessing an empathetic understanding of the rider experience\u2014a throwback to his father's influence.\n\nA key turning point in his life was the end of a long-term relationship two years ago. His partner craved a suburban life with a yard and a two-car garage, a vision that felt like a betrayal of everything Finn valued. The breakup solidified his commitment to an urban-centric life. His social circle reflects this, composed of fellow civil servants, architects, and community activists who debate rent control over craft beer in the Mission.\n\nFinn lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 3.5-mile commute on the 5-Fulton bus is a daily ritual and a real-time case study of his own work. He finds solace in morning runs through Golden Gate Park and weekend explorations of the city\u2019s hidden stairways. His dream isn\u2019t a corner office but to be instrumental in launching a truly transformative transit project, one that radically improves equity and access. He hopes to one day find a partner who understands the romance of a shared Muni ride and believes, as he does, that the best future is one built on community and connection, not fences and freeways."

The engine was off, but the whole bus still hummed, smelling of diesel, wet wool, and day-old newspapers. His dad, smelling of coffee and patience, ruffled his hair. In that quiet moment, Finn felt the city\u2019s massive, complicated heart beating under him. It wasn't a machine; it was a living thing his father helped keep alive. This memory became the blueprint for his empathy.\n\n2.\nDuring his first semester at Berkeley, he took the N-Judah from the underground downtown station out toward the ocean for the first time. The train rattled through the dark tunnel and then suddenly burst into the bright, sun-drenched chaos of Cole Valley. The pastel houses stacked on the impossible hills looked like a dream. That sudden transition from subterranean dark to brilliant light felt like a revelation, cementing his decision to leave the East Coast. This wasn't just a new city; it was a new world to decipher.\n\n3.\nIt was the silence of the two-car garage in a Mill Valley open house that ended things. His partner was tracing patterns on a granite countertop, talking about gardening. Finn just stood in the echoing garage, a space designed for isolation, and felt a profound, suffocating wrongness. He saw a future of fences and freeways, a betrayal of the community he believed in. The breakup two years ago wasn't just a heartbreak; it was a necessary declaration of who he was and what he valued most.\n\n4.\nFive years ago, he\u2019d fought for a minor route adjustment on the 38-Geary, moving a stop fifty feet to better accommodate a senior center. A month later, an email arrived from an elderly woman. \"I can get my own groceries again,\" it read. \"You made my world bigger.\" Finn printed it and pinned it above his desk. The email was a powerful reminder that data points are human lives. It validated his entire professional philosophy\u2014marrying hard data with the quiet dignity of the daily rider, just as his father had.\n\n5.\nLast spring, on a solo morning run, he reached the Dutch Windmill in Golden Gate Park just as the fog began to burn off. The salty air mixed with the scent of cypress. He looked out toward Ocean Beach, feeling the deep, peaceful solitude of being exactly where he belonged. A wave of hope washed over him\u2014not for a promotion, but for someone to stand here with one day, someone who would understand that this quiet, shared view was more romantic than any suburban backyard."
