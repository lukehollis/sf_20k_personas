Her 0.0-mile commute is a recent, post-pandemic development, but the quiet introspection it affords feels like a natural evolution for a woman who has spent her life absorbing the trauma of others.\n\nRaised in a quiet Ohio suburb, Sarah was the reliable older sister to a younger brother whose struggles with severe anxiety defined much of their family life. Watching her parents navigate a fractured mental health system inspired a fierce, protective instinct in her. She pursued her undergraduate degree locally but felt a pull toward a place with more progressive ideas. Her migration west was sealed by an acceptance into UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program in the early 1990s.\n\nSarah\u2019s career began in the crucible of San Francisco General Hospital during the height of the AIDS crisis. The experience was harrowing and formative, forging her into a deeply empathetic and resilient clinician. She learned to sit with profound grief and provide comfort in the face of systemic failure and social stigma. It was here she cemented her identity not just as a social worker, but as a San Franciscan, committed to the city\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nHer personal life has been one of quiet independence. A decade-long partnership in her thirties ended amicably, teaching her that her own company was a peaceful sanctuary. Her social circle is small but deep, composed of old colleagues and a few neighbors who share her love for walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nNow, at 54, her days are structured by telehealth appointments with patients facing chronic illness or end-of-life decisions. She listens to stories of pain and hope through a screen, her calm demeanor a digital anchor. Her future aspirations are not professional but personal. She dreams of taking a long, slow train trip across Canada and finally mastering the potter\u2019s wheel, creating something tangible and beautiful with her hands. For Sarah, fulfillment is no longer about climbing a career ladder, but about finding balance and peace in the city she has long called home."
