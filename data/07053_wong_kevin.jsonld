            "value": "Kevin Wong is a native son of San Francisco, born and raised in the fog-shrouded avenues of the Sunset District. The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, his upbringing was steeped in practicality. His father worked long hours as a line cook in a Chinatown restaurant, and his mother was a seamstress in a small garment factory. Their dinner table conversations were about overtime and rent, not lofty ambitions. Kevin was a quiet, observant child, more interested in deconstructing old radios than in schoolwork. He wasn't a poor student, just an indifferent one, finding the abstract world of academia less compelling than the tangible logic of circuits and wires.\n\nAfter high school, the path to a four-year university felt both unaffordable and unappealing. On the advice of a cousin, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It was there he found his calling. The work was methodical and precise. A key turning point came during an internship at a small data center, where he realized the burgeoning digital world was built on a very physical foundation of racks, cables, and cooling systems. He was good at it, and for the first time, felt a sense of professional purpose.\n\nNow 39, Kevin has spent nearly two decades as a Data Center Technician. He lives a life of quiet routine in a small, meticulously neat SOMA apartment, just a two-minute walk from the windowless, humming fortress where he works. His zero-mile commute means his life is geographically small but tied to a global network. His social circle is tight, consisting of a few colleagues he shares beers with after a late shift and his aging parents, whom he visits for dim sum every Sunday. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his demanding on-call schedule and preference for a solitary life.\n\nKevin is a ghost in the machine of the new San Francisco. He doesn't frequent the trendy bars or use the buzzy apps whose infrastructure he maintains. He is the city\u2019s physical memory, ensuring its digital heart keeps beating. His dream isn't a startup exit, but something quieter: saving enough to buy a small condo back in the Sunset, with a garage he can convert into a personal electronics workshop. He hopes for a future of comfortable stability, and perhaps, a companion who understands that the most profound connections aren't always the loudest."
