Raised in the manicured affluence of Marin County, she was the sensitive, observant child in a household that valued stoic achievement over affection. Her father\u2019s success in finance provided every material comfort but left little room for emotional messiness. The turning point came at seventeen when a close friend died of a heroin overdose, a hidden struggle that shattered the community's placid surface. That tragedy crystallized her life\u2019s purpose: to understand and sit with the pain that others pretended did not exist.\n\nRejecting a business path, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. Her early career was a trial by fire in San Francisco\u2019s most demanding environments\u2014first in the relentless churn of a hospital ER, then at a community clinic in the Mission District. For over a decade, she absorbed the city\u2019s rawest stories of trauma, addiction, and systemic failure. Burnout was a constant, creeping shadow.\n\nThe pandemic, a global trauma, paradoxically offered her a path to sustainability. As the world moved online, Sarah left her agency job and established a private teletherapy practice. Her commute is now a ten-second walk from her kitchen to the sunroom of her Inner Sunset apartment, now a tranquil home office overlooking a neighbor's foggy garden.\n\nHer days are structured and serene. Mornings begin with a misty run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her mind before she logs on to hold space for her clients. At 47, her social life is small but deep\u2014a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow \"helpers\" like teachers and nurses, with whom she shares dinners and effortless understanding. She is divorced, a decade-old scar that has faded into a lesson on self-reliance.\n\nSarah loves the San Francisco that exists beyond the headlines\u2014the resilience of its people, the solace of the park, the quiet hum of her neighborhood. Her dreams are no longer grand, but deep: to write a book on vicarious trauma for fellow healers and, perhaps, cultivate a partnership as peaceful and enduring as her foggy mornings."
