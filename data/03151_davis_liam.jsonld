            "value": "Liam Davis is a product of his parents\u2019 deferred dreams. The only son of first-generation Taiwanese immigrants, he was raised in the fog-dusted avenues of the Sunset District. His parents ran a small laundromat, their hands raw from work and their conversations often circling back to the necessity of his success. His name, chosen from a book of American baby names, was their first gift and first expectation: a name that would fit seamlessly on a resume, that wouldn't require a second glance.\n\nHe never disappointed them. Liam was a model student, his ambition a quiet, intense fire. An undergraduate degree in Economics from UC Berkeley was the logical precursor to a Master's in Financial Engineering from Stanford. He was recruited before he even graduated, stepping onto the fast track at a prestigious investment firm in the Financial District. His career was a blur of complex spreadsheets, market analyses, and twelve-hour days. He excelled, climbing to Senior Financial Analyst through sheer intellectual horsepower and an unwavering work ethic.\n\nThe turning point was unexpectedly silent. Last year, after closing a multi-billion-dollar tech IPO, a massive bonus landed in his account. Staring at the number on his screen, he felt a profound emptiness. This was the pinnacle, the success his parents had sacrificed for, yet it felt hollow.\n\nNow, Liam\u2019s life is contained within the 25 floors of his SoMa high-rise. With a 0.0-mile commute, his day begins by walking from his bedroom to his living room desk, the city\u2019s skyline his only coworker. His routine is brutally efficient: coffee, market open, conference calls, data modeling, and takeout for dinner. Social connections are fleeting\u2014industry happy hours with colleagues or occasional, unfulfilling dates. His truest connection remains the weekly call with his parents, where he assures them he\u2019s thriving, carefully omitting his gnawing sense of disillusionment.\n\nLately, a new dream has begun to form. In the evenings, after the markets close, he\u2019s been watching videos on traditional Japanese joinery. He imagines the feel of wood, the precision of a chisel, the creation of something tangible and beautiful. His secret aspiration is to one day trade his sterile apartment for a small workshop in the Dogpatch, analyzing grain patterns instead of stock patterns, building a life with his hands rather than with numbers."

            "value": "1.\nHe was eight, sitting on a folding table at the laundromat, breathing in the scent of bleach and steam. He watched his mother\u2019s hands, red and raw from the work, expertly folding a warm sheet. She smiled at him, but he saw the deep weariness in her eyes. In that moment, the weight of her sacrifice settled onto his small shoulders. He silently promised that he would earn enough so her hands could one day be soft. That promise became the engine of his ambition, fueling him through every exam.\n\n2.\nAt his eighth-grade graduation, the principal butchered his friend Wei-Chen\u2019s name. A few kids snickered. Then, \u201cLiam Davis\u201d was called, crisp and effortless. From the audience, he saw his father give an almost imperceptible nod of satisfaction. Liam felt a flash of relief, immediately followed by a quiet, piercing shame. He understood then that his name wasn\u2019t just a name; it was armor his parents had given him, camouflage for a world they found difficult to navigate. His life started to feel like a strategy.\n\n3.\nThe Berkeley acceptance letter for Economics felt less like a victory and more like a confirmation. He didn't celebrate; he simply placed it on the kitchen table for his parents to see when they came home. Their tired faces broke into wide, proud smiles. Seeing their profound relief, Liam felt a deep sense of purpose\u2014not for himself, but for them. Any fleeting daydreams of studying art or history dissolved completely. This was the correct move on the board, the next step in fulfilling the family\u2019s silent contract.\n\n4.\nThe IPO bonus landed in his account. He stared at the number, a figure that represented the absolute pinnacle of the goal. It was more money than his parents had made in a decade of running the laundromat. But instead of triumph, a profound, glacial silence filled his chest. It felt like winning a game he\u2019d just realized he never wanted to play. The number was just an abstraction, code that couldn't fill the hollow space inside him. That singular moment was the beginning of the unraveling.\n\n5.\nIt was 2 AM, the only light coming from his phone. He stumbled upon a video: an old man\u2019s hands guiding a Japanese chisel, shaving a perfect curl from a block of cedar. There was no music, only the whisper of steel on wood. Liam watched, mesmerized, as a complex joint took shape without a single nail. A quiet click sounded deep inside him, a feeling of resonance he hadn't felt in years. It wasn't a new plan, but the first flicker of warmth in a cold, sterile room."
