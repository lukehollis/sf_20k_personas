Born in Daly City to Punjabi immigrants, he was named Robert by parents who hoped an American name would smooth his path. His father, a taxi driver, and his mother, a seamstress, pushed him toward a traditional path of academic success.\n\nRobert enrolled at San Francisco State University, aiming for an engineering degree, but his true talent was always fixing things\u2014bicycles, appliances, his father's perpetually troubled Ford Falcon. His educational journey was cut short when his father suffered a major stroke. Robert dropped out of college to support his mother, taking a job as a handyman\u2019s apprentice. He never looked back. The tangible satisfaction of repairing a faulty boiler or rewiring a light fixture felt more real and immediately rewarding than any textbook diagram.\n\nHe worked his way up through grit and a preternatural understanding of how systems work. The turning point came a decade ago when he was offered the live-in Facilities Maintenance Manager position. The 0.0-mile commute was the ultimate perk; his life became the building. He knows its mechanical heartbeat, the groans of the elevator, and the quirks of every radiator.\n\nRobert\u2019s daily routine is a quiet rhythm. He wakes before the fog burns off, walks through Golden Gate Park, and then begins his rounds. His social life is woven into his work\u2014sharing a chai with Mrs. Chen in 3B, debating the Giants' chances with the mail carrier, and enjoying a respectful, professional distance with the building's many residents. He is a quiet pillar, the constant in their transient city lives.\n\nWhile content, Robert dreams of a different kind of quiet. He saves diligently, not for a lavish retirement, but for a small cabin in Mendocino County. His ultimate aspiration is to own a place with no tenants, no work orders, and no late-night calls about a leak\u2014a place where the only thing he has to fix is a second cup of coffee."
