Raised in a small, bustling village, her world was one of vibrant markets and the constant rhythm of the sea. Her formal education ended with the equivalent of high school, as family needs took precedence. Life was simple until a whirlwind romance with a visiting Russian painter, Alexei Novikov, changed everything. Enchanted by his art and gentle spirit, she married him and followed him to his dream city: San Francisco.\n\nTheir early years in the city were a bohemian dream, filled with love and creative energy in a tiny Richmond District apartment. But their dream was shattered by Alexei\u2019s sudden death from an aggressive cancer just five years after they arrived. Widowed at 32 in a foreign country, Priya was left with little money and no clear path. Drawing on the strength she discovered while caring for Alexei in his final months, she pursued a certification as a Nursing Assistant. It was a practical choice, but one that resonated with her innate compassion.\n\nFor the past eight years, Priya has been a live-in CNA for an elderly, house-bound woman in a grand Pacific Heights home. This explains her zero-mile commute; her life and work are contained within the same ornate walls. Her days are a structured routine of administering medication, preparing meals, assisting with mobility, and providing quiet companionship. Her social circle is small, limited to the client\u2019s family and a weekly video call with her sister in Goa.\n\nPriya\u2019s San Francisco is not the bustling tech hub, but the quiet rhythm of the mansion and the breathtaking view of the Golden Gate Bridge from her small room's window. She holds the city at a distance, a place of both cherished memories and profound loss. Her hope is a quiet one: to save enough money to one day get her own small apartment in the Sunset, a place where she can tend to a small balcony garden and finally feel a sense of independence again. Priya Novikov lives a life of quiet dignity, a caregiver sustained by memories of one life and the dream of another, all within a city she knows more by view than by foot."
