The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small grocery on Clement Street, David grew up as a studious observer, more comfortable with books than boisterous play. He spent his youth navigating the dual worlds of his parents\u2019 traditional values and the freewheeling spirit of 1970s San Francisco.\n\nHis path wasn't always clear. He excelled at Lowell High School and later attended UC Berkeley, initially unsure of his direction. The turning point came during the height of the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s. Witnessing the city\u2019s grief, fear, and incredible resilience firsthand ignited a profound sense of purpose. He saw how policy\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014could have life-or-death consequences. This experience steered him toward a Master\u2019s degree in Public Health, focusing on policy and urban health disparities.\n\nUpon graduating, he secured a position with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, where he has remained ever since. His career has been steady rather than meteoric, marked by a deep-seated competence and an unwavering ethical compass. He met his late wife, Elena, a vibrant muralist, at a neighborhood meeting in the Mission. She was his opposite\u2014passionate, outspoken, and colorful\u2014and she drew him out of his shell. Her death from cancer a decade ago was a devastating blow that reshaped his life, leading him to embrace a more solitary existence.\n\nNow, at 54, David\u2019s life is a well-worn path. His 0.0-mile commute is to the spare room in his Inner Richmond flat, overlooking a small, meticulously tended garden. His days are structured: data analysis in the morning, a long walk through Golden Gate Park in the afternoon, and evenings spent reading or listening to jazz. He has a small circle of old friends and is a beloved regular at a local cafe. His aspiration isn\u2019t a promotion but a legacy: to author a single piece of policy that significantly reduces healthcare barriers for the city\u2019s most vulnerable. He finds deep contentment in this focused mission, a quiet man serving the loud, dynamic city that has always been his home."
