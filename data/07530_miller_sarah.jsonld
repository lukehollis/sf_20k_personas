Growing up, she was the fierce advocate for her younger brother, whose struggles with a speech impediment were often met with impatience by the school system. It was in those parent-teacher conferences, translating not just his words but his frustrations, that Sarah found her purpose. This path led her to UC Santa Cruz for an undergraduate degree in psychology and then to San Francisco State University for a Master of Social Work, cementing her commitment to the city.\n\nShe began her career with the San Francisco Unified School District, thriving in the chaotic, vibrant energy of a middle school in the Mission District. She was a physical presence\u2014a calm port in the storm of adolescent hormones, family crises, and systemic neglect. Then, the world shifted. The pandemic pushed her job into the digital realm, and even as schools reopened, budget restructurings and new remote-work protocols kept her there. Her commute became zero miles.\n\nNow, from her small, second-floor apartment in the Inner Richmond, Sarah manages a caseload of students scattered across the city. Her day is a sequence of video calls, her screen a mosaic of troubled faces, anxious parents, and overworked administrators. She grapples with digital empathy fatigue, fighting for resources and mediating crises through a connection that often feels fragile.\n\nTo counteract the isolation, she has built a life within a few square blocks. Mornings start with a foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by a strong coffee from a favorite cafe on Clement Street. Evenings are for a book club with other social workers or volunteering at a community garden, anything to feel grounded and connected to something tangible. Her closest friends are a lifeline, understanding the unique weight she carries.\n\nSarah loves San Francisco, but she misses feeling its pulse through her work. Her deepest aspiration is to get back into a school building, to trade the sterile quiet of her apartment for the ringing of a school bell and the messy, unscripted reality of the children she is so determined to serve."
