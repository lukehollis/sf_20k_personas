The only child of Korean immigrants, he grew up in Daly City, where the fog felt heavier and the American Dream seemed a little more conditional. His parents poured their life savings and endless hours into a small dry-cleaning business, their tired hands a constant, silent reminder of the sacrifices being made for him. Their mantra was simple: security. For them, it was a clean shop; for Andrew, it had to be a college degree and a stable, high-paying job.\n\nHe absorbed this lesson completely. At UC Berkeley, Andrew chose Economics not out of passion, but out of pragmatism. He was methodical and brilliant, graduating with honors and securing a coveted analyst position at a top-tier management consulting firm in San Francisco before the ink on his diploma was dry. The career was a perfect fit for his ambition\u2014a clear ladder of promotions, intellectual challenges, and a salary that finally quieted the anxieties of his upbringing.\n\nHis move to a sleek apartment in Hayes Valley was a definitive turning point. The 1.1-mile walk to his Financial District office became a daily ritual of success, a triumphant stroll past the world his parents could only commute through. His life is now a meticulously curated schedule: 6 AM gym sessions, 70-hour work weeks optimizing supply chains for Fortune 500 companies, and strategic weekend socializing with other young professionals.\n\nYet, at 27, a hairline crack has appeared in the polished facade. A recent project, a grueling six-month affair, left him feeling hollowed out. The six-figure income and prestige felt less like a victory and more like a gilded cage. He finds himself walking slower on his commutes, noticing the art in Patricia\u2019s Green or the individual character of the local cafes he\u2019s usually too busy to enter. Andrew\u2019s dream is shifting. He\u2019s beginning to wonder if his analytical skills could solve more meaningful problems than corporate inefficiency. For now, he\u2019s still on the path, but for the first time, he\u2019s starting to look for a different destination."

He complained about a papercut, and she just smiled tiredly, holding up her own hands for him to see. The calluses were like worn leather, the knuckles red and swollen. \"These are good hands, Andrew,\" she\u2019d said in Korean. \"They're building your future.\" The weight of those hands settled on his heart, a debt he felt he could only repay with success.\n\n2.\nAt Berkeley, signing his major declaration form, his mouse hovered over \"English\" for a full minute. He imagined discussing literature, writing stories. Then, a vivid image of his father\u2019s exhausted face at the end of a 14-hour day flashed in his mind. He decisively clicked \"Economics.\" It wasn\u2019t a moment of joy, but one of grim resolution. He was locking in the final gear of the machine his parents had built. Duty felt heavier, and more important, than passion.\n\n3.\nThe day he got the keys to his Hayes Valley apartment, he stood in the empty living room, looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows. The rent was astronomical, a figure that would have terrified his parents. This wasn\u2019t their world of foggy Daly City; this was the clean, sharp epicentre of the dream. He felt a surge of triumphant relief, a feeling of having finally *arrived*. This sleek, quiet space was the tangible proof that their sacrifices had not been in vain.\n\n4.\nAfter the final presentation for the six-month logistics project, his VP slapped him on the back, beaming about the multi-million dollar savings. In the celebratory boardroom buzz, Andrew felt nothing. He saw the numbers on the slide\u2014impersonal figures representing optimized shipping routes for a product he\u2019d never see. He had poured his life into making a massive corporation slightly more efficient. The applause felt hollow, the prestige like a costume. A profound, aching emptiness bloomed in his chest.\n\n5.\nWalking home last Tuesday, he found himself stopped in Patricia's Green, watching a musician tune a cello. He\u2019d walked this path a thousand times, always rushing, phone in hand. But this time, he just listened. He noticed the way the fading light caught the strings, the focused calm on the musician's face. The moment was small, useless by any metric he lived by, yet it felt more real than his entire work week. For the first time, he wondered about the value of things that couldn't be quantified."
