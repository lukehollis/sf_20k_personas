Raised in Ohio by a carpenter father and a teacher mother, he inherited a respect for both tangible craftsmanship and intellectual pursuit. He left the Midwest for college, earning a Master's in English Literature with vague notions of a quiet, academic life. However, a brief, soul-crushing stint in corporate marketing in his late twenties served as a crucial turning point. He realized his passion wasn\u2019t for selling products, but for shaping futures.\n\nHe pivoted, earning his teaching credential and finding his calling in a high school English classroom. He moved to San Francisco in his early thirties, drawn by the city\u2019s vibrant energy and a position at the prestigious private school. David was a natural educator, and his dedication saw him rise from teacher to department head, and finally, to Principal a decade ago.\n\nHis personal life has been quieter. A marriage in his thirties ended amicably, the demanding nature of their respective careers pulling them in different directions. Without children of his own, the student body became his surrogate family. His 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his existence; he lives in the historic Headmaster\u2019s Cottage on the school\u2019s manicured grounds in the Presidio Heights neighborhood.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm of early morning walks across the quad, assemblies, staff meetings, and late nights reviewing budgets. He knows the name of every student. His social life consists of occasional dinners with his vice-principal and a near-religious Sunday morning coffee at a small caf\u00e9 in Laurel Village. David\u2019s dream is no longer personal adventure, but institutional legacy. He hopes to establish an endowment that guarantees scholarships for low-income students, ensuring the school he\u2019s devoted his life to reflects the diversity of the city he can see, fog-shrouded and beautiful, from his office window."
