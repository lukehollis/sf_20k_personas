Born and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown, she was the quiet, dutiful daughter of parents who ran a small laundromat. From a young age, her life was a rhythm of school, helping fold other people's clothes, and stolen moments sketching in notebooks. She dreamed of a life filled with color and design, a world away from the scent of starch and steam.\n\nHer educational journey led her to City College of San Francisco, where she pursued an Associate\u2019s degree in Graphic Design. She was talented, her portfolio filled with bold typography and vibrant illustrations of city life. But in her final semester, her mother suffered a severe stroke. Mei, without a second thought, dropped out to become her primary caregiver. She quickly learned about medications, mobility assistance, and the quiet patience required to care for a loved one. The experience changed her.\n\nAfter her mother passed away, the path back to graphic design felt distant and foreign. The path to caregiving, however, was now deeply ingrained. She completed a Certified Nursing Assistant program, swapping her design portfolio for a CNA certificate. Her career began in a bustling nursing home, but the frantic pace left her feeling disconnected.\n\nThe turning point was finding her current role: a live-in CNA for Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but frail 89-year-old widow. This explains her zero-mile commute; her life and work share the same address. Her days are structured around Eleanor's needs: medicine schedules, preparing meals, and slow walks in Golden Gate Park. Her social life is small\u2014weekly calls with her brother in Sacramento and coffee with an old friend every other Sunday, her only regular time off.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. It\u2019s not the bustling nightlife, but the sound of the N Judah streetcar in the distance, the specific bench in the park that gets the afternoon sun, and the faces of the cashiers at the local market. Her dream hasn't died, but it has transformed. In the quiet hours after Eleanor is asleep, Mei still sketches. Her subjects are no longer imagined cityscapes, but Eleanor\u2019s sleeping face, the pattern of light on the carpet, the view of the fog-draped Sutro Tower. Her aspiration is a quiet one: to one day have enough time and space to fill a sketchbook, not with what could be, but with the profound, quiet beauty of the life she lives now."

While her parents worked, she had a stolen piece of butcher paper and a single charcoal pencil, sketching a fantastical bridge soaring over Chinatown\u2019s rooftops. It was her first secret, a silent rebellion drawn in shades of grey. That act of creation was a promise to herself: her world would one day be as colorful as the one she imagined on paper.\n\n2.\nThe memory of her final typography critique is seared into her mind. She was presenting a bold, colorful poster when her phone buzzed with the call about her mother's stroke. Suddenly, the vibrant designs on the wall felt frivolous, the instructor's voice a distant hum. In that instant, her future fractured. The path to a creative life vanished, replaced by a singular, urgent focus on her mother. It wasn\u2019t a choice, but an immediate reordering of her world, where love and duty eclipsed all else.\n\n3.\nMonths into caring for her mother, there was a quiet afternoon. Her mother, unable to speak, sat in a chair while Mei gently brushed her long, silver-streaked hair. Their eyes met in the hand mirror, and in that shared gaze, an entire conversation unfolded\u2014one of apology, gratitude, and unconditional love. It was a moment of profound, wordless connection. This taught Mei that the deepest form of care wasn't in the medicine or the tasks, but in the quiet moments of shared dignity and presence.\n\n4.\nOn her first day, Eleanor Vance watched her with sharp, assessing eyes as Mei prepared her afternoon tea. After a long silence, Eleanor simply said, \"You're quiet. Good.\" Then, she gestured toward the bay window. \"That seat gets the best afternoon light, in case you draw.\" Mei was stunned. It was the first time someone had seen both the caregiver she had become and the artist she had been. In that small apartment, veiled in fog, she felt a flicker of hope that her two selves could coexist.\n\n5.\nLate one night, with the sound of the N Judah a faint rumble in the distance, Mei sat down with her sketchbook. She\u2019d intended to draw something from memory, something grand. Instead, her eyes fell on the way the streetlight cast a soft glow on Eleanor\u2019s sleeping face. With a new sense of purpose, she began to sketch the delicate lines around her mouth, the texture of the worn quilt. It was an epiphany: her art was no longer about escaping her life, but about finding the extraordinary beauty within it."
