Born and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown, she was the quiet, dutiful daughter of parents who ran a small laundromat. From a young age, her life was a rhythm of school, helping fold other people's clothes, and stolen moments sketching in notebooks. She dreamed of a life filled with color and design, a world away from the scent of starch and steam.\n\nHer educational journey led her to City College of San Francisco, where she pursued an Associate\u2019s degree in Graphic Design. She was talented, her portfolio filled with bold typography and vibrant illustrations of city life. But in her final semester, her mother suffered a severe stroke. Mei, without a second thought, dropped out to become her primary caregiver. She quickly learned about medications, mobility assistance, and the quiet patience required to care for a loved one. The experience changed her.\n\nAfter her mother passed away, the path back to graphic design felt distant and foreign. The path to caregiving, however, was now deeply ingrained. She completed a Certified Nursing Assistant program, swapping her design portfolio for a CNA certificate. Her career began in a bustling nursing home, but the frantic pace left her feeling disconnected.\n\nThe turning point was finding her current role: a live-in CNA for Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but frail 89-year-old widow. This explains her zero-mile commute; her life and work share the same address. Her days are structured around Eleanor's needs: medicine schedules, preparing meals, and slow walks in Golden Gate Park. Her social life is small\u2014weekly calls with her brother in Sacramento and coffee with an old friend every other Sunday, her only regular time off.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. It\u2019s not the bustling nightlife, but the sound of the N Judah streetcar in the distance, the specific bench in the park that gets the afternoon sun, and the faces of the cashiers at the local market. Her dream hasn't died, but it has transformed. In the quiet hours after Eleanor is asleep, Mei still sketches. Her subjects are no longer imagined cityscapes, but Eleanor\u2019s sleeping face, the pattern of light on the carpet, the view of the fog-draped Sutro Tower. Her aspiration is a quiet one: to one day have enough time and space to fill a sketchbook, not with what could be, but with the profound, quiet beauty of the life she lives now."
