Her name itself tells the story: her mother, a driven first-generation immigrant from Shanghai who instilled a fierce work ethic, and her father, a third-generation Irish-American contractor from Daly City who taught her the value of a well-told story and pragmatic solutions. Growing up in Fremont, she was bilingual, navigating the expectations of academic excellence at home and the casual, suburban rhythms of her American school life. This constant code-switching made her a keen observer of human behavior and systems.\n\nHer fascination with how people and technology intersected led her to Stanford, where she earned a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction. After a grueling but formative five years at a major tech giant, Mei grew disillusioned with corporate bureaucracy. She craved autonomy and tangible impact, pivoting to consultancy. As a Principal Consultant, she now operates from her meticulously organized apartment in NoPa. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are a disciplined cycle of deep-focus work, advising startups and established firms on how to make their products more intuitive and humane.\n\nA key turning point came three years ago when a project she led, while financially successful, resulted in a product she felt was ethically ambiguous. The experience solidified her resolve to work only on projects that aligned with her values. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a handful of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and an artist friend who keeps her grounded in a world beyond algorithms. She maintains a close relationship with her parents, her weekly calls a vital link to her dual heritage.\n\nNow, on the cusp of 40, Mei yearns for a different kind of legacy. Her professional success feels secure but incomplete. Her dream is to leverage her expertise for social good, perhaps by building a pro-bono consulting arm for non-profits or mentoring young women of color entering the tech field. She loves San Francisco for its ambitious energy and natural beauty\u2014her evenings are often spent on long, pensive runs through Golden Gate Park\u2014but she aspires to shape its future into something more equitable and thoughtful, one human-centered system at a time."
