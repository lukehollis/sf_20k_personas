Raised in the quiet, manicured suburbs of the East Bay, he was the sensitive observer in a family that preferred not to discuss difficult things. His mother\u2019s long, unnamed battle with depression cast a silent shadow over their home, and from a young age, David learned to read the subtle shifts in her mood, becoming the unofficial emotional caretaker. This early, intuitive training laid the groundwork for his entire career.\n\nHe pursued psychology at UC Santa Cruz, drawn to the redwood-studded campus's contemplative atmosphere. The true turning point, however, came during his Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley when his mother passed away after a long illness. The experience of navigating his own profound grief, while simultaneously studying the mechanics of it, cemented his calling. He would help others walk through the fire he knew so well. After graduation, he spent a decade working in the demanding environment of a large San Francisco hospital, but the bureaucracy and emotional toll led to burnout.\n\nSeeking a more sustainable and personal way to practice, David moved to the Inner Sunset and established his own private therapy practice from home. His commute is a zero-mile journey from his kitchen to a quiet, soundproofed office in his condo overlooking a sliver of Golden Gate Park. His days are now a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions with clients grappling with grief, anxiety, and life transitions. He starts each morning with a foggy run through the park, a ritual that clears his head before he takes on the emotional weight of others.\n\nAt 47, David is thoughtful and deliberate, his social life consisting of a small circle of close friends, many of whom are also in healing professions. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, leaving him quietly single and more introspective. His connection to San Francisco is deep but gentle; he loves the anonymity the city affords and the immediate access to nature's solace. His dream is to write a book for the caregivers\u2014the silent listeners like his younger self\u2014and perhaps start a pro-bono support group. For David, success is not measured in income, but in the quiet moments of understanding he both gives and, increasingly, allows himself to receive."
