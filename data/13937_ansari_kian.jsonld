Born in Berkeley to Iranian parents who fled Tehran after the 1979 revolution, he was raised on stories of a lost homeland and the immense value of stable, democratic institutions. His father, an electrical engineer, and his mother, a university librarian, instilled in him a profound respect for education and a pragmatic, problem-solving mindset. Growing up in the East Bay, Kian witnessed the first dot-com boom not with dreams of stock options, but with a curiosity for how technology could reshape society for the better.\n\nHe pursued a Political Science degree at UC Davis before enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy. It was there his path crystallized. A key turning point was an internship with the City of Oakland, where he saw how outdated, user-hostile websites created barriers for low-income families seeking housing aid. He realized his unique calling was to be a translator: to speak the language of both bureaucratic policy and user-centered technology.\n\nNow, as a Civic Technology Strategist for the City and County of San Francisco, Kian works to untangle the digital knots of public administration. His days are spent collaborating with city departments to make services like permit applications and public assistance more accessible and efficient. Living in the Duboce Triangle with his partner, a landscape architect, Kian\u2019s life is intrinsically woven into the city\u2019s fabric. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute to his office near City Hall is a daily survey of the urban landscape he is trying to improve\u2014past vibrant murals, struggling storefronts, and new parklets.\n\nKian\u2019s social circle consists of fellow public servants, non-profit leaders, and artists, often gathering for potlucks where discussions revolve around urban policy and local art. His dream is not personal wealth, but systemic impact. He aspires to build a municipal government that is truly responsive to its citizens, proving that public institutions can be as innovative and humane as the communities they serve. For Kian, San Francisco\u2019s glaring problems are not a deterrent but a call to action, the central challenge of his life's work."

She pointed to a picture of a bustling public square. \u201cThis is where I met your aunt for tea,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice soft. Kian felt the ghost of that place, a phantom limb of a city he\u2019d never known. It wasn't just a story of loss, but of vibrant public life stolen away. It planted the seed of his fierce, protective devotion to civic spaces and the institutions that sustain them.\n(Childhood, early 1990s)\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring his grad school internship in Oakland, he watched an elderly woman try to navigate the city\u2019s housing aid website on a library computer. After ten minutes of confused clicking and error pages, she sighed, shoulders slumping in defeat. Kian felt a quiet rage burn in his chest. It wasn't her fault; it was a failure of design, a digital wall built by indifference. In that moment of shared frustration, his abstract policy ideals became a concrete mission: he would be the one to tear down those walls.\n(Graduate School, mid-2000s)\n\n***\n\n3.\nMonths after launching a simplified online portal for small business permits, an email landed in his inbox. It was from a woman who had just opened a tiny flower shop in the Richmond. She attached a photo of her storefront, bright with bouquets. \u201cI was dreading the paperwork,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut this was\u2026 easy?\u201d That single word, \u201ceasy,\u201d felt like the most significant victory of his career. It was proof that his work wasn't just code and policy, but a tangible thing that helped someone\u2019s dream bloom.\n(Early career with SF, late 2010s)\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe remembers a bike ride home last spring. He passed a new, beautifully designed parklet on Valencia, where people laughed over coffee. Ten feet away, a man shivered in a makeshift shelter. The gorgeous, jarring dissonance of it all stopped him. Beauty and despair, community and isolation, all on one block. The sight wasn't a reason to give up; it was a renewal of his vows. This was the complex, heartbreaking, essential puzzle he was here to help solve, one piece at a time.\n(Last Spring)\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe stood with his partner, the landscape architect, on a hill overlooking the city at dusk. His partner pointed out the living networks of parks and greenways below, while Kian traced the invisible digital pathways he was building from his office near City Hall. He felt a profound sense of shared purpose. They were both city-builders, one with soil and stone, the other with code and servers. It affirmed his belief that his work, too, was about creating a more humane and beautiful landscape for people to live in.\n(Last few months)"
