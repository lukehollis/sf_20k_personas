The son of a Korean software engineer and a Punjabi restaurateur who met at UC Berkeley in the 90s, Jasdeep grew up in Fremont navigating two distinct and vibrant worlds. His childhood was a loving fusion of cultures: kimchi jjigae shared at the same table as saag paneer, weekend trips to the Gurdwara alternating with respect paid to his Korean grandparents. This balancing act fostered a deep-seated empathy in him, a knack for seeing the world from multiple perspectives.\n\nWhile his parents hoped he\u2019d enter tech or medicine, Jasdeep was drawn to the kids at school who, like him, felt they existed in an in-between space\u2014new immigrants, children of divorce, or those struggling to meet family expectations. He saw them, and he wanted to help. This led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work, a choice that initially concerned his practical-minded father but earned his mother\u2019s quiet approval.\n\nA key turning point was his final year internship at a community center in the Mission. He was assigned a case involving a teenager recently arrived from El Salvador, alienated and overwhelmed. By patiently helping the youth navigate school enrollment and find a soccer league, Jasdeep saw the tangible impact of being a steady, reliable anchor in someone\u2019s chaotic life. It solidified his career path.\n\nNow 26, Jasdeep is a Case Manager for a youth services non-profit. His days are a whirlwind of school visits, family mediations, and navigating city bureaucracy to secure resources for his clients. He lives in a small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond, its shelves filled with social theory books, graphic novels, and a few thriving houseplants. His 2.8-mile bicycle commute to his office near Hayes Valley is his daily ritual for decompression, pedaling through the Panhandle and past the Painted Ladies, the city\u2019s rhythm a familiar backdrop to his thoughts.\n\nHis dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014both for himself, to avoid the burnout so common in his field, and for the systems he works within. He hopes to eventually get his Master's and move into a policy-making role, building better, more intuitive support structures for the city\u2019s next generation of kids who need someone to see them for who they are."

His Korean *halmoni* had ladled him a steaming bowl of kimchi jjigae, while his mother placed a fresh chapati beside it. His father, laughing, showed him how to tear the bread and dip it into the spicy Korean stew. In that moment, the two worlds on his plate didn't feel separate; they were just *his* dinner. It wasn't a balancing act, it was simply home\u2014a feeling of complete belonging he\u2019d spend his life trying to replicate for others.\n\n2.\nHe was fifteen, at a sprawling Punjabi wedding reception. He spotted a younger cousin, recently moved from out of state, looking completely lost amidst the swirl of brightly colored lenghas and loud Bhangra music. Jasdeep left his friends, sat with him, and started talking about video games. The relief that washed over the boy\u2019s face was a quiet revelation. Jasdeep realized that simply showing up and making someone feel seen could be a powerful anchor, a lesson that became the cornerstone of his future work.\n\n3.\nHe was 21, standing on the sidelines of a foggy soccer field at a Mission playground. Weeks of navigating school bureaucracy for a withdrawn teen from El Salvador all melted away in one moment. The boy, now in a team jersey, scored a goal and broke into a triumphant, unguarded smile for the first time since they had met. Jasdeep felt a profound, almost dizzying sense of purpose lock into place. This was it. This was the work he was meant to do.\n\n4.\nJust last year, after a brutal week of failed housing applications, he felt burnout\u2019s cold edge. He was packing up when he found a folded paper a 12-year-old client had slipped him. It was a crayon drawing of two stick figures on bikes labeled \u2018JD\u2019 and \u2018me,\u2019 riding past the Painted Ladies. The simple, heartfelt thank you cut through the bureaucratic noise. It reminded him that his impact existed in these small, human connections, not just in the endless paperwork he fought against daily.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, his mind was a tangle of case notes after a difficult family mediation. He pushed off on his bike, the cool evening fog of the Panhandle hitting his face. Pedaling became a meditation. The beat of his tires on the pavement, the familiar pastel glow of the Painted Ladies against the charcoal sky\u2014the city's rhythm slowly untangled his own. By the time he reached his Inner Richmond apartment, the weight had shifted. He wasn't just commuting; he was resetting, ensuring he\u2019d be ready for tomorrow."
