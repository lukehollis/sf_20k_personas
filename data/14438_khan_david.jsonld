He was the son of a Berkeley history professor who specialized in Central Asian empires and a pragmatic Irish-American librarian. Raised in a book-filled North Berkeley home, David grew up with a deep-seated curiosity about what made people tick. This led him to a Bachelor's in Psychology from UC Santa Cruz, where he was more fascinated by cognitive biases and group dynamics than clinical practice.\n\nGraduating in the late \u201890s, David stumbled into the nascent world of web design. It was a chaotic, exciting time. He found his calling not in coding, but in observing how confused users navigated clunky websites. This was his turning point; he realized he could apply his psychology degree to the burgeoning digital landscape. He became an early evangelist for what would later be formalized as User Experience (UX) research, weathering the dot-com bust by building a reputation for delivering sober, user-centric truths to overly ambitious founders.\n\nNow a Principal UX Research Consultant, David operates with quiet authority. He chose consulting for the variety and autonomy it affords. His 7.5-mile commute from his Inner Sunset home to client offices in SoMa is a daily ritual in his reliable Subaru. It\u2019s a buffer zone filled with history podcasts, a nod to his father's influence.\n\nHe met his wife, Sarah, a landscape architect, two decades ago. They ground each other\u2014he shaping the intangible digital world, she shaping the tangible, living one. They have two teenage children and chose their neighborhood for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its settled, family-oriented feel.\n\nDavid is a quintessential long-term San Franciscan: he appreciates the city\u2019s innovative spirit but is wary of its tech-fueled excesses. His aspirations are not for a disruptive startup, but for a life of meaningful connection. He dreams of traveling the Silk Road with Sarah once the kids are in college and perhaps writing a book that distills his observations on human behavior in the digital age\u2014a legacy of thoughtful inquiry, much like his parents built before him."

A middle-aged woman, recruited for a usability test, kept clicking the company\u2019s logo, trying to get back to the homepage. The young founder was visibly frustrated, but for David, it was an epiphany. In her confused clicks, he didn't see user error; he saw a predictable cognitive pattern. This single moment defined his entire career, transforming his psychology degree from an academic pursuit into a vital, practical tool for navigating the burgeoning digital world.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001, and the air in the startup\u2019s conference room was thick with desperation. David presented his findings: nobody understood their \"revolutionary\" interface. The 25-year-old CEO argued that users just \"weren't smart enough.\" David calmly held his ground, showing video clips of profound user confusion. The silence that followed was heavy with the weight of a failing dream. That day forged his professional steel, teaching him that his value wasn't in validating ambition, but in reflecting reality, however harsh it might be.\n\n3.\nHe met Sarah at a potluck in a Mission duplex. He was passionately explaining a website's flawed navigation when she interjected, comparing it to poorly planned garden paths that people naturally ignore. He was struck silent. Her hands, smudged with a bit of soil, described tangible space while he only had abstract concepts. In that moment, he felt the pull of a world outside the digital ether. She was an anchor, a landscape architect who understood his world through her own, and he knew his life was about to change.\n\n4.\nOne ordinary Sunday, fog rolled through the eucalyptus trees in Golden Gate Park. His daughter was teaching his son to throw a frisbee, their laughter muffled by the mist. Sarah was pointing out the structure of a nearby fern grove. Watching them, framed by the living world his wife so deeply understood, David felt a profound sense of rightness. This\u2014the damp air, the foggy light, the sound of his family\u2014was the tangible anchor that made his abstract work in the digital world feel meaningful.\n\n5.\nStuck in traffic on the way to SoMa, a podcast detailed the Mongol *Yam*, a network of relay stations. David suddenly saw it\u2014not as dusty history, but as a perfect analogue for a distributed user network. He felt a powerful intellectual thrill, a direct inheritance of his father\u2019s way of seeing the world. It was a clarifying moment: he wasn\u2019t just a tech consultant. He was continuing a family legacy of inquiry, observing human systems, whether they were built of horse-paths or hyperlinks."
