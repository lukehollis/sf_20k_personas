Raised in the orderly suburbs of Sacramento, she was the daughter of a pragmatic Lebanese-American civil engineer and a free-spirited mother who taught high school art. Her father envisioned a stable future for her, while her mother encouraged her to paint, draw, and see the world through a creative lens. Heeding her father\u2019s advice, Chloe dutifully enrolled at UC Davis and declared a major in Economics, a sensible choice that left her feeling uninspired.\n\nThe turning point came during a junior year study abroad program in Florence. Immersed in a city where art was not just confined to museums but woven into the very fabric of daily life, she had an epiphany. She didn\u2019t want to analyze markets; she wanted to help art find its audience. Upon graduating, she abandoned the corporate recruitment path and took the first job she could land in her desired field: a Junior Marketing Coordinator role for a small non-profit that championed Bay Area muralists.\n\nNow 24, Chloe\u2019s world is her small, sunlit apartment in the Inner Richmond, which she shares with two other young women. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday unfolds at a small desk wedged into a corner of her bedroom. Her routine is built around her neighborhood: a morning jog through Golden Gate Park, grabbing a coffee from a local cafe, and logging into Slack. Evenings are often spent cooking with her roommates or attending a low-key gallery opening for work.\n\nSocially, her world is small but meaningful, centered on her roommates and a handful of work colleagues. She finds the SF dating scene exhausting and prefers reading at a parklet to shouting over music in a bar. Chloe\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but specific; she loves the city's public art, its independent bookstores, and the fog rolling over the hills. Her dream is to one day become the Marketing Director for a major institution like SFMOMA, proving to her father\u2014and herself\u2014that her passionate pivot was the most practical decision she ever made."
