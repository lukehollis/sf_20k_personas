The only child of Russian immigrants from St. Petersburg, she grew up in the foggy, quiet avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Outer Richmond. Her parents, a stoic engineer and a meticulous librarian, instilled in her a deep sense of responsibility and a quiet diligence. Her defining childhood experience came at sixteen when her beloved *babushka* was diagnosed with a complex heart condition. Anastasia became the family\u2019s unwilling navigator of the American healthcare maze, translating dense medical terminology and witnessing firsthand how easily vulnerable patients could be overwhelmed and overlooked.\n\nThis formative trial forged her path. She pursued a degree in psychology at UC Davis before returning to the Bay Area for a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. Her focus was clear: medical social work, a desire to be the compassionate, competent guide she had needed for her grandmother.\n\nNow 29, Anastasia works as a clinical social worker for a major hospital network, but her commute is zero miles. From her small, tidy apartment in Hayes Valley, she conducts telehealth sessions with patients and their families, helping them cope with new diagnoses, navigate end-of-life care, and access resources. Her days are a cascade of other people\u2019s crises, viewed through the intimate distance of a laptop screen. To decompress, she walks. Her routines are rituals: a morning latte from a local caf\u00e9, a lunchtime walk through Patricia\u2019s Green, and a long, meandering evening route to watch the sunset paint the sky over Alamo Square\u2019s Painted Ladies.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, consisting mainly of a few fellow social workers who understand the unique emotional weight of their profession. She sees her parents every other Sunday for a dinner that is heavy on tradition and light on emotional disclosure. Anastasia\u2019s dream is to eventually open a small private practice focused on serving the city\u2019s elderly immigrant population, bridging the cultural and linguistic gaps she knows so well. For now, she finds solace in her quiet corner of the city, a professional anchor for others while seeking her own stable ground."
