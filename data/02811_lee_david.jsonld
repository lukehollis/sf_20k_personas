Born to Chinese immigrants who poured their life savings into a small general store on Clement Street, David grew up stacking shelves and making change, his childhood soundtrack the chime of the shop's door. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped for a different life for him\u2014one with a degree and a desk job, far from the grind of retail.\n\nHe obliged, attending San Francisco State University and earning a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design. For a few years, he chased the dream, freelancing for tech startups and small agencies. But the work was inconsistent, the clients demanding, and the promise of creative fulfillment felt hollow. He found himself burnt out, living paycheck-to-paycheck in a city that was rapidly out-pricing his artistic ambitions.\n\nThe turning point came a decade ago when his father had a health scare, forcing him into retirement. With his mother struggling to run the shop alone, David stepped in, telling himself it was temporary. That \"temporary\" role evolved into his life's work. At 37, he is now the full-time manager of \"Lee & Son Goods,\" living in the small two-bedroom apartment directly above it. His commute is a single flight of stairs.\n\nDavid's days are a familiar rhythm of unlocking the front door at dawn, managing inventory, chatting with the neighborhood regulars who have known him since he was a boy, and locking up long after the sun has set. His social life is woven into the fabric of his block; he\u2019s on a first-name basis with the owners of the bakery next door and the bartenders down the street. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his demanding schedule and unbreakable bond with the store.\n\nThough he has accepted his path, the ghost of the artist he wanted to be lingers. He still meticulously designs the store\u2019s signage and finds quiet satisfaction in arranging tasteful displays. His dream is no longer about creative acclaim but about honoring his parents' legacy while making the shop his own. He hopes to one day launch an online store\u2014a project where his dormant design skills could finally shine\u2014and ensure the little shop on Clement Street thrives for another generation."
