Raised in a modest, predictable suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, she was an observant child who preferred the structured worlds of novels to the chaos of her boisterous family. She pursued an English Literature degree, not with a clear career path, but out of a love for narrative and order.\n\nIn 1997, feeling a pull for a life less ordinary, Sarah packed two suitcases and moved to San Francisco, landing a receptionist job at a burgeoning dot-com startup. While engineers and marketers chased ephemeral glory, Sarah discovered her true calling in creating operational harmony. She was the one who remembered birthdays, ordered the right coffee, and untangled logistical knots. Her calm competence saw her promoted to Office Manager, a role she has held, in various forms, ever since. She survived the dot-com bust by being indispensable and practical, a human anchor in a sea of volatility.\n\nHer personal life has been similarly steady. A marriage in her early thirties to a software engineer ended amicably a decade later, leaving her with a beautiful condo in Noe Valley she\u2019d bought with him and an even stronger sense of self-reliance. The key turning point was the pandemic. The shift to remote work transformed her role; the 0.0-mile commute meant her domain was now virtual, managing culture and logistics through Slack and Zoom.\n\nToday, Sarah\u2019s life is a comfortable routine. Mornings begin with a walk for her rescue terrier, Gus, and a coffee from the corner cafe. Her days are a cascade of digital requests, but she ends them screen-free, often with a book or at a local pottery class. She has a small, tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom, like her, are city veterans who remember a different San Francisco. Her dream isn\u2019t to retire to somewhere quiet, but to eventually leverage her decades of experience into a consulting business, helping new companies build a sane and supportive remote culture. She remains the calm at the center of the storm, a permanent resident in a city defined by constant change."
