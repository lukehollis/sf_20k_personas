The only son of immigrants from Hong Kong, he was raised in the Richmond District amidst the scent of his father\u2019s small grocery store and the constant, gentle pressure to succeed. His parents, who sacrificed everything for his future, saw education as the definitive path upward. David internalized this, excelling within the city\u2019s public school system and earning a coveted spot at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis initial passion was for the pure elegance of science, the intricate dance of molecules. This led him to a Ph.D. program in Molecular Biology at UCSF. However, a pivotal event reshaped his career. During his final year of research, his father was diagnosed with a fast-moving cancer, and David felt the profound helplessness of watching cutting-edge science fail to translate into timely treatment. This experience was a turning point. He decided he didn\u2019t want to spend his life at a lab bench; he wanted to be at the nexus where discovery becomes medicine.\n\nAfter a brief post-doc, David transitioned from academia to the private biotech sector. The move was pragmatic, allowing him to apply his rigorous scientific mind to managing clinical trials. He thrived, his quiet determination and keen intellect making him a natural leader. Now, as a Director of Clinical Research, he oversees the complex human studies that are the final, critical step in bringing new drugs to market.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine. He leaves his well-tended home in West Portal each morning, taking the Muni Metro downtown to his Mission Bay office. The 9.5-mile commute is his time to read, not scientific journals, but history and fiction. Evenings are spent with his partner of fifteen years, an urban planner for the city. They share a love for SF\u2019s hidden stairways and quiet neighborhood restaurants. David\u2019s ambition is no longer for personal accolades but to see one of his projects through to FDA approval\u2014a tangible victory against the diseases that once felt insurmountable. He remains a son of San Francisco, a product of its institutions, now working to shape its future."

The air is thick with the scent of dried shiitake mushrooms and cardboard. His father's hands, calloused from work but gentle, guide his own as they stack cans of grass jelly. He doesn\u2019t understand the immense sacrifice yet, only the quiet dignity of the work. This memory is the foundation of his character\u2014a heavy, warm feeling of love fused with unspoken obligation. It was planted there, on Clement Street.\n\n***\n\n2. At Lowell High School, David first looks through a proper microscope. A single drop of pond water transforms into a universe of frantic, beautiful life. He sees paramecia tumbling in a silent, intricate ballet. In that moment of pure wonder, the abstract pressures of his future dissolved into an elegant, observable order. Science wasn\u2019t just a subject his parents valued; it was a secret language he had just begun to understand, a passion that felt uniquely his own.\n\n***\n\n3. The hospital room felt airless, sterile. David, then a UCSF doctoral candidate, held his father's hand, the skin thin as paper. He knew the molecular pathways of the cancer ravaging his father\u2019s body, yet that knowledge was an abstraction, utterly powerless against the beeping machines. The chasm between the science he studied and the suffering he witnessed felt infinite. That profound helplessness was a crucible, burning away his academic detachment and forging a new, desperate sense of purpose.\n\n***\n\n4. His first major meeting in biotech wasn't about molecules, but about people. A slide went up showing the patient demographics for a new oncology trial. He saw their ages, their hometowns, and he pictured his father\u2019s face. The cool, corporate conference room in Mission Bay suddenly felt more consequential than any lab. This was the nexus. This was where theory had to become translated hope. He felt a grim resolve settle in his chest; he was finally on the right side of the fight.\n\n***\n\n5. Last spring, after a grueling week, he and his partner climbed the hidden Pemberton Place stairs near their home. At the top, they paused, looking out as the lights of the city began to sparkle below. A quiet sense of peace settled over him. This view, this shared silence, this life they had built\u2014this was the 'why'. His work wasn't an abstract scientific pursuit anymore; it was a tangible fight for more quiet evenings, for more time, for everyone."
