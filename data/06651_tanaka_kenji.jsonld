At 40, his life is a testament to the idea that a calling can be found outside of a classroom. A third-generation Japanese American, Kenji grew up in the Sunset District, the son of a pragmatic accountant father and a mother who expressed her love through meticulously crafted home-cooked meals. His parents envisioned a stable future for him, pushing him towards a business degree at San Francisco State University.\n\nHowever, Kenji felt adrift in lecture halls. The theories of management felt hollow compared to the vibrant, chaotic reality of his part-time job as a server in a bustling Japantown restaurant. It was there, amidst the clatter of plates and the warm hum of conversation, that he found his element. The immediate gratification of a happy customer, the camaraderie of the staff\u2014it felt more honest and vital than any textbook. After two years, he made the difficult decision to drop out, a choice that created a quiet rift with his family but set him on his true path.\n\nHe worked his way up through the city\u2019s demanding hospitality scene, eventually landing at *Kiri*. The owner, an aging restaurateur, saw Kenji\u2019s innate talent for anticipating needs and creating a welcoming atmosphere. Now, as the manager, Kenji\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs from his minimalist apartment above the restaurant. His days begin with inventory and end long after the last customer has gone, finding peace in the quiet moments with a cup of tea, savored in theempty dining room. His staff is his family, and the neighborhood regulars are his community.\n\nWhile a past long-term relationship crumbled under the weight of his commitment to the restaurant, Kenji isn\u2019t lonely. He is fulfilled by his craft. His quiet dream isn't to open a massive chain, but to one day buy *Kiri* from its owner, to become not just its manager but its steward, ensuring the place that gave him his purpose continues to thrive for decades to come."
