Raised in Madison, Wisconsin, by a history professor father and a librarian mother, his childhood was filled with dinner-table debates and a deep-seated belief in the power of well-functioning public institutions. This environment naturally led him to a Political Science degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, followed by a Master of Public Policy from Georgetown University.\n\nHis early career began, as expected, in Washington D.C., working for a federal agency. For five years, he churned out reports and analyses, but grew disillusioned by the glacial pace and partisan gridlock. The policies felt abstract, disconnected from the people they were meant to serve. The turning point came during a visit to a friend in San Francisco. He was captivated by the city's vibrant energy but also struck by its visible, complex challenges. He saw an opportunity to apply his skills at a more tangible level.\n\nWithin a year, he accepted a position with San Francisco\u2019s city government. Now, at 41, he is a Senior Policy Analyst, having spent over a decade wrestling with the city's thorniest issues, from housing affordability to public transit reform. His 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic norm; his Cole Valley one-bedroom apartment serves as both his office and his sanctuary.\n\nHis days are disciplined. He starts with a walk to his favorite local caf\u00e9 for an Americano, which he sips while reviewing data. Afternoons are a blur of Zoom meetings and writing dense policy briefs. He decompressess by running in Golden Gate Park, the green expanse a necessary antidote to the bureaucratic tangle of his work. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of fellow civic-minded professionals and a long-standing monthly trivia night. A serious relationship ended two years ago, and while he\u2019s open to a new connection, his focus remains on his career.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is professional yet profound. He sees the city not as a tourist, but as a complex system of overlapping crises and opportunities. His greatest hope is to see a landmark housing policy he helped craft come to full fruition, providing tangible relief for residents. He dreams not of changing the world, but of making his small, complicated, adopted corner of it function just a little bit better."
