The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, she was raised in a home where academic excellence was the unquestioned path to a stable American life. Her father, a chemical engineer, filled their house with schematics and textbooks, and Sunita naturally gravitated toward the clean logic of math and physics. A Bachelor\u2019s in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis was a pragmatic choice, fulfilling both her aptitude and her parents' aspirations.\n\nHer early career was spent as a hands-on engineer, designing power distribution components in Silicon Valley. While competent, she felt a disconnect. A turning point came during a major project delay caused by poor communication between teams. Sunita realized she was more adept at organizing the people and processes than designing the circuits. This insight prompted a pivot into project management. Now, as a Senior Program Manager, she doesn't just work on the grid; she orchestrates its evolution, a role she finds infinitely more satisfying.\n\nSunita\u2019s personal life was re-calibrated in her mid-thirties after an amicable divorce from her college sweetheart. The split, while painful, taught her a fierce independence. She moved from the suburbs to a quiet, light-filled apartment in Noe Valley, a neighborhood she chose for its village-like feel and direct Muni access. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few former colleagues and a book club that discusses more life than literature.\n\nHer daily routine is grounded. She wakes before the sun, sips chai while reading international news, and then catches the J-Church line downtown. Her 5.8-mile commute is a treasured ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s complex machinery\u2014the very systems she works to improve. Her work at the utility company, focusing on electrifying transportation and modernizing the power grid, feels like a tangible contribution to the city\u2019s future.\n\nSunita\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a corner office but a legacy of resilience. She wants to see the projects she manages come to fruition, creating a grid that can withstand climate change and serve every community equitably. She aspires to one day mentor young women entering STEM, hoping to help them navigate their own systems of career and identity."

Pointing a calloused finger, he traced the flow of energy from one node to the next, explaining how an unseen force could power a thousand homes. She didn\u2019t grasp the physics, but she felt the elegant, interconnected logic. It was a secret map of the world, and in that moment, she learned that everything, from a family to a city, was a system waiting to be understood.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the dead air in the conference room in her late twenties. The project was failing, and the engineers, brilliant but siloed, were talking past each other. In that moment, Sunita saw it not as a technical problem but a broken circuit of communication. The realization hit her with the force of a current: she was meant to fix *this* system, the human one. It was a terrifying, exhilarating insight that gave her the courage to pivot her career, steering her away from designing circuits to orchestrating people.\n\n3.\nAfter signing the final divorce papers in her mid-thirties, she spent the first night on the floor of her empty Noe Valley apartment. The next morning, sunlight poured through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. She sipped chai from a paper cup, feeling not loss but a profound sense of peace. This quiet, light-filled space was hers alone. It wasn\u2019t a sad ending, but the calm, solid foundation of a life she was consciously building for herself, a testament to her newfound independence.\n\n4.\nOne rain-slicked winter evening on the J-Church, the lights inside the tram flickered. The car went dim for a second before the redundant power systems she helped implement kicked in, restoring the warm glow. Passengers barely noticed, but Sunita felt a jolt of quiet, fierce pride. This was her work\u2014not a line on a project plan, but the city\u2019s steady heartbeat through a storm. That flicker, a potential failure instantly averted, affirmed the deep, tangible purpose she had found in her career.\n\n5.\nLast year at book club, they barely discussed the novel. Instead, another woman in tech confessed her paralyzing fear of being discovered as an imposter. No one offered advice. They simply listened, shared their own versions of that same fear, and refilled her glass. In that moment of shared vulnerability, Sunita felt a connection more resilient than any power grid. It solidified her desire to mentor\u2014to build that same safe, supportive system for the next generation of women navigating their own careers."
