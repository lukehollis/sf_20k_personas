The son of Punjabi Sikh immigrants, Elias grew up with the scent of motor oil and the satisfying click of a socket wrench. While his parents preached the value of a stable career, it was watching his father diagnose a sputtering engine and bring it back to roaring life that truly shaped him. This love for tangible, mechanical solutions was a stark contrast to the abstract world of software that consumed many of his peers.\n\nThis passion led him to San Jose State University, where he earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Mechanical Engineering. He initially took a job at a massive consumer electronics firm, but felt lost in the corporate bureaucracy, his contributions reduced to a single component on a sprawling assembly line he\u2019d never see. A key turning point came when a friend in a startup poached him. The new role offered him a chance to oversee the entire manufacturing process for a niche hardware product\u2014a high-end, smart home audio system.\n\nNow, at 26, Elias lives a modern paradox. He is a master of physical production who works entirely from his sleek SoMa apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step walk from his bed to a desk dominated by three monitors. His day is a blur of early morning calls with factory managers in Shenzhen, refining CAD models with designers in Europe, and analyzing production yields. He orchestrates the birth of thousands of physical objects from his quiet, digital cocoon.\n\nLife in San Francisco is a deliberate choice to be at the epicenter of his industry, even if his office is virtual. After his trans-pacific work is done, he reclaims his time. He\u2019s a regular at the rock-climbing gym in the Dogpatch and meets his small circle of friends for craft beer in Hayes Valley. While the odd hours make dating a challenge, he finds solace in the city's energy. Elias\u2019s ultimate dream is to close the loop started in his father\u2019s garage. He hopes to one day launch his own hardware company, building a small-scale, automated factory right in the Bay Area, finally bridging the vast distance between his designs and the satisfying reality of a finished product he can hold in his own hands."
