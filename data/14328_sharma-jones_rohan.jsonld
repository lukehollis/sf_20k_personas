Born in Oakland to an Indian father, a pragmatic software engineer, and a free-spirited white American mother who was a ceramicist, his childhood was a sensory tapestry of curry spices, kiln dust, and lively dinner parties. The East Bay\u2019s diverse culinary landscape was his playground, and by his teens, he was more interested in the composition of a five-course meal than in coding. This passion led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in Hospitality Management, a practical choice that worried his father but felt like destiny to him.\n\nHis career began humbly: bussing tables, then bartending through college. The turning point came during a post-graduation backpacking trip through Spain's Rioja region. Standing in a centuries-old vineyard, the concept of *terroir*\u2014the taste of a place\u2014crystallized in his mind. He returned to San Francisco with a new mission: to tell stories through beverages. He worked his way up with relentless dedication, earning a sommelier certification and making a name for himself with his innovative pairings. Now, as the Beverage Director for a chic, arts-focused restaurant in Hayes Valley, he curates a list that is both a conversation starter and a journey in a glass.\n\nRohan lives in a meticulously kept Duboce Triangle apartment with his husband, David, an architect. His 3.5-mile commute is a daily ritual he cherishes. Zipping through traffic on his Vespa is his moment of urban meditation, a burst of freedom before the orchestrated chaos of service begins. His days are a mix of meetings with distributors, training staff, and long nights on the restaurant floor, observing guests and ensuring every detail of the beverage experience is perfect.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees the city as a living ecosystem of taste, constantly evolving. He thrives on the competition and camaraderie of its food scene. Rohan\u2019s ultimate dream is to open his own intimate bar in a neighborhood like the Mission or North Beach\u2014a small, personal space dedicated to artisanal spirits and natural wines. It would be the culmination of his life\u2019s work: a place that, like himself, is a thoughtful blend of heritage, craft, and modern San Francisco style."

His dad handed him a tray of steaming masala chai to serve. Hesitantly, Rohan used his mother\u2019s lopsided, hand-thrown ceramic cups. Watching a pragmatic engineer cradle the imperfect, beautiful vessel, he felt a click of understanding. It wasn't two separate worlds, but a perfect, harmonious blend. This was the moment he first understood composition, the beauty of the unexpected pairing.\n\n2.\nIt was in Rioja, dust kicking up around his worn boots. He was 22, backpacking and adrift. An old winemaker had him crush a sun-warmed Tempranillo grape between his fingers, then handed him a fistful of the dry, mineral-rich soil. \"This is the parent of that,\" the man said in Spanish. The connection was electric, a current running from the earth, through the vine, to his own palate. It was no longer just wine; it was a story of place. He returned to SF with a clear purpose.\n\n3.\nThe silence of the sommelier certification exam room was deafening. Three red glasses, three whites. His heart hammered, his father\u2019s gentle skepticism a faint echo in his mind. He lifted the first red, inhaled, and the world focused to a single point. Cherry, leather, dried herbs\u2026 Chianti Classico. He named it, his voice steady. The nod from the Master Sommelier was more than confirmation; it was liberation. It was the moment his passion became his irrefutable profession, a craft he had rightfully mastered.\n\n4.\nTheir first night in the Duboce Triangle apartment was chaos. Boxes everywhere. David, ever the architect, was sketching plans on a napkin while Rohan, overwhelmed, opened a bottle he\u2019d been saving\u2014a crisp, celebratory Sancerre. They drank it straight from the bottle, sitting on the bare floor, the city lights painting patterns on the walls. It tasted like potential. In that shared, simple moment, surrounded by unpacked life, Rohan felt truly home. This was the quiet foundation upon which every ambition would be built.\n\n5.\nYesterday\u2019s commute was perfect. The five o\u2019clock sun slanted through the city, making the streetcar lines glitter. He leaned into a turn on his Vespa, the brisk air a sharp, clean palate cleanser after a day of negotiating with distributors. For those 3.5 miles between Duboce and Hayes, he wasn't a director or a boss; he was just a moving part of the city's vibrant ecosystem. It was his daily meditation, a fleeting moment of pure, uncurated freedom that prepared him for the beautiful chaos of service."
