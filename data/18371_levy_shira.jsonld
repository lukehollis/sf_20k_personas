She was raised in Berkeley, the child of a Black artist mother from Oakland and a Jewish sociology professor father. Their dinner table was a vibrant mix of social justice debate and creative expression, instilling in Shira a deep-seated belief that systemic problems required both compassionate and analytical solutions.\n\nThis led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Public Health. A volunteer position at a free clinic in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District became her turning point. Witnessing firsthand the health disparities faced by immigrant and low-income families, her academic interest ignited into a passionate calling. The theoretical became tangible; policy papers had faces and names.\n\nHer career was a steady, determined climb through the city\u2019s non-profit sector. Shira wasn\u2019t a flashy networker but earned respect through her meticulous work and unwavering dedication. Now, as Director of Community Health Programs, she designs and oversees initiatives\u2014from school-based nutrition education to vaccination drives for the elderly\u2014that aim to bridge the very gaps she first observed as a student.\n\nAt 47, her life has found a stable rhythm. After an amicable divorce in her late thirties, she channeled her energy into her work and her community. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its diverse, family-oriented feel. Her daily 5.5-mile commute on the MUNI bus is a time for reflection, observing the city she serves.\n\nShira\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of legacy. She aspires to secure permanent funding for a mentorship program connecting young people of color with careers in public health. For Shira, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it\u2019s a living project, a complex community she is committed to helping heal, one program at a time."

Her father led the prayers, deliberately linking Pharaoh to redlining and the story of Exodus to the Civil Rights Movement. On the wall, her mother had hung a painting of raised fists holding matzah. For Shira, the smell of brisket and the cadence of Hebrew fused into a single, powerful lesson: justice was an ancient story, but the work of liberation was happening at their own Berkeley dinner table. It\u2019s where her two worlds became one purpose.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was in her early twenties, volunteering at the Mission clinic. An elderly woman, Se\u00f1ora Carmen, held a prescription bottle with trembling hands, her eyes filled with a quiet fear. She only spoke Spanish and couldn't read the English instructions. In that moment, Shira saw not a public health statistic, but a grandmother in need of care. The rage that rose in her wasn't hot, but clarifying. This was the work. It had a face, a name, and a story.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe year after her divorce, around age 39, she ran. She would push out the door of her new Inner Richmond apartment and run west through Golden Gate Park. The damp eucalyptus scent filled her lungs as she pounded the pavement. Reaching the Great Highway, staring at the vast, grey Pacific, she didn\u2019t feel loss, but a quiet, powerful solitude. She was her own anchor, in her own city. That feeling of self-reliance became a foundation she\u2019s built on ever since.\n\n***\n\n4.\nJust last year, on her daily MUNI commute. An elderly Cantonese-speaking woman\u2019s bag of oranges broke, spilling across the aisle. Before Shira could move, a young man with noise-canceling headphones was on his knees, patiently gathering them. They didn't share a language, just a small, decent moment. It was the city she fought for in microcosm\u2014the small, unnoticed connections between strangers that quietly held everything together. It renewed her weary hope for another week.\n\n***\n\n5.\nShe was 45, overseeing a vaccination drive in the Excelsior. A young volunteer, a first-generation student from SF State, stayed late to ask about grant-writing and community outreach. The student\u2019s questions were sharp, her passion palpable. Shira saw her own burgeoning fire reflected in the young woman\u2019s eyes. It was then her ambition crystallized: it wasn\u2019t enough to build programs. She had to build the next generation of builders, ensuring the work would long outlive her."
