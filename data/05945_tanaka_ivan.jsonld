The son of a Nisei father, a meticulous electrician, and a third-generation Japanese American mother who worked as an accountant, Ivan grew up in San Jose surrounded by a quiet dedication to order and function. His parents, wanting a name that sounded strong and worldly, chose Ivan, a decision that always made him feel slightly distinct from his peers.\n\nInitially drawn to the creative side of manufacturing, he pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Industrial Design at San Jose State. However, during his studies, he discovered his true passion wasn't in designing the final product, but in perfecting the system that created it. He was fascinated by workflow efficiency, supply chain logistics, and the elegant dance of a well-run production floor.\n\nAfter graduation, Ivan climbed the ladder at a large Silicon Valley electronics manufacturer. He thrived until the dot-com bust of the early 2000s resulted in mass layoffs, leaving him adrift. This became his defining turning point. Observing the rise of boutique, locally-made goods, he saw a niche. Instead of returning to a large corporation, he used his expertise to help small, artisanal brands scale their operations.\n\nThis new path led him to San Francisco, where he purchased a live/work loft in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood with a rich industrial past transforming into a hub for creators. This explains his 0.0-mile commute; his office and small-scale production workshop are on the ground floor of his home. Now 48, Ivan is the behind-the-scenes force for several high-end local companies, from leather goods to bespoke lighting fixtures.\n\nA focused and private man, Ivan\u2019s social life is woven into his neighborhood. He\u2019s a regular at the local brewery and the corner coffee shop, his friendships built on shared community rather than grand social events. His dream isn\u2019t to build his own brand, but to establish a co-op makerspace\u2014a place to pass on his knowledge of process and production, ensuring that the legacy of craftsmanship in San Francisco continues to thrive."
