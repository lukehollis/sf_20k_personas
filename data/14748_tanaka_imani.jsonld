Raised in Oakland by her Black American father, a pragmatic auto mechanic, and her Japanese mother, a meticulous ceramicist, Imani\u2019s childhood was a fusion of function and form. Her father\u2019s garage smelled of oil and metal, a place where she learned the quiet satisfaction of repairing what was broken. Her mother\u2019s studio was a sanctuary of clay and glazes, where she absorbed the Japanese aesthetic of *wabi-sabi*\u2014finding beauty in imperfection and simplicity.\n\nThis dual upbringing shaped her path. The pivotal moment came at seventeen, when her father passed away, leaving her his heavy, grease-stained toolbox. Holding a worn-down wrench, she saw not just a tool, but a legacy of making things last. This inheritance solidified her decision to pursue a career that honored both her parents' philosophies. She enrolled in the MFA program for Industrial Design at the California College of the Arts, channeling her creativity into tangible objects meant for daily life.\n\nNow, as the Lead Product Designer for a sustainable home goods company in the Dogpatch, Imani\u2019s influence is clear. She designs elegant, durable kitchenware and furniture, championing natural materials and longevity over disposable trends. Her days are a mix of digital modeling and hands-on prototyping in the workshop, a balance she cherishes.\n\nImani lives in a sunny Potrero Hill apartment, its walls adorned with her mother\u2019s pottery and art from local creators. Her 2.5-mile bicycle commute is a daily ritual, a moment of connection with the city\u2019s industrial past and creative present. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from grad school and regular visits with her mother in the East Bay.\n\nHer ultimate dream is to launch her own design studio, Tanaka Made, creating heirloom-quality products that embody her unique heritage. For Imani, design is not just a profession; it\u2019s a way to tell a story\u2014one of resilience, intention, and the quiet beauty of a well-made thing."

Imani watched, expecting tears, but her father quietly took it to the garage. He didn\u2019t toss it. Instead, he carefully applied a thin line of industrial epoxy, clamping it with a gentle vise. The bowl was whole again, a hairline scar tracing its curve. It wasn't perfect, but it was strong and loved. In that moment, Imani understood that fixing something was its own form of beauty, a quiet act of devotion honoring both function and history.\n\n2.\nWeeks after the funeral, she finally lifted the heavy lid of her father\u2019s toolbox. The scent of motor oil and cold steel hit her like a physical presence. She picked up his favorite combination wrench, its handle worn smooth and dark from years of his grip. The weight felt solid, real. As grease smudged her palm, she wasn't just holding a tool; she was holding his legacy of making things work. The grief was still a raw ache, but now it had a purpose: to build things that last.\n\n3.\nDuring a final critique at CCA, her professor picked up the simple wooden ladle she had designed from reclaimed maple. He didn\u2019t just look at it; he balanced it in his palm, feeling its weight and texture. \u201cThis has a soul,\u201d he said to the class. \u201cYou can feel the hand that made it and the history of the material.\u201d The praise wasn\u2019t just for her design; it was a profound validation of her entire philosophy. It was the moment she knew the garage and the studio had truly merged within her.\n\n4.\nOne foggy Tuesday morning last spring, she crested the top of Potrero Hill on her bike. Below, the Dogpatch emerged from the mist\u2014the old shipyard cranes standing like sentinels beside modern workshops. The crisp air smelled of bay salt and brewing coffee. It was her entire ethos in a single view: the industrial past gracefully making way for a functional, creative future. It wasn't a dramatic event, just a quiet, powerful feeling of being in exactly the right place at the right time, fully connected to her city.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, sitting in her mother\u2019s sunlit Oakland studio, she was sipping tea from a perfectly imperfect cup. Her mom watched her, a small smile playing on her lips. \u201cYour father gave you his hands,\u201d she said softly, \u201cand I gave you my eyes. It is time you built a house for them both.\u201d The simple words landed with the weight of a calling. It was no longer just a dream; launching Tanaka Made suddenly felt like an inevitability, the truest and most necessary expression of her inheritance."
