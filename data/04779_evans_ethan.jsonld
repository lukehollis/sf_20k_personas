Born in a small town in South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by a loving, Caucasian couple and raised in the manicured suburbs of Marin County. His parents, the Evanses, gave him everything, yet a quiet sense of displacement colored his childhood. He was a studious, observant boy who excelled in school but always felt as if he were navigating a liminal space\u2014too Asian for his white-Anerican surroundings, yet completely disconnected from his Korean heritage.\n\nThis search for identity propelled him to UCLA for his undergraduate degree in sociology. It was during his junior year that he experienced a pivotal turning point: a funded trip to South Korea to search for his birth family. The search was inconclusive, yielding only fragmented records of a young, unwed mother. While heartbreaking, the experience solidified his calling. He realized he wanted to help others navigate the complex systems and emotional voids that had defined his own life. This led him to UC Berkeley, where he earned his Master of Social Work (MSW).\n\nNow 34, Ethan\u2019s life and work are deeply intertwined. He is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a permanent supportive housing facility in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin, providing counseling to formerly unhoused residents with co-occurring medical and mental health disorders. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a small staff apartment on the building\u2019s top floor. His days begin with strong tea and a view of the city waking up before he descends into its most pressing realities, helping residents manage everything from medication to past traumas. His apartment is his sanctuary, a minimalist space filled with books and plants.\n\nEthan\u2019s social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and two old friends from grad school. He finds his connection to San Francisco not in its iconic landmarks, but in the raw, unfiltered humanity of his neighborhood. His dream isn\u2019t for a bigger house or a different career, but to build a more robust wellness program within the facility, one that integrates art and mindfulness. Ultimately, Ethan hopes to find peace not by solving the mystery of his past, but by continuing to build a meaningful present, finding his own sense of home by helping others secure theirs."

            "value": "1.\nHe remembers being eight, staring at the family portrait on the mantel. His parents\u2019 loving smiles framed his own face, a stark contrast in features. In that moment, he understood that love and displacement could coexist. It wasn't sadness, but a quiet awareness of a gap he couldn't name, a question that would silently echo for years. This feeling of being both fully loved and fundamentally different became the bedrock of his quiet, observational nature, always trying to understand where he fit.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, sitting in a drab Seoul office as a social worker slid a thin, worn file across the table. The fragmented records spoke of a young mother but offered no name, no path forward. The expected wave of grief was replaced by a strange, quiet calm. The search was over. In that profound loss, he found his purpose. He could stop looking for his own history and start helping others navigate theirs. The mystery wouldn't define him; his response to it would.\n\n3.\nIt was his second year at the facility. A resident, a woman who rarely spoke, quietly showed him a faded photograph of a garden she once tended. She described each plant with a reverence he understood deeply. In her story of a lost home, he felt a profound connection that transcended their different lives. That shared sense of longing, and the quiet trust in that moment, confirmed he belonged not in a manicured suburb, but right here, amid the city\u2019s raw, resilient heart.\n\n4.\nJust last week, after a grueling day of crisis calls, he\u2019d sat in his armchair, the city lights blurring through the window. He held a warm mug of barley tea, the steam fogging his glasses, and simply watched his monstera plant unfurl a new leaf. There was no grand revelation, just a deep, grounding peace. He realized home wasn't a place you find, but a space you cultivate. This small, quiet ritual was his proof, a sanctuary he had built for himself, one breath at a time.\n\n5.\nFor his 34th birthday, his two friends from grad school came to his small apartment. They didn't go out, but instead cooked a simple meal, their conversation an easy, familiar rhythm in the compact space. Leaning against his kitchen counter, watching them laugh, he felt a sense of belonging so complete it was physical. This, he realized, was family\u2014not an answer to a question from the past, but a quiet, steady presence he had chosen, and that had chosen him back. It was enough."
