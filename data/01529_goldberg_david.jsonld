At 54, his daily commute to Golden Gate Elementary, where he is the principal, is a short walk from his Craftsman home, a journey filled with familiar faces and the scent of fog mixing with eucalyptus from the nearby park.\n\nHe is a product of the city itself, raised in the Haight-Ashbury of the 1970s by a bookseller father and a community organizer mother. Their home was a chaotic sanctuary of progressive ideals, intellectual debate, and dog-eared paperbacks. Formal education was valued, but lived experience was revered. This upbringing instilled in David a deep-seated belief in community and a slight distrust of rigid institutions.\n\nHis own educational journey was meandering. He enrolled at San Francisco State to study literature but found himself more drawn to student activism and volunteering than to lectures. He left without a degree, feeling adrift until a part-time job at an after-school program in the Mission District became his unexpected calling. Working with children, seeing their potential and their struggles firsthand, gave him a purpose he\u2019d never found in a classroom. This revelation propelled him to return to school, not for a traditional degree, but to earn the necessary credentials to become a teacher.\n\nDavid\u2019s career was a slow, steady climb through the city\u2019s public school system. He was the teacher who stayed late, who knew every student\u2019s family situation, who championed the arts and social-emotional learning long before they were buzzwords. He became a principal not for the title, but for the ability to shape a school\u2019s culture into the kind of supportive community he\u2019d always craved.\n\nHis personal life is his anchor. For twenty years, he has shared his home with his husband, Marcus, a landscape architect whose calm demeanor balances David\u2019s passionate energy. Their evenings are spent gardening, cooking, and walking their terrier in Golden Gate Park. David\u2019s dream is simple: to foster a generation of empathetic, curious children and, perhaps one day, to retire and finally write the book of poetry he started in his twenties. He is a man who found his universe in a small corner of a big city, dedicating his life to cultivating the ground right under his feet."
