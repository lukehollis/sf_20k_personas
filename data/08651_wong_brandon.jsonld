Born and raised in the Sunset District, he was the only child of Hong Kong immigrants who poured their life savings into a small, beloved bakery. From a young age, Brandon witnessed the city\u2019s complex rhythm not from a postcard view, but from the front lines: the daily struggle for parking for his parents' delivery van, the reliance on the often-unreliable L Taraval Muni line, and the vibrant, multilingual community that flowed past their shop window.\n\nThis practical, ground-level perspective shaped his academic path. While his parents hoped for a lucrative career in tech or medicine, Brandon felt drawn to the city\u2019s underlying systems. At UC Davis, he majored in Urban Studies, fascinated by how infrastructure could either connect or isolate communities. A pivotal internship with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) sealed his fate. He saw the gordian knot of bureaucracy and competing interests but also felt a spark of idealism; he believed he could help untangle it.\n\nNow 26, Brandon is a Transportation Planner for the city, working from his small but tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute has made his neighborhood his entire ecosystem. His days begin not with a battle on the freeway, but with a walk to a local cafe on Clement Street for a strong coffee. He spends hours analyzing traffic data, modeling bus rapid transit scenarios, and drafting proposals for safer bike lanes. His work is a constant feedback loop; the designs he reviews on his monitor are the same streets he walks every evening in Golden Gate Park.\n\nBrandon maintains a close-knit group of friends from college and a burgeoning relationship with a landscape architect he met through a mutual friend. His dream isn't grand or abstract; it's tangible. He wants to help create a San Francisco where a family running a small business doesn't lose an hour a day searching for parking, and where a child can safely bike to school. He wants to see the city live up to its progressive ideals, one protected bus lane and pedestrian-friendly intersection at a time, honoring the hardworking community that raised him."
