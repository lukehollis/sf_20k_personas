Born and raised in the Richmond District, his world was shaped by the rhythms of his immigrant parents\u2019 Cantonese restaurant: the clatter of woks, the scent of five-spice, and the relentless pursuit of a stable American life. For them, stability was paramount, a value they hoped to instill in their only son. Lei, however, found his voice not in numbers, but in the clean lines of a drawing pen. He filled sketchbooks with heroes and cityscapes, dreaming of a life in comics or design.\n\nHe dutifully enrolled at City College, pursuing an Associate's in Graphic Design. He excelled, his portfolio blooming with a quiet, sharp creativity. But the pressure from his family, combined with the instability of freelance work, gnawed at him. The turning point came when his father needed a minor but complicated surgery. Over weeks of appointments, Lei observed the medical office staff\u2014their calm efficiency, their ability to navigate a confusing system, the tangible help they provided. It was a different kind of order, one he found himself craving.\n\nIn a decision that was both a compromise and a calling, Lei pivoted. He earned a medical office assistant certificate and soon found a job in a specialist\u2019s clinic nestled on a street corner in the Inner Sunset. He now lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment directly above the clinic, his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nHis days are a structured pattern of scheduling appointments, managing patient records, and offering a steady presence to anxious people. It's a life that would have made his parents proud\u2014secure and helpful. Yet, the artist in him hasn't vanished. In the evenings, after the last patient has left, Lei sits by his window overlooking the MUNI tracks. He pulls out his Wacom tablet, the glow illuminating his face as he sketches. His current project is a graphic novel, a semi-autobiographical story about a young man navigating the two worlds of his family\u2019s expectations and his own quiet, creative dreams. Lei found the stable ground his parents wanted for him; now, he\u2019s secretly trying to build a world of his own upon it."
