The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery, Liam grew up understanding the city not as a series of landmarks, but as a complex network of communities. His parents preached stability and security, worlds away from the uncertainty they had left behind. This grounded upbringing fostered in him a deep fascination with how cities function and breathe, leading him to pursue a Master's degree in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis idealistic vision, however, collided with the harsh reality of student debt and a desire to repay his parents' sacrifices. He made a pragmatic pivot, leveraging his analytical skills to land a coveted role in management consulting. For over a decade, his life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and PowerPoint decks, optimizing supply chains for corporations that were the antithesis of his parents\u2019 corner store. He was successful, wealthy, and profoundly disconnected from the passion that once drove him.\n\nThe pandemic-induced shift to remote work was the turning point. Suddenly, his commute was 0.0 miles. His world shrank to the confines of his sleek, modern condo in Mission Bay\u2014a sterile glass tower that felt a universe away from the Sunset. The silence, punctuated only by Zoom calls, amplified his discontent. His long-term relationship crumbled under the weight of his \"always-on\" work mentality, leaving him truly alone with his success.\n\nNow, at 39, Liam finds himself haunted by the ghost of his Urban Planning degree. During his screen breaks, he doesn't just scroll; he studies rezoning proposals and pores over plans for new public parks. His aspiration is no longer to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a way down. He dreams of leaving consulting to work for a community development non-profit or even using his capital to launch a small, socially-conscious business. He wants to reconnect with the tangible fabric of San Francisco, to build something meaningful in the city that raised him, and finally bridge the gap between the man he became and the boy who loved maps."
