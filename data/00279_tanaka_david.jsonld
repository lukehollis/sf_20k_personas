A fourth-generation Japanese-American, David grew up in the serene, tech-dominated landscape of suburban San Jose. His parents, a pragmatic engineer and a meticulous accountant, carried the unspoken legacy of their own parents\u2019 internment, valuing stability and tangible success above all else. They envisioned a similar path for David, but from a young age, he was drawn to the visual world, filling sketchbooks with detailed drawings instead of code.\n\nHis choice to pursue a Bachelor's in Graphic Design at San Jose State was a quiet act of rebellion. It was a compromise\u2014a practical application of art that his parents could grudgingly accept. After graduating, David dove into San Francisco's burgeoning tech scene, initially working as a junior designer for startups that burned bright and fast. He honed his skills at the intersection of digital interfaces and human emotion, learning to build brands from the ground up. Over a decade, he climbed the ladder, finally landing his role as Creative Lead at a boutique agency that values artistry over algorithms. He now works remotely, leading projects for arts organizations and cultural institutions, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to the life he\u2019s built.\n\nA key turning point was ending a long-term relationship five years ago, an event that prompted him to channel his energy inward. He invested in his Dogpatch loft, transforming the industrial space into a sanctuary of minimalist design, thriving plants, and his personal printmaking equipment. His daily routine is a blend of focused work\u2014client calls and digital mockups\u2014and restorative rituals like walking to a local caf\u00e9 or spending evenings at his printing press.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but specific; he loves the city\u2019s creative pulse, not its chaotic center. His social life revolves around a tight-knit circle from the design and art worlds. His ultimate dream is to transition from client-facing work to his own full-time art practice, creating large-scale prints that explore themes of memory, identity, and the delicate balance between digital and analog worlds. He aspires to create something permanent in a city defined by constant change."
