The only child of Taiwanese immigrants, he saw their relentless hard work as both an inspiration and a life to escape. While they toiled seven days a week, David buried himself in books, driven by a quiet ambition to build a world far from inventory counts and cash registers.\n\nHis path was meticulously planned. He earned a computer science degree from UC Berkeley, and then, seeing the power nexus shifting from engineering to strategy, pursued an MBA at Stanford. This combination made him a prime candidate for top-tier management consulting. For over a decade, David excelled, becoming a Senior Management Consultant specializing in tech company optimization. His life became a blur of airports, boardrooms, and hotel suites, diagnosing corporate ills and prescribing high-stakes solutions. He was successful, wealthy, and a stranger to his own city.\n\nThe pandemic was the unexpected anchor. Grounded indefinitely, the 0.0-mile commute from his Mission Bay condo bedroom to his home office became a stark symbol of his disconnect. The constant travel that had defined his identity vanished, replaced by the sterile quiet of his high-rise. At 42, he realized his professional network was vast, but his personal one had withered. He had advised on billion-dollar mergers but hadn't had a meaningful, non-transactional conversation in weeks.\n\nNow, David\u2019s days are a disciplined cycle: a pre-dawn run along the Embarcadero, followed by twelve hours of intense Zoom calls and slide deck creation. He rediscovered the simple pleasure of walking to the Ferry Building Farmer's Market on Saturdays, a faint echo of his parents' world. His core aspiration has shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to building genuine connection. He dreams of leveraging his strategic mind for a local non-profit or mentoring young entrepreneurs from backgrounds like his own. He wants to transition from being a high-earning resident to a true neighbor, finally reconnecting with the city he was born in but is only now learning to call home."
