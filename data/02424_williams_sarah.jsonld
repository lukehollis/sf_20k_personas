Raised in a planned Sacramento suburb by a public school teacher and a state water board engineer, her childhood was defined by civic-minded stability and discussions about infrastructure at the dinner table. She grew up believing that systems, when managed properly, could genuinely improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nThis belief led her to UC Davis, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Political Science with a minor in Urban Studies. While her peers were drawn to national politics, Sarah was fascinated by the municipal level. A transformative junior-year internship with a San Francisco City Supervisor's office sealed her fate. Answering calls from residents about everything from broken streetlights to navigating the affordable housing lottery, she saw the direct, tangible impact of local government. It was messy, often frustrating, but undeniably real.\n\nUpon graduating, she eschewed more lucrative private-sector offers and eagerly accepted a position as a Program Coordinator for City Services. Her \"0.0 mile commute\" is a post-pandemic reality; her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond doubles as her office. Her days are a cycle of Zoom meetings with community partners, updating databases for public health outreach, and drafting reports. To counteract the digital isolation, she builds routines that tether her to her neighborhood. Her morning starts with a walk to a small cafe on Clement Street for an oat milk latte, and she ends most workdays with a run through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park, trading spreadsheets for eucalyptus-scented air.\n\nSarah\u2019s social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from college and her old internship, most of whom also work in the non-profit or public sector. They bond over their shared passion and frustrations, meeting for trivia at a neighborhood pub or weekend dim sum. She is deeply connected to San Francisco, not as a place of disruption and tech glamour, but as a complex community she is dedicated to serving. Her dream isn't a corner office, but to eventually move into a policy advisor role, shaping the programs she now helps execute. She hopes to one day afford a small condo in the city she loves, continuing her work as a builder from within."
