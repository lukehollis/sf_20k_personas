Raised in a modest East Bay home, his world was shaped by two opposing forces: his father\u2019s grease-stained garage, filled with the logic of engines and tools, and his mother\u2019s quiet love for library books, brimming with narratives and history. While his peers followed a path toward college, Brandon found classrooms suffocating. He learned by doing, disassembling everything from toasters to lawnmowers, less to fix them and more to understand their soul.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma, but his real learning was just beginning. He drifted through jobs in construction and theater set-building, honing his skills with wood, metal, and light. The turning point came during a volunteer stint at the Exploratorium. A senior exhibit designer, impressed by Brandon\u2019s sketchbook of imaginative, interactive contraptions, took him under her wing. This informal apprenticeship was his university. He learned how to tell a story not with words, but with space, texture, and interaction.\n\nNow 29, Brandon lives and works in a sprawling live/work loft in Dogpatch. His commute is a ten-step walk from his coffee maker to his workshop, a space of controlled chaos with 3D printers, woodworking tools, and countless prototypes. His days are a fluid mix of digital modeling and hands-on fabrication, often fueled by late-night inspiration. San Francisco isn\u2019t just his home; it\u2019s his creative ecosystem. The city\u2019s embrace of the unconventional allowed a self-taught maker like him to thrive.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of other creators\u2014programmers, artists, and industrial designers\u2014who often gather at local breweries to debate aesthetics and function. While past relationships have fizzled, often strained by his devotion to his work, he remains an optimist. Brandon\u2019s ultimate dream is to design a permanent, landmark exhibit for the California Academy of Sciences, a fusion of his father\u2019s mechanics and his mother\u2019s narratives. He wants to build something that inspires the same wonder in a new generation of children that he once found taking apart a clock radio."
