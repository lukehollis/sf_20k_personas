Born in San Mateo to a reserved Lebanese immigrant father and an emotionally expressive Midwestern mother, he grew up bridging the cultural and communicative gap between them. He became a keen observer of unspoken tensions and the subtle ways people seek connection and validation. This early role as the family's emotional interpreter planted the seed for his future career, making him acutely aware of the fractures that can form in the absence of empathy.\n\nHis educational journey took him to UC Santa Cruz for his undergraduate degree, where the campus's progressive, introspective culture resonated with him. He then moved into the city for his graduate studies at the University of San Francisco, earning a Master's in Counseling Psychology. It was here that Alex felt he had truly come home. He deliberately chose not to pursue a lucrative private practice, instead dedicating his skills to the public school system. He is now a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist at a high school in the Mission District, a role he finds both draining and immensely fulfilling.\n\nA key turning point was the end of a seven-year relationship in his early thirties. He and his partner had simply grown in different directions, a painful but amicable split that taught him profound lessons about grief, acceptance, and personal evolution\u2014insights he now shares with the teenagers he counsels. His social life now revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from grad school and a weekly hiking club.\n\nAlex lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days begin with a foggy run in Golden Gate Park, a ritual of solitude before the city awakens. His 5.5-mile commute on the N-Judah or the 38-Geary provides a daily cross-section of the city he serves\u2014a rolling diorama of lives intersecting. He loves the quiet residential feel of his neighborhood, a peaceful retreat from the emotional intensity of his work in the vibrant, often chaotic Mission.\n\nHis aspiration is to one day co-found a non-profit offering affordable mental health services for young adults and first-generation families. Alex dreams of building a life of deep connection, both in a future partnership and by continuing to be the empathetic, steady presence for others that he once needed himself."

Alex watched his father\u2019s stoic silence, then turned to his mom and translated the silence into something gentler: \u201cHe\u2019s just tired, Mom. He means he hears you.\u201d It was the first time he consciously built a bridge over an emotional chasm. That heavy, necessary act of translation became the blueprint for his life, a role he never asked for but instinctively knew how to play.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe day he officially moved into his USF grad school apartment, he stood at the window as the fog rolled down Masonic. He heard a distant cable car bell and smelled the damp pavement mixed with garlic from a neighbor\u2019s kitchen. It wasn\u2019t a jolt of excitement he felt, but a profound, settling calm. He\u2019d spent his life feeling slightly out of sync, but here, in the city\u2019s complex, moody embrace, he felt understood without having to say a word. He was finally home, at age twenty-five.\n\n***\n\n3.\nAfter seven years, the end arrived not with a fight, but with two keys placed on the clean kitchen counter. Standing in the echo of their shared apartment, his partner had looked at him, their eyes full of a sad, deep kindness, and said, \u201cTake care of yourself, Alex.\u201d In that moment, grief was washed with a surprising wave of gratitude for what they had been. That quiet, respectful ending, in his early thirties, taught him that love\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t always permanence, but growth. It\u2019s a lesson he carries into every session.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt happened last spring, in his small office at the high school. A quiet sophomore, a first-generation kid who never spoke, finally looked up from his hands. He described the crushing pressure of being his family\u2019s only English speaker, their cultural navigator. Alex felt a jolt of recognition so powerful it almost winded him. In that shared silence that followed, he saw his own childhood reflected back. It was a draining, sacred moment that solidified his purpose: to be the steady presence he had once desperately needed himself.\n\n***\n\n5.\nMost mornings begin like this: the damp, sharp smell of eucalyptus and cold earth in Golden Gate Park. His breath plumes in the foggy air, the city still a muffled hum. As he runs his usual route, the Conservatory of Flowers slowly emerges from the mist, a ghostly and beautiful promise. This solitary ritual is his anchor. It\u2019s the one part of his day that belongs only to him, a quiet space where he gathers his own frayed ends before spending the day helping teenagers untangle theirs."
