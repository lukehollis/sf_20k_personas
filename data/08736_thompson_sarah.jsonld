Raised by an engineer father and a librarian mother, her childhood was stable and intellectual, yet emotionally reserved. Sarah was the family\u2019s outlier, intensely curious about the unspoken feelings that simmered beneath the surface of their orderly lives. This fascination with the human psyche led her to study psychology at the University of Washington.\n\nSeeking a more direct way to effect change, she moved to the Bay Area for her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn to the region's progressive ethos. Her early career was a trial by fire at San Francisco General Hospital, where she confronted the rawest forms of urban struggle\u2014addiction, severe mental illness, and systemic neglect. The work was vital but draining. A pivotal turning point came after a particularly harrowing week that left her on the verge of burnout; she realized that to sustain her career, she had to redefine her professional boundaries.\n\nNow, at 44, Sarah runs a private telehealth practice from her quiet Inner Sunset apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute affords her a cherished morning ritual: coffee from a local roaster, followed by a walk through the misty avenues of Golden Gate Park before her first video session. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she specializes in helping other healthcare professionals manage stress and prevent the very burnout she once experienced.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but deliberate. She avoids the city\u2019s frantic pace, preferring the village-like feel of her neighborhood. Her social life is an anchor, built around a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a chef, a teacher, and a landscape architect\u2014who share dinners and hike Mount Sutro. Single after a long-term relationship ended amicably a few years ago, Sarah finds fulfillment in her work and autonomy. Her dream isn't about expansion but about deepening her impact; she hopes to write a book on vicarious trauma and compassionate self-care for therapists, a testament to a life spent understanding pain and fostering healing, both for others and for herself."
