Raised by a stoic factory foreman and a pragmatic schoolteacher, she was instilled with a belief in education as the only viable escape route. She enrolled in a local university to study linguistics, dreaming of a life of translation and travel. That dream took an unexpected turn when, at 21, she met an American software engineer on a work assignment. Swept up in a whirlwind romance, she abandoned her studies and followed him to San Francisco, her unfinished degree from a university no one recognized now just a footnote in her past.\n\nThe California dream quickly soured. The relationship dissolved within two years, leaving Anastasiya alone, with non-transferable college credits and a tourist visa nearing its end. Faced with returning to a life she\u2019d eagerly fled, she chose to fight. She found sponsorship through a series of grueling, low-wage service jobs before her sharp organizational skills and composure landed her an administrative assistant position at a boutique real estate firm. This role became her lifeline.\n\nNow 30, Anastasiya\u2019s life is a study in proximity and distance. Her 0.0-mile commute is a unique perk; her employer manages the sleek SoMa high-rise where she lives in a small, subsidized studio. Her days are spent coordinating showings for multi-million-dollar condos, processing paperwork for the city\u2019s elite, and then returning to her own modest apartment in the very same building. She is intimately connected to the architecture of wealth but financially and socially removed from its inhabitants.\n\nHer routine is precise: a morning run along the Embarcadero, strong coffee from a small cart, and hours spent behind her laptop. Socially, she keeps a tight circle of fellow Eastern European expats, finding comfort in shared language and dark humor. Anastasiya\u2019s dream is not to own one of the condos she helps sell. Instead, she quietly saves money with the hope of one day finishing her degree\u2014not in linguistics, but in graphic design. She yearns to create something of her own, to build a life defined by her own artistry rather than facilitating the acquisitions of others, finally making San Francisco feel like a home she has chosen, not just a place she has ended up."
