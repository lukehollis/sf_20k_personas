The son of Indian immigrants, Rohan grew up stocking shelves and making small talk with customers, learning the art of the sale and the value of a dollar long before he knew what a commission was. His parents preached the gospel of safe, stable professions, but Rohan, while sharp and personable, lacked the academic passion for engineering or medicine.\n\nHis educational path was practical. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration. It was a foundational, no-frills education that left him with a degree but no clear direction. For a few years, he drifted, working unfulfilling administrative jobs and feeling the magnetic pull of San Francisco just over the hill. The turning point came during the mid-2010s housing frenzy. He watched with fascination as \"For Sale\" signs in his neighborhood were replaced by \"Sold\" signs in a matter of days. He realized his natural charisma and understanding of community dynamics were his true assets.\n\nAt 26, he poured his savings into getting his real estate license. The first few years were a grind of hosting open houses for senior agents and building a client base one coffee meeting at a time. His breakthrough came from specializing in first-time buyers, empathizing with their anxieties and expertly guiding them through the bewildering process. He wasn't just selling properties; he was selling a foothold in the city he loved.\n\nToday, Rohan is a fixture in the Mission District. His 3.5-mile bicycle commute to his SOMA office is a daily ritual, a rolling tour of the murals, parklets, and vibrant street life he pitches to clients. He's known for his honesty, often talking people *out* of bad deals. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, a mix of fellow agents and neighbors he\u2019s met at Dolores Park or his favorite taqueria.\n\nThough successful, Rohan feels the poignant irony of his profession daily. He helps others achieve the dream of homeownership while still renting a one-bedroom apartment. His core aspiration isn't to become a top seller, but to finally buy his own place\u2014a small multi-unit building, perhaps\u2014cementing his own family's legacy in the city that has shaped him."

Before Rohan could say anything, his father smiled, bagged the milk, and told her to catch him next time. He didn\u2019t see it as a loss. He saw a neighbor. That quiet moment defined business for Rohan forever. It wasn\u2019t about the transaction; it was about the trust you build on a block, street by street. It\u2019s the reason he\u2019ll always value the client over the commission.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-four, feeling adrift, he sat on the front steps of his parents' Daly City home. He watched a slick agent slap a \"SOLD\" sticker onto a \"For Sale\" sign that had been up for less than a week. The agent didn't just leave; he chatted with neighbors, laughing easily. Rohan felt a jolt of recognition. The small talk, the community knowledge he\u2019d learned his whole life\u2014that was the real business. In that instant, his path became crystal clear, leading directly over the hill and into the heart of the city.\n\n3.\nHis first sale to a young couple, both teachers, nearly broke him. They\u2019d scraped together a down payment for a tiny condo in Bernal Heights, their anxiety palpable. When he finally handed them the keys, the wife started crying with relief. Rohan felt a profound, vicarious joy that dwarfed any thought of his paycheck. That moment, around age 28, cemented his purpose: he wasn't in the housing business, he was in the \"giving people a foothold\" business, especially those who thought it was impossible.\n\n4.\nOne warm Thursday, biking home from SOMA, he got stuck behind a garbage truck on Clarion Alley. Instead of being annoyed, he took in the familiar murals, a chaotic symphony of color and protest. He could smell pupusas frying nearby and hear the distant rumble of BART. He felt a deep, grounding love for the city\u2019s imperfect, vibrant soul. This daily sensory immersion wasn't a commute; it was a reminder of what he was really selling\u2014not just square footage, but a life lived within this beautiful mess.\n\n5.\nLast month, he got a text from clients he\u2019d helped buy a starter home in the Outer Sunset. It was a photo of their toddler taking her first steps in their new living room. \"Thank you for our forever home!\" it read. He smiled, genuinely happy for them, then looked around his own rented one-bedroom in the Mission. Pride warred with a familiar, quiet ache. The image didn't make him jealous; it sharpened his ambition. His final goal wasn\u2019t just to sell homes, but to own one."
