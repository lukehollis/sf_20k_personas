Raised in a quiet suburb of Chicago, he was the son of an accountant and a librarian\u2014parents who valued stability and intellectual curiosity. Aidan inherited both traits, excelling in school not through overt brilliance, but through methodical persistence. He was fascinated by the hidden systems that govern human interaction, which led him to pursue a Master's degree in Quantitative Sociology at UC Berkeley, viewing society as a complex dataset waiting to be interpreted.\n\nThe Bay Area\u2019s tech boom was an irresistible lure. His unique skill set\u2014the ability to find human stories within vast spreadsheets\u2014made him a perfect fit for a Senior Data Analyst role. He quickly proved his worth, deciphering user behavior and translating esoteric numbers into actionable business strategies. His career was a clear success. A key turning point was his company\u2019s permanent shift to remote work post-pandemic. While his peers lamented the loss of office culture, Aidan secretly thrived. His 0.0-mile commute meant more time for deep focus, turning his sunny NoPa apartment into an optimized hub of productivity.\n\nHis current life is a well-ordered routine. Mornings begin with a pour-over coffee and a brisk walk through the Panhandle, his mind already churning through server logs. His days are spent in a silent dialogue with data, his social interactions largely confined to Slack channels and video calls. His social circle consists of a few grad school friends, now similarly embedded in the tech world, with whom he shares occasional dinners and cynical conversations about the industry. Dating has been a frustrating, transactional ballet conducted through apps, rarely progressing beyond a few formulaic dates.\n\nAidan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both intimate and detached. He loves the city\u2019s proximity to nature and its intellectual energy but experiences it mostly from the curated comfort of his neighborhood. He is comfortable, yet a quiet restlessness has begun to surface. He dreams of applying his skills to something more meaningful, perhaps for a civic tech non-profit, and yearns for a genuine connection that can\u2019t be predicted by an algorithm. He hopes his next chapter involves analyzing a life that is less predictable and more his own."
