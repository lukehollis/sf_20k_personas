The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, she grew up in the quiet fog of the Sunset District. Her father, a pragmatic engineer, and her mother, a librarian, instilled in her a deep respect for discipline and education, hoping she would pursue a career in medicine or law. Dasha, however, spent her youth sneaking away on the N-Judah line to lose herself in the vibrant chaos of the Mission's murals and the hushed galleries of SoMa.\n\nHer choice to study art history at UC Santa Cruz was a point of contention, but she framed her graduate degree in Arts Administration as a pragmatic compromise\u2014a way to engage with her passion while building a stable career. A pivotal semester abroad in Berlin solidified her path, exposing her to radical public art and community-based projects that reshaped her understanding of what a gallery could be.\n\nAfter graduate school, she cut her teeth in New York\u2019s demanding art scene before a compelling opportunity brought her back home. In San Francisco, she met her husband, Mark Baxter, an architect who shared her vision for how design and art shape public life. They merged their names upon marriage, a symbol of their partnership and Dasha\u2019s commitment to her own heritage.\n\nNow, as the Curator and Director of Public Programs for a major contemporary arts center, Dasha is a respected figure in the city\u2019s cultural landscape. She\u2019s known for pushing boundaries, curating not just visual arts but also pioneering programs that blend performance, technology, and gastronomy. Her 4.8-mile Muni ride from their Hayes Valley apartment to the SoMa arts center is a cherished ritual of reflection and people-watching.\n\nAt 40, Dasha feels a deep sense of accomplishment, yet she is looking toward her next chapter. Her quiet ambition is to launch her own independent arts foundation, one that focuses on providing grants and mentorship to emerging Bay Area artists from underrepresented communities. She wants to be the bridge she never had\u2014connecting the city\u2019s diverse creative talents with the resources they need to thrive, ensuring the soul of San Francisco continues to be painted by all its people."

The sudden blast of Mission sun and the smell of roasting corn felt illicit and exhilarating. Hiding her Sunset-district identity, she walked for hours, her heart pounding in rhythm with the murals' vibrant colors. It wasn't rebellion; it was a pilgrimage. That day, she understood that art wasn't just in galleries\u2014it was the city\u2019s very pulse. This secret knowledge became the foundation of her life's work.\n\n2.\nThe acceptance letter for her Arts Administration master's lay on the dining room table between her and her father. He adjusted his glasses, reading the words\u2014a pragmatic compromise she had carefully engineered. The silence was thick with unspoken disappointment but also a grudging respect. It wasn\u2019t the M.D. or J.D. he\u2019d hoped for, but it was a plan. In that moment of tense truce, Dasha learned how to build a scaffold for her dreams, shaping her passion into a form the world, and her family, could understand.\n\n3.\nIn Berlin, standing before a graffiti-laced remnant of the Wall, everything shattered and reassembled. It wasn't the art itself, but the raw, living history it was painted on. She felt the chill of the concrete and understood that art could be a tool for reclamation, a direct response to trauma and a catalyst for community dialogue. The quiet, reverent galleries of her youth seemed suddenly inadequate. This epiphany gave her a new, more urgent sense of purpose that would define her curatorial vision back home.\n\n4.\nShe remembers not the wedding, but the quiet evening in their first Hayes Valley apartment. Mark sketched on a napkin while she spoke about wanting to honor her parents without losing herself. He looked up and said, \"What about both? Chen Baxter.\" The idea was immediate and right. Seeing their names merge on paper felt less like a compromise and more like a declaration\u2014a synthesis of heritage and partnership. It was a conscious choice to build a new identity, cementing her commitment to a future she was authoring herself.\n\n5.\nAt the opening of her first large-scale interactive installation, she stood back and watched. The room pulsed with light and sound, filled with a crowd far more diverse than a typical gallery opening. She saw a young woman, no older than twenty, touching a sensor and watching the art react with pure, uninhibited awe. In that woman's wide eyes, Dasha saw her teenage self, fresh off the N-Judah. This was the culmination of everything\u2014her past and present intersecting. It was the moment her quiet ambition crystallized into a plan."
