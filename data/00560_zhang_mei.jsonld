The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, she was raised in a household where success was measured by stability and academic achievement. Her parents, who ran a small laundromat in the Sunset District, poured their hopes into Mei, envisioning a future for her as a doctor or lawyer.\n\nMei was a dutiful daughter, excelling in school and aiming for a pre-med track at UC Berkeley. The turning point came during her sophomore year when her grandmother, her beloved *Nai Nai*, suffered a stroke. Mei witnessed firsthand her family\u2019s struggle to navigate a confusing healthcare system, battling language barriers and cultural misunderstandings. She saw how a lack of accessible information could be as debilitating as the illness itself. This experience extinguished her desire to be a clinician and ignited a passion for systemic change. She pivoted, eventually earning a Master's in Public Health with a focus on community health education.\n\nNow 29, Mei works from her apartment as a Healthcare Program Manager for a large Bay Area-based Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). Her 0.0-mile commute offers a solitary start to her day, usually with a cup of oolong tea and a view of the fog rolling in over Golden Gate Park. Her work is her mission: she develops and manages programs aimed at improving healthcare literacy and access for non-English-speaking and elderly populations\u2014the very people she saw her *Nai Nai* struggle amongst.\n\nHer life is deeply woven into her neighborhood. She knows the best spots for dim sum on Clement Street, trades pleasantries with the grocers, and spends weekends running in the park or meeting her close-knit circle of college friends for ramen. Though fulfilled by her work, she sometimes feels a quiet loneliness, a byproduct of her remote work and focused nature. Her dream is to one day launch her own non-profit focused on health advocacy for Asian immigrants. For now, she finds purpose in the data and the programs, knowing that each successful initiative is a tribute to her *Nai Nai*, a small but meaningful step toward a more equitable system."
