Born in Oakland to a Black librarian mother and a second-generation Chinese-American graphic designer father, his childhood home was a vibrant mix of classic literature, calligraphic art, and the hum of an early Macintosh. This environment, where storytelling met design, shaped his future. While he identifies strongly with his Black heritage, the Wong surname is a permanent, proud link to his father\u2019s history, a name he carries as a testament to his unique blended family.\n\nHis educational path was a direct extension of his upbringing. He pursued an undergraduate degree in Digital Arts at UC Santa Cruz, but a summer internship became his primary turning point. Tasked with helping create an augmented reality historical tour of the Haight-Ashbury, Jordan discovered his passion: using technology to overlay stories onto the physical world. This revelation propelled him to a Master of Fine Arts in Digital Media at the California College of the Arts (CCA) in San Francisco, where he honed his skills in coding, projection mapping, and interactive design.\n\nNow 28, Jordan is a Creative Technologist at a SoMa-based innovation lab that develops immersive experiences for museums and high-tech restaurants. His $135,000 salary affords him a comfortable life in the city he loves. His daily routine begins with a 2.8-mile bicycle commute from his Mission District apartment, a ritual that energizes him with the city's morning pulse. He lives with his long-term partner, Maya, a landscape architect, and their shared passion is debating how people interact with designed spaces\u2014his digitally, hers physically.\n\nJordan feels deeply connected to San Francisco's creative and rebellious spirit. Evenings are often spent trying new food trucks, sketching ideas in Dolores Park, or collaborating on small side projects with other local artists. His ultimate dream is to one day open his own independent studio, creating large-scale public art installations that use technology to tell the forgotten stories of the city\u2019s diverse communities, giving a voice to the complex identities, like his own, that define San Francisco."

To his other side, his father\u2019s hand moved across a graphics tablet, the soft whir of the Macintosh a constant hum. In that moment, he felt the perfect fusion of story and design. It wasn\u2019t a choice between his parents\u2019 worlds; he realized he could live in the space where they met. This memory became the blueprint for his identity.\n\n2.\nAt 20, standing on a Haight Street corner, he held up a prototype tablet for his internship. Through the screen, a shimmering, ghostly image of Janis Joplin appeared on the steps of a painted Victorian. It was raw and glitchy, but it felt like pure magic. He felt a jolt of purpose so profound it was almost dizzying. This wasn't just code; it was a form of resurrection. He knew then that he would spend his life telling stories that haunted the city\u2019s physical spaces, making its history tangible.\n\n3.\nTwo years ago, he was arguing with Maya on the grass in Dolores Park. He saw the space as a canvas for a digital layer, while she spoke of drainage and native plants. His frustration melted into awe as he realized they were describing the same thing: how to guide human experience. He looked at her, passionate and brilliant, and understood that their love was built on this beautiful tension between the physical and the digital. It wasn't a debate; it was a perfect collaboration.\n\n4.\nLast spring, biking home late from his SoMa lab, he stopped near the crest of a Mission hill. The fog was a silent predator, devouring the city lights below, one by one. The air was cold, damp, and smelled of eucalyptus and street food. In that quiet solitude, watching the city disappear and reappear, he felt a profound sense of belonging. It wasn't about the industry or the noise; it was about being a small, breathing part of this beautiful, moody, and defiant organism.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, while walking near work, he saw it: a massive, windowless concrete wall, blank and ignored. Instantly, his mind filled the space with a projection-mapped mural of Manilatown\u2019s forgotten residents, their faces flickering into existence after dusk. The vision was so clear, so complete, it was a physical ache. It was no longer a vague dream of a future studio; it was an urgent, tangible mandate. That wall was waiting for its story, and he knew he had to be the one to tell it."
