Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, she is the granddaughter of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small grocery on Clement Street. Her parents, a pragmatic accountant and a meticulous seamstress, encouraged her academic pursuits, hoping she would secure a stable professional future they never had. Mei Lin inherited their discipline but also a deep, artistic appreciation for the city's complex harmony of nature and structure.\n\nInitially, she pursued architecture at UC Berkeley, but found herself more drawn to the spaces between buildings than the buildings themselves. This led her to a graduate degree in Landscape Architecture, where she focused on how public spaces shape community identity. It was a turning point, shifting her ambition from creating monuments to cultivating ecosystems for people. She joined the San Francisco Planning Department in her late twenties, just as the first dot-com boom was reshaping the urban landscape.\n\nFor over two decades, Mei Lin has been a quiet force behind the scenes, her work influencing park renovations, transit-oriented development, and the endless, contentious debates over housing density. A key moment in her career was co-leading the revitalization project for a neglected waterfront area, transforming it into a vibrant public promenade\u2014a tangible success she revisits on her morning walks. Her marriage to a tech entrepreneur in her thirties ended amicably after a decade, a casualty of divergent paths. Since then, her life has been defined by a tight-knit circle of friends, her dedication to her aging parents, and her work.\n\nNow 52, Mei Lin lives in a modern Hayes Valley condo, a stone's throw from City Hall. Her zero-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her home office, a space filled with blueprints, policy drafts, and pots of jasmine tea. Her days are a mix of Zoom meetings with developers, community feedback sessions, and solitary hours refining plans. Her dream is not for personal glory but for legacy: to see the city implement a truly equitable housing plan and to complete a network of green corridors connecting every neighborhood. She finds her joy not in grand openings, but in watching strangers share a bench in a plaza she helped design, proving that a well-planned city can still foster moments of spontaneous grace."
