The daughter of a hardware store owner and a librarian, she grew up in a landscape of cul-de-sacs and two-car garages where public transportation was an afterthought. It was this predictable, car-centric world that fueled her fascination with the complex, vibrant systems that make big cities function. She left Ohio for UC Berkeley, drawn by the West Coast\u2019s progressive energy, and found her calling in a Public Policy program, focusing on urban development.\n\nHer career began not in government, but at a small nonprofit advocating for pedestrian-friendly urban design. After five years, she joined the SFMTA, eager for a larger scale of impact. She found it, slowly climbing the ranks through her meticulous, data-driven approach. Sarah isn\u2019t a charismatic visionary; she\u2019s a pragmatist who finds beauty in a well-timed bus schedule and a successfully funded infrastructure project.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. The amicable end of a decade-long relationship left a void she filled by pouring her energy into her work and her city. The abstract challenge of improving San Francisco\u2019s transit became deeply personal; the city became her partner. Her work on the initial planning stages for the Central Subway project remains a source of quiet pride.\n\nNow 49, Sarah lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley. Her 4.8-mile commute on the N-Judah is a daily field study, where she observes rider patterns and silently critiques dwell times. Her social life is a small, tight circle of friends\u2014a mix of city hall colleagues and members of her long-standing book club\u2014who meet for dinners in the Inner Sunset. Weekends are for the farmers' market on Clement Street and long walks in Golden Gate Park.\n\nSarah hopes to one day lead a major city-wide initiative focused on transit equity. She dreams of a San Francisco where a person\u2019s zip code doesn\u2019t determine their access to opportunity. For her, a successful life isn't measured by title or wealth, but by the tangible improvement she can bring to the city she adopted, one policy brief and one bus route at a time."

The RTA bus groaned past, nearly empty, a ghost ship on a sea of asphalt. She felt a profound sense of isolation, not just for herself waiting for her mom\u2019s car, but for the disconnectedness of it all. It wasn\u2019t anger, but a cool, clear thought: *This could work better*. That flicker of analytical frustration was the first blueprint of the woman she would become, the one who finds purpose in connection.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHer first solo trip into San Francisco from Berkeley was on the F-Market streetcar. She remembers gripping the worn wooden seat, overwhelmed by the symphony of the city\u2014the clang of the bell,snippets of a dozen languages, the impossible slant of the hills. It was the complete, chaotic inverse of a suburban cul-de-sac. The feeling was not disorientation, but exhilaration. In that moment, she knew she wasn\u2019t just visiting; she was finally arriving somewhere she was meant to be. This was her system.\n\n***\n\n3.\nAbout a month after her partner moved out, she stayed at the office until 9 PM, numbly reviewing ridership data. Walking to the stop in the cool, empty quiet of the evening, she felt adrift. Then, exactly on schedule, the warm, bright interior of the N-Judah pulled up, its familiar rumble a quiet comfort. It felt less like a machine and more like a dependable presence checking in on her. The city was keeping its promise. That night, her work became less of a job and more of a partnership.\n\n***\n\n4.\nShe never attended the big press events for the Central Subway. Her pride was a quieter, more personal thing. She remembers standing behind a construction barrier on 4th Street, watching a colossal tunnel boring machine being lowered into the earth. It was a tangible, colossal manifestation of her years of policy briefs, budget analyses, and endless meetings. The sheer scale of it, and her small, invisible part in its existence, filled her with a satisfaction so deep and private it felt sacred.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last spring at the Clement Street farmers' market, she watched an elderly woman carefully explain to her visiting grandson, in a mix of Cantonese and English, exactly how the 28 bus would take him back to his college dorm. The boy listened intently, nodding. For Sarah, it was a sudden, perfect distillation of her entire life\u2019s goal: a city where a bus route is a thread connecting generations, ensuring a grandson can visit his grandmother with just a tap of a card. It renewed her resolve entirely."
