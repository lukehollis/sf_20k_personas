As the only child of Taiwanese immigrants who settled in the Sunset District, he grew up surrounded by the damp San Francisco fog and the unspoken expectation of success. His father, a civil engineer, and his mother, a meticulous bookkeeper, preached the gospel of stability. For them, America was about securing a future their own parents could only dream of.\n\nDavid followed the path laid out for him. He earned a practical undergraduate degree from UC Davis and, after a few years proving his mettle at a mid-tier firm, was accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business for his MBA. This degree was his golden ticket, landing him a coveted role as a financial analyst in the heart of the Financial District. For fifteen years, his life was a predictable rhythm: the early morning Muni ride, the elevator ascending a glass tower, and long hours spent deciphering market trends on glowing screens.\n\nThe turning point wasn't a promotion or a market crash, but a global pandemic. The mandated work-from-home order in 2020 shattered his routine. Suddenly, his commute was zero miles. His spacious SoMa condo, once just a place to sleep, became his entire world. The silence, initially jarring, became revelatory. Without the daily grind of commuting and office politics, David discovered something he\u2019d long ignored: time.\n\nNow, at 45, David is a senior analyst who rarely sees his office. His mornings begin not with a crowded train, but a walk to a local coffee shop where the baristas know his order. He takes midday breaks to stroll through South Park, observing the city with a presence he never had before. He reconnected with a small group of friends from Haas, initiating weekly dinners instead of bi-annual catch-ups. He\u2019s single, but recently joined a hiking group, feeling more open to genuine connection than ever before.\n\nHis aspiration is no longer a C-suite title. Having achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of, he now dreams of balance. He began learning woodworking online, finding immense satisfaction in creating something tangible with his hands. David Wei has found a new kind of wealth: a life measured not just in fiscal quarters, but in contented, well-spent hours in the city he finally feels a part of."
