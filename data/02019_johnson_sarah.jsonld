Raised by a history teacher father and a librarian mother, her childhood was filled with dinner table discussions about civic duty and the importance of community. While other kids watched cartoons, Sarah was often engrossed in the evening news, captivated by the passionate debates she saw on C-SPAN.\n\nHer path seemed set when she enrolled at UC Davis, majoring in Political Science. It was there she discovered her true passion wasn't for the grand theater of national politics, but for the tangible, immediate impact of local government. An internship with a state assemblymember during her junior year was a pivotal turning point. She spent a summer buried in constituent letters about potholes, zoning disputes, and park funding. Instead of finding it tedious, she found it thrilling; this was where policy met real life.\n\nAfter graduating, Sarah moved to San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s vibrant and often contentious political landscape. She landed a grueling job as a field organizer for a contentious housing bond campaign. The long hours and constant arguments with strangers on doorsteps forged her resolve. When the measure passed by a slim margin, the victory felt deeply personal. It cemented her place in the city and led directly to her current role as a Legislative Aide for a City Supervisor.\n\nNow, Sarah\u2019s life is a microcosm of San Francisco\u2019s civic core. Her small, tidy apartment in Hayes Valley is a stone's throw from City Hall, resulting in a commute she measures in footsteps. Her days are a whirlwind of drafting policy memos, attending community meetings in the Mission or the Sunset, and navigating the complex needs of constituents. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; her friends are fellow aides, urban planners, and non-profit advocates she meets at after-work fundraisers or over coffee at Ritual Roasters.\n\nThough driven, Sarah isn't just climbing a ladder. She genuinely believes in the power of good policy to improve lives. Her dream isn't fame, but to one day run for the Board of Supervisors herself, shaping the future of the city that has so completely captured her heart and ambition."
