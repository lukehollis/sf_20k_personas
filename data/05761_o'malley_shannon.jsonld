The daughter of a union electrician and a public-school librarian, she inherited a belief in public works and community service. This foundation propelled her to a Master\u2019s degree in Urban and Regional Planning, driven by a desire to untangle the complex, often inequitable, systems that shape modern life.\n\nShe chose San Francisco for its challenges, not its charms, seeing it as the ultimate puzzle. Starting as a junior planner, she quickly distinguished herself with her meticulous research and passionate advocacy for human-scaled development. A key turning point was her successful campaign for a \"slow street\" conversion in the Outer Sunset, a hard-won victory against entrenched interests that solidified her reputation as a pragmatic idealist. Now a Senior City Planner at 33, she is one of the key figures shaping the city's future zoning and transit policies.\n\nShannon\u2019s life is a testament to her professional principles. She lives in a modern Hayes Valley condo, a deliberate choice that gives her a 0.0-mile commute; her dedicated home office overlooks the bustling intersection of Octavia and Hayes, a constant source of real-world data. On days she visits City Hall, it\u2019s a five-minute walk. Her mornings start with a run through the Panhandle, and her evenings are often spent at community board meetings or sketching out ideas for public spaces.\n\nWhile deeply committed to her work, she maintains a close circle of friends\u2014a mix of architects, non-profit lawyers, and a tech-founder best friend who provides a playfully antagonistic perspective on civic bureaucracy. Shannon\u2019s deepest hope is not for personal accolades, but to leave a tangible legacy: a network of protected bike lanes, a beautifully designed affordable housing complex, a thriving public plaza. She wants to be a quiet architect of a more equitable and livable San Francisco, one block at a time."
