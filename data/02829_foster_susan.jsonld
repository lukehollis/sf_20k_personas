Originally from a quiet Portland suburb, she arrived in San Francisco in the late 1980s, an aspiring art history major at SF State with dreams of curating a museum. To pay her way, she took a waitressing job at \"La Lanterna,\" a family-owned Italian trattoria in the heart of North Beach, run by a gruff but kind patriarch named Marco.\n\nThe art world proved elusive and pretentious, but the controlled chaos of the restaurant floor felt like home. Susan discovered an innate talent for managing people, soothing frayed nerves, and anticipating the needs of both staff and customers. Her academic ambitions slowly faded, replaced by the immediate, tangible satisfaction of a perfectly executed dinner service. Marco, seeing her dedication and sharp mind, began grooming her, teaching her the business from ordering wine to balancing the books.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade ago. Marco, ready to retire and with no children interested in the business, made Susan an offer. He would sell the business to a silent partner on the condition that she stay on as general manager. More importantly, he offered her the small, rent-controlled apartment directly above the restaurant. She accepted without hesitation.\n\nNow, at 54, Susan\u2019s life is inextricably linked to La Lanterna. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days begin with the clatter of morning prep from the kitchen below and end long after the last espresso is served. Divorced in her late thirties, she found the restaurant a more stable and rewarding partner. Her staff are her family\u2014a rotating cast of young, energetic servers and career cooks she mothers and mentors. Her regulars, some of whom she\u2019s known for twenty years, are her community.\n\nSusan is a living fixture of North Beach, a guardian of its fading authenticity. Her dream is no longer about climbing a ladder but about holding steady\u2014keeping La Lanterna true to its roots against a tide of gentrification. She quietly hopes to one day train a successor who loves the place as she does, so she can finally take a long trip to Tuscany, not to see the art, but to taste the food."
