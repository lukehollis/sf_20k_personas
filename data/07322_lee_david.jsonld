His father, an exacting electrical engineer who arrived from Hong Kong in the 1970s, and his mother, a seamstress whose stitches were flawless, raised him in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. From them, he learned that success was measured in millimeters and sustained by quiet, relentless effort. This ethos guided him through Lowell High School and into UC Berkeley\u2019s demanding chemical engineering program.\n\nHis ambition, however, wasn't just to follow in his father's footsteps but to perfect the process. This led him to a Master's in Materials Science at Stanford, where he became fascinated with the microscopic world of semiconductor fabrication. He joined a booming Silicon Valley firm in the late 90s, thrived on the pressure, and survived the dot-com bust by being indispensable\u2014the guy who could coax 3% more efficiency out of a billion-dollar production line.\n\nHis career ascended as his personal life fractured. A decade-long marriage, filled with the tech world\u2019s long hours and deferred promises, ended amicably but left David feeling untethered. It was a turning point. He channeled his energy inward, finding solace in the predictable logic of his work. When his company went fully remote, he embraced the change, selling his suburban home and buying a minimalist condo in the Inner Richmond, just blocks from where he grew up.\n\nNow, his 0.0-mile commute defines his routine. At 6:30 AM, he walks through Golden Gate Park, planning his day\u2019s optimizations. He works in concentrated bursts from his spare-bedroom office, his world contained in schematics and data streams. His social life is sparse\u2014a weekly video call with his sister in Seattle and occasional dim sum with a college friend. He finds comfort on Clement Street, frequenting the same bakery for his morning coffee and pineapple bun.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder. He dreams of something more tangible: building a workshop to craft intricate, custom furniture. It\u2019s a hope that mirrors his profession\u2014taking raw materials and, through meticulous process and patience, creating something of perfect, lasting value."
