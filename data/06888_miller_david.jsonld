Growing up amidst the quiet predictability of suburban Cleveland, Ohio, he was a thoughtful, observant child raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a history-teacher mother. He followed his mother\u2019s passion, earning a Bachelor's degree in History from Ohio State University, a choice his father privately deemed impractical. Restless and seeking a world unlike the one he knew, David bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco upon graduation, drawn by the city\u2019s promise of reinvention.\n\nHis initial years were a struggle. The History degree that had felt so profound in a lecture hall proved difficult to monetize. He drifted between barista gigs and bookstore shifts, watching the tech boom reshape the city around him. The turning point came during a late-night shift, when he realized the historical narratives he loved were simply complex datasets of human behavior. He wasn't just reading history; he was analyzing it. Inspired, he enrolled in an intensive data analytics bootcamp, trading studies of the Peloponnesian War for Python and SQL. His knack for finding patterns in the past translated seamlessly to predicting future trends, and he landed his first tech job within a year.\n\nNow 31, David lives a life defined by his 0.0-mile commute. His apartment in the Mission District doubles as his office, where he deciphers user data for a large tech firm. His daily routine is hyper-local: a morning coffee from the corner cafe, a lunchtime walk through Dolores Park, and evenings spent with his girlfriend, Clara, a graphic designer. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends who value long conversations at a brewery over loud nights out.\n\nDavid feels more a resident of his neighborhood than of San Francisco at large. He is a quiet cartographer of his own small world. His dream is to eventually merge his two passions: using data visualization to tell compelling historical stories, perhaps for a museum or an educational platform. He hopes to build a lasting life with Clara in the city that allowed him to become himself, though the ever-present question of affordability looms over their future plans."
