Raised across the bay in Berkeley, he was the only child of two tenured UC Berkeley professors\u2014a historian and a philosopher. Their home was a library of hushed arguments and theoretical debates, rich in analysis but barren of open emotion. Adam learned early to read the subtle signals in silences and withdrawn gazes, a skill that would later define his professional life.\n\nFollowing the path expected of him, Adam initially enrolled in law school at Georgetown. However, he found the adversarial nature of law and the emotional detachment it demanded to be profoundly alienating. His turning point came during his second year, a quiet crisis of purpose that saw him walking away from a prestigious future. He returned to the Bay Area, not in defeat, but in search of something authentic. He enrolled in the Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT) graduate program at San Francisco State University, finally finding a language for the human connection he had craved his entire life.\n\nAfter years working in community mental health in the Mission, Adam saved enough to establish his own private practice. He now lives and works from a spacious top-floor flat in Cole Valley, his office a converted guest room with fog-dusted windows overlooking the back gardens. His 0.0-mile commute is a cornerstone of the deliberate, tranquil life he has built.\n\nAdam\u2019s days follow a gentle rhythm. Mornings begin with a walk through the Panhandle with his partner of ten years, Marcus, a landscape architect, and their scruffy rescue terrier. He sees clients\u2014often tech founders navigating burnout or couples struggling with the pressures of modern life\u2014from mid-morning until early evening. Socially, Adam and Marcus prefer intimate dinners with a close-knit circle of friends over the city\u2019s bustling nightlife.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deeply personal; he sees the city not as a hub of innovation, but as a collection of individuals seeking meaning. Adam\u2019s deep-seated hope is to write a book exploring the challenges of maintaining emotional intimacy in a digitally saturated world. He doesn\u2019t dream of expansion or fame, but of deepening his understanding and helping others build the emotionally rich lives that he himself fought so hard to create."
