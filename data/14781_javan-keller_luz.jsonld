Born in the Outer Richmond to Filipino immigrant parents\u2014a mother who worked as a home caregiver and a father who spent thirty years with the USPS\u2014Luz was instilled with a profound sense of community service. Her name, meaning \"light,\" was her grandmother's choice, a hope that she would be a guide for others. Growing up, she saw firsthand how her neighbors, many of them newcomers to the country, struggled to navigate the labyrinthine systems of healthcare and education for their children.\n\nThis inspired her to enroll in the Child Development program at San Francisco State University. However, her academic journey was cut short. In her junior year, her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, and Luz left school to become her primary caregiver. This challenging period became her true education, teaching her more about empathy, patience, and bureaucratic advocacy than any classroom could. After her mother\u2019s passing, returning to formal education felt redundant. She had found her calling in the trenches.\n\nNow 40, Luz channels that experience into her work as a Family Support Specialist. She is the calm, reassuring voice for families overwhelmed by special education plans, insurance denials, and social service applications. Her daily 3.5-mile commute on the N Judah MUNI line from her Inner Sunset apartment to her office near Civic Center is a time for reflection, listening to podcasts about urban policy or simply watching the city\u2019s diverse cast of characters.\n\nShe and her husband, Mark Keller, a public school teacher she met at a district-wide parent workshop, share a life built on modest means and a strong sense of purpose. They find joy in simple things: hiking Mount Sutro, exploring farmers' markets in different neighborhoods, and hosting potlucks for a tight-knit circle of friends. Luz\u2019s quiet dream is to one day finish her degree, not for career advancement, but as a promise to her younger self. More urgently, she aspires to create a small, bilingual mentorship program for first-generation high school students, ensuring the light her grandmother wished for her continues to shine for others."

I named you so you would never let anyone feel lost in the dark.\u201d The scent of garlic and ginger filled the air, but what Luz truly breathed in was a sense of purpose. In that moment, the name settled not on her tongue, but in her bones. It wasn't just a word; it was a direction.\n\n2.\nAt thirteen, she sat on the concrete steps, watching Mrs. Chen from next door weep over a school district letter, its official letterhead a wall of English she couldn\u2019t scale. Luz saw the helplessness in her own mother\u2019s eyes as she tried to translate, but the bureaucratic jargon was a fortress. It was the first time Luz understood that compassion without access was a locked door. Sitting there in the fog, a quiet, fierce vow took root: she would learn how to find the keys.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday when her mother looked straight through her and asked where Luz was. The pain was a physical blow. Luz almost fled the room, but instead, she sat down, took her mother\u2019s hand, and began humming a lullaby from her own childhood. Her mother\u2019s grip tightened, a flicker of recognition not for a daughter, but for a feeling of safety. In that silent exchange, Luz learned her most profound lesson: love is not about being remembered, but about being present and fighting for the person who remains.\n\n4.\nThe district workshop was in a stuffy high school library, the air thick with stale coffee and parental anxiety. She noticed him not because he was handsome, but because of his profound patience. Mark, a teacher she'd never met, was explaining an IEP to a worried father, his pen sketching diagrams on a napkin. Luz saw not just a teacher, but an ally. He looked up, met her eyes, and smiled a little\u2014a shared recognition of the day's hard, necessary work. She felt a sense of coming home.\n\n5.\nJust last year, the N Judah shuddered out of the Sunset tunnel, trading the rumbling dark for the bright expanse of Duboce Park. Luz saw a high school girl across the aisle, head bowed over a textbook, her brow furrowed with a familiar mix of focus and worry. In that fleeting moment, her grandmother\u2019s wish, her mother\u2019s fight, and her own quiet ambition converged. The mentorship program wasn't just a dream; it was a debt to be paid forward, a promise to that girl and so many others."
