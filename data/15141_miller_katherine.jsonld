Raised in Walnut Creek, she was a child of car culture, her days dictated by her parents\u2019 commutes. She saw the isolation and inefficiency in the sea of single-occupancy vehicles and yearned for the vibrant, interconnected world she glimpsed on family trips to San Francisco. This early observation planted the seed of a lifelong mission.\n\nWhile studying Political Science at UC Berkeley, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake became her defining moment. Witnessing the Cypress Viaduct\u2019s collapse and the city\u2019s subsequent, heroic reliance on ferries, BART, and MUNI buses transformed her abstract interest into a concrete calling. Public transportation wasn\u2019t just a convenience; it was a city\u2019s lifeline. This solidified her path, leading her to pursue a Master of Public Administration with a focus on urban transit.\n\nKatherine joined the SFMTA as a junior analyst two decades ago, steadily working her way up. Her career grew as her personal life shifted; an amicable divorce from a tech-focused husband in her early forties prompted her to sell their shared Noe Valley house and buy a condo in Hayes Valley. She craved a life where her feet, and the transit lines outside her door, were her primary mode of transport.\n\nNow a Program Director, her days are a whirlwind of budget meetings, public feedback sessions, and logistical puzzles. Her 2.8-mile commute on the 21-Hayes is her daily field research; she observes passenger flow, driver morale, and street conditions with a practiced eye. Her social life is a close-knit circle of other civic-minded professionals and artists, often meeting for dinner in her neighborhood or attending a performance at the SFJAZZ Center.\n\nKatherine\u2019s aspiration isn\u2019t a splashy retirement but to see a key project\u2014like the full integration of the Central Subway or a new bus rapid transit corridor\u2014come to fruition. She wants to leave a tangible legacy of a more equitable and efficient system for the next generation of San Franciscans. For Katherine, her work isn\u2019t just a job; it is the fulfillment of a promise she made to her younger self: to build the connected city she always dreamed of."

            "value": "1.\nShe remembers the sharp clang of the cable car bell on Powell Street, maybe eight years old. Gripping the cold brass pole, the wind whipping her hair, she felt a dizzying sense of freedom. Below, the city wasn't a map of freeways but a living grid of people moving together. That feeling\u2014of being part of a vibrant, thrumming machine instead of trapped inside a quiet box\u2014was a revelation. It planted the deep, unshakable conviction that this was how life was meant to be lived.\n\n2.\nOctober 1989. From the Berkeley Marina, she watched emergency ferries slice across the gray Bay toward a wounded San Francisco. The bridges were closed, the freeways broken, but the city was still moving. It breathed through its arteries of boats and buses. It wasn't about convenience anymore; it was about survival. In that moment of collective crisis and resilience, her abstract political interest hardened into a vocational steel. She knew she wouldn\u2019t just study cities; she would help them function.\n\n3.\nIt was just a new bus shelter on a dreary stretch of Geary, but it was *her* project. A junior analyst, she\u2019d championed it for months. The first time she saw an elderly woman sitting on the bench, shielded from the rain while waiting for the 38, a fierce, protective pride surged through her. This small piece of concrete and plexiglass was tangible proof she could make a difference. It taught her that public service was built one small, essential victory at a time.\n\n4.\nHer first night alone in the Hayes Valley condo was not lonely. From her window, she watched the 21-Hayes bus exhale passengers under a streetlight, its brake lights painting the room red. After years in the quiet of Noe Valley, the city's hum wasn't noise; it was a lullaby of connection. Selling the house had been an ending, but this felt like an arrival. She had finally moved into the very heart of the life she had worked so hard to build for others, and now, for herself.\n\n5.\nOn a packed 21-Hayes last winter, a young mother struggled with a stroller as an elderly man boarded with a walker. Without a word, a tech worker in headphones and a student with a portfolio instinctively shifted, creating a perfect path. Katherine watched the silent, fluid choreography of strangers making space for each other. It was a fleeting, beautiful moment of civic grace. It reminded her that beyond the budgets and meetings, this is what she works for: a system that allows for shared humanity."
