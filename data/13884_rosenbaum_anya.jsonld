Raised in Oakland's Rockridge neighborhood, she is the daughter of a Polish immigrant mother, a graphic designer with a love for bold colors, and a second-generation Jewish-American father, a pragmatic architect who taught her to see the bones of a city. Her childhood was a blend of pierogi-making for Christmas and lighting the menorah for Hanukkah, an upbringing that instilled in her a deep appreciation for how disparate cultures can coexist and enrich a single community.\n\nWitnessing the rapid gentrification of Oakland and San Francisco during the 2010s tech boom was the key turning point in her young life. It transformed her passive appreciation for cities into an active mission. Her undergraduate and graduate studies in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley were less an academic choice and more a calling to understand the forces shaping her home.\n\nNow 26, Anya works as a policy analyst for a non-profit that consults with the city on housing and public space initiatives. Her $95,000 salary affords her a life of deliberate choices in a notoriously expensive city. She lives in a small, rent-controlled studio in Hayes Valley, filled with plants and books on urban theory. Her 1.1-mile walk to her SoMa office is a cherished daily ritual, a ground-level survey of the city she\u2019s trying to improve. She observes new parklets, counts vacant storefronts, and greets the unhoused residents on her route by name.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight circle of grad school friends who share her passion for civic engagement, often meeting for cheap noodles in the Mission or trivia nights at a Divisadero bar. Anya dreams of a San Francisco that can solve its housing crisis without sacrificing its soul. She hopes to eventually lead a major project, perhaps a new model for mixed-income public housing. While she is deeply connected to the city, she battles a persistent fear that the very economic and political systems she works within are too entrenched to allow for the radical, equitable change she believes is necessary."

Her father would point at a Craftsman bungalow, explaining the beauty of its low-pitched roof and exposed rafters\u2014its \"good bones.\" Seconds later, her mother would gesture to the same house, thrilled by the clashing colors of the trim and the resident\u2019s wildly overgrown lavender bush. It was the first time Anya understood that a home, and a city, was both a structure to be analyzed and a living, breathing canvas of human expression.\n\n2.\nThe memory that haunts her is the \"For Lease\" sign that appeared on the door of her favorite Rockridge used bookstore. She was sixteen. The owner, a man with ink-stained fingers, told her the rent had tripled. The loss felt visceral, like a personal theft. It wasn't just a store; it was the smell of aging paper and the repository of neighborhood stories. This quiet erasure transformed her teenage angst into a focused anger, a feeling that would later fuel her entire academic and professional career.\n\n3.\nDuring her first year at Berkeley, a professor assigned them to map the \"informal economies\" of West Oakland. Anya, 19, spent a Saturday talking to a woman selling tamales from a cooler and a man who organized a network of can collectors. She saw not blight, but a resilient, intricate system of survival and community. It was a humbling moment that shattered any top-down, academic arrogance. She vowed then to always see the people first, and the policy second.\n\n4.\nLast winter, on her walk to work, she gave a new pair of wool socks to Marcus, a man who shelters near the Federal Building. He looked at her, his eyes clear and tired, and told her it was his daughter\u2019s birthday. The simple, devastating humanity of that moment cut through all her data sets and policy briefs. It became a grounding truth: her work wasn't about housing units or zoning codes, but about creating a city where a father could see his daughter on her birthday.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, Anya attended the opening of a small parklet her non-profit helped design in SoMa. She watched as two neighbors, who she knew had bitterly argued at the planning meetings, shared a laugh over a cup of coffee. For a fleeting moment, the victory felt immense\u2014a tangible piece of community she helped build. The feeling was immediately followed by a wave of anxiety, thinking of the vast, systemic problems that tiny space couldn't fix. This whiplash of hope and dread has since become her constant companion."
