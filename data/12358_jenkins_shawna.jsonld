Raised primarily by her grandmother, Mae, after her own mother struggled with instability, Shawna learned the meaning of resilience and community from an early age. The Fillmore of her youth was a neighborhood of shared meals, front-stoop conversations, and looking out for one another\u2014a stark contrast to the city she navigates today.\n\nHer educational path was practical, not privileged. After high school, Shawna felt adrift, working odd jobs without a clear direction. The turning point came when Mae\u2019s health began to fail. Shawna, then in her early twenties, became her grandmother\u2019s primary caregiver. This challenging, intimate experience was a baptism by fire. She discovered a deep-seated calling in the quiet acts of providing comfort and dignity. After Mae passed, Shawna channeled her grief into purpose, earning her Home Health Aide certification. It wasn\u2019t a glamorous career, but it was one of profound meaning.\n\nNow at 40, Shawna\u2019s life is a testament to quiet fortitude. Her day begins before sunrise, catching the 22-Fillmore bus for the 3.8-mile commute to her client\u2019s home in a quieter, leafier part of the city. For $52,000 a year, she provides essential care for an elderly artist with dementia, helping with everything from medication to simply being a calm, familiar presence. It\u2019s emotionally taxing work, but Shawna sees it as honoring her grandmother\u2019s memory.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from her church and neighborhood. They are her chosen family, a source of laughter and support who understand the struggle of staying afloat in an increasingly expensive city. Shawna feels a bittersweet love for San Francisco; she mourns the loss of the Black-owned businesses and families of her youth but remains fiercely loyal to the city\u2019s underlying soul. Her dream isn\u2019t grand\u2014it\u2019s to one day secure a small condo in a BMR (Below Market Rate) program and start a community garden in a neglected neighborhood lot. For Shawna, planting roots, both literally and figuratively, is the ultimate aspiration."

A saxophonist played on the corner, his notes weaving through the neighborhood chatter. Mae hummed along, her hand resting on Shawna\u2019s shoulder, a silent promise that she was safe, that she belonged. That feeling of unconditional community became the bedrock of her soul, the standard against which she measures what it means to be home.\n\n2.\nIn her early twenties, during the hardest weeks, she would sit by Mae\u2019s bed and gently brush her thin, silver hair. Mae could no longer speak much, but her eyes would follow Shawna\u2019s every move. In one of those quiet moments, Mae squeezed her hand, a flicker of the strong woman she once was. It wasn\u2019t a moment of healing, but of profound connection. Shawna realized then that providing dignity was a sacred act, a purpose she could build her life upon.\n\n3.\nLast year, her client, lost in the fog of dementia, suddenly picked up a charcoal pencil. For fifteen minutes, he drew with a clarity she hadn't seen in months, sketching a woman's hands\u2014calloused and gentle, resting on a hymnal. The hands were Mae\u2019s. Shawna watched, tears welling, feeling her purpose affirmed. In these small acts of care, she wasn't just working a job; she was actively honoring the memory of the woman who raised her.\n\n4.\nAfter a grueling week a few months ago, she went to a potluck at her friend Delia\u2019s apartment. The room was loud, full of laughter over shared plates of mac and cheese and collard greens. They complained about rent and unruly MUNI buses, but the gripes were wrapped in a deep, shared understanding. In that crowded room, Shawna felt her exhaustion melt away. This was her Fillmore now\u2014a chosen family holding each other up, finding joy within the struggle.\n\n5.\nOn her bus ride home one evening, she noticed it: a small, forgotten lot wedged between two buildings, choked with weeds but getting good afternoon sun. She found herself mentally clearing the debris, picturing neat rows of tomatoes and lavender. The image stuck with her, a seed of possibility. It wasn\u2019t just about a garden; it was about reclaiming a piece of the city for beauty and nourishment. That simple, concrete vision became her quiet rebellion, her hope for planting new roots."
