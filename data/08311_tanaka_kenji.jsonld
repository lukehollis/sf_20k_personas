            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is a man shaped by the quiet hum of technology and the persistent coastal fog of his Bay Area home. A third-generation Japanese-American, he grew up not in San Francisco proper, but in the neighboring suburbs of Daly City. His father was a mechanic, his mother a department store clerk, and their home was a place of practicality and modesty. From a young age, Kenji wasn't drawn to his father's greasy engines but to the clean, logical world inside radios and game consoles. He was the kid who took things apart just to see how they worked, often successfully reassembling them.\n\nForegoing a traditional four-year university, Kenji enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. This practical education landed him his first job as a helpdesk technician during the exhilarating peak of the dot-com boom. The subsequent bust was his key turning point. After being laid off from a flashy startup that promised the world and delivered nothing, a disillusioned Kenji vowed to prioritize stability over hype. He found it in corporate IT, methodically working his way up over two decades to his current role as a Senior IT Support Specialist.\n\nNow 43, Kenji lives a contained and orderly life in a one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his dining table doubles as his office, the glow of multiple monitors illuminating his face from 9 to 5. His daily routine is a comforting ritual: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and a croissant, a day spent troubleshooting complex network issues for a downtown tech firm, and an evening unwinding by restoring vintage audio equipment.\n\nSocially, Kenji maintains a small circle of old work friends, meeting for ramen or a drink every few weeks. He's a familiar, quiet face in his neighborhood, but a private man. His greatest connection to San Francisco is through its green spaces; he spends weekends exploring the trails of Golden Gate Park and Lands End, feeling a sense of peace in the nature buffering the city's chaos. His dream isn't corporate advancement but to one day open a small, specialized shop dedicated to repairing and selling the vintage amplifiers he so lovingly restores, trading the digital world for the warm crackle of analog sound."
