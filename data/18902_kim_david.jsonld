Born in Seoul, he was adopted as an infant by a loving white couple\u2014a librarian and a history professor in Sacramento. They instilled in him a deep reverence for the written word. Growing up in a house overflowing with books, David\u2019s path toward journalism felt preordained. He graduated from San Francisco State University in the early 90s, just as the golden age of print journalism was beginning to tarnish.\n\nHis early career was a grind at a regional paper, chasing down city council stories and writing obituaries. The real turning point came in 1998. Seeing the digital tide sweeping in, he made a pragmatic pivot, taking a job as a content editor for a burgeoning tech website in San Francisco. It was a move that saved his career. He survived the dot-com bust and steadily climbed the ladder through various online media firms, eventually landing his current role as a Senior Editor, where he manages a team that curates technical information for a large online platform.\n\nDavid\u2019s personal life is a quiet counterpoint to his dynamic career. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its fog-laced tranquility and vibrant Clement Street markets. His daily commute is a ritual: a 2.5-mile MUNI ride with a book in hand. The city holds the ghost of his longest relationship, a twelve-year partnership that dissolved amicably a decade ago, leaving him single but not necessarily lonely. He maintains a close circle of friends, mostly fellow industry veterans who share his gallows humor about the ever-changing media landscape.\n\nNow at 53, David feels a sense of stability mixed with a quiet yearning. The $135,000 salary affords him comfort, but the corporate nature of his work lacks the civic purpose he once cherished in journalism. His quiet aspiration is to write a book\u2014not a novel, but a sharp, insightful memoir about his adoption and the search for identity, interwoven with the story of media\u2019s own chaotic transformation. He dreams of creating something permanent in a career defined by the ephemeral."

He explained that 'Kim' was a gift from his birth country, a thread connecting him to a story that began before them. David felt a strange mix of pride and otherness, a feeling that would become the quiet engine of his life's curiosity. It was the first time he understood his identity was a book with two authors.\n**(Circa 1978)**\n\n2.\nHe stood on a SOMA street in 1998, the stale air of the newsroom still clinging to his jacket. In his hand was a job offer from the tech website. He saw his reflection in the startup\u2019s gleaming glass door\u2014a journalist about to trade his byline for a username. It felt like a necessary betrayal, a pragmatic choice for survival that saved his career but forever quieted a piece of his idealistic soul. He went inside and accepted the job.\n**(September 1998)**\n\n3.\nThey decided to end their twelve-year relationship on a bench at the Palace of Fine Arts. There were no shouts, only the quiet finality of their years together settling between them like the evening fog. He remembers tracing the pattern on her coat sleeve as she spoke, realizing this was the last time. It wasn't a failure, but a completion. It hollowed out a space in his heart that he learned to fill not with another person, but with the city itself.\n**(Spring 2014)**\n\n4.\nOn a foggy Tuesday last fall, the 38 Geary lurched to a stop. David looked up from his book and saw Clement Street completely swallowed by mist, the neon signs of the markets bleeding into the white. In that instant, cocooned in the bus's gentle rumble and the scent of damp wool coats, a profound sense of peace washed over him. He felt utterly, perfectly in place. This was his San Francisco\u2014not the skyline, but the quiet, foggy avenues of home.\n**(October 2023)**\n\n5.\nIt was late one night last year, during a soul-crushing edit of a technical manual. He took a break, staring at his own reflection in the dark monitor. He saw the faint outline of his Korean features, the name 'Kim' on his corporate profile, and the ephemeral text he managed. Suddenly, it clicked: his story of adoption and media's story of transformation were the same\u2014a search for identity in a world of constant change. The quiet yearning finally had a title.\n**(November 2023)**"
