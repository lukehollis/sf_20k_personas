The only daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, perpetually struggling print shop in the Outer Sunset, Meena learned early that passion was a luxury, while security was currency. Her childhood was filled with the scents of ink and paper and the low hum of parental anxiety over bills.\n\nHer act of rebellion was quiet but firm: enrolling at San Francisco State University to study Art History. She fell in love with the bold strokes of the Abstract Expressionists and the quiet dignity of Song dynasty ceramics. For four years, she lived in a world of beauty and theory. Reality hit hard upon graduation. Faced with a poor job market for her specialty and her parents\u2019 deepening financial worries, she made a pivotal choice. She took an administrative job at a large insurance firm downtown, a world of actuarial tables and risk assessment that was the antithesis of a museum gallery.\n\nMethodical and detail-oriented, Meena excelled. She was promoted to claims adjuster, a role that suited her ability to find order in chaos and assess value with detached precision. A serious relationship with a musician fell apart during this time; his financial instability was a mirror of her childhood fears, reinforcing her decision to prioritize stability.\n\nNow, at 34, her commute is zero. The pandemic shifted her work home to her meticulously tidy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, and it stuck. Her days are a structured routine: logging in at 8:30 AM to analyze property damage claims, a precisely timed lunch, and a walk through Golden Gate Park after signing off. Her connection to San Francisco is sensory and solitary\u2014the fog rolling over Arguello, the taste of a pork bun from a Clement Street bakery. Her social circle is small, a few trusted friends from college.\n\nHer dream hasn't died, but it sleeps. On Saturdays, she volunteers as a docent at the de Young Museum, the Art History degree finding its voice again. Meena\u2019s aspiration isn\u2019t to quit her job, but to save enough to one day buy a single, beautiful piece of art from a local painter\u2014a tangible symbol that the pragmatic fortress she built might just have room for a window."
