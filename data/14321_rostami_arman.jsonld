Born in San Jose to Iranian immigrants who fled Tehran in the early 1980s, his childhood was a blend of his parents\u2019 deep love for Persian poetry and the pragmatic demands of Silicon Valley. His father, an electrical engineer, taught him that the most elegant solutions were often the simplest, a lesson Arman absorbed while dismantling and rebuilding toaster ovens in their garage. This innate curiosity for how things work guided him through his undergraduate degree at UC Davis and ultimately to a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford.\n\nHe deliberately bypassed the more volatile world of software startups, drawn instead to the tangible, physical challenges of robotics in manufacturing. Over a decade, he rose from a junior designer to a Principal Engineer at a cutting-edge firm in the Dogpatch. He now leads a team developing sophisticated robotic arms for automated assembly lines, a job that provides the intellectual stimulation he craves.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago. The intense focus required to climb the corporate ladder had contributed to the painful end of a long-term relationship. The breakup was a stark realization that while he had meticulously engineered his career, his personal life was neglected. This prompted a shift in his priorities. He sold his car and bought a high-end commuter bicycle, turning his 3.5-mile ride to work into a cherished daily ritual.\n\nToday, Arman\u2019s life is one of structured balance. He lives in a clean, minimalist condo in the Inner Richmond, chosen for its proximity to Golden Gate Park. Weekdays are for problem-solving at work, while weekends are for long bike rides across the Golden Gate Bridge or exploring the city\u2019s farmers' markets. He maintains a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow engineers and old university peers.\n\nWhile proud of his career, Arman\u2019s aspirations are now broader. He dreams of eventually starting his own consulting firm focused on sustainable manufacturing technologies. On a personal level, he hopes to find a partner who shares his appreciation for both quiet ambition and simple joys, aiming to build a future as carefully and thoughtfully as he designs his award-winning robotic systems."

His dad pointed a screwdriver at a circuit board inside a dismantled toaster, quoting a line of Rumi about breaking open to find treasure. In that moment, Arman understood. Engineering wasn't just about logic; it was about finding the simple, poetic truth inside a complex system. This belief became the foundation of his entire career, a lesson learned between spare parts and ancient verse.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe silence after she left was an engineering problem he couldn't solve. It was five years ago. He stood in the living room of his perfectly minimalist condo, a space designed for two, and felt its stark emptiness for the first time. The calculated order of his life felt hollow, a successful project with a fatal design flaw. The ache of that loneliness was a powerful catalyst, forcing him to admit that a well-lived life couldn't be engineered on a schematic; it had to be felt.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe first ride to work wasn't about exercise; it was an act of reclamation. Cresting the top of Potrero Hill, the cool morning fog on his skin, he felt his own power propel him forward. The rhythmic whir of the bicycle chain was a mantra, quieting the static in his head. Looking down at the Dogpatch workshops below, he wasn't just commuting; he was choosing a slower, more deliberate path. That daily ride became his non-negotiable ritual for clarity and peace, a physical anchor in a digital world.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was 2 AM in the lab, two years ago. After weeks of troubleshooting, he ran the final diagnostic. The new robotic arm, his design, moved with an impossible, silent grace, its multi-jointed limb flowing through a complex sequence as if it were dancing. He didn\u2019t see code or mechanics; he saw poetry in motion. It was the elegant, simple solution his father always spoke of, and a wave of profound pride washed over him. He wasn't just building machines; he was creating functional art.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe remembers standing at the Clement Street Farmers' Market last Sunday, the scent of kettle corn and fresh basil in the air. He wasn't rushing or planning, just watching a child marvel at a pile of heirloom tomatoes. A quiet contentment settled over him, a feeling of being perfectly in place. This simple, unstructured joy\u2014so different from the thrill of solving a complex equation\u2014felt like a greater achievement. It was the balance he had intentionally built, one weekend, one market, one quiet moment at a time."
