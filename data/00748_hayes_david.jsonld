            "value": "David Hayes has always existed in the spaces in between. The son of a first-generation Chinese-American nurse and a white architect from the Midwest, he grew up in the fog-blanketed suburbs of Daly City. His childhood was a quiet negotiation of identity\u2014navigating his mother\u2019s Cantonese-speaking household and his father\u2019s more traditionally American one. This dual perspective made him a natural observer, someone keenly aware of the subtle codes and connections that bind communities, and the invisible lines that divide them.\n\nHis path became clearer at UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Sociology. While his peers were drawn to tech internships or corporate recruiting events, David found his purpose volunteering at a West Oakland food pantry. The experience was a turning point. It wasn't just about handing out cans of food; it was about hearing the stories, seeing the systemic fractures up close, and witnessing the profound impact of organized compassion. The abstract theories from his lectures suddenly had faces, names, and urgent needs. He knew then that his work would be on the ground, not in a classroom or a cubicle.\n\nUpon graduating, David accepted a position as a Community Outreach Coordinator for a non-profit in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin that provides supportive housing and resources for formerly unhoused individuals. The job came with a unique perk: a small studio apartment in the same building, making his commute exactly zero miles. His life and work are deeply intertwined. His days consist of checking in on residents, organizing workshops on financial literacy, and coordinating street outreach to connect people with services.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow non-profit workers and volunteers who share his idealism and exhaustion. They decompress with cheap pho in the Richmond District or by escaping the city for hikes in Marin. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand or naive; he hopes to develop a resident-led mentorship program within his organization, empowering the community to support itself. He sees the city\u2019s glaring contradictions every day, but he has chosen to live and work at their epicenter, believing that meaningful change is built not from the top down, but from one human connection to the next."
