Raised in Oakland, his home was a blend of Shinto shrines and Hanukkah menorahs, of quiet introspection and boisterous intellectual debate. From a young age, Kai learned to be a bridge, navigating the beautiful complexities of his dual heritage. This role as a cultural translator sparked his fascination with how people connect and communicate.\n\nThe definitive turning point came during his turbulent adolescence when his parents\u2019 marriage frayed. Witnessing them use therapy not as a last resort but as a tool to rebuild their connection demystified the process for Kai. He saw its power to foster understanding and heal rifts, inspiring him to pursue a path where he could facilitate that same growth for others. After earning his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, he enrolled in a graduate program for Counseling Psychology at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow, at 28, Kai is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist working for a community health organization contracted with the SF Unified School District. His days are spent at a bustling Mission District high school, helping teenagers and their families navigate issues ranging from academic pressure to complex trauma. His own mixed-race background gives him a unique empathy for students grappling with their own identities in one of America\u2019s most diverse cities.\n\nKai lives in a small but bright apartment in the Inner Sunset. His commute is a daily ritual on the N-Judah line, a 2.5-mile journey that allows him to decompress with a podcast before and after emotionally taxing days. He finds solace in long, foggy runs through Golden Gate Park and in his tight-knit circle of friends from grad school, with whom he shares potlucks and hiking trips. Recently out of a long-term relationship, he\u2019s applying his professional tools to his own life, focusing on self-compassion and what he truly wants in a partner. His dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on serving interracial couples and multiracial youth, creating a space for others to find harmony in their own beautiful complexities."

His father was lighting the Hanukkah candles, the Hebrew blessing a familiar, low chant in their Oakland living room. In the same moment, his mother placed a small, perfect pyramid of mochi at the family\u2019s kamidana shrine. He saw no contradiction, only a warm, glowing peace. That quiet moment became his internal compass, a foundational memory of how disparate parts could create a beautiful, harmonious whole\u2014a feeling he\u2019s chased ever since.\n\n2.\nHe was sixteen, hiding in his room, anticipating the tense silence that usually followed his parents\u2019 return from their weekly appointment. Instead, he heard them talking in the kitchen. His father said, \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying,\u201d and his mother replied, softly, \u201cThank you for listening.\u201d That simple exchange landed with the force of a revelation. He realized therapy wasn't a place of blame, but a tool for translation. In watching them rebuild their bridge, he found the blueprint for his own life\u2019s work.\n\n3.\nLast year, a quiet Salvadoran-Filipino freshman confessed she felt like a \u201cglitch\u201d in both her family\u2019s communities. Kai saw his own teenage reflection in her eyes. Resisting the urge to offer a textbook solution, he just said, \u201cI get it. My home had a menorah and a Shinto shrine.\u201d The girl\u2019s shoulders dropped an inch in relief, a tiny, seismic shift of being seen. It was the first time Kai truly understood that his own complicated identity wasn't a challenge to overcome, but the very key to unlocking connection.\n\n4.\nThree months ago, the final conversation with his partner wasn\u2019t a fight, just a shared, sad admission that their paths had diverged. The therapist in him wanted to analyze and fix it, but the man just felt the profound grief. In the quiet of his Inner Sunset apartment afterward, he began asking himself the same questions he poses to his students: \u201cWhat do you need right now? How can you show yourself compassion?\u201d It was the painful, necessary beginning of turning his professional tools inward, learning to heal himself.\n\n5.\nJust last week, after a brutal session involving a student's family trauma, the weight felt unbearable. He got off the N-Judah and ran straight into Golden Gate Park, pushing himself into the thick, damp fog. The rhythm of his feet on the path was a steady mantra. His lungs burned. As he passed the Conservatory of Flowers, a ghostly white silhouette in the mist, he felt the day\u2019s vicarious pain finally dissolve into the cool air. This run, this fog\u2014it was his own therapy, how he washed the world off to find himself again."
