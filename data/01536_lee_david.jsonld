The son of a Korean immigrant father and a second-generation Mexican-American mother, he grew up behind the counter of his family\u2019s struggling laundromat. He saw firsthand the brutal realities of small business\u2014slim margins, long hours, and the constant threat of being squeezed out. This upbringing gave him a practical business acumen that formal education could never replicate. He was sharp but disengaged in school, finding textbooks abstract compared to the tangible profit-and-loss statements he helped his parents decipher.\n\nAfter a single, uninspired semester at a community college, he dropped out. At 22, armed with raw ambition and a small loan from his parents, David launched a tech startup: a logistics app designed to help small, local businesses like his family\u2019s compete with larger chains. It was a spectacular failure. Within two years, he was broke, having learned a brutal lesson in cash flow, marketing, and scaling. This failure became his true degree, the most expensive and valuable education he ever received.\n\nHumbled but not broken, David started offering informal advice to other small business owners. He built a reputation as a \"fixer\" who understood the street-level problems most consultants missed. His success stories, passed through word-of-mouth, eventually reached a boutique management consulting firm that valued his real-world scar tissue over a pristine MBA.\n\nNow 32, David lives in a sleek SoMa apartment that doubles as his office, his 0.0-mile commute a symbol of the life he built. His days are a disciplined blur of client calls, data analysis, and strategy decks, fueled by coffee from a local roaster. He remains disconnected from his family\u2019s past, but it quietly drives him. His social circle is small, curated from the wreckage of his first startup. He hopes to one day launch his own venture fund, specifically for first-generation founders and college dropouts\u2014a way to legitimize his own journey by paving the way for others like him. San Francisco isn't his hometown, but a landscape of reinvention where his unorthodox past became his greatest asset."
