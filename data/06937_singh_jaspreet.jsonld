Born in Tracy to hardworking Punjabi Sikh immigrants, his childhood was steeped in the values of community and service, yet framed by the Central Valley\u2019s suburban aspiration for material success. His father, a long-haul truck driver, and his mother, a cannery worker, dreamed of their son becoming an engineer or a doctor\u2014a path of tangible, secure prosperity. Jaspreet initially tried to follow this path, enrolling in pre-med at UC Davis.\n\nA volunteer position at a Sacramento shelter during his sophomore year became the definitive turning point. He spent hours listening to the stories of unhoused individuals, seeing not just their immediate needs but the systemic failures that led them there. The experience resonated more deeply than any biology lecture. He changed his major and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, a choice that caused friction with his well-meaning parents.\n\nNow 36, Jaspreet\u2019s commute is non-existent because his life and work are one. He is a residential case manager at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin, living in a small apartment within the same building as his clients. His days are a blur of crisis de-escalation, benefits paperwork, connecting residents to medical care, and simply being a consistent, stable presence in their often-chaotic lives. His social circle consists mainly of overworked colleagues and a few old friends from grad school who understand the immense emotional toll of his profession. Past romantic relationships have withered under the demands of a job that is never truly \u201coff.\u201d\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or scenic vistas, but of the city's raw, vulnerable heart. He sees resilience and humanity where others see despair. His dream is not for personal wealth but for a future where his job is less about crisis management and more about holistic support. He quietly hopes that one day he might find the capacity for a life beyond the building\u2019s walls, but for now, his purpose is found within them, offering a steady hand in the center of the storm."
