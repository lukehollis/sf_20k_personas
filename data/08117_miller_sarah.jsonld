The only child of a logger and a schoolteacher, her upbringing was a paradox of resource extraction and deep appreciation for nature. While her father taught her to read the grain of a fallen Douglas fir, her mother taught her the names of the wildflowers that grew in its shadow. This duality shaped her profoundly, steering her away from activism and towards systemic, practical solutions.\n\nShe pursued this path at Oregon State University, earning a Master of Forestry. Her early career involved managing timberland for a private company, where she grew frustrated by the industry\u2019s slow adoption of sustainable practices. The turning point came in the late 90s, when she saw the burgeoning tech industry\u2019s massive, yet unexamined, environmental footprint. She realized the next frontier for conservation wasn't in the forest, but in the server farm. She moved to San Francisco, retooled her expertise, and carved out a niche as an environmental consultant for tech giants.\n\nNow, at 50, Sarah\u2019s life is one of quiet influence. From her meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Sunset, she commands a 0.0-mile commute to her home office. Her days are a blur of video calls with engineering teams in Cupertino and executives in Seattle, advising on everything from supply chain ethics to data center water usage. A amicable divorce a decade ago left her with a sharp sense of independence and a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow consultants and artists she met through neighborhood pottery classes.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is rooted in its proximity to nature. Most mornings begin with a run through the foggy trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her head before a day of corporate wrangling. Her dream isn't retirement, but legacy. She aspires to develop an open-source framework that becomes the industry standard for environmental accountability. On a more personal level, she hopes to one day buy a small, logged-over parcel of land back in Oregon\u2014not as an escape, but as a personal project, to reforest it herself, bringing her life\u2019s work full circle."
