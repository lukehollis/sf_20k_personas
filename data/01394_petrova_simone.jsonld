            "value": "Simone Petrova is a product of unspoken histories. The only child of Bulgarian immigrants, she grew up in the quiet suburbs of Sacramento, where her parents\u2019 love was expressed through hard work and provision, not words. Her father, a stoic mechanic, and her mother, a meticulous house cleaner, carried the weight of their past in their silences. It was in these quiet spaces that Simone learned to listen, becoming acutely sensitive to the emotions people tried to hide. This innate empathy steered her away from the practical careers her parents hoped for and toward the complexities of the human mind.\n\nHer journey to San Francisco began with an acceptance letter from San Francisco State University for their Master of Social Work program. After earning her undergraduate degree in sociology at UC Davis, the city represented a vibrant, chaotic universe where every story felt valued. She paid her dues working in a grueling community mental health clinic in the Mission District, witnessing the profound struggles of the city's most vulnerable. The experience was harrowing but solidified her calling. It was there, helping a young woman navigate generational trauma, that Simone saw the monumental impact of simply being heard.\n\nNow, at 35, Simone is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) with her own private practice, which she runs from a converted office in her Inner Richmond apartment\u2014hence the zero-mile commute. Her days are structured and serene. Mornings begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear her mind before she holds space for others via telehealth appointments. She specializes in anxiety and the unique pressures facing first-generation professionals.\n\nHer social life is a small, carefully-tended garden of close friends, mostly fellow therapists who understand the need for strong emotional boundaries. Simone loves her neighborhood for its tranquility and proximity to the park. She dreams of one day leading workshops and writing about intergenerational communication, hoping to give others the tools she never had growing up. For now, she finds fulfillment in her role as a quiet anchor, helping her clients navigate the turbulent waters of their own lives against the backdrop of a city that is constantly reinventing itself."
