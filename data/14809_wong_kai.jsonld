Raised by a pragmatic, first-generation Chinese-American father who worked as a civil engineer and an expressive, Caucasian mother who taught art history, Kai grew up navigating the space between two worlds: the logical and the creative. This duality defined his path.\n\nInitially, he pursued a computer science degree at UC Davis, appeasing his father\u2019s desire for a stable career. However, he spent his nights and weekends creating digital art and collaborating with performing arts students. The pull of the arts was undeniable. In a pivotal decision that caused friction at home, Kai pivoted, enrolling in an MFA in Digital Media program. It was there he found his true calling: not just building technology, but using it as a medium for storytelling and human connection.\n\nHis career began with freelance gigs for small galleries and music festivals, translating abstract concepts into interactive light installations and augmented reality experiences. His breakthrough came when he was hired by a major creative agency that designed immersive experiences for museums and high-end hospitality brands. Now, as a Creative Technology Director, Kai leads teams that build everything from generative art for Michelin-starred restaurants to interactive historical exhibits. His income affords him a comfortable life, but he\u2019s more proud of making technology feel magical rather than utilitarian.\n\nKai\u2019s daily routine is grounded in his Mission District neighborhood. He starts his day with a 2.5-mile bicycle commute, a moving meditation through the city\u2019s arteries. He shares a restored Victorian flat with his partner, Lena, a landscape architect. Their social life is a blend of gallery openings, weekend hikes in the Headlands, and hosting dinner parties.\n\nAt 41, Kai feels a growing desire to create work with a more permanent, public impact. His dream is to launch his own studio focused on creating large-scale, free-to-access digital art installations in overlooked city spaces, a way of giving back to the San Francisco that has shaped every facet of his identity."

On one side, his father unrolled a crisp blueprint, its sharp blue lines defining a bridge with cold precision. On the other, his mother worked on a canvas, a storm of thick, expressive reds and yellows. Kai sat perfectly in the middle, looking from one to the other, feeling not like a child of two people, but like the silent, empty space between two completely different worlds. It was the first time he understood his life\u2019s work would be to build a bridge between them.\n\n2.\nThe hardest conversation of his life was over dim sum with his father. As Kai explained his plan to abandon computer science for an art degree, he watched his father\u2019s calloused hands, hands that built structures to last centuries, carefully pick up a piece of har gow. His dad didn\u2019t yell. He just said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to struggle like we did.\u201d The quiet disappointment was worse than anger. In that moment, Kai felt the full weight of his decision, a painful but necessary tearing away to build a life that felt true.\n\n3.\nHis first major freelance gig was a light installation for a small festival in Golden Gate Park. He\u2019d spent weeks coding strands of LEDs to \"breathe\" in unison with a soundscape. Exhausted and nervous, he watched from the shadows as a small crowd gathered. A couple reached out, their hands hovering just above the glowing orbs, their faces full of wonder. It wasn\u2019t applause Kai felt, but a deep, quiet click of confirmation inside him. This was it. This was connection. His risky choice had been right.\n\n4.\nIt was on a windswept trail in the Marin Headlands, looking back at the city. Lena was explaining how she\u2019d chosen specific native grasses for a project to restore a patch of coastline. As she spoke, Kai saw the parallel to his own work: both of them were using a logical system\u2014ecology for her, code for him\u2014to create something that felt wild, natural, and alive. He looked from her earnest face to the Golden Gate Bridge, a feat of his father\u2019s world, and felt a profound sense of peace. He\u2019d finally synthesized his two halves.\n\n5.\nThe vision struck him on his daily bike commute down Valencia. He glanced down a graffiti-scarred alley he passed every morning, but this time he saw something else. He pictured a cascade of digital light, a waterfall of generative patterns flowing down the grimy brick, shifting with the sounds of the Mission. Pedestrians would stop, mesmerized. It was a sudden, overwhelming certainty. This was his next act: not making magic for exclusive clients, but embedding it, free for all, in the very arteries of the city that made him."
