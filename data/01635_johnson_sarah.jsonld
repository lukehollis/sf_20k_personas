Born and raised in Daly City, she was a child of the Bay Area\u2019s working-class suburbs, where fog-dampened mornings were a given and financial security was not. Her father was a mechanic with perpetually grease-stained hands, and her mother a waitress who taught Sarah the value of a tireless work ethic. For Sarah, high school was a finish line, not a starting block; college was an abstract concept, a luxury her family couldn't entertain.\n\nHer calling to healthcare was not discovered in a classroom but forged in the crucible of family crisis. When her own mother\u2019s health declined rapidly in her late twenties, Sarah stepped in as her primary caregiver. The experience was grueling but revealed in her a deep well of patience and compassion. After her mother passed, she channeled this newfound purpose into a career, earning a certificate to become a home health aide.\n\nFor years, Sarah commuted across the Bay, working long, draining shifts in various care facilities. The turning point arrived fifteen years ago, with an offer that would redefine her life: a live-in position caring for Eleanor Vance, an elderly widow in a quiet, pastel-colored house in San Francisco's Outer Richmond district. The 0.0-mile commute was a financial lifeline, allowing her to save money in an impossibly expensive city.\n\nToday, Sarah's world is largely contained within the walls of Eleanor\u2019s home. Her daily routine is a quiet rhythm of administering medication, preparing meals, and offering companionship. Her personal life is modest but treasured: solitary walks to Ocean Beach to feel the cold spray on her face, brief chats with the owner of the corner market, and weekly phone calls with her sister in Sacramento. She is an invisible but essential thread in the neighborhood's fabric, the quiet woman seen pushing a wheelchair along the sidewalk on sunny afternoons.\n\nSarah doesn't dream of travel or wealth. Her deepest aspiration is for a small, rent-controlled studio of her own, a space where she can finally clock out and be surrounded by her own silence. Until then, her primary hope is simpler and more selfless: to ensure the woman she cares for lives her final years with dignity, comfort, and the profound peace of being looked after."
