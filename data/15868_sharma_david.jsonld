His parents chased the American dream through the city\u2019s working-class veins; his father drove a Yellow Cab for three decades, and his mother worked the early shift at a donut shop in the Excelsior. Their lives were a testament to relentless hard work for modest returns, a lesson David internalized early on.\n\nSchool was a challenge for David. He was bright but restless, more interested in the mechanics of a car engine than Shakespeare. After graduating from high school, he bypassed college, feeling the immediate pressure to earn. He drifted for several years through a series of unfulfilling jobs\u2014stocking shelves at a Safeway, working in a warehouse south of Market\u2014feeling the precariousness of life without a clear path. The turning point came at 25, when his uncle, a longtime Muni bus driver, told him about an opening for light rail operators. The stability, the union benefits, and the pension were a world away from his hourly gigs.\n\nThe rigorous training to become a Muni Metro operator gave David a purpose he\u2019d never had. For the past 16 years, the rhythmic rocking of the N-Judah and K-Ingleside lines has been the soundtrack to his life. From his operator's cabin, he has a unique vantage point on the city he calls home, witnessing its morning rush, its late-night loneliness, and its ever-changing cast of characters.\n\nNow 41, David leads a quiet, steady life in his Outer Sunset apartment, just a short M-line ride from the Muni Metro East facility. He is single, finding his main social connections within his \"work family\"\u2014the other operators and mechanics he shares early morning coffees and late-night grievances with. He feels a deep, protective love for San Francisco, the kind that comes from seeing its flaws up close every day. His dream isn't of wealth or fame, but of ownership: saving enough to one day buy a small condo in his neighborhood. More than anything, he aspires to a life of continued stability, content in his essential role as part of the city\u2019s circulatory system, keeping the heart of San Francisco moving."

The city lights of San Francisco smeared into golden streaks through the window, a world away from the grit he saw during the day. His father was exhausted and silent, but David felt an immense, quiet pride radiating from the driver's seat. It wasn\u2019t a glamorous job, but he saw the dignity in it\u2014the simple, essential act of keeping the city moving. That feeling planted a seed of purpose he wouldn't understand for years.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt 23, he was stocking shelves on the graveyard shift at a Safeway. Through the big front windows, he\u2019d watch the last N-Judah train of the night glide by, its windows filled with tired faces heading home. He felt a profound pang of being stuck\u2014a ghost in a fluorescent aisle while the rest of the city was in motion, going somewhere. That image of the train, a vessel of purpose slicing through the fog, became a symbol of the stable, meaningful life that felt impossibly out of reach.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis hands were slick with sweat during his first solo run on the K-Ingleside line. As he navigated the turn at West Portal station, the weight of the steel and the hundreds of lives behind him felt immense. Then, a kid in the front window, no older than six, waved at him with pure, unadulterated joy. David waved back, and in that small exchange, the terror melted away. He wasn't just an operator; he was a part of someone's city experience. The responsibility suddenly felt less like a burden and more like an honor.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was the morning after a major storm, barely 5 a.m. at the Metro East facility. Trees were down, service was a mess, and the mood was tense. His uncle, finishing his own shift, simply handed him a thermos of hot, sweet chai, just like his mother used to make. \"Gonna be a long one,\" his uncle grunted. The warmth spread through David's hands, a silent acknowledgment of their shared duty. It was then he truly understood his \u201cwork family\u201d\u2014a bond forged in pre-dawn coffee and the collective burden of the city.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last month, he stood on Ocean Beach, watching the waves crash under a typically gray sky. He had just transferred another thousand dollars into his condo savings account. It wasn't a huge amount, but it was his\u2014earned dollar by dollar, stop by stop, from the Embarcadero to the Zoo. He felt a deep, protective love for the city in that moment, for its flaws and its fog-swept beauty. His dream wasn't to conquer San Francisco, but to finally, officially, own a small piece of it."
