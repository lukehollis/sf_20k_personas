            "value": "Aiko Tanaka is a third-generation Japanese-American, a Sansei whose life has been a quiet rebellion against the pragmatism of her upbringing. Raised in San Mateo by Nisei parents who valued stability above all\u2014a response to the trauma of their own parents' internment\u2014Aiko was pushed toward a sensible, lucrative career. Her father was an accountant, her mother a dental hygienist, and they envisioned a similar path for their daughter.\n\nThe turning point came at nineteen when her older brother, Kenji, died after a swift, brutal battle with leukemia. Aiko witnessed not just her family\u2019s grief, but the systemic coldness of a healthcare system that treated the disease but not the people. It was in sterile hospital hallways, watching social workers offer small measures of comfort, that she found her calling. Rejecting her parents\u2019 plan for law school, she enrolled at UC Berkeley for sociology and later earned her Master of Social Work from SF State, specializing in clinical healthcare.\n\nHer career has been dedicated to navigating the emotional labyrinths of chronic illness and end-of-life care. This demanding path took a toll on her marriage in her thirties; her ex-husband, a tech entrepreneur, could never grasp why she brought the weight of her patients\u2019 worlds home with her. The amicable divorce solidified her independence.\n\nNow, at 53, Aiko lives a purposefully contained life in her tidy Inner Richmond condo, just blocks from Golden Gate Park. Her 0.0-mile commute is a blessing of the modern world; her spare bedroom is a serene home office for telehealth sessions with patients. Her days are structured: green tea and meditation at dawn, followed by back-to-back virtual appointments, and a mandatory lunchtime walk through the park to decompress.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight circle of fellow healers and old friends. Her quiet aspiration is to one day travel to the small village in Kumamoto her grandparents left behind. In her free time, she practices kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold. For Aiko, mending the fractured pieces of a ceramic bowl is a perfect metaphor for her life\u2019s work: finding the beauty and strength in what has been broken."
