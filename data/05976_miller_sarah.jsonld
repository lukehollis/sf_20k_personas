Born to a Filipina mother, a nurse who arrived in the \u201870s, and a Tongan father who worked the city\u2019s construction sites, Sarah grew up in a vibrant, bustling household in the Excelsior District. Her childhood was a tapestry of languages, the scent of adobo and roasted pig, and the strong, supportive embrace of two distinct but overlapping immigrant communities.\n\nPressured by her practical-minded parents to find a stable career, Sarah dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College. She spent several years as an administrative assistant in a small downtown office, finding the work sterile and unfulfilling. A turning point came when she began volunteering for a story hour at her local library. Surrounded by the wonder and unfiltered honesty of young children, she found a sense of purpose that had been missing. She quit her office job, took the necessary certification courses, and became a preschool teacher\u2019s assistant.\n\nThe true anchor of Sarah\u2019s adult life is her home. After years on a waiting list, she secured a unit in a limited-equity housing cooperative in the Western Addition. This rare opportunity is the bedrock of her life in the expensive city. Her 0.0-mile commute is no error; she works at the co-op\u2019s own small, on-site preschool, a place that serves the families living in her building.\n\nHer daily routine is a comforting rhythm: preparing art supplies, shepherding toddlers through the shared community garden, and leading sing-alongs. Her social life is intertwined with her home, consisting of co-op potlucks, committee meetings, and casual chats with neighbors in the laundry room. Though she is single, her life is rich with connection.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn't of wealth, but of depth. She hopes to eventually earn her full teaching credential and become a lead teacher. More importantly, she wants to develop a curriculum that incorporates the stories and traditions of the diverse cultures within her co-op, ensuring the children she cares for see their own heritage reflected, just as her parents did for her. For Sarah, San Francisco is not a city of tech booms and tourist landmarks, but a collection of interconnected villages, and she is a steadfast keeper of her own."
