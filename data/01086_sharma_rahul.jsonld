Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents\u2014an engineer father and a school administrator mother\u2014his childhood was mapped out for him: excel in math and science, attend a top engineering school, and secure a stable, high-paying job in Silicon Valley. Rahul, however, was more interested in the \"why\" than the \"how.\" He spent his teenage years devouring philosophy and history, questioning the systems his parents swore by.\n\nIn a definitive break from the family plan, he enrolled at UC Davis to study Philosophy. His parents were dismayed, seeing it as an impractical and aimless pursuit. But for Rahul, learning to deconstruct complex arguments from Kant to Foucault was rigorous training. After graduating, he leveraged this unique skill set, landing a junior analyst role at a small San Francisco startup. He discovered that his ability to identify flawed logic and structure abstract problems was invaluable in the business world. He quickly outpaced his peers, moving from analyst to strategist and eventually into the high-stakes world of management consulting.\n\nNow 34, Rahul lives and works in a sleek Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to his desk. His days are a blur of international Zoom calls, data analysis, and crafting strategic roadmaps for corporations. His lifestyle is comfortable but solitary. He deconstructs his intense workdays with evening runs through the Panhandle or by grabbing a craft cocktail at a nearby bar, often alone with his thoughts.\n\nHis social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends from college, a welcome escape from his corporate persona. He feels a deep, if complicated, connection to San Francisco\u2014a city that rewards unconventional thinkers like him but also demands a relentless pace. Rahul\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He aspires to pivot his skills toward something with tangible impact, perhaps advising non-profits or joining an early-stage climatetech company. He\u2019s achieved the success his parents wanted for him, but on his own terms; now, he\u2019s searching for the meaning they warned him he\u2019d never find."
