Raised in the quiet, ordered suburbs of Fremont, she was the daughter of Indian immigrants who saw success through the stable lens of engineering and medicine. For years, Priya followed their map, enrolling at UC Berkeley with an undeclared major leaning towards economics. The turning point was not a single event, but a slow burn ignited in a class on the sociology of art. She saw how murals in Oakland\u2019s alleys and sculptures in public parks were not mere decorations, but declarations of identity, resistance, and community. This revelation was her true north.\n\nShe pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning, specializing in Community Arts Development, a degree that baffled her practical-minded parents until she landed her first role with a non-profit revitalizing community spaces in the Bayview. Her talent was in listening\u2014truly listening\u2014to what residents wanted their neighborhood to feel and look like. Now, at 34, she is a Senior Urban Planner for the city, a role she performs with fierce dedication from her light-filled apartment in Hayes Valley.\n\nHer zero-mile commute is a conscious choice. Her home is her sanctuary and office, a space filled with blueprints, local pottery, and a well-used yoga mat. A typical day involves Zoom calls with community boards, drafting proposals for public art installations in the Sunset District, and walking to a local cafe for a caffeine-fueled work session. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of artists, chefs, and activists\u2014her chosen family, with whom she explores new gallery openings and hikes the trails of the Presidio.\n\nWhile proud of her work securing funding for murals and performance spaces, Priya\u2019s dream is larger. She envisions a permanent, city-funded arts corridor in a historically overlooked neighborhood, a legacy project that would provide sustainable careers for local artists and become a landmark built on community vision. It's a complex, bureaucratic dream, but for Priya, it\u2019s the ultimate expression of her belief: that a city\u2019s soul is not found in its skyline, but in the art it nurtures on its streets."
