Raised in suburban Cleveland by an engineer father and a librarian mother, Rob inherited a dual appreciation for structure and knowledge. He arrived in California not for law, but for a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, an idealist hoping to design more equitable cities.\n\nThe turning point came during an internship with the city planning department. He saw brilliant proposals die on the vine, strangled by zoning laws and legal challenges. He realized that real power lay not in blueprints, but in the bylaws that governed them. This epiphany led him to Stanford Law, where he honed his idealism into a sharp legal mind. Foregoing the traditional path at a mega-firm, he and a partner founded a boutique practice specializing in high-stakes land use and real estate law.\n\nThe firm\u2019s success was immense, but it came at a personal cost, culminating in a quiet divorce over a decade ago. In the aftermath, Rob retreated into his work, moving into the sleek penthouse apartment directly above their SoMa offices. His commute became a 60-second elevator ride, a physical manifestation of his all-consuming career. His daily routine is a disciplined loop: a 5 AM session on his rowing machine overlooking the bay, a twelve-hour workday negotiating development deals, and a quiet evening with a book and a glass of Islay scotch.\n\nAt 54, the thrill of litigation has begun to fade, replaced by a contemplation of legacy. His relationship with his adult daughter, an architecture student in New York, is loving but conducted mostly over FaceTime, tinged with her gentle critiques of the corporate towers he helped erect. Rob is deeply connected to San Francisco; he can point out a dozen buildings and recount the courtroom victories that allowed their existence. Now, he nurses a quiet dream of pivoting, perhaps using his formidable skills pro-bono for an affordable housing initiative\u2014a full-circle return to the hopeful young planner who first came west."
