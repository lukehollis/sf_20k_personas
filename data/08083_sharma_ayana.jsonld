The only child of Indian immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a homemaker mother\u2014Ayana was raised on a steady diet of high expectations. The prescribed path was clear: medicine or technology. Secretly, however, she was captivated by her mother\u2019s intricate rangoli designs and the stories behind the deities in the prints that adorned their home.\n\nHer first true act of rebellion was at UC Berkeley, where she quietly switched her major from computer science to art history. The decision caused a rift with her father that took years to mend. To prove her path was viable, she pursued a Master's in Arts Administration, a practical bridge between her passion and the professional world. Upon graduating, she moved to a small apartment in San Francisco, drawn to its vibrant, chaotic, and unapologetic creative spirit.\n\nHer career was a slow, steady climb. She started with unpaid internships, learned grant writing in cramped back offices, and eventually landed a coordinator role at a mid-sized arts non-profit. It was there she found her calling: not as an artist, but as a facilitator, the person who builds the scaffolding that allows art to flourish. A key turning point came a decade ago when a long-term relationship ended over their conflicting desires for the future; he wanted a suburban life like the one she\u2019d fled, while her heart was inextricably tied to her mission in the city. The heartbreak cemented her resolve, channeling her energy into her work.\n\nNow, at 44, Ayana is a Senior Program Manager. Her 0.0-mile commute is to her own sun-drenched living room in Hayes Valley, a space filled with pieces from local artists she champions. Her days are a mix of Zoom calls with donors, mentoring emerging artists, and planning community showcases. Her social life is her professional life\u2014gallery openings are her nights out, and fellow curators are her closest friends. Having finally earned her father's respect through her success, Ayana's dream is to launch a new initiative focused on providing grants and gallery space to first-generation immigrant artists. She wants to build the platform she never had, ensuring the next generation\u2019s artistic voices don't have to be a secret."
