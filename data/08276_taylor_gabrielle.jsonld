Born to a Filipina immigrant mother, a compassionate nurse, and an Irish-American father, a history teacher, Gabrielle grew up in Daly City. Her home was a warm fusion of traditions\u2014lumpia and shepherd's pie often shared the same dinner table. This upbringing instilled in her a deep appreciation for history, narrative, and the complex tapestry of identity.\n\nFollowing her passion for stories told through objects, Gabrielle pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History at UC Santa Cruz. She dreamed of curating exhibits, of giving voice to silent artifacts. However, the stark reality of Bay Area living and the competitive, often low-paying, art world forced a turning point. Unwilling to abandon the city she loved, she made a calculated pivot. A certificate in project management became her bridge from Renaissance paintings to software development cycles, landing her an entry-level role at a burgeoning startup.\n\nNow 34, Gabrielle is a seasoned Project Coordinator for a major tech firm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life; her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond is both a sanctuary and an office. Her days are structured by Slack notifications and Zoom calls, a digital rhythm she breaks with long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park. The neighborhood suits her\u2014quieter than the city\u2019s frantic core, with access to authentic dim sum and Russian bakeries that remind her of San Francisco\u2019s layered history.\n\nHer social life is intentional, curated like one of the exhibits she once dreamed of. It consists of a tight-knit circle of friends, a monthly book club, and regular Sunday dinners with her parents in Daly City. Gabrielle hopes to one day lead projects that intersect with the arts, perhaps for a museum's digital archive, finally merging her past passion with her present profession. For now, she finds contentment in her carefully constructed life, a digital nomad in her own city, forever rooted in the family and culture that raised her."
