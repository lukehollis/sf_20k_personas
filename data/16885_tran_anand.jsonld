Born in Fremont to a Vietnamese refugee father who worked as an electronics technician and a first-generation Indian-American mother who was a librarian, Anand grew up navigating two distinct heritages. His childhood was a blend of ph\u1edf and samosas, of stories of harrowing escape and tales of academic pressure. His environmental consciousness was sparked not in a classroom, but on a 4th-grade field trip to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, where the sight of the salt marshes teeming with life against the backdrop of the Dumbarton Bridge ignited a lifelong fascination.\n\nHe pursued this passion at San Francisco State University, earning a B.S. in Environmental Science. Foregoing a more lucrative corporate path, Anand dedicated himself to the non-profit sector, starting as a field canvasser and slowly climbing the ranks. Over two decades, he developed a reputation as a pragmatic and effective manager, someone who could translate complex scientific data into actionable, community-based restoration projects. His career became his calling, a way to honor the fragile beauty he first glimpsed as a child.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce eight years ago. The amicable split left him re-evaluating his personal life, which had long taken a backseat to his work. He moved from the East Bay into a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond, embracing city life. He now shares a deep bond with his daughter, a marine biology student at UC Santa Cruz, seeing his own legacy reflected in her passion.\n\nAnand\u2019s current life is one of routine and purpose. His day begins with a 3.8-mile ride on the 38 Geary Muni bus to his downtown office, where he manages multi-million dollar grants for Bay Area wetland restoration. Weekends are for him: long walks through Golden Gate Park, browsing the shops on Clement Street, and hiking in the Marin Headlands with a small circle of close friends. He feels a profound connection to San Francisco, a city that represents both his professional purpose and his personal rebirth. His aspiration is no longer to save the world, but to leave his small corner of it\u2014the San Francisco Bay\u2014measurably healthier for the next generation."

He saw a snowy egret take flight against the steel skeleton of the Dumbarton Bridge. It wasn't about nature versus industry; it was the realization that they coexisted, one fragile and one formidable. In that moment, he felt a pull, a quiet but fierce protectiveness for the life humming in the mud. It was the beginning of his purpose.\n\n2.\nHe was sixteen, helping his dad fix a lawnmower in their Fremont garage. His dad, quiet as usual, pointed towards the west and spoke of a different bay, a different ocean. He didn\u2019t share details of his escape, but Anand understood the unspoken weight of the water\u2014how it could represent both terror and freedom. It recast the San Francisco Bay in his mind, not just as an ecosystem, but as a place of arrival and sanctuary. His work suddenly felt tied to his father\u2019s survival.\n\n3.\nThe first night in his Inner Richmond apartment was jarringly silent. The boxes were a maze in the small living room. He ate takeout curry standing by the window, watching the Karl the Fog swallow the tops of the buildings on Geary. There was a hollow ache of an ended chapter, a profound loneliness. But as the headlights of the 38 bus painted a streak of light across his wall, he felt a flicker of something new: autonomy. This quiet space was his own to fill.\n\n4.\nHis daughter, Maya, was sixteen, showing him a shaky video on her phone from a trip to the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve. She was narrating, her voice filled with the same unvarnished wonder he felt as a boy, pointing out a tiny, vibrant nudibranch. In her focused eyes, he saw his own passion not just reflected, but amplified. He realized his legacy wasn't just the wetlands he helped restore; it was the brilliant young woman who would carry that protective instinct forward, into deeper waters than he ever could.\n\n5.\nLast spring, he stood on the edge of a newly restored tidal marsh in the South Bay, a project he had managed from a grant proposal years earlier. The paperwork and budget meetings melted away. He watched a flock of sandpipers dart along the water\u2019s edge, their movements a tiny, frenetic dance. This was the result\u2014not a headline, but the quiet return of life. It was the same feeling from his 4th-grade field trip, but deeper, layered with the earned satisfaction of having played his small part."
