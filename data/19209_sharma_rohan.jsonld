The only child of software engineers who emigrated from Jaipur, India, Rohan grew up watching his parents navigate a world built around freeways. He saw how the lack of reliable public transit limited their community, tethering people to the expense and hassle of car ownership. This early observation planted a seed: cities could be better, more equitable, and more connected.\n\nThis conviction guided his academic path. He excelled at UC Berkeley, earning a bachelor's degree before seamlessly transitioning into their graduate program for Urban and Regional Planning. While his peers were drawn to housing policy or environmental design, Rohan was obsessed with the circulatory system of a city: its transportation networks. His master's thesis, a critical analysis of BART's expansion challenges, caught the attention of a recruiter from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). Landing a job there felt like a calling fulfilled.\n\nThe move to San Francisco was a pivotal turning point. Rohan consciously chose a small apartment in Hayes Valley, ensuring he could live the principles he advocated. His 2.2-mile commute is a daily field study; he rides the Muni, noting rider patterns, delays, and sidewalk conditions with a planner\u2019s eye. His work at the SFMTA is more than a job; it\u2019s a mission to untangle the city\u2019s complex transit knots, working on projects from protected bike lanes to bus rapid transit corridors.\n\nHis life is deeply woven into the fabric of the city. Weekends are spent exploring neighborhoods by foot, grabbing coffee with his girlfriend, Clara, an architect, and debating the merits of new parklet designs. His social circle is a mix of fellow planners and activists who share his passion. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t just career advancement; it\u2019s to one day lead a transformative project that will reshape how San Franciscans move, leaving a lasting, positive mark on his adopted home. He doesn't just work for the city; he\u2019s an active participant in its constant, challenging evolution."

Her quiet sigh wasn't just disappointment; it was the sound of a cage door clicking shut. In that moment, Rohan didn\u2019t see a driveway, but a boundary. A quiet, burning resolve ignited in him to one day erase those lines for people like her. This memory, from his LA childhood, became his foundational \"why.\"\n\n2. His first real commute in San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a trip; it was an arrival. Squeezed onto a rattling N Judah train, he felt the city's pulse through the floor. He saw a dozen different lives reflected in the window, all moving together. The feeling was pure exhilaration\u2014a stark contrast to the isolating drives of his youth. Stepping out at Civic Center, he knew he wasn't just starting a job at the SFMTA; he was finally home, living the connected life he'd only ever planned on paper.\n\n3. At a heated community meeting about a new protected bike lane on Valencia Street, an elderly woman stood up, shaking with anger. Rohan listened, then calmly walked her through the collision data, speaking not as a planner, but as a neighbor. Later, she approached him and said, \"You actually listened.\" The project was approved. That small victory felt monumental, teaching him that empathy was just as crucial as engineering. It solidified his belief that his job was about people, not just pavement.\n\n4. On their third date, he and Clara, the architect, stood on a chilly corner in the Mission, debating a new parklet. She admired the seamless joinery of the reclaimed wood; he critiqued how it narrowed the pedestrian path. They weren't arguing, but building on each other's ideas. He felt a profound sense of being understood, of finding a partner whose language, though different, harmonized with his own. It was the moment he knew his passion for the city had a place in his heart, not just his head.\n\n5. After months of work, a bus rapid transit proposal he\u2019d poured his soul into was savaged in an online neighborhood forum. He scrolled through the furious comments at his desk, the fluorescent lights of the SFMTA office feeling cold and clinical. The weight of the city\u2019s resistance felt crushing, a personal failure. But as he rode the bus home that night, watching the tired faces of his fellow riders, the frustration sharpened into steel. This wasn't just a project; it was for them. The setback didn't defeat him; it radicalized him."
