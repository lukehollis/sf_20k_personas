From her bay window, she watches the N-Judah streetcar rumble past, a piece of the complex circulatory system she has spent her career analyzing. At 52, as a senior transportation planner for the city, she designs the commutes of millions, yet her own is a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her home office.\n\nHer passion for urban density was forged in its absence. Growing up in the sprawling suburbs of Fresno, Sarah felt trapped by the tyranny of the automobile. Life was a series of strip malls and long drives, sparking a youthful obsession with maps of European capitals and their intricate subway lines. College at UC Berkeley was her escape, where she fell in love with walkable neighborhoods and the pulse of a city that lived on its streets. She pursued a Master\u2019s in Urban and Regional Planning, focusing her thesis on the social impact of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.\n\nSarah\u2019s career with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency began with fiery idealism. She championed bike lanes when they were controversial and fought for expanded bus service in underserved communities. A key turning point was a contentious divorce in her late thirties; her ex-husband yearned for a suburban house with a yard, a lifestyle she had purposefully left behind. The split solidified her identity as a dyed-in-the-wool urbanist. She raised her son, now a college student in Oregon, in a city she believed offered a richer, more connected life.\n\nHer days are a structured rhythm of data analysis, community Zoom meetings, and virtual project management. Evenings are for herself: walking her rescue terrier in Golden Gate Park, attending a pottery class, or meeting her small circle of long-time friends for dinner in Cole Valley.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a career ladder but about legacy. She hopes to see the completion of major projects that will make San Francisco more accessible and equitable for the next generation. Her personal aspiration is to one day retire and travel the world\u2019s great railways, not as a planner, but simply as a passenger, finally enjoying the seamless movement she has worked her entire life to create for others."
