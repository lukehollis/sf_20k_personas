Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving couple of literature professors in Portland, Oregon, he grew up surrounded by books and intellectual curiosity, yet always felt a step removed from his peers. This quiet sense of being an outsider fueled a desire to understand how places and systems shape belonging.\n\nDrawn by its dynamic energy, he moved to the Bay Area for his undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. Instead of pursuing a purely technical field, he was captivated by the tangible act of creation, earning a Master's degree in Urban Planning. His thesis focused on creating inclusive, community-centric public spaces in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. He was an idealist, convinced he could architect a better, more equitable city.\n\nThe turning point came after two frustrating years working for a municipal planning department. Weighed down by bureaucratic inertia, budget cuts, and political gridlock, his idealism soured. A friend, already successful in tech, pointed out that Ethan\u2019s skill in systems analysis and problem-solving was highly valued in the private sector. Reluctantly, and with a mountain of student debt, Ethan pivoted.\n\nToday, at 37, he is a highly effective Senior Business Consultant, untangling complex strategic problems for major tech firms from his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His 0.0-mile commute defines his routine: a morning espresso from a local cafe, a disciplined workout, then hours of deep work on video calls. He is successful, financially secure, and respected in his field, yet a part of him mourns the urban planner he left behind.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is layered. He appreciates the city's ambition and culinary scene, but he also sees it with a planner's critical eye\u2014the hostile architecture, the underutilized alleyways, the tension between innovation and livability. His social circle is small, a mix of tech colleagues and a few old friends from his grad school days who understand his quiet dissatisfaction. Ethan\u2019s ultimate dream is not a C-suite title, but to one day leverage his tech earnings to fund the very community design projects he once felt powerless to implement, finally bridging the gap between the world he profits from and the one he truly wants to build."
