The only son of progressive Punjabi Sikh immigrants, his parents gave him his mother\u2019s surname, Kaur, as a statement of equality\u2014a detail that has followed him his entire life as a quiet testament to his family\u2019s values. Growing up, he balanced the demands of his heritage with a potent, Silicon Valley-fueled ambition. He was driven, excelling in school as a way to bridge the two worlds he inhabited.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line of ascent: an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science from UC Davis, followed by a prestigious MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. This combination of human-centric thinking and sharp business acumen made him a natural for the burgeoning tech consulting world. David joined a top-tier firm in the late 90s, riding the dot-com wave and its subsequent booms. He was a problem-solver, parachuting into chaotic tech companies to streamline operations and maximize profit, a life of high-stakes presentations and relentless travel.\n\nThe key turning point came around his 40th birthday. The 80-hour work weeks and constant pressure had contributed to an amicable but necessary divorce. Staring at his life\u2019s balance sheet, he realized his professional success had come at a great personal cost. He negotiated a principal-level position with his firm that allowed him to work remotely, swapping his corner office for a meticulously organized condo in Noe Valley.\n\nNow, David\u2019s life is one of structured tranquility. His commute is a walk to his standing desk, where he advises global tech firms via video call. His days are bookended by walks through his quiet neighborhood, often grabbing a coffee from a local caf\u00e9 near the Castro. His relationship with his teenage daughter, Maya, who he co-parents, has become his central focus. He helps her with calculus and listens to her dreams, finding more fulfillment in her successes than any corporate win. His aspiration is no longer the next promotion, but to build a life of genuine connection\u2014perhaps mentoring young entrepreneurs or finding a partner who values quiet evenings over industry mixers. He has finally found in San Francisco not a ladder to climb, but a place to be."
