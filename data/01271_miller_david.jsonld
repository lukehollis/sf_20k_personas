He grew up in a nondescript suburb of Columbus, Ohio, the son of a librarian and an electrician. His childhood was stable but lacked spark. While his parents valued practical skills, David was drawn to the nascent world of personal computers, spending hours in the basement taking apart and reassembling a Tandy 1000. He saw a logical, predictable world inside the machine that was missing outside.\n\nHe briefly attended community college but found the curriculum slow and uninspired. Instead, he taught himself networking and systems administration through online forums and stacks of manuals. In 1999, drawn by the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom, he moved to San Francisco, not with dreams of being a millionaire founder, but to be near the heart of the machine. He arrived just in time to watch the bubble burst, a formative lesson in the industry\u2019s volatility. This experience solidified his preference for stable, less glamorous work. He found his niche as a remote IT support technician, a reliable problem-solver for companies who needed things fixed without the overhead of an in-house team.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, David has lived in the same rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the desk in his living room. His days are a steady rhythm of support tickets and remote logins. He is a ghost in the system, his voice known to hundreds of employees across the country who have never seen his face. His social life is sparse; a long-term relationship ended a decade ago, leaving him more solitary than lonely. His most consistent human interaction is the brief, pleasant exchange he has with his barista at the local coffee shop on Geary Boulevard.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is sensory rather than social. He loves the way the fog muffles the city sounds and the distant horn of a ship in the bay. At 49, his aspirations are modest. He isn't seeking a promotion or a change. His dream is to keep his apartment, maintain his quiet routine, and one day finish restoring the vintage Commodore PET computer he bought on eBay. He finds deep satisfaction in bringing old technology back to life, a tangible echo of his daily work fixing the unseen problems of the digital world."
