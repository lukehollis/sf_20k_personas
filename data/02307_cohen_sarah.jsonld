Raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by an English professor father and a bookstore-owner mother, her childhood was a quiet world of literature and order. This path led her naturally to a Master of Library and Information Science, with a future envisioned among the silent, curated stacks of a university archive.\n\nThe turning point came in the late 1990s. Lured by a friend\u2019s tales of boundless opportunity, Sarah took what she thought would be a two-year detour to San Francisco. She landed a job as an \"Information Architect\" at a chaotic dot-com startup. Here, she discovered a surprising truth: her librarian's skill for creating order from chaos was a superpower in the unstructured world of tech. She wasn\u2019t just good at organizing data; she excelled at organizing people, processes, and systems. The thrill of solving high-stakes operational puzzles replaced her quiet academic ambitions.\n\nHer career ascended through the booms and busts of Silicon Valley. She developed a reputation for being the calm center of any storm, the person who could streamline a fledgling department into an efficient machine. This professional focus, however, contributed to the amicable end of her marriage; her ex-husband, a graphic designer, longed for a quieter life in the Pacific Northwest, a life Sarah wasn't ready to choose. The divorce solidified her identity as a San Franciscan, her career and close-knit circle of female friends becoming her anchor.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a meticulously kept condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a double-edged sword; the efficiency is unmatched, but the lines between her living room and the relentless demands of her Director of Operations role are hopelessly blurred. Her days are a marathon of Zoom calls, broken up by a mandated walk to Patricia's Green to feel the sun. Having achieved the professional success she pivoted towards, Sarah finds herself dreaming of a \"second act.\" She aspires to one day apply her hard-won operational expertise to a non-profit or a major museum, a way to finally merge the high-efficiency world she mastered with the world of cultural preservation she once left behind."
