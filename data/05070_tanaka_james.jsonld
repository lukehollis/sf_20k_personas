Born and raised in San Jose, he is a third-generation (Sansei) Japanese American whose family history was a silent presence in their suburban home. His father, a stoic software engineer, rarely spoke of his own parents\u2019 experience in the WWII internment camps, but the unspoken weight of it shaped James. He grew up feeling a pull to understand and mend the emotional fractures that his family, and many others, carried just beneath the surface. This led him away from the expected path in tech and toward the helping professions.\n\nHis educational journey began at UC Davis, where a volunteer position at a community health clinic became a turning point. He witnessed firsthand how Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) navigated labyrinthine healthcare systems to advocate for the vulnerable. It was a revelation. He saw a career that blended empathy with practical action. After completing his undergraduate degree, he earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on health and aging.\n\nJames spent the first fifteen years of his career in the high-stress environment of a major San Francisco hospital, performing emotional triage in the emergency department and helping families navigate end-of-life care. The work was profoundly meaningful but exacted a heavy toll, contributing to the end of a long-term relationship. The pandemic offered an unexpected pivot. Transitioning to a full-time telehealth role, his commute vanished overnight, replaced by the digital quiet of video calls from his Inner Sunset apartment.\n\nNow 43, James\u2019s life is defined by a carefully cultivated balance. His days begin with a run through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears his head before he steps into his home office. He finds comfort in the rhythm of his neighborhood\u2014buying used books at Green Apple, picking up groceries from local markets. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of friends who understand the importance of mutual support. James hopes to one day open a small private practice focused on caregiver burnout and intergenerational trauma within the AAPI community. He seeks not grand ambition, but a sustainable life of purpose and, perhaps, a new partnership built on the hard-won wisdom of his past."

When he showed his father, the man\u2019s face tightened. \u201cYour grandparents. Manzanar.\u201d The words were stones dropped in a well of silence. In that moment, James understood his family wasn't just quiet; they were carrying a ghost. He felt an ache to learn its name, a need that would later guide him toward healing the unspoken wounds in others.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, a volunteer at a Davis health clinic, feeling useless. Then he saw an elderly Filipina woman, weeping silently over a confusing bill. As doctors rushed past, an LCSW sat with her. With a gentle voice and a firm hand on the phone, the social worker dismantled the bureaucratic wall, brick by brick. James watched, transfixed. It wasn't just kindness; it was a skill, a weapon against chaos. He saw his path then, a way to translate compassion into concrete help, and he never looked back.\n\n3.\nIt was 2 AM, the sterile smell of the ER still clinging to his clothes. His partner, Mark, was waiting up. \u201cYou aren\u2019t here, James,\u201d he said softly, his voice tired not with anger, but with distance. And he was right. James was still in a room with a grieving family, his spirit hollowed out. He looked at the man he loved and saw the chasm his work had carved between them. He realized with a sickening clarity that in mending other families, he was allowing his own to fracture.\n\n4.\nThe first week of the pandemic lockdown felt like surfacing after a decade underwater. The ER's cacophony was replaced by the muffled quiet of his Inner Sunset street. Sitting at his makeshift desk, he saw his first telehealth client appear on screen, their face framed by their own home. It was still social work, still connection, but the frantic, adrenalized urgency was gone. For the first time in years, he felt his own shoulders drop from his ears. It was a profound, unexpected exhale that changed everything.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a foggy morning last fall, pausing his run near the Japanese Tea Garden. The scent of damp earth and eucalyptus filled the air. He thought of his family's ghosts, the frantic burnout of the hospital, and the quiet purpose of his days now. There, in the misty quiet of the park, he felt not a sense of loss, but of integration. He was standing on ground that felt earned, finally ready for the life he was mindfully building for himself. A quiet hope settled in his chest."
