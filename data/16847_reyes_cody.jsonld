The son of a car mechanic father and a Filipina-American mother who worked as a hospital administrator, Cody grew up with grease under his fingernails and the steady encouragement to find a practical path. He was never a standout student in the traditional sense; abstract theories in textbooks bored him, but he could disassemble and reassemble any broken electronic device in the house by the age of fourteen.\n\nWhile his high school peers stressed over SATs and applications to UCs, Cody felt a profound sense of detachment. A turning point came during a career fair when he visited the booth for a local community college\u2019s Electronics Technology program. Seeing the circuit boards, diagnostic tools, and robotics kits sparked something in him that a lecture hall never could. He enrolled, earning his Associate\u2019s degree with honors two years later. His skills were in high demand, and he quickly landed a job as a Logistics Automation Technician at a massive distribution center in South San Francisco, keeping the intricate choreography of warehouse robots running smoothly.\n\nNow 27, Cody lives in the Outer Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy, quiet streets remind him of home. His $84,000 salary affords him a room in a shared three-bedroom apartment. His daily routine is predictable: a 6:00 AM wake-up, followed by a 7.5-mile commute against traffic in his reliable Honda Civic. He spends his days troubleshooting complex machinery, finding deep satisfaction in diagnosing a problem and implementing a fix.\n\nSocially, his world is small but solid. He\u2019s been dating Maya, a vibrant landscape architecture student he met through a mutual friend, for over a year. She pulls him out of his shell, introducing him to new restaurants in the Mission or dragging him on hikes in Marin. His deepest aspiration isn't fame or fortune, but stability. He dreams of saving enough with Maya to one day buy a small house with a garage in Pacifica\u2014a place where he can have his own workshop and still hear the ocean, a tangible future he can build with his own two hands."

The family\u2019s VCR had eaten a tape, and after hours of careful disassembly on the living room floor, he\u2019d found the rogue gear. When he finally put it back together and the movie flickered to life, his father, smelling of motor oil, simply nodded. It wasn't praise, it was recognition. In that quiet moment, Cody felt a profound sense of competence that school had never given him, a feeling that he could understand the world by taking it apart.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, wandering a noisy high school career fair, he felt completely adrift among the booths for four-year universities. Then he saw it: a simple table for a community college, laid out with circuit boards and wiring kits. The instructor didn't ask about his GPA; he asked what Cody liked to build. For the first time, Cody felt seen not for what he lacked in a classroom, but for what he could do with his hands. It was a spark of belonging, a clear, tangible path opening up through the fog of his future.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe entire southern quadrant of the distribution center had gone dark. Senior techs were stumped, but Cody, just six months on the job, noticed a faint flicker on a diagnostic panel everyone else had ignored. He traced it to a single, corroded pin on a master controller. When he replaced it and a thousand robots whirred back to life in perfect unison, a quiet, powerful satisfaction settled deep in his chest. This was more than a job; it was a calling he was truly good at.\n\n***\n\n4.\nMaya had insisted on taking him to Land's End for their third date, on a day so foggy you couldn\u2019t see the bridge. He\u2019d expected to feel restless, but as they stood by the Sutro Baths-ruins, wrapped in the quiet gray, she\u2019d just leaned her head on his shoulder. He wasn\u2019t performing or trying to be interesting; he was just there, with her. He realized then that love didn't have to be loud. For him, it felt like this: a shared, comfortable silence against the sound of the ocean.\n\n***\n\n5.\nThey were driving through Pacifica when Maya pointed to a small, unassuming house with peeling paint and a two-car garage. \"Look, a workshop,\" she'd said. In his mind, he instantly saw it all: his tools neatly hung on a pegboard, the scent of grease and salt air mixing, and Maya planting something in the yard. The dream wasn\u2019t just about a house anymore. In that moment, it became a clear, achievable picture of a future he could build and maintain with his own two hands, for them."
