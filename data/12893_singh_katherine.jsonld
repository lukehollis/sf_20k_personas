Raised in the planned suburbs of Walnut Creek, she was the daughter of Amir Singh, an exacting architect who emigrated from Punjab, and Sarah, a free-spirited painter from the Central Coast. From her father, Katherine inherited a love for elegant systems and logical grids; from her mother, an appreciation for organic, human-centric design. This duality defined her path.\n\nHer \"aha\" moment came not in a classroom, but on a BART train. As a teenager, watching the chaotic crush of commuters, she saw not an annoyance, but a complex puzzle of human movement waiting to be solved. This fascination led her to a B.S. at Cal Poly, followed by a Master's in Transportation Engineering from UC Berkeley, where she specialized in mobility data. Her career began at a public agency, but she soon moved to a senior role at a major consulting firm, craving a faster pace and broader impact. Now, she analyzes vast datasets to advise the city and private companies on how to make transit more efficient and equitable.\n\nA key turning point was watching her grandmother in Fresno become isolated after she could no longer drive. The experience transformed Katherine\u2019s work from an intellectual exercise into a personal crusade. For her, a well-designed bus route or a protected bike lane is a lifeline, a tool for community connection and independence.\n\nToday, Katherine lives in the Inner Richmond with her partner, Leo, a landscape architect. Her life is a practical application of her professional values. Her 4.5-mile commute is a daily ritual: a bike ride through the quiet morning streets to a MUNI stop, her mind mapping the city's pulse. Evenings are for cooking meals with Leo, discussing urban green spaces, or volunteering for a local pedestrian advocacy group.\n\nSan Francisco is both her laboratory and her home. She sees the city as a living dataset, a place of immense potential hampered by legacy challenges. Her aspiration is to lead a public-private partnership to pioneer a new, data-driven, and deeply human transit solution for the Bay Area, ensuring no one gets left behind\u2014a perfect synthesis of her father's logic and her mother's heart."

Everything has its place,\" he said, his voice full of calm certainty. Later that afternoon, her mother, Sarah, led her to the garage studio, where she mixed cerulean and ochre on a palette. \"It finds its own way,\" Sarah whispered as the colors bled together. In that moment, she felt not a conflict, but the profound weight of two beautiful, essential truths.\n\n*****\n\n2.\nIt was a phone call during her master's at Berkeley that changed everything. Her grandmother in Fresno, a woman of vibrant stories, sounded small and clipped. \"The bus didn't come on time, Katie. It's just... easier to stay home.\" The silence that followed was cavernous, filled with an absence of life. In that moment, the sterile data on Katherine's screen dissolved into the stark image of her grandmother, isolated by a single, unreliable bus route. Her work was no longer about efficiency; it was a fight against loneliness.\n\n*****\n\n3.\nShe was sixteen, crammed onto a sweltering, stalled BART train near the MacArthur station. A collective sigh of frustration rippled through the car. But instead of annoyance, Katherine felt a strange, electric curiosity. She began watching the subtle shifts and sways, the invisible paths people carved through the crush. It wasn't a crowd; it was a living algorithm of need and destination. That day, transportation ceased to be about metal and concrete; it became a complex, deeply human puzzle she was suddenly desperate to solve.\n\n*****\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday, she sat at their kitchen table in the Inner Richmond, tracing the chaotic flow of a problem intersection on a napkin. Across from her, Leo was sketching a design for a new parklet. He glanced over and said, \"If you put a series of small trees here, it slows cyclists naturally.\" She felt a surge of warmth and recognition. They were speaking the same language, solving the same puzzle. In that small, quiet moment, home wasn't just a place of rest, but a shared design studio for a better city.\n\n*****\n\n5.\nThree years into her consulting job, she stood on a corner in the Excelsior. It was a Saturday, and the new 51-Crosstown bus she'd fought for\u2014a simple line on her dataset\u2014roared past. She watched an elderly man with a cane get on, followed by a young couple with a stroller. No one noticed her, but she felt an invisible current pass through her\u2014the quiet, immense satisfaction of connecting one human being to their city. It was the first time she truly felt her father's logic and mother's heart working as one."
