Her world, from birth, has smelled of boiled dough, sour cream, and simmering beef broth\u2014the legacy of her father, Nikolai, a stoic Russian immigrant who met her mother, Wei, in an English language class two decades ago. Meilin is the living fusion of their two worlds: she possesses her mother\u2019s sharp organizational skills and her father\u2019s quiet, unwavering sense of duty.\n\nGrowing up, the restaurant was her playroom, her first job, and her destiny. While friends went to summer camp, Meilin learned to fold pelmeni, bus tables, and manage inventory. Her educational journey felt pre-written; an Associate's degree in Hospitality Management from City College of San Francisco was a practical step, not a passionate one. It was a formalization of the knowledge she\u2019d already absorbed through years of firsthand experience. The turning point wasn't a single event, but a slow realization around age 22 that her life path was a trench she was digging deeper, not a road she was paving forward.\n\nNow, as the restaurant\u2019s official manager, her 0.0-mile commute is a gilded cage. Her day starts with inventory checks and ends long after the last customer has paid. Her father, his hands now arthritic, trusts her with the operations, while her mother still charms the regulars at the front. Meilin\u2019s social life consists of brief chats with suppliers and shared cigarettes with the kitchen staff during their break.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intensely hyperlocal. She doesn\u2019t see the glittering skyline or the tech campuses; she sees the fog rolling in from Ocean Beach, knows the schedule of the 38 Geary bus by heart, and feels the pulse of the neighborhood through its dinner orders.\n\nDeep down, Meilin dreams of anonymity. She yearns to live in a different neighborhood, maybe the Mission, and work a job that ends at 5 p.m. She fantasizes about traveling to places that don\u2019t have a kitchen attached, using her savings not for a new freezer, but for a plane ticket. For now, love and loyalty keep her tethered, managing her parents\u2019 dream while quietly wondering when she\u2019ll get the chance to build her own."
