He grew up in the dense, working-class neighborhoods of South Boston, the son of a union electrician and a school secretary. His world was one of tangible things: copper wire, worn textbooks, and the biting Atlantic wind. His family expected him to pursue a practical trade, but Liam was always drawn to the elegant logic of systems, the hidden structures that governed everything from the Dewey Decimal System to the city\u2019s bus routes.\n\nBucking expectations, he pursued a Master's in Library and Information Science, fascinated by the architecture of knowledge itself. It was during the dot-com boom that he had his epiphany: the burgeoning internet was just a new, chaotic library in desperate need of organization. He translated his skills in cataloging and information theory into the language of data and cloud infrastructure. This pivot was his key turning point, taking him from a potential academic to a highly sought-after tech professional. He moved to San Francisco for a job offer in his late twenties and never looked back.\n\nNow at 42, Liam is a Senior Solutions Architect, a title that perfectly marries his past and present. From his meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Richmond, he designs complex cloud systems for global companies. His 0.0-mile commute grants him a life measured in neighborhood blocks. His days begin with a pour-over coffee from a cafe on Clement Street and often include a midday run through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park to clear his head.\n\nRecently single after the amicable end of a long-term relationship, his social life is curated and intentional, centered on a few close friends, board game nights, and dinners at unassuming neighborhood restaurants. He has achieved the financial stability his parents championed, but in a world they barely understand. Liam\u2019s private aspiration is to build something for himself\u2014not a startup, but a digital archive dedicated to preserving the histories of disappearing trades, a quiet nod to the father who still asks him to explain what exactly he does for a living. He seeks to build a bridge between the tangible world he came from and the abstract one he now commands."
