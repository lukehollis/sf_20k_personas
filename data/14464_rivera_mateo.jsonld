Born in Daly City to a Filipino immigrant father who worked as a mechanic and a second-generation Chinese-American mother who was a meticulous accountant, Mateo\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two hardworking cultures. His name, common in the Philippines due to its Spanish colonial history, was his father\u2019s choice, a nod to their heritage that often surprises people who expect a different background based on his surname.\n\nInitially, Mateo didn't have a clear career path. After high school, he took a job as a medical records clerk at a local clinic while attending community college part-time. It was there, amidst towering shelves of manila folders and the chaotic transition to early digital systems in the late 1990s, that he found his calling. He saw firsthand how poor data management created genuine problems for both patients and doctors. This experience was crystallized when his own father was navigating a chronic illness, and Mateo had to personally help decipher conflicting and incomplete medical files.\n\nThis turning point gave him a mission. He transferred to a four-year university and earned a Bachelor's degree in Health Information Management. He wasn't a coder chasing a startup dream; he was a problem-solver who understood the human cost of inefficient systems. Now, as a Clinical Informatics Specialist at a major San Francisco medical center, he is a quiet architect of medical efficiency. He designs and refines the electronic health record systems that doctors use daily, ensuring that data flows seamlessly from the lab to the patient chart, preventing the very errors that frustrated him two decades ago.\n\nMateo lives a structured, peaceful life in the Inner Sunset. His 3.8-mile commute on the N-Judah MUNI line is a daily ritual, a time for podcasts on data science or simply watching the city wake up. He loves his neighborhood\u2019s foggy mornings and its proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he often walks to decompress after a long day of intricate problem-solving. While single, he maintains a close-knit circle of friends for board game nights and hikes in Marin. His dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to one day lead a project that develops a truly patient-centric health information app, giving people the same clarity and control over their medical data that he once fought to find for his own family."

He saw the weary confusion in his dad\u2019s eyes as he tried to make sense of the conflicting information. A quiet, protective anger ignited in Mateo\u2019s chest. He wasn't just sorting paper; he was trying to reclaim a piece of his father\u2019s dignity from a broken system. That single moment at the table wasn't about a career, it was a promise he made to his dad.\n\n2.\nHe remembers being about ten years old in their Daly City garage. His father, smelling of grease and metal, was meticulously reassembling a carburetor. From the doorway, his mother, holding a ledger, called out a question about a household expense. His father answered without looking up. The image of their two worlds\u2014the mechanical and the financial, both requiring immense precision and care\u2014became his internal definition of work. It taught him that diligence, in any form, was a language of love.\n\n3.\nIt was 1999, and he was a clerk surrounded by shelves of manila folders. An elderly woman was crying softly at the front desk because her chart for a crucial specialist appointment was lost. He saw the resigned look on his supervisor\u2019s face, the acceptance of systemic failure. The woman\u2019s quiet despair hit him hard, transforming the abstract problem of \"poor data management\" into the tangible fear on a stranger's face. He knew then that organizing files was a matter of human well-being.\n\n4.\nJust last year, while walking past a nursing station, he overheard one nurse tell another, \"That new allergy flag you-know-who built is a lifesaver. It caught a major conflict this morning.\" They had no idea he was the architect of that simple, color-coded alert. A deep, anonymous pride washed over him. It wasn't about getting credit; it was the profound, quiet satisfaction of knowing his logic had protected someone he would never even meet. This was his true reward.\n\n5.\nOn a recent Tuesday, the N-Judah train emerged from the Sunset Tunnel into the light. The fog that had blanketed his neighborhood gave way to a clear view of the city waking up below. With his data science podcast playing softly, he watched the familiar progression of stops, a predictable rhythm in a complex city. In that moment of transit, suspended between his quiet home and his intricate work, he felt a deep sense of belonging and peace, a single, functioning node in a system he loved."
