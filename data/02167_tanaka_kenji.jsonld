            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is a third-generation San Franciscan, a detail he holds with quiet pride. His grandparents ran a small grocery in Japantown before internment, a family history that anchors him to the city's complex past. Raised in the Sunset District by a soft-spoken father who worked for the city and a mother who was a pillar of the Japanese Cultural and Community Center, Kenji\u2019s upbringing was steeped in community, diligence, and the rolling fog. He wasn't destined for the tech world; his heart was in the past. He earned his Bachelor's in History from SF State, dreaming of becoming a museum curator, surrounded by the tangible artifacts of bygone eras.\n\nThe reality of the Bay Area's cost of living proved a harsh turning point. Curatorial jobs were scarce, and Kenji felt the pressure to build a stable life in the city he refused to leave. With a pragmatism inherited from his father, he completed an intensive IT certification program. He discovered a knack for the logical, problem-solving nature of the work. It wasn't his passion, but he was good at it, and it paid the bills, allowing him to stay rooted in San Francisco.\n\nNow 36, Kenji is an IT Support Specialist for a downtown tech firm, but his commute is zero miles. His one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, filled with history books and neatly organized cables, doubles as his office. His days are a routine of digital triage: solving password crises and network issues through a headset, a helpful ghost in the corporate machine. To combat the isolation, he makes a point of leaving his apartment for lunch every day, walking to a favorite banh mi shop on Clement Street or grabbing coffee, just to feel the neighborhood's pulse.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, centered on a few old college friends. His true passion project, however, bridges his two worlds. He volunteers his evenings at the JCCCNC, using his IT skills to help digitize their historical archives\u2014photographs, letters, and records from families like his own. Here, Kenji the historian and Kenji the IT specialist merge. His dream isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to build a comprehensive, publicly accessible digital archive for Japantown. It\u2019s his way of curating his community's history, ensuring its story remains as permanent and accessible as the city itself."
