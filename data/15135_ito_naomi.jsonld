Raised in Santa Rosa, Naomi grew up navigating this rich, dual heritage. She spent summers on the reservation, learning traditional basket weaving from her grandmother, and weekends listening to her father\u2019s stoic stories of interned ancestors and the quiet resilience required to reclaim a place in America.\n\nThis deep-seated understanding of land, displacement, and community shaped her academic path. She saw how poorly planned developments could sever cultural ties and exacerbate inequality. Driven by a desire to build cities that heal rather than harm, she pursued a graduate degree in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley. San Francisco, with its potent mix of breathtaking beauty and jarring inequity, was the only place she wanted to work.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of the city\u2019s planning department, and after nearly two decades of navigating bureaucracy and public hearings, she is now a Senior Urban Planner. Naomi is a pragmatist, known for her ability to find compromise between developers, activists, and city officials. Her current focus is on transit-oriented affordable housing projects, a role that feels like a direct application of her life's purpose.\n\nNaomi\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the Mission District. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment a few blocks from Dolores Park, a home she cherishes. Her daily routine involves a morning coffee from a local cafe before catching the J-Church Muni line for the 2.5-mile commute downtown. Evenings are for unwinding, either with a run through the park or a quiet dinner with her tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of colleagues and artists. A significant long-term relationship ended five years ago, a painful turning point that solidified her independence and deepened her professional focus.\n\nHer greatest aspiration isn't a promotion but a legacy. Naomi dreams of spearheading a project that isn't just sustainable and equitable, but that meaningfully integrates indigenous land management principles into its design. For her, planning San Francisco\u2019s future is an act of honoring its past\u2014all of it."

Naomi was ten, sitting by the Klamath, fumbling with a basket start. \"The sticks know where to go,\" her grandmother had said, guiding her small hands. \"You just have to listen.\" In that moment, she understood planning wasn\u2019t just about diagrams and imposing a will, but about feeling the tensions and finding a pattern. It was the first time she realized that a community was something you could weave with your own hands.\n\n2.\nAt a project review in her twenties, a historical photo flashed on screen: the Tanforan Racetrack, converted into a temporary internment camp. She saw the barracks, the barbed wire, and felt a cold jolt, seeing her father\u2019s stoic stories overlaid on a SFO-adjacent parcel map. In that sterile conference room, her family\u2019s displacement became a zoning issue. It ignited a protective fire in her, a quiet vow to use her position to ensure the land remembered its ghosts and protected its living.\n\n3.\nThe morning after he left five years ago, the J-Church\u2019s rumble seemed impossibly loud in the quiet of her Mission apartment. The silence was a hollow ache in her chest. She stood in the living room, sunlight cutting through the bay window, and realized the space was entirely hers now. The rent-controlled walls felt less like a bargain and more like a fortress she had to hold alone. That painful solitude forged a fierce independence, rooting her not to a person, but to a place and a purpose.\n\n4.\nIt was a vicious public hearing for a housing project about eight years ago. An elderly homeowner, fearing change, was shouting at a young activist, desperate for a home. Naomi stood at the podium, feeling the raw friction between preservation and survival. Instead of citing code, she spoke of her own family\u2019s need for stable ground. The room quieted. It wasn\u2019t a victory, but a fragile truce. It taught her that compromise wasn\u2019t weakness, but the painstaking work of weaving a future that could hold everyone.\n\n5.\nOn a run last year, she paused at the top of Dolores Park, looking out as the fog began to spill over Twin Peaks. Below, the city gleamed, a grid of human ambition laid over a land that had its own patterns. She thought of the managed burns and seasonal harvests of the Yurok, and a profound clarity settled over her. Her legacy wouldn't be a building, but a method: to help shape a small part of San Francisco that listened to the land itself."
