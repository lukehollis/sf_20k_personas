The daughter of a Korean ceramicist and an Irish-American engineer, she grew up in a quiet Portland suburb where her life was a blend of her mother\u2019s artistic sensibilities and her father\u2019s pragmatism. While she inherited her mother\u2019s eye for design and flow, her father\u2019s voice guided her toward a more stable path. She chose a Business Administration degree from the University of Washington, a practical decision that quieted a nascent desire to study art history.\n\nHer career began at a mid-size Seattle tech firm as a business analyst. Ambitious and sharp, Jessica quickly demonstrated a unique ability to translate user needs into technical requirements, a skill that naturally led her toward product management. The turning point came at 26 when she was recruited by a major San Francisco tech company. The move was daunting but represented a chance to finally merge her creative instincts with her business acumen in a city at the epicenter of innovation. Now, as a Product Manager, she thrives in the high-stakes environment of shaping digital products, earning a salary that once felt unimaginable.\n\nJessica\u2019s life is anchored in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her 3.8-mile MUNI ride to her SoMa office is a daily ritual, a time to people-watch and decompress with a podcast. The neighborhood is her sanctuary; she runs in Golden Gate Park on foggy mornings and finds comfort in the authentic Korean restaurants that remind her of her mother\u2019s cooking. Her social life revolves around a close-knit group of friends\u2014fellow tech transplants who have become her found family\u2014and a series of well-intentioned but often comical Hinge dates.\n\nLooking forward, Jessica aims to become a Director of Product before she\u2019s 35. Yet, a deeper aspiration is taking root. She dreams of one day launching her own venture, something smaller and more meaningful, perhaps a platform that connects local artists with tech-driven opportunities\u2014a perfect synthesis of her parents' worlds. For now, she is content building her life in San Francisco, a city that finally feels like the right-fit product for her own complex, evolving story."

Clutching the ceramic mug her mother made\u2014the only thing she\u2019d unpacked\u2014she looked out at the city lights filtered through the fog. The fear was a cold knot in her stomach, but underneath it, a spark of exhilaration. This was the start of her own design. That night, loneliness transformed into a quiet, determined ownership of her new life, a project she would build herself.\n\n\u200e\n2.\nIt was during a tense product review, about a year into her job. The engineering lead was dismissing her proposed user flow as \"too aesthetic, not functional.\" Jessica held her ground, calmly mapping the user's emotional journey to the design, using data to back her creative instinct. When the room went silent, then nodded in agreement, she felt a profound click. It wasn't about art versus logic; it was about their synthesis. She realized she wasn\u2019t just a PM; she was a translator, finally fluent in both her parents' languages.\n\n\u200e\n3.\nLast winter, craving comfort, she found a tiny Clement Street restaurant. The *sundubu-jjigae* arrived bubbling, tasting exactly like her mother\u2019s. She sent her a photo, and her mom called immediately. Hearing her mother\u2019s voice, speaking a mix of Korean and English, while she ate that familiar flavor thousands of miles from Portland made her cry quietly into her spoon. The city, for the first time, didn't just feel like a career move; it felt like a place that could hold all parts of her.\n\n\u200e\n4.\nOn a foggy Saturday morning run in Golden Gate Park, around age 28, she felt completely enveloped, the path ahead a mystery. As she ran, the idea hit her not as a business plan, but as a feeling: a platform for artists like her mother, powered by the logic of her father. By the time she reached Stow Lake, the sun was breaking through the mist. The fog hadn't been an obstacle; it was a canvas. She wasn't just chasing a promotion; she was building towards her own masterpiece.\n\n\u200e\n5.\nShe was 29, sitting on a friend\u2019s Potrero Hill rooftop after another comically bad Hinge date. Instead of offering platitudes, her friends just listened, sharing their own stories of feeling adrift. Surrounded by blinking city lights and the warmth of cheap wine, she realized this was her family now. They weren\u2019t bound by blood, but by shared ambition, vulnerability, and the tacit understanding of building a life from scratch so far from home. In that moment, San Francisco\u2019s immense loneliness felt conquerable."
