The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a bustling laundromat, his childhood was a quiet study in contrasts: the pragmatic, constant hum of the family business versus the expansive worlds he discovered in books. His parents, valuing stability above all, hoped he would pursue a secure profession like law or engineering.\n\nTo appease them, Daniel enrolled at San Francisco State University, but chose History as his major\u2014a compromise that felt academic yet fed his soul. It was during a part-time job as a gallery attendant at the de Young Museum that his future clicked into place. He wasn\u2019t captivated by a single painting, but by the way the entire exhibition told a story through space, light, and flow. He realized he didn\u2019t want to write history; he wanted to build it for people to walk through.\n\nAfter graduation, he eschewed the path to a \u201csafe\u201d career, a decision that caused a quiet rift with his parents. He threw himself into the arts scene, taking on unpaid internships and small freelance gigs. Daniel taught himself CAD and 3D modeling software at night, slowly building a portfolio that showcased his unique talent for translating historical narratives into immersive physical experiences.\n\nNow 41, Daniel is an established exhibit designer, working on a contract basis for major museums and galleries. He lives and works in a spacious SoMa live-work loft, the reason for his 0.0-mile commute. His mornings start with strong coffee from a local roaster before he immerses himself in digital models and sketches in his studio space, separated from his living area by a wall of corkboard and blueprints. He remains close to a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014curators, artists, and writers\u2014though his dedication to his craft often leaves little time for deep romantic relationships.\n\nDaniel feels deeply connected to San Francisco, a city he has watched transform around him. He carries the memory of the old, quieter city in his heart even as he contributes to its modern cultural landscape. His ultimate dream is to design a permanent, landmark exhibition for a San Francisco museum\u2014a legacy piece that tells a quintessential story of the city that shaped him."

The air was thick with the scent of steam and bleach, but in his hands, a library book on Pompeii made the world disappear. The rhythmic thumping of the machines was the backdrop to a lost civilization. It wasn't defiance, but survival\u2014a quiet, secret act of building a world within a world. This was where he first learned that every space, even one filled with chores, could hold a story if you knew where to look.\n\n2.\nIt was a quiet Tuesday shift at the de Young during his sophomore year at SF State. He wasn\u2019t looking at a specific painting but at the architecture of the exhibit itself: the way a narrow hall opened into a vast, sunlit room, guiding visitors on an unspoken journey. A current of understanding jolted him. He realized history wasn\u2019t just written in books; it was built in three dimensions. In that silent moment, his life\u2019s work declared itself not as a choice, but as a calling.\n\n3.\nThe day he told his parents he wouldn\u2019t be pursuing a stable career, the silence in their Sunset apartment was heavier than any argument. His father stirred his congee, the scrape of the spoon against the bowl the only sound. His mother simply looked at her own hands\u2014the hands that had folded a city\u2019s worth of laundry. He felt the immense weight of their deferred dreams. That quiet rupture forged his resolve; he would have to build a life worthy of their disappointment.\n\n4.\nHe was 28, standing in the corner of a cramped Mission gallery at the opening of his first paid gig\u2014an exhibit on the city's Beat poetry scene. He watched as people moved through the space exactly as he\u2019d envisioned, their path dictated by the deliberate placement of a plinth, their attention caught by a spotlight he\u2019d hung himself. They were walking through his narrative. A wave of profound, overwhelming vindication washed over him, affirming every late night spent teaching himself, every doubt he\u2019d ever had.\n\n5.\nJust last week, Daniel stood at his SoMa loft window, coffee in hand, watching a construction crane pivot against the morning sky. Below, the gleam of a new biotech campus crowded a block of old warehouses. He felt the familiar pang of nostalgia for the city that was, a ghost of fog and quieter streets. But then he turned back to the blueprints on his desk. He wasn't just a relic of old San Francisco; he was actively designing its modern memory, ensuring the story continued."
