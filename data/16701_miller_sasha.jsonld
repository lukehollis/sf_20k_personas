Born in the Haight-Ashbury to a Japanese-American ceramicist mother and a white, beat-generation-poet father, her childhood was a collage of pottery dust, incense, and dog-eared books. She grew up with a profound appreciation for objects that held stories, learning from her mother the Japanese art of *kintsugi*\u2014mending broken pottery with gold, making the piece more beautiful for having been broken.\n\nThis foundation led her to a Bachelor's in Art History from UC Berkeley. While she loved academia, she felt a disconnect. A post-graduation apprenticeship in Florence, Italy, was her turning point. There, under the tutelage of an old master, she discovered her true calling was not just to study art, but to save it. She learned the meticulous, patient craft of restoring canvas, paper, and wood.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, Sasha worked for a decade at a prestigious downtown gallery before striking out on her own. At 42, following an amicable divorce from an architect who couldn't understand her devotion to \"other people's old things,\" she poured her savings into opening Miller Restoration. Her sun-drenched studio in Dogpatch is a sanctuary of quiet focus.\n\nNow 54, Sasha\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. She drives her Subaru the 3.8 miles from her cozy Noe Valley Victorian, where she lives with a scruffy rescue terrier named Pigment. Her days are spent hunched over canvases, carefully cleaning away decades of grime to reveal the artist\u2019s original intent. Her income is steady, built on a reputation for excellence among private collectors and small museums. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of artists, chefs, and gallery owners met over dinner in the Mission or at gallery openings in SoMa.\n\nSasha\u2019s dream is not of wealth, but of legacy. She hopes to one day be commissioned to restore a major piece of public art for the city, perhaps one of the Coit Tower murals. For her, mending the art of San Francisco is her way of mending the city itself, a quiet act of devotion to the place that made her."

But her mother didn't scold. Instead, she collected the fragments and, over days, showed Sasha how to trace the cracks with gold. Seeing the broken thing made whole and beautiful was a quiet revelation. It taught her that damage isn't an end, but a story\u2014a lesson that became the foundation of her entire life, a belief in the beauty of the repaired.\n\n2.\nIn Florence, at 23, she spent a week on one square inch of a darkened canvas\u2014a Virgin\u2019s mantle. Her master watched silently. With a solvent-tipped swab, she finally lifted centuries of grime. A blue so deep and luminous it stole her breath emerged, a color unseen since the artist\u2019s own time. It was a jolt, a connection across time that felt more real than any textbook. In that moment, she knew she wouldn't just study art; she would be a guardian of its light, its quiet accomplice.\n\n3.\nThe day she got the keys to the Dogpatch studio, she was 42 and newly single. The cavernous space smelled of old wood and possibility. Her footsteps echoed, the only sound in the silence her divorce had left. She stood in a rectangle of sunlight on the floor, terrified and absolutely free. It wasn\u2019t just a studio; it was a declaration. She was pouring the pieces of her own life back together, not with gold, but with grit, turpentine, and the defiant choice to honor her own calling.\n\n4.\nHer favorite restoration wasn\u2019t for a museum, but for a family in the Sunset. It was a small, smoke-damaged landscape by a forgotten local painter. When she revealed the finished work, the family\u2019s elderly matriarch began to cry. \u201cThat\u2019s my mother\u2019s San Francisco,\u201d she whispered. That quiet moment of connection, of returning a piece of personal history to someone, felt more significant than any prestigious commission. It affirmed that her work wasn\u2019t just technical; it was an act of preserving memory for the city she loved.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, on a walk through Noe Valley, a thick Karl the Fog morning. She held the leash, feeling the happy tug of Pigment sniffing at a damp gate. Slowly, the fog thinned, revealing the top of a familiar Victorian, its painted trim a soft pastel against the grey. The city was revealing itself to her, piece by piece. In that simple, quiet moment\u2014dog, fog, home\u2014she felt a profound sense of peace. This was her life, not broken, but gracefully mended into a comfortable, beautiful whole."
