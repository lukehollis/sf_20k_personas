A second-generation Chinese-American, she was raised in a small home filled with the aromas of her parents' nearby bakery. They instilled in her a profound work ethic and a quiet sense of duty, hoping she would pursue a stable, traditional career.\n\nIn a move of quiet rebellion, Mei chose to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz, losing herself in the beauty of Renaissance frescoes and Impressionist brushstrokes. After graduation, however, the reality of San Francisco's cost of living set in. The dream of curating a museum felt distant and impractical. In a pivotal turning point, she took a temp job as an office assistant at a burgeoning tech startup.\n\nThis pragmatic decision unexpectedly charted her future. Her meticulous attention to detail, honed by years of analyzing art, made her a natural at organizing chaotic projects. She was calm under pressure and possessed an innate ability to translate the creative visions of engineers into actionable plans. She worked her way up, eventually landing her current role as a Project Coordinator. Her bachelor's degree remains a private passion, a testament to a different path she once considered.\n\nNow 31, Mei's 0.0-mile commute defines her life in her Hayes Valley apartment. Her day begins not with a frantic BART ride, but with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by a video call with her development team. The lines between her living room and her office are permanently blurred. She lives with her partner, Alex, a graphic designer she met through a mutual friend, who understands the challenge of balancing creative pursuits with corporate demands.\n\nThough content, Mei dreams of reconnecting with her original passion. Her ultimate goal is to launch a consulting firm that bridges the gap between the art world and the tech sector, helping companies procure local art for their offices. She is a true daughter of San Francisco\u2014a woman who has adapted to the city\u2019s relentless evolution while holding onto the creative soul that defines both her and her hometown."
