The son of a Japanese-Peruvian father from Lima and a Nisei (second-generation) Japanese-American mother from Sacramento, he grew up in the fog-dusted suburbs of Daly City. His childhood home was a gentle fusion of cultures: the savory aroma of lomo saltado mingling with the quiet reverence for his grandparents\u2019 Buddhist altar. He witnessed his immigrant father navigate the complexities of American bureaucracy with a quiet, persistent dignity. This observation planted the seed of his future career: a desire to be the bridge for those lost in translation, both linguistically and culturally.\n\nHis educational journey was purposeful. After earning a B.A. in Sociology from San Francisco State University, a key turning point solidified his path. His younger sister faced a serious health crisis, and the family was overwhelmed until a compassionate hospital social worker stepped in, providing clarity and emotional support. Seeing that impact firsthand, Carlos enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program. He specialized in child and family services, driven to become the professional his own family had so desperately needed. Now an LCSW, he works at a public middle school in the Western Addition, serving as a quiet anchor in the lives of chaotic adolescents and their often-overwhelmed families.\n\nAt 29, Carlos lives a life of intentional routine. His mornings begin with a short meditation before he boards the N-Judah train from his small, tidy apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 2.8-mile commute is his time to decompress before diving into the emotional demands of his day. Evenings are for runs in Golden Gate Park or experimenting with recipes that honor his heritage. While a recent breakup has left his social life quieter, he remains deeply connected to his family and a small circle of trusted friends.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees the city not as a tech playground, but as a mosaic of communities striving to coexist. His dream is to one day open a small, bilingual private practice in the Mission District, specifically serving immigrant families. For Carlos, success isn't measured by stock options, but by the resilience he helps foster in the city that shaped him."

He watched his father, clutching a stack of papers, speak to the clerk in carefully articulated, accented English. There was no anger in his father\u2019s voice, only a persistent dignity that seemed to push back against the tide of bureaucratic indifference. In that moment, Carlos felt a quiet, fierce pride. He wasn't just watching his dad get a license; he was witnessing the quiet strength required to build a life between two worlds, planting the first seed of his own desire to guide others.\n\n2.\nThe hospital waiting room felt cold and sterile when he was nineteen, his family fractured by his sister's sudden illness. Then, the social worker arrived. She didn't have magic answers, but she sat with his mother, her calm presence a literal anchor in their panic. She translated medical jargon and, more importantly, validated their fear. Carlos watched her bring a sliver of order to their chaos. It was a revelation\u2014his vague yearning to help suddenly had a title and a purpose. This was what he wanted to do: be the calm in someone else's storm.\n\n3.\nHis first year at the middle school, a quiet seventh grader finally spoke. After weeks of silence, she told him her family was about to be evicted, stating it with a stoicism that broke his heart. Carlos just listened, validating her fear without offering empty platitudes. He connected her family with a legal aid service later that day. It wasn't a dramatic victory, but it felt profound. At 26, he understood his work wasn't about grand saves, but about being a single, trusted adult in a child\u2019s chaotic world.\n\n4.\nIt\u2019s a simple, recurring memory from his late twenties. The N-Judah train bursts from the darkness of the Sunset Tunnel into the light at Duboce Park. For a brief moment, sunlight floods the car, illuminating the diverse faces around him\u2014students, construction workers, elderly residents. He feels an overwhelming sense of shared passage, of being a small, vital thread in the city\u2019s complex fabric. It\u2019s a daily reaffirmation of his purpose, a reminder that underneath the noise, San Francisco is a mosaic of journeys, all moving together.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, nursing the fresh wound of a breakup, he ran in Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. His lungs burned and his heart ached, but the rhythmic pounding of his feet on the pavement became a mantra of endurance. Reaching the Dutch Windmill, shrouded in mist, he realized he was practicing what he preached. He was using routine and physical grounding to process pain. At 29, it was a quiet, personal confirmation that the resilience he helps others find, he could also cultivate for himself."
