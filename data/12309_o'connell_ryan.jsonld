Adopted as an infant from Seoul by a loving, boisterous Irish-American family in Sacramento, he grew up navigating a world of dualities. He was the only Asian face at sprawling O\u2019Connell family reunions, a constant, gentle reminder of his unique story. This upbringing instilled in him a deep empathy for anyone who felt like an outsider, a feeling that would later define his professional life.\n\nInstead of pursuing a more lucrative career, Ryan was drawn to understanding the systems that shape lives. He attended San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's in Social Work. The city\u2019s vibrant diversity was a balm; for the first time, being an Asian man with an Irish name wasn't an anomaly, just another detail in the urban tapestry. After graduating, he was determined to combine his social work training with his personal outlet: art. He found his calling at a non-profit in the Mission District that uses creative expression to help at-risk youth.\n\nA key turning point came at age 26 when he took a solo trip to Seoul. He didn\u2019t search for his birth family, but instead immersed himself in the culture, food, and language. The experience didn\u2019t replace his American identity but enriched it, solidifying his sense of self and giving him a new lens through which to view the immigrant and first-generation youth he served. He worked his way up from a frontline counselor to Program Manager, now overseeing grants, staff, and curriculum.\n\nToday, Ryan\u2019s life is quintessentially San Francisco. He lives with his partner, a public school teacher, in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 2.8-mile bike commute is a cherished ritual, taking him through the Panhandle and down the Wiggle. Evenings are for cooking, reading, or weekly trivia with friends. His $88,000 salary requires careful budgeting but affords a life rich in community and purpose. His dream isn\u2019t wealth, but stability: to secure enough funding to expand his program\u2019s reach into another neighborhood and to one day feel secure enough to start a family of his own in the city that finally made him feel whole."

His Aunt Sheila, smelling of beer and hairspray, ruffled his black hair and boomed, \u201cThere\u2019s our Ryan!\u201d He smiled, but felt the familiar dissonance\u2014his name, his family, yet a reflection in the sliding glass door that was solely his. It wasn\u2019t loneliness, but a quiet awareness of his difference. That day, watching his cousins, a seed of deep, unwavering empathy for anyone on the outside looking in was planted firmly in his heart.\n\n2.\nAt eighteen, during his first week at SF State, he rode the 49 Mission bus, overwhelmed by the symphony of Spanish, Cantonese, and English. For the first time, nobody looked twice at the Asian man with the Irish name. He felt a tension he never knew he held release from his shoulders. He wasn\u2019t a curiosity or a special story; he was just another thread in the city\u2019s complex, vibrant weave. That anonymity felt more like belonging than anything he had ever known.\n\n3.\nIt happened during a session in his second year at the non-profit. A quiet, withdrawn teenager named Maya, who\u2019d only ever drawn jagged, abstract lines, spent an entire hour meticulously sketching the Golden Gate Bridge from a photo. She finally looked up, handing him the sketchbook. \u201cMy dad drove a taxi over this bridge every day,\u201d she whispered. In that moment, Ryan understood his work wasn\u2019t just about art; it was about unlocking the stories trapped inside. It solidified his life\u2019s purpose with startling clarity.\n\n4.\nStanding in Seoul\u2019s Gwangjang Market at age 26, the air thick with the steam from boiling mandu, he felt a profound sense of peace. He watched a vendor, an older woman with kind eyes, expertly fold dumplings. She looked like she could be a relative, but the thought brought no pain or longing. Instead, he felt a layer of his identity click into place. He wasn't replacing his Irish-American upbringing, but adding a rich, foundational chord to the music of who he was.\n\n5.\nJust last Tuesday, he was biking home, coasting down the Wiggle as the fog began to roll in. He saw the warm light of his Inner Richmond apartment window and could just make out the silhouette of his partner moving in the kitchen. A wave of simple, overwhelming gratitude washed over him. This was it. Not wealth, not fame, but this feeling\u2014a hard-won stability, a shared life, and the quiet promise of home in the city that finally made him feel whole."
