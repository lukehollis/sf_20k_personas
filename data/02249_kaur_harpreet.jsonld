Born in Yuba City to Punjabi Sikh immigrants who tilled the soil, her upbringing was steeped in the values of community, hard work, and faith. Her parents, Jaswant and Gurmeet, envisioned a stable future for her in medicine or engineering, a tangible reward for their sacrifice. Harpreet obliged initially, studying economics at UC Davis, but felt a persistent disconnect. She was more drawn to the quiet struggles of her peers, second-generation kids navigating the chasm between their parents\u2019 homeland and their American reality.\n\nThis realization was her first major turning point. Defying familial expectations, she moved to San Francisco to pursue a Master\u2019s in School Counseling at SFSU. The city was a revelation\u2014a vibrant, chaotic tapestry so different from the structured farmlands of her youth. Upon graduating, she accepted a position at a prestigious private high school in Pacific Heights, a role that came with a unique perk: a small apartment in a converted carriage house on campus. This solved her commute and solidified her life\u2019s path.\n\nFor over two decades, Harpreet\u2019s world has been defined by the school\u2019s Gothic architecture and the rhythm of the academic year. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk across a dewy lawn, her days spent in an office filled with college pennants and nervous energy. She is a master of navigating the anxieties of privilege, helping students who have everything except, often, a clear sense of self. She has never married, her students becoming the focus of her nurturing instinct. Her social life is a small, warm circle of fellow faculty and friends from the Sikh Gurdwara in the Richmond District.\n\nNow at 51, Harpreet finds contentment in her structured life. Weekends are for long walks in the Presidio, visits to her aging parents in Yuba City, and tending to the planters on her small patio. Her dream isn\u2019t one of grand change but of legacy: she hopes to establish a mentorship program connecting her affluent students with youth from underserved city schools. She has built her sanctuary not of land or wealth, but of purpose, finding her home in the space where she helps young people find theirs."
