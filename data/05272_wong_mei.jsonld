Born in a cramped but loving apartment above a bustling Clement Street market, she is the daughter of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who dreamed of her becoming a doctor or lawyer. But it was her grandmother, Po Po, who nurtured her soul. While her parents folded dim sum, Po Po would take Mei Lin\u2019s small hand and walk her through the alleys of Chinatown, telling her stories not of gold and fortune, but of jade pendants, silk robes, and the ghosts of the old opera house. These walks, filled with whispers of the past, became Mei Lin\u2019s first museum tours.\n\nWhen it came time for college, Mei Lin respectfully defied her parents\u2019 wishes, enrolling at San Francisco State University. She pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History, with a minor in Asian American Studies, seeking the language to articulate the beauty and resilience her grandmother had shown her. The turning point came during her junior year when Po Po passed away, leaving Mei Lin a single, intricately carved wooden cricket cage. Holding the fragile object, Mei Lin understood her calling: to be a guardian of stories, to protect the delicate artifacts that connect generations.\n\nNow 26, Mei Lin has woven her passion into her life. As a curator\u2019s assistant at the Asian Art Museum, her commute is a mere 0.0 miles\u2014a short walk from her tidy studio apartment in the Civic Center. Her days are a quiet rhythm of research, cataloging ceramics from the Ming dynasty, and helping design exhibitions that bridge ancient traditions with contemporary perspectives. Her social circle consists of a few close friends from her SF State days, with whom she explores new restaurants in the Mission or hikes the coastal trails of the Presidio.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her professional and personal life. She doesn\u2019t just live in the city; she is one of its dedicated memory keepers. Her deepest aspiration is to one day curate her own major exhibition: a definitive showcase of the art, struggle, and vibrant endurance of San Francisco's Chinese community\u2014a loving tribute to her grandmother and the city that shaped them both."

Her grandmother pointed a wrinkled finger at the peeling paint of the old opera house, whispering about the ghost of a spurned soprano. The scent of ginger and the clatter of mahjong tiles faded as Mei Lin stared, picturing the silk robe and hearing a phantom aria. At that moment, history ceased to be a story in a book; it became a living, breathing presence woven into the city\u2019s very bricks, a secret she now shared.\n\n2.\nAt eighteen, in their small apartment, the sound of cleavers chopping downstairs felt louder than usual. She faced her parents, their hopes for her future hanging between them like lanterns. Announcing her choice of Art History over pre-med felt like a betrayal, yet it was also a quiet declaration of self. It was the first time she chose to honor the stories Po Po gave her over the pragmatic dreams of her parents, a difficult but defining act of carving her own path.\n\n3.\nPo Po\u2019s funeral was a blur of black suits and muffled grief. Back in her dorm room at age twenty, her mother handed her the small, intricately carved cricket cage. Holding the fragile wood, silent and empty, the weight of her loss became a clear, sharp purpose. It wasn\u2019t just an object; it was a vessel for a story, a life, a connection. In that profound stillness, Mei Lin understood her calling was not to mourn the past, but to become its faithful guardian.\n\n4.\nDuring her first year at the museum, she was tasked with cataloging a simple, celadon-glazed teacup from a local family\u2019s estate. While recording its dimensions, her thumb found a slight indentation near the base\u2014the faint, personal mark of the potter from centuries ago. A jolt ran through her, a direct-line connection across time. At twenty-four, this tangible link to an anonymous creator validated her entire life\u2019s direction. She wasn\u2019t just handling artifacts; she was holding hands with ghosts.\n\n5.\nLast spring, laughing with friends in a loud Mission taqueria, she saw a vibrant mural that echoed the operatic colors she remembered from Chinatown\u2019s festival banners. A wave of inspiration washed over her, and she suddenly saw it all: the layout, the lighting, the stories for her future exhibition. In that moment, her personal history and her professional ambition fused completely. The city wasn't just her home; it was her canvas, and she finally knew exactly what she wanted to paint."
