The daughter of a pragmatic Russian immigrant mother, Yelena, and a second-generation Chinese-American father, she was raised in the blue-collar suburbs of Vallejo. The surname came from a father who passed away when she was ten, leaving behind only faint memories and a cultural heritage she felt just beyond her grasp. Her childhood was defined by her mother\u2019s fierce love and the constant, low-grade hum of financial anxiety. Anastasia was the bridge between her mother\u2019s Old World stoicism and the laid-back California culture she witnessed at school, a balancing act that made her observant and reserved.\n\nHer path was supposed to be a straight line out. She enrolled in community college, tentatively pursuing an art history degree, a passion that felt like a secret luxury. But when her mother\u2019s health declined, Anastasia dropped out to become a full-time caregiver and provider. She took the first stable job she could find, an administrative role at a local clinic, and the dream of museums and Caravaggio was packed away. Her career became a series of lateral moves within healthcare administration, valued for her meticulousness and calm demeanor.\n\nThe major turning point came eight years ago with her mother\u2019s passing. Untethered and alone for the first time, Anastasia sold the small Vallejo home and moved to San Francisco, a city she\u2019d only ever visited on school trips. She chose a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, drawn subconsciously to a neighborhood where Russian bakeries stood near Cantonese restaurants. She found her current role with the Department of Public Health, a position that became fully remote after 2020.\n\nNow, Anastasia\u2019s life is contained within a few square miles. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins by walking from her bedroom to the small desk in her living room. Her daily rhythm is marked by processing digital forms, the quiet brewing of tea, and a lunchtime walk through Golden Gate Park, her one constant solace. She has a few close friends, but her social life is minimal, a preference for solitude honed by years of caregiving. Her deepest connection is to her neighborhood\u2014the fog rolling over Clement Street, the familiar faces at the green grocer. Her truest dream remains alive: she\u2019s slowly chipping away at her art history degree through online classes, hoping one day to trade her keyboard for a position at the de Young Museum, finally closing the distance to the world she put on hold."
