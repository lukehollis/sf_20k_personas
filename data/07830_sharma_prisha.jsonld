The only child of two academics who emigrated from Mumbai to Ann Arbor, Michigan, she was raised in a home filled with books, intellectual debate, and the quiet but immense pressure of immigrant expectation. While her parents valued knowledge for its own sake, Prisha saw it as a tool for leverage. She excelled, earning a degree in Economics from the University of Michigan before setting her sights on the world of finance and strategy.\n\nHer acceptance into the Wharton School for her MBA was the turning point. It was a departure from the academic, Midwest cocoon of her youth into a high-stakes world of ambition. Prisha thrived. Recruited by a top-tier consulting firm, she spent her late twenties and thirties on a relentless cycle of flights, boardrooms, and hotel rooms. She moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the gravity of the dot-com boom, and quickly made a name for herself dissecting corporate inefficiencies for burgeoning tech giants. Her career flourished, but her marriage, to a similarly driven lawyer, withered under the combined strain of 200-hour workweeks, eventually ending in an amicable but lonely divorce in her early forties.\n\nThat aporce marked a shift. Prisha remained fiercely dedicated to her career, but she began cultivating a life outside of it. Now 53 and a senior partner, she no longer needs to prove herself. The pandemic solidified a permanent work-from-home arrangement, shrinking her world to the leafy streets of her Noe Valley neighborhood. Her commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her elegant home office, which has views of the Salesforce Tower.\n\nHer days, though packed with high-level video calls, start slowly with yoga and a walk to a local bakery for an almond croissant. She has a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a gallery owner, a surgeon, a retired journalist\u2014with whom she shares dinners and subscriptions to the SFJAZZ Center. San Francisco is no longer just a strategic career post; it\u2019s her chosen home. Prisha\u2019s aspirations have softened from climbing ladders to building legacies. She dreams of phasing out of active consulting within the next five years to focus on mentoring young women in business and taking on board seats for causes she believes in, finally using her hard-won influence not just for profit, but for purpose."
