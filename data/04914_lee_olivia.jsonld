Raised in Oakland, she was the only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small, bustling Cantonese restaurant. Her parents, pragmatic and hardworking, envisioned a future for Olivia in medicine or engineering\u2014a stable path far from the long hours and thin margins of their own lives. But Olivia found her escape not in science, but in the hushed aisles of the local public library, where stories offered worlds beyond her grasp.\n\nHer choice to study English Literature at UC Berkeley was a compromise her parents tolerated. The true turning point came during a volunteer shift at a community center, where she helped a struggling teenager discover a passion for fantasy novels. The spark of connection she felt in that moment was profound, solidifying her decision to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science at San Jose State. It was a career path her parents met with quiet disappointment, seeing it as a step down from their ambitions for her.\n\nNow, at 36, Olivia is the Senior Librarian at a prestigious private boarding school nestled in San Francisco's Presidio Heights. Her 0.0-mile commute is a key feature of her life; she lives in a small apartment in the faculty housing on the lush, self-contained campus. Her days are structured and serene, starting with the morning bell and filled with guiding students through research, curating collections, and creating a haven of intellectual curiosity.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a close-knit group of fellow educators. While professionally fulfilled, a part of her yearns for more. On weekends, she breaks from her campus bubble, taking the bus to the Inner Richmond for authentic dim sum that reminds her of home, or losing herself for hours in the vastness of Golden Gate Park. Her deepest ambition is a secret she nurtures in the quiet of her apartment: to write her own Young Adult novel, inspired by the resilient, complex teens she works with every day. Olivia has built a life as carefully curated as her library's shelves, but she dreams of one day finding her own name on a spine."

But in her lap was a library copy of *A Wrinkle in Time*, its pages smelling of dust and possibility. While the chaotic symphony of her parents' restaurant played around her, she found a defiant silence between the lines of the book. This was her first curated space, a silent world built amidst the noise, teaching her that refuge could be found anywhere.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt twenty, she sat at her parents\u2019 dinner table and announced her English major. Her father\u2019s chopsticks paused mid-air. Her mother let out a sigh so quiet it was more felt than heard. There were no shouts, only the heavy, disappointed silence that followed, thick with the ghosts of med school applications and engineering degrees. That silence was a defining weight. It taught her the cost of her quiet rebellion and instilled in her a deep-seated need to prove that a life built on words could be just as stable.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe was a sullen teenager named Marcus who claimed to hate reading. During her volunteer shift, Olivia didn\u2019t lecture him; she simply handed him a worn paperback of *The Hobbit*, talking about dragons instead of themes. He returned a week later, his eyes alive, asking for the sequel. That spark of connection\u2014of seeing a world open up for someone else\u2014was a physical jolt. It solidified her future. She wasn't just escaping into stories anymore; she was building doorways for others, a purpose that felt more real than any career her parents had imagined.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHer first night in the faculty apartment, at twenty-eight, she stood at the window overlooking the manicured campus green. The library, her new domain, was lit softly against the Presidio\u2019s evening fog. After years of striving, of quiet defiance and student housing, the profound peace of the scene washed over her. This wasn't an escape or a compromise; it was an arrival. She had built this sanctuary for herself, brick by brick, book by book. For the first time, she felt her life was perfectly, beautifully in order.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, on a quiet Sunday, she broke her routine. Instead of the park, she sat in her own apartment, the campus bells silent, and opened a blank document. Her fingers trembled as she typed the first sentence of a story. It was about a girl who lives in a floating restaurant in the Bay. The act felt both thrilling and treacherous, a secret fault line under her carefully constructed life. That single sentence was the beginning of her dream to not just shelve stories, but to finally place one of her own there."
