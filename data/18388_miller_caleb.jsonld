Raised by a public school teacher mother and a social worker father, dinner table conversations were about systemic challenges and the people who fell through their cracks. This upbringing naturally led him to pursue a Psychology degree at the University of Oregon, where he initially considered a future in clinical therapy, aiming to help people one-on-one.\n\nA post-graduation volunteer stint at a struggling health clinic became his pivotal turning point. While he was effective in counseling sessions, he was deeply frustrated by the clinic's ancient, user-hostile software that prevented patients from easily booking appointments or accessing their own records. It was then he realized his understanding of human behavior could have a greater impact not by treating individuals, but by fixing the broken systems they were forced to navigate. This revelation led him to the burgeoning field of UX (User Experience) Research, and inevitably, to San Francisco.\n\nNow, at 35, Caleb has carved out a niche for himself, applying psychological principles to make technology more accessible in the healthcare and education sectors. He finds deep satisfaction in his work, knowing his research helps create apps that an elderly person can use to manage medication or a first-generation student can use to apply for financial aid.\n\nCaleb lives in a classic bay-window apartment in NOPA (North of Panhandle) with his long-term partner, Maya, a public health policy advisor he met at a fundraiser. His daily routine begins with the 5-Fulton Muni, a 3.8-mile ride downtown where he listens to podcasts on design ethics. Evenings are often spent cooking with Maya, testing recipes from their CSA box, or going for runs through the Panhandle into Golden Gate Park. He feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s blend of technological innovation and progressive ideals. His aspiration isn't to get rich, but to eventually lead a design team for a major public health initiative. He dreams of a future where good design is a fundamental right, and maybe, just maybe, owning a small home in the Sunset with enough room for a dog."

He remembers Mr. Henderson, a man in his late seventies, jabbing a trembling finger at the clinic's archaic website. \"I just need to see the doctor,\" he'd said, his voice thick with defeat. Caleb sat with him for an hour, navigating the broken portal. It wasn't a psychological barrier; it was a design one. In that moment, sitting in the poorly lit Portland office at 23, his path crystallized. He realized he could help more people by fixing the screen than by sitting in the therapy chair.\n\n2. At 26, during his first week in San Francisco, he rode the 5-Fulton downtown alone. As the bus crested the hill near Alamo Square, revealing the Painted Ladies against the hazy skyline, he felt a profound click. This wasn't just a new city; it was the physical manifestation of his new purpose. He wasn't running from anything, but he was running *toward* this\u2014a place where his specific skills could matter. The feeling wasn't excitement, but a quiet, grounding sense of being in exactly the right place.\n\n3. He was 30, hiding near the appetizer table at a sterile fundraiser, when he met Maya. She was rolling her eyes at a politician's speech, and he'd offered a commiserating smile. They didn't talk about their jobs at first, but about the flawed system the fundraiser was meant to fix. He felt seen\u2014not just by a potential partner, but by an intellectual peer who understood. Leaving that night, he didn't just feel a spark; he felt the solid, comforting click of a missing piece of his life locking into place.\n\n4. Two years ago, he received an email forwarded from his project manager. It was from the daughter of an 82-year-old man who had used their new medication management app. \"For the first time,\" she wrote, \"Dad feels in control.\" Caleb stared at the screen, the sterile office around him disappearing. It was proof that lines of code, guided by empathy, could genuinely restore a person's dignity. It was the fulfillment of his Portland upbringing, and he saved the email in a folder labeled \"Why.\"\n\n5. Last autumn, on a run with Maya through the Panhandle as the fog rolled in, they slowed to a walk near the Conservatory of Flowers. She\u2019d leaned her head on his shoulder, and without prompting, they started talking about a dog. That conversation drifted seamlessly to a small yard, then to a specific image of a modest house in the Sunset. It wasn't a memory of ambition, but of shared contentment. It cemented that his dream wasn't just professional but deeply personal: to build a quiet, meaningful future with her."
