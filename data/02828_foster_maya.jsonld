Her father, a skilled carpenter, battled bouts of unspoken depression, a silent weight that shaped the family\u2019s emotional landscape. Witnessing his struggle without the language to address it instilled in Maya a profound desire to understand the invisible burdens people carry.\n\nAfter completing a sociology degree at the University of Oregon, she took a job at a housing non-profit. The work was frustrating; she was a cog in a bureaucratic machine, unable to address the deep-seated trauma and mental health crises of the clients she served. This experience was her turning point. Realizing she wanted to work with the root cause, not just the symptoms, she moved to the Bay Area to pursue a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career was a trial by fire as an emergency department social worker at a busy San Francisco hospital. For years, she was on the front lines, managing acute psychiatric crises, comforting families through tragedy, and navigating the city's complex systems for its most vulnerable. The work was vital but led to profound burnout. To preserve the compassion that drew her to the field, Maya transitioned to a new role: working remotely as a clinical therapist for the same healthcare network.\n\nNow, at 40, her life is centered in her quiet Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her kitchen to a room filled with soft light, comfortable chairs, and soundproofing panels. Her days are structured by back-to-back telehealth sessions, providing therapy to clients across the city. She finds solace in her routine: morning walks in the fog-dampened quiet of Golden Gate Park, a lunch break spent tending to her small balcony garden, and evenings with a small, close-knit circle of friends, most of whom also work in healthcare.\n\nMaya feels a deep, complicated connection to San Francisco. She\u2019s acutely aware of its systemic failings, yet she\u2019s dedicated her life to mending its individual fractures. Her dream isn't one of wealth or status, but of sustainability\u2014to continue her vital work without losing herself. Her aspiration is to become certified in EMDR therapy, adding another tool to her kit, and to one day coax a perfect tomato plant to fruit on her foggy city balcony."
