            "value": "Catalina Rojas-Miller is a product of two distinct worlds. Born in San Jose, she was raised by a pragmatic architect father from Ohio and a vibrant, passionate immigrant mother from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. Her childhood was a blend of structured blueprints and spontaneous salsa dancing, a duality that shaped her creative lens. The scent of her mother's ajiaco soup is as foundational to her memory as the clean lines of her father\u2019s drawings. This mix of logic and soul guided her toward a Bachelor\u2019s in Graphic Design from San Francisco State University.\n\nGraduating in the shadow of the dot-com bust, Catalina\u2019s early career was a hustle. She freelanced, designed logos for startups that vanished overnight, and learned resilience. The real turning point came in her late twenties after her mother\u2019s sudden passing. The loss crystalized her professional ambition: she no longer wanted to just make things look good; she wanted to make people *feel* something joyful and connected. This pushed her from traditional graphic design into the burgeoning field of user experience (UX), and eventually, into crafting entire human experiences.\n\nNow a Lead Experience Designer, Catalina shapes how people interact with immersive museum exhibits, high-end restaurant apps, and recreational spaces. Her work is her art form, blending digital interfaces with physical environments. She thrives on the challenge, leading a team to design seamless moments of delight.\n\nHer personal life has seen its own redesigns. A marriage in her early thirties ended amicably in her late thirties, a conscious uncoupling that left her with the hyphenated name and a renewed sense of independence. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, chefs, and tech professionals.\n\nCatalina lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant murals and culinary scene resonate with her own heritage. Her daily routine involves a 3.8-mile ride on the Muni, a day of creative problem-solving, and an evening spent either exploring a new restaurant for \"research\" or unwinding with her watercolor set. Her modest dream is to one day open her own small consultancy, crafting bespoke experiences for boutique hotels and cultural institutions, proving that good design isn't just about efficiency, but about enriching the human spirit."

            "value": "1.\nShe was seven, kneeling on a chair at the family dining table. To her left, the scent of graphite and clean paper as her father finalized blueprints, his ruler gliding with quiet authority. To her right, the kitchen air was thick with cilantro and simmering chicken from her mother\u2019s ajiaco. She remembers placing a small hand on her father\u2019s page, feeling the comforting geometry, then looking toward the vibrant chaos of the kitchen. It wasn\u2019t a conflict, but a perfect balance. This duality became the foundation of her own creative process.\n\n2.\nA month after her mother's funeral, Catalina sat in the quiet of her mother's closet. The scent of her perfume still lingered on a silk scarf. She found a worn photo album, landing on a picture of her mother, mid-laugh, flour on her cheek from making arepas. The grief was a hollow ache, but in that captured, unposed joy, a new purpose sparked. Design wasn't about pushing pixels; it was about creating moments like this one\u2014moments of pure, unselfconscious delight. It was the day she decided to pivot her entire career.\n\n3.\nIt was the opening night for her first major museum project. She stood anonymously in the back, watching a family interact with the immersive tidepool exhibit she\u2019d designed. A young girl, maybe ten, reached out and touched the projected water, gasping as digital fish scattered from her fingertips. Her father smiled. In that shared, seamless moment of wonder, Catalina felt a quiet, profound rightness. This was what she was meant to do: build small bridges of joy between people and their world. The memory remains her professional anchor.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the late afternoon light slanting through the window of their Noe Valley apartment. She and her husband sat at the kitchen table, the divorce papers signed between them. There were no tears, just a shared, heavy silence and the quiet hum of the refrigerator. He pushed the stack toward her, and she pushed his back. It was a release, not a failure. That amicable end was a redesign of her life, leaving her with a hyphenated name and an unburdened sense of her own path forward.\n\n5.\nWalking home from the Muni stop on 24th Street just last week, she was struck by a familiar convergence. The brilliant colors of a new mural reminded her of Bogot\u00e1\u2019s streets, the smell of carnitas filled the air, and a flash of insight for a restaurant app she was designing struck her with crystal clarity. Grounded in the Mission\u2019s vibrant rhythm, she felt every part of her life\u2014her past, her work, her heritage\u2014click into place. This feeling of belonging, of being wholly herself, is her quietest, most cherished prize."
