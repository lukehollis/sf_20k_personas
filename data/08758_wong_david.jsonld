            "value": "David Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s western fog, born and raised in the Richmond District to parents who ran a bustling Clement Street bakery. Their days were measured in flour and sugar, their dreams rooted in practicality and financial security for their only son. Honoring their wishes, David attended San Francisco State University and earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration, a sensible choice that led to a stable, but soul-crushing, logistics job in the Financial District.\n\nThe turning point came at 28. Exhausted by spreadsheets, he impulsively volunteered for a small, struggling theater company in the Mission. The organized chaos backstage, the scent of sawdust and old velvet, and the shared thrill of an opening night felt more like home than his parents' bakery ever had. He discovered his knack for logistics and budgeting wasn't a corporate curse but a superpower in the underfunded arts world.\n\nHe quit his job, took a massive pay cut, and started over as an assistant stage manager. Over the next decade, David became an indispensable figure in the Bay Area arts scene, moving from scrappy theater groups to dance companies and eventually landing his current role as a Production Manager for a renowned multidisciplinary arts organization.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a spacious live/work loft in a converted SoMa warehouse that also houses his company's primary rehearsal space. His days are a whirlwind of budgets, lighting vendor calls, and placating temperamental directors, a routine he navigates with a signature calm. He is the pragmatic anchor for his circle of artist friends, the one who remembers to file for permits and order the gaffer tape.\n\nDavid feels an intense connection to San Francisco\u2019s persistent, gritty creative soul. He\u2019s seen countless venues and artists priced out, a loss he feels personally. His dream isn't to be in the spotlight, but to secure a permanent, endowed space for his company, creating a legacy of stability. He doesn't make the art himself, but in a city constantly threatening to erase it, David ensures the show can, and does, go on."
