Born in Daly City to a Filipino immigrant mother, a compassionate nurse, and an Irish-American father, a stoic union longshoreman, Micah grew up navigating the space between two vibrant cultures. He never felt wholly one or the other, a feeling that nudged him toward a path of pragmatic ambition. He saw a business degree as a universal language, earning his Bachelor's from San Francisco State University as a ticket to a stable future his parents worked so hard to provide.\n\nHe caught the very beginning of the digital wave, landing a junior role in the fledgling e-commerce department of a legacy Bay Area retailer in the late 90s. While others chased dot-com fortunes, Micah learned the nuts and bolts of moving physical goods through a digital world. He wasn't a founder, but a builder\u2014the reliable manager who weathered the bust of the early 2000s, his pragmatism once again proving its worth. Over two decades, he steadily climbed the corporate ladder, his expertise growing in lockstep with the industry itself.\n\nA significant turning point came in his late thirties when a decade-long relationship dissolved, a casualty of his demanding career and a mutual drifting apart. The breakup prompted him to finally move from the suburbs into the city, seeking a change of scenery and a life more his own. He settled in Hayes Valley, appreciating its central location and vibrant, walkable streets.\n\nNow, at 49, Micah\u2019s life has found a comfortable rhythm. His days begin with a walk with his rescue terrier, Buster, followed by a quiet Uber ride to his SoMa office. As a Director, he spends his days in meetings, mentoring his team and strategizing for the ever-shifting retail landscape. Evenings are for unwinding\u2014either cooking at home or meeting a few old friends at a familiar wine bar. He has achieved the stability he craved, but now quietly aspires for more. He dreams of taking extended trips to both the Philippines and Ireland to connect with the roots of his identity, and holds a private hope for a new partnership, one built on shared experience rather than youthful ambition."

Standing small beside his stoic dad, Micah watched massive cranes lift containers from a ship that had sailed from Manila. In the metallic groan of the machinery, he didn't just see cargo; he felt the tangible weight of providing. That day cemented his ambition not for flashy success, but for the quiet, unshakeable stability his father embodied\u2014the power of building something real and dependable.\n\n2. In the spring of 2001, he walked into a corporate graveyard. The dot-com bust had finally hit, and the once-vibrant office was hollowed out, the Aeron chairs of the \"ideas people\" sitting empty. But his small e-commerce team, the ones managing physical inventory, were still there. Amid the quiet panic, Micah felt a profound sense of vindication. It was the moment he knew his pragmatic, unglamorous approach wasn\u2019t a weakness; it was a survival skill. Flash fades, but substance endures.\n\n3. After the movers left his new Hayes Valley apartment, the silence was deafening. It was his first night alone in a decade. He stood at the window, watching the city lights blur, the grief of his breakup a physical weight in his chest. But beneath the loneliness was a terrifying, electric hum of freedom. He was untethered from the suburban life he\u2019d built for someone else. In that quiet, solitary moment, he realized his next project wasn\u2019t for work; it was building a life that was entirely his own.\n\n4. The smell of garlic frying always brings him back to their Daly City kitchen. He remembers his mother\u2019s hands, a nurse's hands, showing his clumsy childhood fingers how to roll lumpia, folding the delicate wrapper just so. *\u201cLike this, anak,\u201d* she\u2019d murmur. It wasn't just a cooking lesson; it was a quiet transfer of heritage, a moment of pure belonging. He can still feel the warmth of that memory, a persistent ache that now fuels his dream of finally seeing the place she came from.\n\n5. He wasn't looking for a dog. But at the SPCA, a scruffy terrier cowered at the back of the kennel, shivering. Micah knelt, held out his hand, and waited. The dog, Buster, crept forward and nudged his palm with a cold, wet nose. In that simple, trusting gesture, a part of Micah that had been dormant for years cracked open. It wasn't a strategic decision or a planned outcome; it was the simple, profound act of being needed. It was the beginning of home."
