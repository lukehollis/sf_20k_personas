The only child of immigrants from Guangdong, China, she grew up in the back of her parents\u2019 small grocery store, her childhood soundtrack a mix of Cantonese chatter and the clanging bell above the door. From a young age, she was their translator and navigator, deciphering utility bills and city permit applications, an experience that planted the seed of her future career. She saw firsthand how policy, often written in inaccessible language, directly impacted her family's livelihood and stress levels.\n\nThis formative experience propelled her through Lowell High School and into UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Master of Public Policy. An internship with a tenants' rights organization in the Mission District was a key turning point, solidifying her desire to work not in distant government halls, but on the ground, advocating for communities like the one she grew up in.\n\nNow 29, Mei Lin is a Policy Analyst for a non-profit focused on housing stability and affordability. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a desk in the corner of her Inner Richmond apartment, where she spends her days immersed in data sets and legislative drafts. Her work is her passion; she feels the weight of the city\u2019s housing crisis personally, viewing every statistic as a family potentially displaced.\n\nHer life is a quiet blend of intense work and simple city pleasures. Weekday evenings are often spent reading policy papers, but weekends are for herself. She finds peace hiking Lands End, meets her few close friends for dim sum on Clement Street, and visits her parents every Sunday, conversations still flowing easily between English and Cantonese. She is deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014not the glittering tech hub, but the city of neighborhoods, of family-run businesses, of shared histories. Her dream isn't fame or fortune, but to author a piece of successful housing legislation that tangibly helps families like her own remain in the city they helped build. For Mei Lin, San Francisco is not just a home; it\u2019s a responsibility."
