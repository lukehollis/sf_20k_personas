The son of first-generation Chinese immigrants from Guangzhou, he was given a decidedly Western name by parents who believed assimilation was the key to a stable American life. He grew up in the Outer Sunset, in a world defined by the persistent Pacific fog, the roar of the ocean a few blocks away, and the comforting rhythm of family-owned bakeries and restaurants on Taraval Street. His childhood was practical and disciplined, focused on academics and filial duty, with weekend dim sum serving as the primary social event.\n\nThis pragmatic upbringing shaped his educational path. While others chased passions in art or tech, Liam pursued a Bachelor's degree in Public Policy at UC Davis. He wasn't a fiery activist but a methodical observer, fascinated by the complex machinery of governance that shaped his family\u2019s neighborhood\u2014from MUNI line changes to small business permits. A key turning point was a college internship where he witnessed firsthand how a well-written policy could directly improve community services. It solidified his belief that real change happens not in protests, but in memos and budget meetings.\n\nNow, at 24, Liam works as an Administrative Assistant for a city department. His 0.0-mile commute is a modern perk; he works remotely from his small apartment, a converted in-law unit just a few streets from his parents' home. His days are a quiet routine of emails, scheduling, and digital paperwork, the bureaucratic hum a familiar backdrop. He maintains a tight circle of high school friends, now scattered across the Bay Area, connecting through group chats and occasional weekend meetups. Socially, he is reserved but loyal, preferring a long walk along Ocean Beach with a single friend to a crowded bar.\n\nLiam\u2019s ambition is as quiet and steady as the fog rolling over the hills. He sees his current role not as a final destination but as the ground floor. He diligently studies organizational charts and policy drafts, hoping to eventually become a policy analyst. His dream is to have a tangible impact on the city that raised him, specifically on housing or public transit\u2014issues he sees affecting his family and neighbors daily. He is playing the long game, a true son of the Sunset: patient, observant, and deeply rooted in home."
