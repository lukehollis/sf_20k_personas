Born to a young mother who couldn't care for him, Daniel was adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese-American couple, David and May Leung, who owned a small grocery store in the Sunset District. Growing up a white child in a bustling Cantonese-speaking household, Daniel felt like a cherished, unique artifact. He learned the rhythm of mahjong tiles and the scent of traditional soups, yet always remained a gentle observer, a bridge between worlds. This outsider-insider perspective fostered a deep fascination with history, stories, and the careful organization of information.\n\nHis educational path was a straight line toward this passion. After earning a B.A. in History from UC Davis, he pursued a Master's in Library and Information Science at San Jose State, just as the digital revolution was taking hold. A key turning point came during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s; while working his first archival job, he witnessed entire digital histories of failed startups vanish overnight. This cemented his mission: to preserve the ephemeral data of the modern world. He dedicated himself to becoming an expert in digital preservation, eventually rising to become the Lead Digital Archivist for a major information services firm downtown.\n\nDaniel\u2019s life is one of quiet order. He lives in the same rent-controlled Inner Richmond apartment he found twenty years ago, a sanctuary filled with books, meticulously organized hard drives, and the lingering scent of good tea. His 1.5-mile commute on the MUNI bus is a time for reading or observing the city he has meticulously cataloged in his mind. Though his adoptive parents have passed, he remains close to his cousins, joining them for dim sum on weekends. He is single, having had one serious long-term relationship that ended amicably a decade ago; his work has since been his most constant companion.\n\nHis aspiration is not grand ambition, but quiet legacy. He dreams of successfully launching a project to archive the city\u2019s early web history, ensuring the digital ghosts of San Francisco\u2019s past are never truly lost. Daniel Leung, the boy who learned to find his place by understanding others, now spends his days making sure that every story has a place to be found."

His mother, May, would call out items in rapid Cantonese, and Daniel would carefully make a checkmark on the paper ledger. He couldn't always keep up, but the weight of the clipboard felt important. It was his first act of curation, learning that love and belonging could be found in the quiet order of things, even in a language he only partially commanded. It taught him to find his place by creating it.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001. A senior manager handed him a drive and told him to wipe it\u2014the entire digital life of a failed pet supply startup. As the progress bar filled, Daniel felt a physical sickness. He saw not just code, but business plans, emails, fledgling online communities\u2026 a whole micro-history turning to nothing. In that moment of sanctioned digital erasure, his quiet passion for history became a fierce mission. He would not just catalog the past; he would save it from the careless present.\n\n3.\nAfter his father passed, Daniel stood in the empty grocery store one last time. The shelves were bare, the familiar scent of produce and incense replaced by the smell of dust and old wood. He ran a hand over the worn counter where his father had tallied receipts for decades. In that silent space, he felt the weight of a history about to vanish. This loss wasn't just familial; it was archival. It solidified his resolve that no story, no matter how small, should ever be completely erased.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the conversation a decade ago when Sarah left. \"You love the *idea* of us,\" she'd said, not unkindly. \"You've curated our history, but you're afraid to live in the messy present.\" It was a moment of painful clarity. He realized his instinct was to preserve moments, to freeze them perfectly, not to navigate their unpredictable flow. The amicable end of their story became another carefully cataloged file in his mind, confirming that his truest, most constant companion would always be the past itself.\n\n5.\nLast winter, on his usual 38R bus ride, he watched a young woman sketching the wet, neon-lit street in a notebook. She was meticulously capturing a fleeting moment of fog and light. Daniel felt a surge of quiet kinship. He wasn't just commuting; he was witnessing another archivist at work. The city wasn't just a place he lived but a vast, collaborative project of memory-keeping. That silent acknowledgment reaffirmed his own quiet purpose: to make sure all those sketches, both analog and digital, could one day find a home."
