            "value": "Sophia Looking Horse carries two worlds within her name. Her father, a Lakota man from the Cheyenne River Reservation, moved to the Bay Area during the federal relocation programs of the 1960s, finding work but losing his connection to the land. Her mother, a white art historian from a family of academics, met him at a protest during the Occupation of Alcatraz. Sophia was raised in Oakland, a childhood split between the vibrant, multicultural energy of the East Bay and summers in South Dakota, where the vast sky and the weight of tradition felt like a different universe.\n\nThis duality shaped her entire life. She pursued a Master\u2019s in Art History, deliberately focusing on Contemporary Indigenous Art, frustrated by how her paternal culture was so often treated as a historical artifact, frozen in museum glass. Her early career in established institutions like the de Young Museum was a study in polite resistance, trying to push for the inclusion of living Native artists in contemporary galleries, not just ethnographic wings.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. After a particularly disheartening curatorial decision by her superiors, she cashed out her savings, secured a small business loan, and leased a ground-floor live/work loft in the Mission District. She named her gallery *O\u010dh\u00e9thi Contemporary*, a nod to the Seven Council Fires of her people. The 0.0-mile commute was a necessity born of dedication; her life and work were now one.\n\nAt 46, Sophia\u2019s days are a seamless blend of personal and professional. Mornings are spent in her sunlit apartment upstairs, reviewing submissions from artists across North America. Afternoons and evenings are for the gallery below, a space filled not with sterile white walls, but with warm textures, challenging canvases, and intricate sculptures that hum with living stories. Her relationships are woven into her work; the artists are her chosen family, her patrons are her community. She isn't married and has no children, but she is a matriarch in her own right.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is rooted in the Mission\u2019s legacy of activism and art. She sees the neighborhood\u2019s murals and vibrant cultural mix as a reflection of her own identity. Sophia\u2019s dream is already in motion, but her aspiration is to make *O\u010dh\u00e9thi Contemporary* a self-sustaining institution\u2014a permanent, powerful platform ensuring that the world sees Indigenous art not as a relic of the past, but as a vital, evolving force in the present."
