Born and raised in the Richmond District to parents who ran a small laundromat, her upbringing was a study in pragmatism and hard work. They encouraged a stable path, so Priya dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College, envisioning a secure, if uninspired, future in office management. For nearly a decade, she lived that life, working as an administrative assistant for a downtown accounting firm, the rhythmic hum of office machines a dull soundtrack to her days.\n\nThe true turning point was not a career move but a personal one: motherhood. When her son, Rohan, was born, Priya\u2019s world reoriented. Enrolling him in a small, play-based cooperative preschool in the Inner Sunset, she discovered her true calling not in spreadsheets, but in story time and finger-painting. She saw magic in the \"beautiful chaos\" of early learning and found she had a natural talent for calming tantrums and encouraging curiosity.\n\nFollowing an amicable divorce in her early thirties, Priya made a decisive change. She left the corporate world, earned a certificate in Early Childhood Education, and took a position as an assistant teacher at the very preschool her son had attended.\n\nNow at 50, Priya\u2019s life is contained within a few blocks of the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her cozy in-law apartment to the preschool on the ground floor of a neighboring house. Her days are a whirlwind of mediating disputes over toy dinosaurs, wiping away tears, and celebrating the triumph of a successfully tied shoelace. Her social life is woven into the fabric of her community\u2014coffee with the lead teacher, conversations with parents during pickup, and weekly dinners with Rohan, now a student at SF State.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or tourist landmarks, but of foggy mornings in Golden Gate Park and grocery shopping on Irving Street. Priya\u2019s dream is simple and deeply felt: to one day open her own small, in-home preschool, a nurturing space built entirely on her philosophy of kindness and play. It is a quiet ambition, pursued not for profit, but for the profound joy of helping little people begin their journey."

At sixteen, doing homework at the folding counter, she accepted that her future would be practical and secure, like a neatly folded sheet. That memory isn't sad, but foundational. It represents the quiet, responsible path she had to walk away from, making her eventual leap into the \"beautiful chaos\" of teaching a true act of courage. It taught her to value joy over mere stability.\n\n2.\nShe remembers her first volunteer day at Rohan\u2019s preschool when she was 30. A little girl was sobbing, red-faced, over a broken crayon. While other adults fussed, Priya knelt down, not with words, but with a quiet presence. The girl\u2019s sobs softened into hiccups. In that moment, the silent hum of her office felt a world away. She felt a surge of purpose so clear and potent it was almost a physical shock. It was the first time she felt truly competent, truly *herself*.\n\n3.\nShe can still feel the tremble in her hand as she signed her resignation letter at 33. She was recently divorced, trading a steady paycheck for a student grant and an uncertain future. The fear was a cold weight in her stomach, but beneath it was a fierce, humming excitement. It was the moment she stopped living the life she was *supposed* to have and started building the one she needed. That single act of courage became the bedrock of her new, more authentic self.\n\n4.\nShe treasures the memory of a four-year-old named Maya, who for months had only communicated in nods. One rainy afternoon during story time a few years ago, Maya tugged her sleeve and whispered, \u201cAgain?\u201d Priya\u2019s heart felt like it stopped and restarted. It wasn\u2019t a loud victory, but a seismic one. It confirmed her philosophy: that patience, kindness, and play could unlock a child's entire world. That single word was more validating than any promotion she had ever received.\n\n5.\nLast autumn, walking with a near-grown Rohan through a foggy Golden Gate Park, she pointed to a charming house bordering the Panhandle. \"Something like that,\" she said, \"for my school.\" He squeezed her shoulder, understanding everything she didn't say. In that moment, her dream felt not like a distant fantasy, but a gentle, inevitable next step. It wasn't about ambition, but about culmination\u2014a life of quiet joys distilled into a space of her own, right in the neighborhood that held her heart."
