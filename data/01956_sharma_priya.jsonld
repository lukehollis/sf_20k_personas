Born and raised in the Richmond District to parents who ran a small laundromat, her upbringing was a study in pragmatism and hard work. They encouraged a stable path, so Priya dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College, envisioning a secure, if uninspired, future in office management. For nearly a decade, she lived that life, working as an administrative assistant for a downtown accounting firm, the rhythmic hum of office machines a dull soundtrack to her days.\n\nThe true turning point was not a career move but a personal one: motherhood. When her son, Rohan, was born, Priya\u2019s world reoriented. Enrolling him in a small, play-based cooperative preschool in the Inner Sunset, she discovered her true calling not in spreadsheets, but in story time and finger-painting. She saw magic in the \"beautiful chaos\" of early learning and found she had a natural talent for calming tantrums and encouraging curiosity.\n\nFollowing an amicable divorce in her early thirties, Priya made a decisive change. She left the corporate world, earned a certificate in Early Childhood Education, and took a position as an assistant teacher at the very preschool her son had attended.\n\nNow at 50, Priya\u2019s life is contained within a few blocks of the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her cozy in-law apartment to the preschool on the ground floor of a neighboring house. Her days are a whirlwind of mediating disputes over toy dinosaurs, wiping away tears, and celebrating the triumph of a successfully tied shoelace. Her social life is woven into the fabric of her community\u2014coffee with the lead teacher, conversations with parents during pickup, and weekly dinners with Rohan, now a student at SF State.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or tourist landmarks, but of foggy mornings in Golden Gate Park and grocery shopping on Irving Street. Priya\u2019s dream is simple and deeply felt: to one day open her own small, in-home preschool, a nurturing space built entirely on her philosophy of kindness and play. It is a quiet ambition, pursued not for profit, but for the profound joy of helping little people begin their journey."
