The only son of hardworking immigrants from Mumbai, he grew up in Fremont, where the air was thick with the scent of his mother's cooking and the weight of his father\u2019s dream: for Michael to become a doctor. He was a dutiful son, excelling in math and science, but his heart was captivated by how things were made. He would spend hours disassembling old radios and clocks, not to fix them, but to understand the logic of their construction.\n\nThis fascination led him to defy expectations and pursue a Bachelor's in Industrial Design from California College of the Arts. It was a compromise he brokered with his parents\u2014practical, but still creative. His early career was a series of freelance gigs and a stint at a promising hardware startup that spectacularly imploded during the dot-com bust. This failure became his most important turning point. He realized he was less interested in designing the final, flashy product and more obsessed with perfecting the system that created it. He pivoted, retooling his skills to become a Manufacturing Process Engineer.\n\nNow, at 46, Michael has crafted a life of deliberate precision. His 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his existence; he lives in a spacious live/work loft in Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial past speaks to his soul. His workshop, filled with CNC machines and 3D printers, is on the ground floor, his minimalist apartment above. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago\u2014his partner wanted a suburban life he couldn't imagine leaving his workshop for\u2014he has embraced a focused, almost monastic routine. His social circle is small but tight: fellow engineers, designers, and artisans he meets at local breweries.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco isn't through its boisterous tech scene, but its quieter maker culture. His days are spent consulting for companies, streamlining their production lines from his loft. His ultimate dream is to stop consulting and use his perfected processes to launch his own small line of high-end, beautifully engineered home goods. For Michael, success is no longer about a big exit or pleasing his parents; it\u2019s about achieving a perfect, elegant efficiency in his work and in his life."
