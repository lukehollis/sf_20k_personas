Raised in the suburban warmth of Fremont, his father, a software engineer, and his mother, a meticulous bank teller, envisioned a stable, lucrative future for him in tech or medicine. Arjun dutifully enrolled in computer science at UC Davis, but found the code and algorithms sterile, lacking the human connection he craved. The turning point came not in a classroom, but in his own home. His younger sister\u2019s battle with severe anxiety was compounded by a healthcare system that felt culturally tone-deaf, unable to grasp the nuances of their family's experience. Witnessing her struggle, Arjun found his purpose.\n\nHe pivoted, abandoning his lucrative tech path for the demanding, under-appreciated world of social work. He earned his Master of Social Work (MSW) from UC Berkeley, drawn to the city's progressive and complex social landscape. His early career was a trial by fire, working in crisis intervention at a busy San Francisco hospital. There, he honed his skills in empathy and resilience, learning to hold space for the city's most vulnerable while building the emotional fortitude to keep from drowning in their trauma.\n\nNow at 39, Arjun\u2019s life is one of structured calm. He lives in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in NoPa, where his commute is a walk from his kitchen to the spare room he\u2019s converted into a telehealth office. His days are a sequence of virtual sessions, guiding clients through grief, addiction, and anxiety from behind a screen. He begins each morning with a run through the Panhandle, clearing his mind before taking on the emotional weight of others.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep but quiet. He isn\u2019t found at trendy bars but at neighborhood farmers' markets or delving into the stacks at Green Apple Books. His social circle is small and intimate, anchored by his partner, a landscape architect who understands his need for quiet decompression after work. Arjun\u2019s dream is to one day open a small, private practice in the Inner Richmond, specializing in providing culturally competent mental healthcare for the South Asian community. He hopes to be the resource for others that his own family desperately needed, a quiet force for healing in the city that shaped him."
