The only son of a pragmatic high school history teacher and a methodical librarian, David learned early to appreciate structured systems and predictable outcomes. While his peers pursued sports, he diagrammed historical battles and organized his book collection by the Dewey Decimal System. This intellectual rigor earned him a scholarship to UC Berkeley, a move that felt like stepping onto another planet. The chaotic energy of California initially overwhelmed him, but he soon found his footing.\n\nInstead of a traditional MBA, David pursued a Master\u2019s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology at Stanford. He was fascinated not by balance sheets, but by the human architecture of a company\u2014how to make teams more efficient and workflows more elegant. This niche expertise made him a coveted asset in the world of management consulting. He joined a top-tier firm right after graduation and began his relentless ascent. His talent was in seeing the human patterns behind corporate dysfunction, translating complex emotional dynamics into the crisp logic of flowcharts and strategic roadmaps.\n\nNow at 40, his life is contained within the sleek, minimalist walls of his Hayes Valley condo, where his commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to his standing desk. His success is undeniable, yet it has come at a cost. A long-term relationship dissolved five years ago, a casualty of 80-hour work weeks and his inability to log off. His connection to San Francisco is largely transactional; he appreciates the world-class restaurants he can get delivered and the proximity of Golden Gate Park for his disciplined 6 AM runs, but knows few of his neighbors.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are a blur of international Zoom calls and data analysis. He tells himself his goal is to make partner at his firm. But in rare, quiet moments, staring out at the city lights, a different aspiration flickers. He dreams of applying his skills to something with more soul\u2014perhaps founding a B-Corp or advising non-profits. He fears he has optimized the humanity out of his own life, and at the peak of his career, David is beginning to consult on his most challenging project yet: himself."
