The son of Iranian immigrants who settled in San Jose in the late 1980s, his childhood was defined by the sprawling suburban grid. His father, an electrical engineer, and his mother, a math teacher, instilled in him an appreciation for logical systems. From his bedroom window, Kian would trace the paths of cars on the freeway, fascinated by the patterns of movement. This fascination evolved into a critical analysis during his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley, where he saw how urban design could either isolate or connect communities. He stayed at Berkeley for his Master's in Urban Planning, determined to build cities for people, not just for cars.\n\nHis career path was a direct application of his ideals. Starting as a junior analyst, Kian is now a Senior Transportation Planner, focusing on improving the efficiency and equity of San Francisco's public transit system. A pivotal moment came early in his career during a public outreach meeting for a new bus route. Hearing firsthand from elderly residents and low-income families about how a reliable bus line would be their lifeline to groceries, healthcare, and family, solidified his mission. He wasn\u2019t just drawing lines on a map; he was creating pathways to opportunity.\n\nNow 34, Kian lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the Duboce Triangle, a neighborhood he chose specifically for its transit access. His own 2.8-mile commute on the N-Judah is a daily field test of his work. He\u2019s currently single after a long-term relationship ended two years ago, a shift that deepened his connection to his close-knit group of friends and his family in the South Bay. His life is a balance of professional focus and personal enjoyment\u2014analyzing traffic flow data by day, and exploring the city\u2019s culinary scene or hiking in the Marin Headlands by weekend.\n\nKian\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He feels the city\u2019s pulse on his daily commute and sees its future in his blueprints. His primary aspiration is to play a key role in a major infrastructure project, one that will leave a lasting, positive mark on the city he now calls home. He dreams of a San Francisco that is more accessible, equitable, and sustainable, and he wakes up every day dedicating his career to making that vision a reality."

His father came in and, instead of telling him to sleep, explained the logic of on-ramps and cloverleaf interchanges. In that moment, the chaotic blur of cars became a beautiful, intricate system. It wasn\u2019t just a view; it was his first lesson in how elegant design could bring order to the world, a principle that would guide his entire life.\n\n2.\nHe was 26, nervously presenting bus route options in a stuffy Bayview community room. An elderly woman, gripping her cane, spoke about visiting her husband's grave at the lone cemetery on the route. \"Your line,\" she said, her voice shaking slightly, \"is the only way I can see him.\" The abstract lines on his map suddenly had a soul. Kian felt the weight of her words settle in his chest, a heaviness that became his lifelong professional compass: he was building connections, not just corridors.\n\n3.\nHe was 32. The weekend after his partner moved out, the silence in his Duboce Triangle apartment was deafening. He got on the N-Judah with no destination, just watching the neighborhoods blur into the sunset. For the first time, the transit system he obsessed over wasn't a problem to solve, but a gentle, rocking cradle. The anonymous rhythm of the city held him when he couldn\u2019t hold himself together, teaching him that some of life\u2019s most important journeys have no logical endpoint.\n\n4.\nLast year, on a foggy Saturday, his friends dragged him on a hike in the Marin Headlands. As they reached a crest, the fog suddenly broke, and the entire city unfolded below, glinting in the sun. He could trace the path of the Golden Gate Bridge, a structure of pure, beautiful logic. But it was the messy, vibrant city it connected to that filled him with awe. He felt a sharp, clear sense of belonging, realizing home wasn't just a system to perfect, but a place to love.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, he stood anonymously near a newly installed bus shelter he\u2019d helped design in the Outer Sunset. He watched a mother with a stroller easily board a bus using the new raised platform, and an elderly man sit comfortably out of the wind. It was a small change, invisible to most. But for Kian, seeing his digital model become a seamless, human reality sent a jolt of quiet pride through him. This was it. This was the work."
