Adopted as an infant by a kind, middle-class couple from suburban Ohio, he grew up as the only Asian face in a sea of homogeneity. His parents, the Millers, gave him love and security, but could never fully bridge the quiet, cultural gulf he felt. This sense of being an outsider-insider would shape his entire life.\n\nHe sought refuge in stories, leading him to San Francisco State University to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in History. He was fascinated by lineages, origins, and the narratives people build for themselves. In the vibrant diversity of SF, David felt a sense of belonging for the first time. After graduating, however, his history degree felt more like a passion than a profession. Adrift and needing work, he took a temporary job at a stylish home goods store in Hayes Valley.\n\nTo his surprise, he thrived. The chaos of retail was something he could organize, the customers were stories he could briefly enter and then exit, and the products were tangible pieces of a curated life. He had a natural talent for management and aesthetics. His key turning point came a decade ago when the owner of the store, \"Aether,\" offered him the full-time manager position, which included the lease on the small, one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop.\n\nNow, at 43, David\u2019s life is a quiet life stitched into the fabric of Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of stairs. His world is a neatly curated four-block radius: coffee from the barista he knows by name, a beer at the corner bar, and groceries from the local market. He is a familiar, respected face in his neighborhood\u2014friendly, but retaining a professional distance.\n\nWhile content, a quiet longing persists. He dreams of taking a trip to Seoul, not to find his birth family, but to simply walk the streets and feel a connection to the history he has only read about. For now, he finds solace in his orderly existence, a man who has built a stable, beautiful world for himself, one carefully chosen object at a time."

But his was the only Asian face. It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling, just\u2026 a fact. A quiet, unbridgeable space in an image of perfect belonging. That silent observation taught him to see life from a slight distance, planting the seed of his lifelong search for history and context, for a narrative that made sense of his own unique place in the world.\n\n2.\nHis first semester at SF State, age 18. He was packed onto the MUNI N Judah line, shoulder-to-shoulder with people of every imaginable background. He saw faces that looked like his alongside countless others. For the first time, his own features felt completely unremarkable. The relief was a physical thing, a letting go of a tension he hadn't known he was holding. He wasn't an outsider here; he was just another person in the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic story. This was when San Francisco truly became home.\n\n3.\nHe was 33, adrift. Margaret, the owner of Aether, called him into her small office. He expected a talk about sales figures. Instead, she slid two keys across the desk. \"The store manager position is yours,\" she\u2019d said. \"And so is the apartment upstairs, if you want it.\" He remembers the surprising weight of the cold brass in his palm. It wasn't just a job; it was an anchor. It was the moment his drifting life clicked into place, offering him a foundation built on aesthetics and order.\n\n4.\nHis first night in the apartment above Aether. He owned little, just a mattress on the floor. Through the open window, he could hear the faint murmur of Hayes Street settling down. Below his feet, silent and still, was the shop\u2014his domain. He felt a profound sense of quiet possession, of a world contained. This small space was the first place that felt entirely his, a kingdom he could finally curate and control from the ground up, solidifying his love for an orderly, self-made existence.\n\n5.\nAbout two years ago, unpacking a new shipment of modern Korean ceramics for the shop. He had a history book about the Joseon dynasty open on the counter. He paused, holding a simple, celadon-glazed cup, its clean lines echoing the photos in his book. In that moment, the two halves of his life\u2014the history he studied and the tangible objects he sold\u2014fused. It was a quiet, bittersweet pang: a connection felt across centuries, sharpening the persistent, gentle pull of a place he\u2019d never seen."
