Adopted as an infant by a kind, middle-class couple from suburban Ohio, he grew up as the only Asian face in a sea of homogeneity. His parents, the Millers, gave him love and security, but could never fully bridge the quiet, cultural gulf he felt. This sense of being an outsider-insider would shape his entire life.\n\nHe sought refuge in stories, leading him to San Francisco State University to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in History. He was fascinated by lineages, origins, and the narratives people build for themselves. In the vibrant diversity of SF, David felt a sense of belonging for the first time. After graduating, however, his history degree felt more like a passion than a profession. Adrift and needing work, he took a temporary job at a stylish home goods store in Hayes Valley.\n\nTo his surprise, he thrived. The chaos of retail was something he could organize, the customers were stories he could briefly enter and then exit, and the products were tangible pieces of a curated life. He had a natural talent for management and aesthetics. His key turning point came a decade ago when the owner of the store, \"Aether,\" offered him the full-time manager position, which included the lease on the small, one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop.\n\nNow, at 43, David\u2019s life is a quiet life stitched into the fabric of Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of stairs. His world is a neatly curated four-block radius: coffee from the barista he knows by name, a beer at the corner bar, and groceries from the local market. He is a familiar, respected face in his neighborhood\u2014friendly, but retaining a professional distance.\n\nWhile content, a quiet longing persists. He dreams of taking a trip to Seoul, not to find his birth family, but to simply walk the streets and feel a connection to the history he has only read about. For now, he finds solace in his orderly existence, a man who has built a stable, beautiful world for himself, one carefully chosen object at a time."
