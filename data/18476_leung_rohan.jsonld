His father, a stoic immigrant from Hong Kong, met his vibrant, Gujarati-Indian mother in the late 1980s while they were both working at a restaurant in the Mission District. They raised Rohan in a small apartment in the Excelsior, a neighborhood where the scent of his mother\u2019s curries and his father\u2019s steamed fish mingled with the city\u2019s fog. Growing up, Rohan navigated the worlds of Cantonese and Gujarati, feeling equally at home at boisterous Diwali celebrations and quiet Lunar New Year gatherings.\n\nAcademically, Rohan was never a star. He was more interested in the city\u2019s mechanics than textbooks, preferring to watch the cable cars get turned around at Powell Street or trace Muni bus lines on a map. After graduating high school with a general studies diploma, he drifted for a few years, working a string of unfulfilling jobs\u2014barista, stocker at a Trader Joe's, and delivery driver. The turning point came at 22, when an uncle, a veteran Muni mechanic, suggested he apply to be an operator. \"It's a real career, Ro,\" he'd said. \"You serve the city that raised you.\"\n\nThe rigorous training was Rohan\u2019s version of college. He learned the city\u2019s veins not from a map, but from the driver's seat. Now, at 28, he operates the N Judah line, a route he considers the city\u2019s spine. His days are a rhythmic routine of pre-trip inspections, navigating traffic, and observing the cross-section of humanity that boards his train. He lives in a modest one-bedroom in the Outer Sunset, a 6.5-mile commute he makes, ironically, on a different Muni line.\n\nRohan\u2019s social life is grounded and local. He plays on a pool league with other operators and meets old high school friends for burritos in the Mission. He\u2019s quietly saving, nursing the near-impossible dream of a down payment on a small condo somewhere in his beloved, expensive city. His deeper aspiration is to one day travel to Hong Kong and Gujarat, to see the physical places that live inside him as stories and flavors. For now, he finds meaning in his work\u2014a steady hand on the wheel, moving San Francisco forward, one stop at a time."

            "value": "1.\nAt eight years old, he remembers sitting on the floor of their Excelsior apartment as his father silently counted out money for the Lunar New Year red envelopes. From the kitchen, the scent wasn't of steamed fish, but of his mother frying *thepla* for a snack, the fenugreek and turmeric a warm counterpoint to the damp fog outside. In that moment of blended aromas and quiet ritual, he felt a deep sense of peace. This wasn't two separate worlds, but simply *his* world, whole and uniquely fragrant. It solidified his identity as one thing, not a compromise.\n\n2.\nHe was fourteen, ditching a history lesson to watch the Powell Street cable car turnaround. He ignored the tourists and focused on the gripmen, their grunts of effort as they pushed the heavy car on the wooden disc. The final, solid *thunk* as it locked into place was more satisfying than any school bell. It was a moment of profound fascination with the city\u2019s unseen labor. This wasn't magic; it was muscle and mechanics. It planted the seed of seeing the city not as a place, but as a system he desperately wanted to understand.\n\n3.\nThe memory that haunts him from his aimless years was at 21, stocking Greek yogurt at Trader Joe's. The air was cold, the work mindless. Through the large front window, he saw the 38 Geary bus glide past, its interior warm and yellow, full of people heading home or out into the night. A wave of intense uselessness washed over him. They were all going somewhere, part of the city\u2019s pulse, while he stood still. That moment crystallized his deep yearning for purpose\u2014to be the one moving, not the one left behind watching.\n\n4.\nDuring his first solo run on the N Judah at 22, he remembers the exact moment he emerged from the dark of the Sunset Tunnel. The train burst into the light at Duboce Park, with the downtown skyline spread before him. His hands tightened on the controls, and a feeling of immense ownership and responsibility thrilled through him. The city wasn't just a map anymore; it was a living route under his command. He wasn't just driving a train; he was carrying a piece of San Francisco, and a piece of himself, home.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, on a drenched, foggy night, an elderly woman boarded his train at 19th Avenue. As she shuffled past, she met his eyes and gave a small, familiar nod. In quiet Cantonese, she said, \"\u591a\u8b1d, \u5f8c\u751f\" \u2014 \"Thank you, young man.\" The simple acknowledgment, a snippet of his father's tongue from a stranger, felt more meaningful than any formal commendation. It was a quiet confirmation that he belonged, that he wasn't just an operator but a recognized part of the neighborhood's daily life, serving the city that raised him."
