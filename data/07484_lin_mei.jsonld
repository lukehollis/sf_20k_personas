The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants, she grew up in the fog-kissed avenues of the Sunset District. Her parents, who ran a small neighborhood laundromat, instilled in her a formidable work ethic and the belief that security was paramount. For them, success meant a stable, high-paying job, a world away from their own daily toil. Mei, a diligent and gifted student, absorbed this lesson completely, excelling in school and earning a prestigious spot at UC Berkeley.\n\nShe chose to major in Economics, a practical degree that promised a clear path to the financial stability her parents dreamed of. Upon graduation, she landed a coveted role as a Financial Analyst for a major firm headquartered in the Financial District. It was the picture of success. However, a key life event reshaped her entire experience: her job went fully remote just as she started. Her commute became a 0.0-mile walk from her bed to her desk in a sleek, sterile SoMa apartment she\u2019d chosen for a commute she never has to make.\n\nNow, at 24, Mei\u2019s life is a paradox of proximity and isolation. She spends ten to twelve hours a day staring at spreadsheets, her world confined to the four walls of her apartment. Her primary connection to the city is through food delivery apps and the muffled sounds of cable cars and sirens. Her college friends have their own busy lives, and the spontaneous social connections of an office are absent.\n\nLately, a quiet rebellion has been stirring within her. Tucked away in her closet is her father\u2019s old film camera, a relic from his own forgotten hobby. Mei\u2019s dream is no longer just about financial security, but about finding balance. She aspires to log off at a reasonable hour, walk out her door, and rediscover her city\u2014not as a set of data points, but through a lens. Her hope is to capture the vibrant, chaotic soul of the Mission's murals and the quiet dignity of the Golden Gate Bridge at dawn, reconnecting with the home she knows by heart but has forgotten how to see."
