Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Anna immigrated to San Francisco with her engineer parents at age ten. They brought with them a pragmatic worldview and hopes for their daughter to pursue a stable, lucrative career. For a time, Anna tried to fit their mold, enrolling in a business program at a local community college. But the lessons felt sterile, a world away from her fondest memories: spending summers with her *babushka*, her hands dusted in flour, learning the alchemy of traditional Russian baking.\n\nThe turning point came during a final exam she couldn't bring herself to finish. She walked out of the classroom, dropped her courses, and took a grueling job as a prep cook in a North Beach bakery. This was her real education. For years, she absorbed techniques, working her way up from washing dishes to shaping croissants. She saved every dollar, sketching designs for elaborate, sculptural cakes in a worn notebook. Her vision wasn't just to make pastries, but to create edible art.\n\nAt 27, she poured her life savings into a tiny, neglected storefront on a vibrant Mission street, renovating the apartment above it herself. She named it \"Crumb & Canvas.\" Her 0.0-mile commute from her bed to her bakery allows for an obsessive dedication to her craft. Anna\u2019s days are a blur of mixing, baking, and decorating. Her creations are renowned in the neighborhood\u2014geode cakes that glitter with rock candy, and tarts painted with delicate floral scenes using fruit pur\u00e9es.\n\nHer social life is woven into the fabric of her block; her \"family\" consists of the coffee shop owner next door and the muralist who uses her wall. While she dreams of one day having her work featured in an art gallery or collaborating with SFMOMA, her deepest hope is simpler: to continue building a life on her own terms, one where passion is the main ingredient and her work brings a moment of beauty to others."
