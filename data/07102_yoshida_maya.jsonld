A third-generation Japanese-American, she grew up in the East Bay hearing her grandmother\u2019s stories of the family farm in the Central Valley\u2014a place of sun-scorched earth and intricate irrigation canals, lost decades ago. These tales instilled in Maya not a sense of nostalgia, but a pragmatic understanding of the delicate balance between human endeavor and natural resources. This foundation guided her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies and later to a Master's degree in Environmental Policy and Management.\n\nHer early career was spent within large environmental firms, analyzing impact reports and navigating the labyrinth of regulations. While competent, she felt a growing disconnect between her paperwork and the tangible world. The turning point came during a protracted legal battle over water rights that mirrored the struggles her own family had faced. Frustrated by corporate inertia, she struck out on her own a decade ago, establishing a consulting practice from her home. This move allowed her to choose projects she believed in, advising non-profits, local municipalities, and conscientious developers on sustainable practices.\n\nNow, at 46, Maya\u2019s life is centered in her quiet Inner Sunset flat, just a few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a brisk walk among the cypress trees, coffee from a local cafe in hand. Her work is a mix of intense focus over datasets and engaging with clients on video calls, her voice a calm authority on watershed management and green infrastructure.\n\nHer social life is a small, tightly-woven circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow consultants and neighbors met at the Sunday farmers' market. Though a long-term relationship ended amicably years ago, she finds fulfillment in her work and in her role as a doting aunt to her niece in Sacramento. Maya\u2019s deepest aspiration is to help shape a more resilient San Francisco, ensuring the city her niece will inherit is one that honors its natural landscape. She dreams of her work living on not in plaques or accolades, but in thriving urban ecosystems and cleaner bay waters."
