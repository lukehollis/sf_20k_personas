Born in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, she is the daughter of Ivan, a dissident poet who fled the Soviet Union with little more than a suitcase of books, and Mei, a pragmatic second-generation Chinese-American whose family ran a small neighborhood grocery. Anastasia\u2019s childhood was a blend of borscht and congee, of Russian fairy tales read by her melancholic father and boisterous Lunar New Year celebrations with her maternal grandparents. She grew up a quiet observer, navigating the two distinct worlds within her own home, feeling like a bridge between them.\n\nThis feeling of being an intermediary shaped her path. While she was an average student, she was deeply empathetic, often defending the kids who were considered \"different.\" She saw teaching not as a job, but as a calling to create the inclusive space she craved as a child. After earning her teaching credential from San Francisco State University, a key turning point came when she was hired at the elementary school just three blocks from her childhood home. It felt like coming full circle.\n\nNow 43, Anastasia\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her commute is a short walk, allowing her to live in the top-floor flat of the duplex her family has owned for decades; her aging mother, Mei, lives downstairs. Her daily routine is a ritual of community: a nod to the owner of the Russian bakery, a brief chat in Cantonese at the corner market, and the morning bell at school. Her social life revolves around parent-teacher conferences and dinners with a small circle of fellow teachers. A serious relationship in her thirties ended when her partner wanted to leave the expensive city, a move Anastasia couldn't fathom\u2014leaving would mean abandoning her mother, her students, and the very ground that gave her identity.\n\nAnastasia\u2019s dreams are not grand, but deeply rooted. She hopes to start a multilingual storytelling club at her school, honoring the legacy of her late father. She aspires to save enough to one day visit the villages in Guangdong and the streets of St. Petersburg that exist for her only in family stories. More than anything, she hopes to continue providing a sanctuary for her students, proving to each of them that, like her, they don't have to choose one world over another; they can be a beautiful, complex story all their own."
