Born in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, she is the daughter of Ivan, a dissident poet who fled the Soviet Union with little more than a suitcase of books, and Mei, a pragmatic second-generation Chinese-American whose family ran a small neighborhood grocery. Anastasia\u2019s childhood was a blend of borscht and congee, of Russian fairy tales read by her melancholic father and boisterous Lunar New Year celebrations with her maternal grandparents. She grew up a quiet observer, navigating the two distinct worlds within her own home, feeling like a bridge between them.\n\nThis feeling of being an intermediary shaped her path. While she was an average student, she was deeply empathetic, often defending the kids who were considered \"different.\" She saw teaching not as a job, but as a calling to create the inclusive space she craved as a child. After earning her teaching credential from San Francisco State University, a key turning point came when she was hired at the elementary school just three blocks from her childhood home. It felt like coming full circle.\n\nNow 43, Anastasia\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her commute is a short walk, allowing her to live in the top-floor flat of the duplex her family has owned for decades; her aging mother, Mei, lives downstairs. Her daily routine is a ritual of community: a nod to the owner of the Russian bakery, a brief chat in Cantonese at the corner market, and the morning bell at school. Her social life revolves around parent-teacher conferences and dinners with a small circle of fellow teachers. A serious relationship in her thirties ended when her partner wanted to leave the expensive city, a move Anastasia couldn't fathom\u2014leaving would mean abandoning her mother, her students, and the very ground that gave her identity.\n\nAnastasia\u2019s dreams are not grand, but deeply rooted. She hopes to start a multilingual storytelling club at her school, honoring the legacy of her late father. She aspires to save enough to one day visit the villages in Guangdong and the streets of St. Petersburg that exist for her only in family stories. More than anything, she hopes to continue providing a sanctuary for her students, proving to each of them that, like her, they don't have to choose one world over another; they can be a beautiful, complex story all their own."

From the living room, her grandmother\u2019s television blasted a Cantonese opera, a whirlwind of gongs and dramatic declarations. For a moment, Anastasia sat perfectly still, caught in the crosscurrent of two languages she understood but could not reconcile. It was the first time she felt less like a person and more like a quiet, necessary space between two worlds.\n\n2.\nIn fourth grade, a new boy named Alexei arrived, fresh from Odessa, with clothes that were wrong and an accent that was a target. At recess, seeing him alone by the chain-link fence, Anastasia walked over. She didn't know what to say, so she simply split her Twinkie in half and offered it to him. The look of profound relief on his face was a revelation. It wasn't about defiance; it was about creating a small, shared moment of safety. That feeling became the blueprint for her classroom.\n\n3.\nIt was a cold, foggy evening on Ocean Beach with her then-partner, Mark. He spoke of leaving San Francisco, of affordable houses and easier lives. Anastasia watched the waves crash and could only think of her mother in the flat downstairs, the scent of the Russian bakery on Geary, and the faces of her students. She realized with a hollow ache that he saw a city, but she saw an ecosystem of memory and duty she was physically incapable of leaving. That night, she chose her roots.\n\n4.\nShe was 15 when her father gave a rare reading at a small community hall in the Richmond. She didn\u2019t understand all the Russian, but she watched the faces in the small crowd\u2014other exiles, their eyes filled with a shared, unspoken longing. She saw his words build a bridge back to a lost home, offering shelter. It was then she understood that stories weren't just entertainment; they were a form of survival. This memory is the foundation of her dream to start a multilingual storytelling club.\n\n5.\nThe phone call came when she was 25, standing in her childhood bedroom. It was the principal from her old elementary school, offering her a teaching position. After hanging up, she looked out her window at the fog rolling down the avenues, the same view she\u2019d had her whole life. It wasn't just a job offer; it felt like the city itself was enfolding her, affirming her purpose. She wasn't just staying home\u2014she was being called to serve it, right where she began."
