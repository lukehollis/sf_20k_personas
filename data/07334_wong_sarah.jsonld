The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the quiet, residential avenues of the Outer Richmond. Her parents ran a small, bustling laundry service on Geary Boulevard, their lives a testament to grueling hours and deferred dreams. From a young age, they instilled in Sarah the paramount importance of education, envisioning a future for her in medicine or law\u2014a stable, prestigious career that would justify their sacrifice.\n\nSarah excelled academically, but she carried the weight of her parents\u2019 expectations like a stone. She felt an invisible pressure that was common among her peers, a silent struggle to balance familial duty with personal identity. The turning point came during her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. Volunteering with at-risk youth in Oakland, she saw her own anxieties mirrored in the faces of younger students navigating poverty, family pressure, and self-doubt. It was a profound realization: she didn\u2019t want to heal bodies; she wanted to guide minds. Defying her parents\u2019 wishes, she enrolled in a Master of Science in School Counseling program at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 35, Sarah is a counselor at a prestigious private high school in Presidio Heights. Her 0.0-mile commute is a unique perk; she lives in a small, subsidized apartment on the edge of the manicured campus, a world away from the foggy streets of her childhood. Her days are a whirlwind of scheduled appointments and crisis interventions, helping privileged teenagers navigate academic anxiety and existential pressures that are surprisingly similar to those she once faced. Her relationship with her parents has softened into a respectful understanding, though they still don't quite grasp the emotional labor her job requires.\n\nHer life is deeply enmeshed with the school. Her closest friends are fellow faculty members, and her social life often revolves around school events. On weekends, Sarah reclaims her city. She takes long walks through Golden Gate Park, seeks out the best soup dumplings in the Richmond, and loses herself in the Mission\u2019s vibrant murals. Her dream isn't wealth or status, but to see her students build lives of genuine purpose. For herself, she hopes to one day find a partner and move to her own place in a different neighborhood\u2014to finally create a life that is entirely, beautifully, her own."
