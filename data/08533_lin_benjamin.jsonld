As a second-generation Taiwanese-American, his childhood was defined by the relentless rhythm of the family business. While he honored his parents' tireless work ethic, he craved a world of abstract strategy, a departure from the tangible reality of stocking shelves and working the register.\n\nThis ambition led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in History, fascinated by the rise and fall of systems and empires. After a few aimless post-graduate years, he made a pragmatic pivot, earning an MBA from Stanford. This degree was his golden ticket, launching him into the demanding world of management consulting. His ascent was rapid; Benjamin possessed a rare talent for seeing the cold, hard logic within a company's chaos, making him invaluable for corporate restructuring.\n\nHis professional success, however, hollowed out his personal life. A long-term marriage dissolved under the strain of his 80-hour work weeks and constant travel. This was his key turning point. After the divorce, he threw himself even deeper into his work, finding a sterile comfort in data and deliverables.\n\nNow, at 47, his commute is zero miles. His world is his meticulously organized Hayes Valley condo, where he advises global corporations from a minimalist desk overlooking the city. His days are a controlled sequence of espresso, Zoom calls, and market reports. For leisure, he runs along the Embarcadero or visits the SFMOMA on quiet weekday afternoons, an observer rather than a participant in the city's pulse.\n\nThough financially secure, Benjamin feels a growing sense of emptiness. He is a man who advises corporations on their future but is profoundly uncertain of his own. His quiet aspiration is to find meaning beyond the balance sheet\u2014perhaps by leveraging his skills for a non-profit, or even by indulging a secret dream of opening a small, curated bookstore. He is a man shaped by two San Franciscos: the one of his upbringing, and the one he now observes from his panoramic window, wondering how to finally bridge the distance."
