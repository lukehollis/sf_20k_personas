Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, she is the daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, perpetually busy grocery store. Her parents preached the gospel of tangible work\u2014stocking shelves, managing inventory, serving the community. For them, success was something you could hold in your hands. While her peers aimed for four-year degrees, Li Na was drawn to the nascent pulse of the first dot-com boom, fascinated not by the code but by the physical hardware that made it all possible.\n\nShe bypassed the university track for an Associate\u2019s degree in Electronics Technology from City College of San Francisco. It was a practical choice that led to a career as a data center technician. Over two decades, she has become a veteran of the city\u2019s tech engine rooms, the unseen force who racks servers, runs coolant lines, and troubleshoots the failures that would send software engineers into a panic. She survived the dot-com bust because while companies folded, the servers they left behind still needed a caretaker.\n\nHer life is uniquely contained within a single SoMa building. Years ago, she secured a rare loft apartment in a converted warehouse, a floor directly above the mid-size data center where she works. Her commute is a 60-second elevator ride, depositing her from the quiet of her spartan apartment into the cold, humming heart of the internet. This proximity defines her existence; the low, constant thrum of the servers below is the soundtrack to her life.\n\nLi Na is a private woman. Her social circle is small, composed mostly of other \u201cblue-collar\u201d tech workers she\u2019s known for years. She dutifully visits her aging parents in the Richmond every Sunday, a journey that feels like traveling back in time. She finds a strange comfort in her solitary role, a silent guardian of digital worlds. Yet, at 46, she dreams of quiet. Her aspiration isn\u2019t a promotion but an escape\u2014a small house in the East Bay with a garden, where the only humming comes from bees and the only data she manages is the progress of her tomato plants."
