Born in San Francisco to Cantonese immigrants, her early years were spent in the back of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Richmond District. They saw her sharp mind as a ticket out of their world of long hours and thin margins, pushing her toward a secure, high-paying career.\n\nMei obliged, excelling at Lowell High School and later UC Berkeley. It was during her time at UC College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly Hastings) that her path irrevocably shifted. While her peers pursued corporate internships, Mei volunteered at a legal aid clinic serving Chinatown's monolingual seniors. Witnessing firsthand the exploitation of tenants and workers\u2014people who looked and sounded like her own parents\u2014ignited a sense of purpose that no corporate salary could match.\n\nChoosing public interest law was a quiet act of defiance. It strained her relationship with her parents, who struggled to understand her rejection of financial security. It also became the central conflict in her marriage to a corporate lawyer, a union that eventually dissolved under the weight of their fundamentally different values. The divorce was a key turning point, solidifying her commitment to her work above all else.\n\nNow, at 48, Mei is the formidable Managing Attorney for a small legal services non-profit. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of practicality; she lives in a simple unit directly above her ground-floor office. Her days are a whirlwind of mentoring young, idealistic lawyers, writing grants to keep the lights on, and strategizing complex eviction defense cases. She's a pillar for her clients, known for her calm demeanor that masks a fierce, unyielding resolve.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, consisting of a few old friends who understand the emotional toll of her work. Her great hope isn't for personal wealth or an easy retirement, but for the sustainability of her organization. Her dream is to secure enough funding and mentor a successor fiery enough to ensure that San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable residents will always have a fighter in their corner, long after she has argued her final case."
