            "value": "Rohan Sharma is the son of a story he never wanted to write. His parents, a software engineer and a doctor, emigrated from Delhi to the Bay Area in the 1980s, embedding themselves and their aspirations in the fertile ground of Silicon Valley. For them, success was a clear equation of prestigious schools and stable, high-paying jobs. Rohan dutifully followed the path, suppressing his innate love for visual arts and earning an MBA from Stanford. He spent five years in a fintech startup, analyzing data and managing portfolios in a world of code and capital that felt utterly alien to his soul.\n\nThe turning point came at age 30, during a trip to India meant to be a simple family visit. In the vibrant, chaotic workshops of Jaipur, watching artisans meticulously hand-block print fabrics, he felt a profound connection he\u2019d never experienced in a boardroom. The colors, the textures, the sense of legacy\u2014it was a visceral awakening. Within six months of his return, he quit his job, cashed out his stock options, and took an unpaid internship at a small SOMA gallery, much to his parents' initial horror. He used his business acumen not for profit maximization, but to champion artists struggling for a foothold.\n\nToday, at 42, Rohan is the manager and chief curator of \"Axis Gallery\" in Dogpatch, a respected space known for showcasing challenging contemporary works, particularly from the global diaspora. He lives in a minimalist loft apartment directly above the gallery, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to the seamless integration of his life and his passion. His days begin with coffee amidst the silent sculptures and canvases before the public arrives. His social circle is a tight-knit community of artists, collectors, and thinkers; his romantic life has been secondary to the demanding work of building the gallery's reputation.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of reinvention. He shed a predetermined identity in this city to build one that is authentically his. His dream is no longer financial security but cultural legacy: to discover a visionary artist whose work will endure long after he's gone, solidifying his small corner of the city as a true sanctuary for art."
