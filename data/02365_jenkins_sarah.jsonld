Raised in California's Central Valley, she was the daughter of a pragmatic high school history teacher and a warm, community-focused librarian. From them, she inherited a belief in public service and an acute awareness of the subtle cracks in society through which children could fall. While her peers dreamed of leaving the valley for glamour, Sarah dreamed of finding a place where she could make a tangible difference.\n\nShe moved to the Bay Area for college, earning her undergraduate degree at SF State before pursuing a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. It was there she honed her deep-seated empathy into a professional skill set, drawn to the complex, under-resourced world of public education. She chose to be a school social worker, a role she saw as a critical bridge between a child\u2019s chaotic home life and their potential in the classroom.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when a long-term relationship ended. Her partner wanted a suburban life of comfort and predictability, a world away from the demanding, emotionally taxing career Sarah refused to abandon. The difficult breakup solidified her independence and deepened her commitment to her work and her chosen city. She found a small, rent-controlled apartment just two blocks from the elementary school where she worked, making her commute a short, familiar walk.\n\nNow at 44, Sarah\u2019s life is hyperlocal. Her daily routine involves a morning walk with her rescue terrier, Buster, in McLaren Park, followed by a day of crisis intervention, parent meetings, and connecting struggling families with city resources. She sees her students and their parents at the local grocery store and the neighborhood taqueria; the line between her personal and professional life is beautifully, and sometimes exhaustingly, blurred. Her friendships are a tight-knit circle of fellow educators and non-profit workers who share her values.\n\nSarah doesn\u2019t dream of wealth or fame. Her aspiration is to one day afford a down payment on her own small condo in the neighborhood she loves and serves. More than anything, she hopes to see the children she supports grow into resilient adults, knowing she played a small part in buffering them from the city\u2019s harshest edges."
