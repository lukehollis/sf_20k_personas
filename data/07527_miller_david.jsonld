Born to a pragmatic, blue-collar family in suburban Cleveland, he was the quiet observer, the kid who framed the world through the lens of a secondhand camera. San Francisco in the early 1990s promised a Technicolor escape from Ohio\u2019s gray skies. He enrolled at a local art college, dreaming of a life in photography, his mind buzzing with the city\u2019s kinetic energy.\n\nThat dream, however, was short-lived. A family crisis back home during his sophomore year\u2014his father\u2019s sudden illness\u2014drained his family\u2019s meager savings and his own resolve. He dropped out, telling himself it was temporary, and took a stockroom job at a neighborhood hardware store to send money home. Temporariness, he learned, has a way of becoming permanent. He discovered an unexpected knack for retail\u2019s quiet order, and his reliability saw him rise from stockboy to cashier, then to assistant manager, and finally, to the store manager position he\u2019s held for fifteen years.\n\nAt 50, David\u2019s world is a ten-block radius around his Clement Street store. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from the small apartment he rents above the shop. His days are a rhythm of unlocking the front door, greeting regulars by name, advising on the right kind of wall anchor, and managing inventory. His romantic life has been a series of well-intentioned but brief relationships; his career left little room for the grand gestures of love. His social circle consists of a few other local merchants with whom he shares a weekly beer, complaining about city permits and rising costs.\n\nHis old Minolta film camera sits on a bookshelf, a relic of a younger man's ambition. David\u2019s hope for the future is not fame or wealth, but a quiet form of contentment. He dreams of one day reducing his hours, of finally taking that camera off the shelf and walking the city not as a manager, but as the artist he once set out to be, capturing the subtle beauty of the neighborhoods he knows so well."
