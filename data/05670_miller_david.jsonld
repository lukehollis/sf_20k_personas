The son of an auto mechanic, he learned early on that the world made sense through his hands. School was a place he endured, not embraced; his real education took place in his father\u2019s garage, learning the logic of engines and the satisfaction of a well-done repair. He earned his high school diploma without ceremony and immediately entered the workforce, finding a quiet pride in practical labor.\n\nIn his early twenties, chasing a fleeting romance, David moved to San Francisco. The relationship soon dissolved, but the city, with its constant need for people who could fix things, held on to him. He drifted through various handyman and construction jobs until landing a position as a maintenance assistant in a large, pre-war apartment building in the Outer Richmond. It was here his life found its anchor. When the aging superintendent retired a decade later, David, known for his reliability and quiet competence, was the natural successor.\n\nThe promotion came with a small, ground-floor apartment, cementing his unique 0.0-mile commute. For over fifteen years now, David\u2019s life has been interwoven with the building's own. His daily routine is a symphony of familiar sounds: the morning rumble of the boiler, the squeak of a tenant's door he needs to oil, the afternoon call about a leaky faucet. He is a constant, steady presence in the transient lives of his tenants, the keeper of their small domestic dramas. He\u2019s on a first-name basis with most residents, sharing brief pleasantries in the lobby but rarely venturing deeper. His social life consists of a weekly beer at a quiet bar on Geary and the occasional chat with the mail carrier.\n\nDavid doesn't dream of wealth or grandeur. His hopes are grounded and tangible: a peaceful week, a smooth-running heating system, perhaps one day retiring to a small plot of land in Northern California. But he knows, deep down, he is as much a fixture as the building\u2019s foundation. His connection to San Francisco isn't its iconic skyline, but the plumbing, wiring, and human stories contained within the walls of this single, sprawling building he calls home."

            "value": "1.\nHe remembers the weight and jangle of the master keys when Mr. Henderson, the retiring superintendent, pressed them into his palm. \"She's all yours now, son,\" the old man had rasped, smelling of pipe tobacco and oil. It wasn't joy David felt, but a profound, grounding solidity. That night, sitting in his new ground-floor apartment, the building's low hum felt like a promise. For the first time since leaving Bakersfield, he wasn't just passing through; he had anchored himself to something real and permanent. This happened fifteen years ago.\n\n2.\nThe call came about Mrs. Gable in 4B. Her son needed to be let in. David opened the door to an apartment frozen in time: a half-finished cup of tea, a novel splayed open on the ottoman. As he silently unplugged her humming refrigerator, a wave of immense, quiet sadness washed over him. He wasn't a friend or family, just the man who fixed her sink. This moment, about eight years ago, taught him he was a guardian of silent histories, the final witness to the small, complete lives lived within his walls.\n\n3.\nIt was a ferocious winter storm, around 2012. A section of the old roof failed just after midnight, sending water into the top-floor hallway. While tenants panicked, David felt a surge of pure, focused adrenaline. For hours, drenched and freezing, he patched the leak with tar and plywood under a single work light. Afterwards, alone in the quiet warmth of the boiler room, nursing his raw hands, he felt a fierce pride. He hadn't just done a job; he had protected his charge, proving his worth in the most tangible way possible.\n\n4.\nOne summer night, after a long argument with the stubborn boiler, he sat on the back-alley retaining wall. The fog rolled thick and low, muting the sounds of Geary Boulevard into a distant murmur. He could smell the damp concrete and a neighbor's night-blooming jasmine. There were no tourists, no landmarks, just the cool, quiet air of his small corner of the world. This recurring, simple moment defined his love for the city: not its grand views, but its private, peaceful atmosphere when the day's work was finally done.\n\n5.\nHe rarely thinks of the woman he followed to San Francisco, but he remembers the day she left. He\u2019d walked to Ocean Beach and stared at the vast, indifferent gray of the Pacific. It wasn't heartbreak he felt, but a strange, hollow freedom. He looked at the endless water, then turned his back and walked toward the avenues, toward the promise of steady work. That day, in his early twenties, sealed his fate. He chose the logic of buildings over the chaos of passion, a decision that built his entire life."
