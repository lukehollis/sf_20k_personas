Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing elementary school teacher mother, his upbringing was stable, comfortable, and thoroughly devoid of artistic chaos. It was a high school trip to the Portland Art Museum that first ignited a spark, a fascination with how color, form, and history could be captured on a canvas.\n\nHe pursued this spark at the University of Oregon, enrolling in their Art History program with hazy dreams of a curator\u2019s life. To pay for his tuition and rent, he took a job waiting tables at a popular farm-to-table restaurant in Eugene. There, he discovered an unexpected passion. He thrived on the energy of the dinner rush, the intricate choreography of the staff, and the art of crafting a perfect guest experience. He had a knack for it, a calm authority that belied his age.\n\nUpon graduation, he faced a choice: a low-paying, solitary internship at a small gallery or a dynamic management training program with the restaurant group. A turning point arrived as a perfectly timed email: a new, high-concept restaurant was opening inside a major San Francisco arts institution, and they needed an assistant manager who could speak both the language of hospitality and art. It was a synthesis of his two worlds he never imagined possible. He packed his bags and moved to the city.\n\nNow 29, Liam is the General Manager of that very restaurant. His life is one of curated proximity; his \"0.0 mile commute\" is a five-minute walk from his modern, compact apartment in Hayes Valley. His days are a blur of inventory management, staff scheduling, and collaborating with the museum's curators to create menus that echo the themes of the current exhibitions. Having recently emerged from a long-term relationship, he pours his energy into his work. His social life primarily consists of late-night drinks with his chef and a close-knit circle of industry friends.\n\nWhile content, Liam dreams bigger. He aspires to one day open his own small bistro-gallery, a space where emerging local artists can show their work and the menu is a masterpiece in its own right. He loves San Francisco for its relentless creative pulse, a rhythm he now orchestrates daily, one perfectly plated dish at a time."
