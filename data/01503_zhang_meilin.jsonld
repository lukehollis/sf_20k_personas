As a second-generation American, her childhood was a blend of long hours helping the family business and a deep-seated understanding that success was built on practicality and hard work. Her parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in a new country, envisioned a stable future for her in medicine or engineering.\n\nThe turning point came during a weekend trip to San Francisco in her late teens. She was mesmerized by the city\u2019s organized chaos: the dense tapestry of neighborhoods, the impassioned arguments over development she overheard in cafes, and the visible tension between historic preservation and the push for modernity. She saw a living system, one that could be studied, understood, and improved. This revelation led her to pursue a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, disappointing her parents but setting her on an unshakeable course.\n\nNow 45, Meilin has spent two decades at the San Francisco Planning Department, rising to the role of Senior Planner. She lives the dense, walkable urbanism she advocates for in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a short walk from her City Hall office. Her day begins with coffee from a local roaster and a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green, where she mentally critiques the public space design.\n\nHer relationship with San Francisco is the most enduring of her life, having outlasted a decade-long partnership that buckled under the weight of her professional devotion. Her friends are a tight-knit circle of architects, community activists, and policy wonks who share her obsession with the city's future. Her youthful idealism has been tempered by the realities of bureaucracy and political compromise, but her core mission remains: to help shepherd San Francisco toward a more equitable and resilient future. She dreams not of personal wealth, but of walking through a neighborhood in twenty years and seeing the thriving, affordable housing and vibrant public spaces she helped bring into existence, knowing she played a small part in protecting the city\u2019s soul."
