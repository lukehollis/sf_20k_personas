Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, Liam grew up in a home filled with the warmth of his parents\u2014a firefighter father and a schoolteacher mother\u2014but always felt a quiet sense of being wonderfully, complicatedly different. He was the Asian son in a sea of Irish relatives, a duality that would shape his entire life.\n\nSeeking the stability his parents championed, Liam pursued a practical path. He attended San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration. It felt like a safe, responsible choice. He graduated directly into the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, which solidified his desire for a secure career. He found his footing in banking, working his way up with a meticulous and reliable nature. Now, as a loan officer, he navigates the digital tide of finance, helping others secure their dreams of homeownership in the city he knows so intimately.\n\nA key turning point was a trip to South Korea in his late twenties. He\u2019d hoped for a profound connection, an easy puzzle piece to complete his identity, but instead found himself a tourist in his own birthplace. The experience was unsettling but clarifying; it affirmed that San Francisco was his one true home. The recent shift to permanent remote work was another seismic event. With his commute reduced to zero, his world, once split between his apartment and the Financial District, has now become hyper-local to his Hayes Valley neighborhood.\n\nHis days are a structured blend of work and community. Mornings start with a coffee from a specific local cafe where the baristas know his order, followed by hours reviewing loan applications from his sunlit home office. Afternoons are for jogs through the Panhandle or Alamo Square Park. He has built a quiet life of routines that ground him. Though financially secure, Liam feels a pull toward something more tangible than interest rates. He recently started taking a pottery class, finding solace in shaping clay with his own hands. His dream is to one day use his financial acumen to open a small business in his neighborhood, creating a space that is as rooted and welcoming as the home his parents gave him."
