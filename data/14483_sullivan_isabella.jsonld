Raised in Humboldt County, her father was a third-generation Irish-American logger, and her mother a respected Karuk tribal elder. Her childhood was a blend of Catholic feast days and Karuk ceremonies, instilling in her a unique perspective on tradition, resilience, and the fractures that can run through a community. Witnessing firsthand the systemic neglect and lack of culturally competent mental health services for her Native peers, Isabella found her calling.\n\nHer educational path was a direct answer to this need, taking her from Humboldt State to a Master of Social Work program at SF State. The move to San Francisco was a seismic shift, trading redwood forests for concrete canyons, but she was driven by a clear purpose. She began her career as a case manager for at-risk youth, her empathy and sharp insights quickly setting her apart. A key turning point came when she realized she could have a greater impact by shaping programs rather than just executing them. This led her to pursue leadership, eventually becoming the Clinical Program Director for a non-profit that bridges educational and health services.\n\nNow 43, Isabella lives a structured, purposeful life in the Inner Richmond. Her mornings begin with a Muni ride across the city, a book on clinical theory or Native history in her lap. Her days are a marathon of meetings, grant writing, and mentoring younger social workers. She's single, having ended a long-term relationship amicably years ago, and finds fulfillment in her strong network of colleagues and a few close friends.\n\nSan Francisco is now her home, its diverse communities a macrocosm of the world she grew up in. She finds solace in Golden Gate Park, a necessary green lung that reminds her of home. Isabella\u2019s ultimate dream is to secure funding for a new initiative: a wellness program for urban Indigenous youth that integrates traditional healing practices with evidence-based therapy. It's the culmination of her life's work\u2014using the tools of her new world to honor the needs of the one that raised her."

He\u2019d been in trouble at school again, and the county counselor\u2019s words had been useless, hollow. He just stared at the water, his silence a wall she couldn\u2019t breach. The feeling\u2014a mix of fury and profound helplessness\u2014was a physical ache. It was then she knew. She wouldn\u2019t just comfort; she would build the bridges others couldn't see, using words and traditions they would actually understand. It was the moment her path became clear.\n\n2.\nHer first week at SF State, age twenty-three. She stepped off the N Judah at sunset and the world fractured into a million electric points of light stretching to the bay. The sheer scale of it, the endless concrete replacing the familiar scent of damp earth and redwood, hit her with a sudden, breathtaking loneliness. She felt like a sapling in a steel canyon. In that moment of being so utterly untethered, her mission became her anchor. She wasn't there to get lost, but to find others who were.\n\n3.\nIt was a budget meeting when she was thirty-one. Her supervisor spoke of \"trimming\" a vital after-school program, using phrases like \"unfortunate but necessary.\" Isabella saw the faces of the kids who relied on that space, a fragile lifeline. A hot, clear anger rose in her. Patching wounds wasn't enough; she had to stop the bleeding at its source. She realized then that her empathy was a tool, but true change required a seat at the table where the decisions were actually being made. She started applying for leadership roles the next day.\n\n4.\nShe was nearly two years into city life, feeling worn thin by the noise, when a friend took her to the Redwood Grove in Golden Gate Park. The moment she stepped under the canopy, the air changed. The scent of bark and damp earth was a scent from her soul\u2019s oldest memory. She touched the rough bark of a giant, closed her eyes, and for the first time since leaving Humboldt, she felt her roots find soil. This grove became her church, her necessary sanctuary, making the city finally feel like home.\n\n5.\nLast year, a young Miwok intern confessed his struggle to her, feeling adrift between the city\u2019s demands and a heritage he felt slipping away. Isabella saw her own reflection in his eyes\u2014the same fracture she\u2019d felt her whole life. But this time, she wasn\u2019t a helpless teenager. She was a director with skills and connections. The conversation was a spark hitting dry tinder. Her dream of an integrated wellness program went from a long-term goal to an urgent, non-negotiable mandate. She started writing the grant proposal that night."
