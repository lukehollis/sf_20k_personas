Born in Brussels to a transient American sociologist father and a French-Algerian archivist mother, his childhood was a collection of temporary addresses across three continents. He was a perpetual newcomer, a cultural chameleon who learned to blend in everywhere and belong nowhere. This constant flux fostered a deep-seated independence and a quiet, observant nature.\n\nHis formal education is a scattered, incomplete tapestry of international schools. The true constant in his life was the structured, logical world of computers. While his parents analyzed the chaotic patterns of humanity, David found solace in the predictable elegance of code and circuitry. He taught himself everything, from hardware repair in his teens to network security in his early twenties. His career began not with a degree, but with a reputation for being the person who could fix any digital problem, first for fellow expats and later for small businesses back in the States.\n\nThe turning point was landing a remote contract for a Bay Area startup. It offered stability without demanding he anchor himself to an office. At 28, he chose to move to San Francisco, a city he felt understood the concept of self-invention. He settled in a small, meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley, officially making his commute 0.0 miles.\n\nDavid\u2019s current life is one of disciplined routine. His mornings are for his clients\u2014troubleshooting software glitches and managing networks from his standing desk. Afternoons are for him: long walks through the Panhandle, discovering new coffee shops, or losing himself in the collected quiet of the Green Apple Books annex. His social circle is small and curated, consisting of a few friends from a weekly board game night and a rock-climbing gym. He values his autonomy fiercely, yet a nascent desire for deeper connection has begun to stir. His dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to one day use his skills to launch a non-profit that provides tech literacy and support to underserved communities, building a legacy of connection in the city he finally chose to call home."
