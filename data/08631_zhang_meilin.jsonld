Her life unfolds in the small apartment above her restaurant, \u201cJasmine Phoenix,\u201d and the kitchen directly below, a commute measured in a single flight of stairs. Born in San Francisco to parents who emigrated from Guangdong, Meilin\u2019s childhood was steeped in the aromas of her mother\u2019s cooking. While her father, a pragmatic man who worked long hours as a Muni driver, pushed her toward a stable career, Meilin\u2019s heart was always in the kitchen, absorbing her mother\u2019s intuitive approach to balancing flavors.\n\nTo please her father, she enrolled in an accounting program at City College, but her studies felt gray and lifeless compared to the vibrant culinary world she loved. The turning point came when her mother fell ill. Meilin, then 20, dropped out of college to care for her and, by necessity, took over the family\u2019s cooking. It was during this difficult period that her mother\u2019s lessons crystallized into a true calling. After her mother passed, leaving Meilin with a worn, sauce-splattered recipe book, she knew her path. She spent a decade working in other kitchens, saving every dollar, before pooling her resources to open Jasmine Phoenix.\n\nToday, at 51, Meilin\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine and quiet purpose. Her days begin before dawn with trips to local markets and end late after the last table is cleared. The restaurant is not just her business; it is the living legacy of her mother. Her customers, a mix of neighborhood old-timers and curious foodies, are her extended family. She has mentored a young server, a recent immigrant herself, seeing a spark of her own past in the girl\u2019s eyes.\n\nMeilin doesn\u2019t dream of expansion or Michelin stars. Her deepest aspiration is to preserve the authentic flavors of her heritage, providing a place of comfort and connection in an ever-changing city. She is a quiet anchor in her neighborhood, her life a testament to the idea that the most profound journeys can happen within the smallest of spaces."
