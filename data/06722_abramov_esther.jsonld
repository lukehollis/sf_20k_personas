Growing up amidst the cadence of Russian and the scent of rye bread from local bakeries, she was a quiet, observant child, keenly aware of the unspoken traumas her parents and their friends carried. This early immersion in the complexities of displacement and adaptation planted the seeds of her future career.\n\nWhile her peers were drawn to tech or finance, Esther pursued sociology at UC Berkeley, fascinated by the architecture of human communities. This led her to a Master of Social Work (MSW) from San Francisco State University, a practical pivot toward healing the fractures she had observed her whole life. She began her career at a community health clinic in the Mission, working with immigrant families. The grind was immense, but it was there she earned the supervised hours for her LCSW licensure, a milestone that felt more significant than any diploma. She later transitioned to a major hospital, but the bureaucracy wore on her spirit.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties with the amicable end of a long-term relationship. The separation was less a tragedy and more a clarification. Realizing she craved autonomy, she left the hospital system and launched her own private practice.\n\nNow, at 49, her commute is a 10-step walk from her kitchen to a sunlit office in her Cole Valley apartment. Her days are structured by back-to-back telehealth sessions, her voice a calm anchor for clients navigating anxiety, grief, and trauma. To decompress, she walks through Golden Gate Park or seeks the quiet companionship of books at Green Apple. She has a small, tight circle of friends and a cherished relationship with her aging parents. Esther\u2019s dream is to start a therapy group for adult children of immigrants, creating a space for a generation caught between worlds. She sees San Francisco not just as her home, but as a complex, wounded, and resilient entity she is profoundly committed to helping heal, one session at a time."
