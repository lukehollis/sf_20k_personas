She was raised under the relentless sun of the Central Valley, the daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who built a life from the ground up, first in the fields and later behind the counter of their own small grocery store. Her childhood was steeped in the values of *seva* (selfless service) and community, but she always felt a pull toward the foggy, progressive coastline she visited on family trips. This pull became a tangible goal, a quiet rebellion against the expectation that she would follow a more traditional path.\n\nShe found her escape, and her purpose, at UC Berkeley, where she studied psychology. The vibrant diversity and intellectual freedom were intoxicating. It was here she realized that her parents\u2019 value of *seva* could be channeled not into medicine, as they had hoped, but into mental healthcare. She pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, committing herself to the city that felt like her true home. Her clinical focus on healthcare was cemented after witnessing the immense emotional toll a chronic illness took on a close family friend, a burden often carried in silence within her community.\n\nNow 36, Priya is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major San Francisco hospital. The pandemic was a pivotal turning point, shifting her practice almost entirely to telehealth. Her commute is now zero miles; a small, dedicated office nook in her Inner Richmond apartment has become her connection to patients across the city. Her days are a marathon of video calls, helping people navigate the emotional trauma of new diagnoses, the exhaustion of caregiving, and the complexities of the healthcare system.\n\nTo decompress, she walks. Morning treks through the misty quiet of Golden Gate Park are non-negotiable, a ritual to ground herself before the day's vicarious pain. Evenings are for herself: cooking elaborate meals, connecting with a tight-knit circle of friends, or simply reading by her bay window. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she serves its most vulnerable residents while finding her own solace in its parks and neighborhoods. Priya\u2019s ultimate dream is to open a small private practice dedicated to providing culturally competent therapy for the South Asian community, creating a space where the unspoken can finally be heard."

While stacking cans of chickpeas, a dusty car pulled up, a faded UC Berkeley sticker on its bumper. It wasn't envy she felt, but a profound, aching recognition of a different world. A tangible promise of a life that existed beyond the rows of almond trees and unspoken expectations. That sticker became a secret compass point, a quiet symbol of the fog-bound coastline she was determined to reach. It was the first time her dream felt possible.\n\n2.\nIt was her first semester at Berkeley, sitting on the lawn at Sproul Plaza, surrounded by a cacophony of passionate voices. Back home, *seva* was quiet, dutiful. Here, service felt loud, intellectual, and active. She realized then that her parents' value wasn't just about healing the body through medicine, but could also be about liberating the mind through understanding. In that moment, her purpose clicked into place with a clarity that was both terrifying and exhilarating. She had found her own way to serve.\n\n3.\nVisiting their family friend during his chemo was the turning point. The family brought food he wouldn\u2019t eat and spoke only of physical symptoms, but no one named the despair suffocating him. Priya will never forget the look in his eyes\u2014a deep, hollowed-out resignation. She saw the unspoken trauma, the emotional burden so many in her community carried in silence. She left his house that day, during her master's program, knowing her life's work would be to give that specific silence a voice.\n\n4.\nOne of her first nights in her Inner Richmond apartment, she walked as the fog rolled in, swallowing the streetlights. The distant, mournful call of a foghorn echoed through the quiet. Instead of feeling small, she felt held, protected by the mist. It was the complete opposite of the Central Valley's oppressive, wide-open sky. This city, with its secrets and its cool embrace, felt like a confidante. This, she realized with a deep, settled breath in her late twenties, was no longer an escape; it was an arrival.\n\n5.\nApril 2020. She remembers a telehealth call with a young man just diagnosed with MS. The screen framed his face, isolating the single tear that traced a path down his cheek. In the hospital, she might have missed it. But here, in the strange, digital intimacy of her apartment nook, it was everything. That moment crystallized the shift in her practice. The pandemic had collapsed the world, but it had also focused it, making her a direct, unfiltered witness in her patients' most vulnerable spaces."
