He grew up in a meticulously landscaped suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, the younger child in a family that prized appearance above all else. His father was a successful corporate lawyer, his mother a pillar of local charity circles. But behind the serene facade, his older sister, Chloe, battled a severe and undiagnosed bipolar disorder, a silent storm that shaped Julian\u2019s childhood with its unpredictable wreckage and the family\u2019s determined denial. It was in those quiet, tense moments, trying to understand Chloe\u2019s pain, that Julian\u2019s path was forged.\n\nHe pursued psychology at Oberlin College, driven to find the language for the suffering his family refused to name. The academic world, however, felt too detached. Wanting to be on the front lines, he moved to the Bay Area for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn to its reputation for community-focused action. He found his calling in healthcare, where systemic failures and personal crises intersect.\n\nNow, at 33, Julian is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a large hospital system. His 0.0-mile commute is the most telling detail of his life: he lives in a staff apartment within a supportive housing facility in the Inner Sunset, helping clients transition from inpatient psychiatric care back into the community. His days are a blur of crisis intervention, therapy sessions, and bureaucratic navigation. The line between work and home is non-existent; he is both a clinician and a neighbor to his clients, a role that offers profound connection but leaves little room for a separate self.\n\nHis social life consists of late-night talks with a few trusted colleagues and long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park to decompress. San Francisco, for him, is not a city of tech booms and trendy restaurants, but a landscape of need and recovery seen from his window. He dreams of designing a more integrated transitional care program, one that addresses the loneliness he witnesses daily. Personally, he hopes to one day find a partner and build a life where he can truly clock out, to learn how to be just Julian, not just Julian the social worker."

Their father, illuminated by the porch light, just said, \u201cWe\u2019ll fix this in the morning.\u201d But Julian saw the terror in Chloe\u2019s eyes, a silent scream his parents refused to hear. In that moment, he chose his side: not the one that fixed surfaces, but the one that sought the storm beneath. He learned that love meant looking at the wreckage and asking why.\n\n2.\nHe remembers a stuffy Oberlin seminar room, around age 20. The professor was diagramming therapeutic modalities on a whiteboard, all neat boxes and arrows. Julian just saw Chloe\u2019s face\u2014the wildness, the despair\u2014that fit into no diagram. The intellectual distance felt like a betrayal, a sterile observation of a house on fire. He knew then he couldn\u2019t just study the map; he had to go into the territory, no matter how messy. This was the moment he decided on social work.\n\n3.\nHis first Berkeley field placement, age 24, took him to a Tenderloin SRO. The smell of Pine-Sol and stale cigarette smoke was a world away from Ohio. His client, a man his father\u2019s age, meticulously arranged his few possessions on a milk crate and spoke not of his diagnosis, but of losing his dog. Julian simply sat and listened, seeing the person, not the case file. The vast, sterile distance of his childhood home collapsed. This was real. This was where he belonged.\n\n4.\nLast year, a client he\u2019d worked with for months was finally moving into their own apartment. They had a job, they were stable. After the last box was packed, the client turned and asked, \"Who do I call if I just\u2026 want to watch a movie with someone?\" The question hung in the empty room, a perfect, painful summation of the loneliness that recovery checklists always missed. It\u2019s what sparked his dream of building a program that addressed more than just survival.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, on a solo run at dusk, fog swallowing the tops of the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. He ran past a couple sharing a thermos on a bench, their laughter a small, warm sound in the cooling air. A sharp, unexpected ache hit him\u2014not for a specific person, but for the ease of it. For a moment that wasn't about decompressing or processing. He wondered, with a startling clarity, what it would be like to just be Julian, running toward someone."
