The daughter of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her upbringing was stable, predictable, and imbued with a deep appreciation for community and systems. While her peers gravitated towards engineering and medicine at the University of Michigan, Sarah chose Sociology, fascinated by the hidden frameworks that govern human interaction. She was less interested in building the machine and more in understanding how people used it.\n\nHer turning point came during a summer internship. Tasked with analyzing user engagement data for a small ethical tech startup, she discovered a talent for translating human behavior into actionable insights. She realized her sociological lens was not a liability in the tech world, but a unique asset. Upon graduation, she leveraged this experience into a Program Analyst role at a larger San Francisco-based company, packed two suitcases, and left the Midwest behind for a city she\u2019d only seen in pictures.\n\nNow, at 24, Sarah\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of her small studio apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute from bed to desk defines her routine: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and a croissant, followed by hours of analyzing program data and collaborating with colleagues over Slack. The city she moved for often feels like a distant backdrop viewed from her window.\n\nTo combat the isolation of working from home, Sarah has begun building a life in miniature. She knows the names of the baristas at her coffee shop and the grocer at the corner market. Twice a week, she attends a pottery class in the Mission, finding solace in the tactile, imperfect nature of clay\u2014a stark contrast to her digital work. Her social circle is small but growing, consisting of a few friends from her pottery class and one college friend who lives across the bay.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to eventually lead a team focused on digital ethics, using her background to build more humane and community-oriented technology. She hopes to one day feel as connected to the sprawling, chaotic energy of San Francisco as she does to the quiet streets of her own neighborhood, finally bridging the gap between the life she analyzes on-screen and the one she is cautiously, thoughtfully building for herself."
