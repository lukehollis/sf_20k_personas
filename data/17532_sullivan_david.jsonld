Born in Seoul, he was adopted as an infant by a boisterous, loving Irish-American couple in Daly City. His father, a plumber, and his mother, a receptionist, raised him with unwavering affection, but David\u2019s childhood was marked by a quiet sense of otherness. He was a Sullivan who loved his family\u2019s soda bread and boisterous holiday parties, yet the face in the mirror didn\u2019t match the ones around the dinner table.\n\nHe was never a standout student, finding the abstract nature of high school academics uninspiring. The turning point came when his mother suffered a complex fracture in her leg. Through her multiple visits for imaging, David was captivated not by the injury, but by the methodical calm of the radiologic technologists. He saw a tangible skill, a way to help people by bridging the gap between human anatomy and technology. This clarity of purpose led him to the Rad Tech program at City College of San Francisco, where he finally thrived.\n\nUpon earning his Associate's degree, David\u2019s diligence and empathetic patient care earned him a position at a major San Francisco medical center on Parnassus Avenue. Over two decades, he has become a senior technologist, a respected figure known for his steady hand and his ability to soothe anxious patients in the cold, humming environment of the imaging suites.\n\nAt 43, David\u2019s life is one of deliberate comfort. He lives in a small, tidy condo in the Inner Sunset, a purchase he made with years of careful saving. His 2.1-mile bicycle commute, often cutting through Golden Gate Park, is a cherished daily ritual\u2014a mental buffer between the stresses of the hospital and the peace of his home. He is contentedly single, with a close circle of friends from a weekly cycling club and a few trusted colleagues.\n\nHis dreams are no longer about career advancement. Having found peace with his dual identity, his greatest aspiration is to take a sabbatical and spend a month in South Korea. He isn't searching for his birth family, but rather for a connection to the culture itself\u2014to taste the food, hear the language unfiltered, and walk the streets of the city where his story began. It\u2019s a quiet pilgrimage to finally reconcile the man named Sullivan with the face he sees in the mirror."

A great-aunt he\u2019d never met pinched his cheek, her touch papery and strange. \u201cAnd whose little fella is this?\u201d she cooed at his father. The innocent question landed like a stone, creating a sudden, silent space in the boisterous room. It was the first time he felt the profound dissonance of his name and his face, a quiet ache of otherness that would shape his search for identity.\n\n<br>\n\n2.\nHe was seventeen, sitting in the sterile waiting room while his mother got an X-ray. Through the door, he watched the technologist, a woman with kind eyes and deliberate movements. She spoke to his mother in a low, calming voice, her hands expertly positioning the injured leg. In that moment, the world clicked into place for David. He felt a wave of absolute clarity, recognizing a path of tangible purpose. It wasn't about grades or theories; it was about offering calm, competent care in moments of human fragility.\n\n<br>\n\n3.\nThe day he got the keys to his Inner Sunset condo, he stood alone in the empty living room. It was his early thirties. Sunlight cut across the floorboards, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. There was no grand celebration, just the heavy, solid weight of the key in his palm and a profound, quiet sense of accomplishment. This small space, earned through two decades of steady work and careful saving, was his anchor. It was proof that he could build a life of his own, on his own terms.\n\n<br>\n\n4.\nAfter a particularly harrowing shift\u2014a pediatric case that rattled even him\u2014he pedaled his bike hard into Golden Gate Park. The evening fog was rolling in, muffling the city sounds. Near Stow Lake, he stopped, gasping in the cool, damp air. The physical exertion and the park\u2019s immense quiet washed over him, cleansing the sterile beeps and anxieties of the hospital from his mind. That ride cemented itself as more than a commute; it became his sacred ritual, the buffer that preserved his empathy and his sanity.\n\n<br>\n\n5.\nAn elderly Korean patient, terrified of the MRI machine, began speaking to him in urgent, soft Korean. He could only offer a reassuring hand, the language a barrier between them. Later, her son translated her gratitude, adding, \u201cShe said your face reminded her of her grandson.\u201d The comment struck him with a bittersweet force\u2014a connection felt but not fully shared. That single interaction transformed his vague longing into a concrete plan. He knew then he had to go to Korea, not to find family, but to find that missing vocabulary."
