He was born and raised in the Outer Richmond, the only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved bakery on Balboa Street. His childhood smelled of pineapple buns and freshly brewed tea, underscored by his parents' unwavering belief that their son would become a doctor\u2014a path to a security they never had.\n\nDriven by filial duty, David enrolled in the biology program at San Francisco State University. For two years, he excelled, fueled by caffeine and the weight of his family\u2019s dreams. The turning point came swiftly and cruelly: his father was diagnosed with a debilitating chronic illness. The bakery faltered, and David, seeing his mother's exhaustion, made the choice to drop out of college to work full-time and help manage the mounting medical bills. The dream of becoming Dr. Lee was quietly packed away.\n\nHe found a job as a medical office assistant at a small private practice. It was a compromise, a way to stay adjacent to the world he was meant to join. For over fifteen years, he has been the calm, organizing force in the background of other people\u2019s health crises.\n\nNow 43, David\u2019s life is a testament to routine and stability. He lives in a modest apartment directly above the clinic where he works in the Inner Richmond, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His days are predictable: he opens the office, manages chaotic schedules with quiet efficiency, and offers a reassuring presence to anxious patients. He is single, his personal relationships mostly consisting of weekly dinners with his widowed mother in the Sunset and familiar, friendly nods to the baristas and grocers in his immediate vicinity.\n\nDavid rarely thinks about the life he might have had. His aspirations have softened into simpler hopes: ensuring his mother lives comfortably, saving enough to one day visit the national parks he\u2019s only seen in documentaries, and finding satisfaction in being the reliable, unseen anchor for his small corner of the city\u2019s healthcare system. He is a man who traded a grand dream for a necessary reality, finding a different, quieter kind of purpose along the way."
