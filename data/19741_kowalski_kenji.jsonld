Raised in the blue-collar fog of Daly City, Kenji\u2019s world was framed by bus schedules and the rumble of the freeway. He learned early that a city\u2019s greatness wasn\u2019t just in its landmarks, but in its ability to move its people. This fascination with urban arteries, the veins that carried working people like his parents to their jobs, became his calling.\n\nHis path was solidified by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a young undergraduate at SF State, seeing the Cypress Viaduct pancaked and the Embarcadero Freeway rendered useless was a visceral lesson in urban fragility and the critical importance of infrastructure. It propelled him toward a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, where he eschewed lucrative private development for the complex, often thankless world of public transportation.\n\nFor over two decades, Kenji has been a Senior Transportation Planner for the city. He lives in the Inner Richmond with his wife, Maria, a public school librarian. Their daughter is now away at college, leaving their rent-controlled apartment feeling both spacious and quiet. Kenji\u2019s 5.5-mile commute is his daily field research. Riding the 38-Geary, he\u2019s not just a passenger; he\u2019s an observer, noting choke points, rider demographics, and the daily ballet of a system under constant strain. He feels the pulse of the city in the lurch of the bus and the conversations overheard.\n\nHis personal life is intertwined with the city\u2019s civic fabric, from neighborhood association meetings to volunteering at the Japanese Cultural and Community Center. Kenji doesn\u2019t dream of a high-rise condo or a Tesla. His aspirations are written in bus rapid transit lanes and protected bike paths. He hopes to see a truly integrated regional transit system in his lifetime, a legacy of seamless movement for the next generation of San Franciscans. For Kenji, a successful life is a city that simply *works*\u2014for everyone."

The groan of the bus and the hiss of its doors was the sound of his father returning\u2014smelling of salt air and shipyard grease. It wasn't just a bus; it was the vehicle that brought his family back together each night. That nightly reunion cemented his belief that transit wasn't a service, but a fundamental human necessity.\n\n2.\nOctober 17, 1989. Kenji sat stunned on the floor of his SF State dorm room, watching the raw footage on KRON-4. It wasn\u2019t the shaking that broke him; it was the image of the Cypress Viaduct, a concrete ribbon he\u2019d driven a hundred times, now a tomb of crushed cars. In that moment of horrific collapse, he saw his life\u2019s purpose with terrifying clarity. He wouldn\u2019t just study cities; he would dedicate his life to making them strong enough to hold the people he loved.\n\n3.\nThe first day the Geary corridor\u2019s red bus-only lanes went live was a quiet, personal victory. He stood near Masonic, coffee in hand, just watching. A 38R Express bus, full of morning commuters, glided effortlessly past a sea of gridlocked cars. No one on the street knew his role in the decade-long fight to make that happen. For Kenji, seeing that single bus move freely was more satisfying than any award. It was tangible proof that painstaking work could bend the city toward fairness.\n\n4.\nHe can still feel the weight of his daughter Maya\u2019s small hand in his, her first time on the 38-Geary without a stroller. He pointed out the ticket machine, explaining how the transfer worked. She was more interested in the accordion-like joint of the articulated bus. To his wife, Maria, it was a simple errand. To Kenji, it was a sacred rite of passage\u2014bestowing upon his daughter the key to her own city. His work suddenly felt intensely personal; he was building a city for her.\n\n5.\nVolunteering at the JCC\u2019s Obon Festival, he was clearing tables when an elderly woman thanked him. She told him how her family used to take the Fillmore streetcar to Japantown every weekend before the internment. \"They took the tracks out while we were gone,\" she said, her voice flat. Her simple, devastating statement connected the city\u2019s infrastructure to its history of injustice. It fortified his resolve that building transit was also an act of restoration\u2014stitching back together the communities the city had once torn apart."
