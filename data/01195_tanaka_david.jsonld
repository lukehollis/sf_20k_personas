Born in Sacramento to a quiet Japanese father and an expressive fourth-generation Californian mother, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two distinct culinary cultures. He remembers the sublime simplicity of his grandmother's dashi from summer trips to Fukuoka and the comforting richness of his mother\u2019s sourdough on foggy Sacramento mornings. School was a place of distraction; his true education began at 16, scrubbing pans in the back of a bustling Italian restaurant. He never attended college, instead opting for the brutal, meritocratic crucible of the professional kitchen.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco at 21 with a set of knives and fierce ambition. He worked his way up the line in a dozen kitchens, from North Beach institutions to Financial District power-lunch spots, absorbing techniques and developing his own voice. The turning point came after a fiery burnout at 30, where he nearly quit the industry. Instead, he took a sous chef position at a small, minimally decorated restaurant that prioritized ingredients over spectacle. There, he honed his signature style: Japanese precision and reverence for seasonal ingredients, expressed through a Northern California lens.\n\nNow 46, David is the executive chef and owner of \"Fune\" (Boat), a celebrated 30-seat restaurant in Hayes Valley. He lives in the small apartment directly above it, making his commute a simple walk downstairs. His life is the restaurant. Mornings are for farmers' markets and butchery, afternoons for prep and staff training, and nights are a blur of intense, focused service. This monastic devotion cost him his marriage years ago; his relationship with his teenage daughter is a collection of polite, brief text messages. His kitchen staff is his surrogate family, a tightly-knit group bound by pressure and shared passion. David dreams of two things with equal, aching intensity: earning a Michelin star and one day teaching his daughter how to properly fillet a fish, a simple act of connection that feels more elusive than any award."
