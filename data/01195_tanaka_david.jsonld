Born in Sacramento to a quiet Japanese father and an expressive fourth-generation Californian mother, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two distinct culinary cultures. He remembers the sublime simplicity of his grandmother's dashi from summer trips to Fukuoka and the comforting richness of his mother\u2019s sourdough on foggy Sacramento mornings. School was a place of distraction; his true education began at 16, scrubbing pans in the back of a bustling Italian restaurant. He never attended college, instead opting for the brutal, meritocratic crucible of the professional kitchen.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco at 21 with a set of knives and fierce ambition. He worked his way up the line in a dozen kitchens, from North Beach institutions to Financial District power-lunch spots, absorbing techniques and developing his own voice. The turning point came after a fiery burnout at 30, where he nearly quit the industry. Instead, he took a sous chef position at a small, minimally decorated restaurant that prioritized ingredients over spectacle. There, he honed his signature style: Japanese precision and reverence for seasonal ingredients, expressed through a Northern California lens.\n\nNow 46, David is the executive chef and owner of \"Fune\" (Boat), a celebrated 30-seat restaurant in Hayes Valley. He lives in the small apartment directly above it, making his commute a simple walk downstairs. His life is the restaurant. Mornings are for farmers' markets and butchery, afternoons for prep and staff training, and nights are a blur of intense, focused service. This monastic devotion cost him his marriage years ago; his relationship with his teenage daughter is a collection of polite, brief text messages. His kitchen staff is his surrogate family, a tightly-knit group bound by pressure and shared passion. David dreams of two things with equal, aching intensity: earning a Michelin star and one day teaching his daughter how to properly fillet a fish, a simple act of connection that feels more elusive than any award."

It was just water, kombu, and katsuobushi, yet it tasted of the deep ocean and ancient smoke. In that clear, umami-rich broth, he first learned that perfection wasn't about addition, but subtraction. It was a lesson in purity that would become the foundation of his entire culinary philosophy.\n\n2.\nAt 30, he sat on the loading dock behind a celebrated restaurant, the city\u2019s indifferent hum drowning out the kitchen's chaos. His hands were burned, his spirit scoured raw. He was done. He picked up his phone to call his mom, to admit defeat. But as he stared at his ruined hands, he realized he didn't hate the craft, only the noise surrounding it. He didn't make the call. Instead, he quit to find a quieter way, a path back to the ingredients themselves.\n\n3.\nThe first time he walked into the empty storefront that would become Fune, it smelled of dust and possibility. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating a space most would find daunting. But David saw it all instantly\u2014the exact placement of the counter, the flow from the pass to the tables, the precise spot for the six-burner range. For the first time, he wasn't building someone else's dream. In that silent, empty room, he felt the terrifying, exhilarating peace of being completely responsible.\n\n4.\nHis daughter, Maya, was twelve and had a birthday dinner with her friends. David swore he would be there to cut the cake. But a new line cook had a meltdown during service, and the rhythm of the kitchen\u2014that relentless, demanding god\u2014claimed him. He arrived home after midnight to a dark apartment. On the counter was a single, perfectly cut slice of cake on a plate, a silent, heartbreaking gesture of love and absence that he has never forgotten.\n\n5.\nIt was a Tuesday night last spring. A food critic was dining, but that wasn't it. The kitchen was just\u2026 flowing. A silent ballet. Every sizzle, chop, and plate wipe was part of a single, focused rhythm. He expedited service, not with words, but with glances and nods. He caught his sous chef\u2019s eye across the pass, and in that shared look was a moment of pure, unspoken communion. This was it. This fleeting, perfect synchronicity was the high he had been chasing his entire life."
