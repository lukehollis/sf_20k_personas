Born and raised in a stoic, working-class family in Toledo, Ohio, her path was forged not by ambition, but by empathy. The pivotal moment came at sixteen, when her younger brother was diagnosed with a severe chronic illness. Sarah spent her formative years navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system alongside her parents, witnessing firsthand how families could be broken by the stress of paperwork, insurance denials, and emotional exhaustion. That experience became her calling.\n\nRejecting the familiar Midwest, the promise of progressive values drew her west to UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work in the early 1990s. San Francisco, with its vibrant chaos and culture of acceptance, felt like a true home. She began her career in the trenches of a major downtown hospital, spending nearly three decades as a shield for the vulnerable. She fought for patients, arranged safe discharges for the elderly and unhoused, and absorbed the secondary trauma that came with the territory. A long-term relationship dissolved under the weight of her demanding career, leaving her with a quiet resilience and a deep appreciation for her own space.\n\nThe pandemic was an unexpected turning point. Burnt out from the sterile scent of hospitals and the constant crises, Sarah transitioned to a fully remote case management role. Her 0.0-mile commute now leads from her bedroom to a small desk overlooking the fog-laced avenues. Her days are a structured blend of telehealth calls with clients, meticulous digital paperwork, and afternoon walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nAt 53, Sarah\u2019s social circle is small but deep: a book club with neighbors, a weekly yoga class, and dinners with a few fellow social workers who understand the language of her life. Her dream is no longer to change the world, but to bring a measure of peace to her small corner of it. She aspires to travel more, perhaps to finally see the Northern Lights, and to nurture the rooftop container garden that provides a tangible sense of growth amidst the complexities of her work."
