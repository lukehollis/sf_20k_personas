The daughter of David, a Jewish-American sociology professor, and Emi, a kintsugi artist from Kyoto, Aiko grew up in Berkeley navigating a life of Shabbat dinners and Obon festivals. She learned to be a bridge, translating not just language but cultural nuances between her relatives. This instilled in her a profound empathy and an awareness of the unspoken needs that simmer beneath the surface of conversation.\n\nHer path crystallized during her grandmother\u2019s long battle with cancer. Aiko witnessed firsthand the communication breakdowns between her gentle, Japanese-speaking Obaachan and the well-meaning but culturally unaware healthcare staff. The experience was a quiet turning point, illuminating a path where her innate empathy could become a professional tool. She pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology at UCLA, followed by a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, determined to fill the gaps she had seen.\n\nNow 30, Aiko is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital, specializing in palliative care support. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern healthcare landscape; her office is a quiet, sunlit room in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, providing counseling to patients and families navigating the complexities of terminal illness. She finds solace in her routine: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, a midday break in Golden Gate Park, and evenings spent either practicing yoga or cooking meals that are a comforting blend of her heritage\u2014matzo ball soup one night, miso soup the next.\n\nAiko maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow helpers she met in grad school. Though currently single, she values these deep connections over a wider social net. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate; she loves the fog-laced quiet of her neighborhood and the accessibility of a city that honors its diverse communities. Aiko\u2019s dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on culturally competent geriatric and end-of-life care, creating a space where no one, regardless of their background, feels unheard in their most vulnerable moments."
