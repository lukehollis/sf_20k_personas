The son of a Pittsburgh steelworker, Gideon grew up surrounded by the deafening sounds of industry. While his father saw pride in forging I-beams, Gideon found magic in the high school drama club\u2019s workshop, transforming plywood and paint into castles and cityscapes. He briefly chased a degree in Theater Arts from Carnegie Mellon but found the dusty, tangible reality of the scene shop more compelling than any lecture. He dropped out after an apprenticeship at a local playhouse offered him a full-time job.\n\nIn 1995, drawn by the siren song of a more vibrant and accepting arts scene, Gideon packed his tools and moved to San Francisco. He found a room in a sprawling Haight-Ashbury flat and spent years as a freelance carpenter, building sets for scrappy, ambitious theater companies. His turning point came when he landed a permanent position with a major repertory theater downtown. Over the next two decades, he honed his craft, rising from a junior carpenter to the indispensable Head Scenic Carpenter, the one who could solve any engineering puzzle the set designer dreamed up.\n\nNow 53, Gideon\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Castro, a neighborhood he\u2019s called home for nearly thirty years. His mornings start with strong coffee from a local caf\u00e9 before he catches the K-Ingleside Muni downtown. His social life is inextricably linked to his work; his chosen family is the crew of stagehands, lighting designers, and actors he\u2019s worked with for years. He\u2019s the steadfast, reliable veteran they turn to for advice or a loan.\n\nGideon\u2019s aspirations are no longer for the spotlight. He dreams of mentoring the next generation of theater technicians, ensuring the craft endures. His greatest hope is that the arts can survive in a city that increasingly caters to tech, and his deepest fear is being priced out of the only city that has ever felt like home. He finds his fulfillment not in the applause from the audience, but in the quiet moment before the curtain rises, looking upon a world he built with his own two hands."

From the bay window of the sprawling flat, the rumble of the N-Judah was a lullaby, not the roar of a steel mill. He ran a hand over the cheap plywood bookshelf left by a previous tenant, already thinking of how to make it stronger. For the first time, the noise of a city felt like a promise, not a sentence. He was finally in the right place.\n\n2.\nHe recalls a tiny Mission theater, circa 2000. They needed it to rain on stage. With no budget, he engineered a system from a garden pump and perforated PVC pipe. During the tech rehearsal, the lead actress gasped as the first \"raindrops\" fell perfectly into the light. That gasp was more satisfying than any paycheck. It wasn\u2019t about money; it was about making the impossible real with scraps and ingenuity. This cemented his love for the puzzle, not the prestige.\n\n3.\nHe thinks of the night the main turntable cracked, two hours before a 2008 opening. Panic flared in the young stagehands, but he just grabbed his screw gun and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get to it.\u201d For the next hour, the crew worked in a silent, efficient ballet of repair he directed with nods and gestures. Afterward, sitting on the stage floor sharing lukewarm pizza, he looked at their tired, smudged faces. He knew then, with absolute certainty, that this was his family.\n\n4.\nHe often thinks of a young apprentice, maybe ten years ago, about to throw a miter saw guide in frustration. Gideon didn\u2019t just fix the cut. He put his scarred hand over the kid\u2019s, guiding it gently, explaining the grain, the feel of the wood. He saw the flash of understanding in the apprentice's eyes\u2014the same spark he\u2019d felt in high school. In that moment, building a carpenter felt more important than building a set. It planted a new kind of dream in him.\n\n5.\nHe holds onto the feeling from last season\u2019s opening night. The set was a beast\u2014a multi-level facade that had to glide and pivot silently. Just before the house lights dimmed, he stood in the wings, breathing in the smell of pine and paint. He looked at the impossible thing he and his crew had willed into existence. The stage manager called \"places.\" In that hushed, electric moment, with the world he built waiting for life, he felt a profound and quiet joy. This was his applause."
