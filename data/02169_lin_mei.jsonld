A second-generation Chinese American, she was born and raised in the Outer Sunset, the daughter of pragmatic immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store on Taraval Street. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the salty ocean air of her neighborhood, defined by expectations of academic success and a stable, lucrative career. Her parents hoped for a doctor or an engineer; Mei, however, was quietly drawn to the stories of her elders, especially her grandmother, P\u00f2p\u00f3, whose complex health issues first exposed Mei to the bewildering maze of the American healthcare system.\n\nThis experience became her turning point. While her parents saw her volunteering at a local community center as a hobby, Mei saw it as a calling. She pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, but instead of pre-med, she studied sociology. This act of quiet rebellion was followed by a Master of Social Work from SF State, cementing her path. She chose to work within the system she found so challenging, becoming a healthcare social worker for a major San Francisco hospital network.\n\nNow 37, Mei lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that feels like a comfortable echo of her childhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is a modern reality; she is a digital bridge connecting vulnerable patients\u2014the elderly, the terminally ill, recent immigrants\u2014to the resources they desperately need. Her days are a series of telehealth calls, electronic paperwork, and emotionally taxing conversations, helping families navigate insurance, palliative care, and housing. She decompressesto by walking through Golden Gate Park or browsing the shelves at Green Apple Books on Clement Street.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight circle of friends, most of whom also work in public service. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, Mei is finding comfort in her independence and her work. Her dream is not of wealth, but of impact. She aspires to one day launch a non-profit focused on providing culturally competent, compassionate palliative care for the city\u2019s Asian elders, a tribute to the grandmother who unknowingly set her on this path. For Mei, success is measured in the calm she can bring to a family in crisis, right from her small apartment in her corner of the city."
