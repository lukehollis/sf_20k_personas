The scent of solder and freshly brewed coffee often mingles in the air of her live/work apartment, a testament to her 0.0-mile commute. Raised in Sacramento by an architect father and a ceramicist mother, Aiko grew up at the intersection of structure and artistry. She spent her childhood sketching blueprints alongside her dad and learning the feel of clay from her mom, developing an innate understanding of how form follows function.\n\nHer path seemed set for design, and she enrolled in California College of the Arts to pursue a Bachelor's in Product Design. The turning point came during her junior year when a beautifully conceived smart-home device she designed was deemed nearly impossible to produce at scale by her professor. Frustrated by the gap between concept and reality, Aiko became obsessed with the \"how.\" She pivoted her focus, taking every available course on materials science and fabrication. She discovered her true passion wasn't just inventing things, but making invention possible.\n\nUpon graduating, Aiko bypassed larger tech firms for a scrappy hardware startup in Dogpatch that specialized in rapid prototyping. The job came with the loft, placing her directly above the small-scale manufacturing lab she now manages. Her days are a fluid mix of CAD modeling at her standing desk and troubleshooting 3D printers and CNC machines downstairs. Her social life is tightly woven with her work; her few colleagues are her closest friends, often sharing late-night takeout over schematics.\n\nAiko\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in this tangible culture of creation. She feels more at home in the industrial grit of Dogpatch than anywhere else. While her friends from college chase software clout, Aiko dreams of founding her own company dedicated to sustainable and ethically sourced electronics manufacturing. She aspires to build not just products, but a better way of building, right in the city that has always been a workshop for the future."
