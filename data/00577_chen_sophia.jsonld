She grew up in the Inner Sunset apartment above the Taiwanese restaurant her parents poured their life savings into after immigrating in the late 1980s. Her childhood smelled perpetually of star anise, simmering beef broth, and fried scallions.\n\nWhile she cherished her family, she dreamed of a world beyond the bistro's four walls. She pursued this dream at UC Santa Cruz, losing herself in the quiet, pristine world of Art History. A bachelor's degree in hand, she envisioned a future as a gallery curator, a life filled with clean lines and silent contemplation, a stark contrast to the chaotic, sensory symphony of the restaurant.\n\nThe turning point came during her final year of college. Her father suffered a major heart attack, forcing him into an early, reluctant retirement. Her mother couldn't manage the business alone, and the thought of selling her parents' entire life's work was unbearable. Sophia came home, initially telling herself it was temporary.\n\nThat was a decade ago. At 37, Sophia is no longer a temporary manager but the bistro's heart and soul. She has reluctantly, and then proudly, made it her own. She kept her father\u2019s classic recipes but refined the menu, sourcing produce from the Alemany Farmers' Market and introducing a curated selection of oolong teas. Her Art History degree found an unexpected use in redesigning the menus and managing the restaurant\u2019s Instagram, which now boasts a loyal following.\n\nHer days are a blur of inventory, staff scheduling, and greeting regulars by name. Relationships are often transient\u2014flirtatious conversations with suppliers or a brief connection with a charming customer. Her hope of finding a partner who understands her all-consuming lifestyle feels distant. Staring out her apartment window late at night, long after the last customer has gone and the chairs are stacked, Sophia watches the N Judah streetcar rattle by. She dreams not of escaping, but of earning a Michelin Bib Gourmand\u2014a testament not to the life she lost, but to the one she masterfully built."
