Born in the former Yugoslavia, his childhood was shattered by the ethnic conflicts of the early 1990s. At 19, he and his parents arrived in San Francisco as refugees, carrying little more than the clothes they wore. The Vaskovich family\u2019s \u201cOther\u201d ethnicity on census forms was a constant reminder of a nation that no longer existed.\n\nWith his family needing immediate income, Andre\u2019s formal education ended with a GED. He was practical and good with his hands, finding work in building maintenance. His early years were a blur of learning English from coworkers, mastering HVAC systems, and sending money to relatives back home. He didn\u2019t have the luxury of exploring the city\u2019s vibrant culture; he was too busy keeping its lights on.\n\nHis turning point came when he was hired as a junior maintenance technician at a burgeoning biotech firm in Mission Bay. While scientists engineered breakthroughs in the labs, Andre ensured the complex infrastructure\u2014the delicate climate controls, the high-voltage electrical, the specialized plumbing\u2014ran flawlessly. He was reliable and intuitive, seeing the building not as a structure, but as a living organism. Over two decades, his competence saw him rise through the ranks, from technician to supervisor, and finally to Facilities Operations Manager. He didn't have a degree, but he had encyclopedic knowledge of every pipe and wire in the campus, earning the respect of PhDs who relied on his practical genius.\n\nToday, Andre lives in the Outer Sunset with his wife, Elena, a school administrator he met at a community event. Their daughter is now away at college, a milestone that represents the culmination of his life\u2019s work. His daily routine is disciplined: a 5:30 AM wake-up, followed by the long, rattling MUNI ride across the city. This commute is his time to decompress, watching the city wake up.\n\nAndre\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of profound gratitude, not romance. The city was his family\u2019s sanctuary and the foundation of his career. His hopes are grounded: pay off the mortgage, see his daughter thrive, and one day travel with Elena to a beach where the only sound is the ocean. He doesn't need to change the world; he is content having built a small, stable, and peaceful corner within it."

After years of air raid sirens back home, the absolute quiet was an alien sound. He stood at the window, watching the thick fog swallow the streetlights, and felt a profound absence of fear for the first time since childhood. San Francisco wasn't a dream to him; it was simply the end of a nightmare. That silence became the peace he would build his life upon.\n\n2.\nIt was around 2001, when a critical cleanroom\u2019s climate control system failed. PhDs were panicking, their experiment at risk. Andre, then a junior tech, calmly bypassed a faulty relay he knew from instinct was prone to failure. He didn\u2019t understand their science, but he understood the building\u2019s nervous system. The head researcher simply nodded at him afterward\u2014a gesture of pure respect he valued more than any promotion. In that moment, he knew he wasn\u2019t just a maintenance man; he was essential.\n\n3.\nHe met Elena not at a party, but at a dusty book sale at the Parkside library in the late \u201890s. He was hunting for technical manuals; she was stacking donated novels. Her easy laugh cut through his constant exhaustion. For years, his life had been a closed circuit of work, family, and duty. Talking to her was like discovering a new wire, one that connected not to a machine, but to a future with joy in it\u2014a future he hadn't yet dared to imagine for himself.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, the thick envelope arrived from her university. His daughter opened it, her shriek of joy filling their small Outer Sunset home as the MUNI rattled past outside. Andre didn\u2019t cheer. He simply leaned against the doorframe, seeing the entire journey in a flash: the refugee camp, the first paycheck, the decades of early mornings. That acceptance letter wasn\u2019t just paper; it was the final receipt for his life\u2019s work. The debt was paid. She was safe. She was free.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his morning commute. As the M train emerged from the West Portal tunnel, the early sun caught the glass of the downtown skyscrapers, making them gleam like promises. He saw the entire city laid out before him\u2014not as a tourist, but as a groundskeeper. He knew the grit underneath the beauty, the aging systems that kept the lights on. A quiet feeling of ownership settled over him. He had helped build this, and in return, it had given him a life."
