            "value": "Though he is Caucasian, Alex Kim has only ever known a Korean-American home. Adopted as an infant from a Polish orphanage by a loving, first-generation couple in Daly City, his upbringing was a blend of cultures. He learned to revere his elders and master his mother's kimchi jjigae recipe, all while navigating the subtle dissonances of not sharing his parents' physical features. This feeling of being an affectionate outsider, of existing between worlds, fostered a deep empathy and a quiet, observant nature. He became fascinated by the invisible threads that hold families together, or tear them apart.\n\nThis fascination guided him to Santa Clara University for his undergraduate studies and ultimately to a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology from the University of San Francisco. He bypassed the lucrative path of private practice, feeling a pull toward communities that reminded him of his own complex beginnings. As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, he now works for a non-profit that contracts with SFUSD and city health clinics, specializing in supporting children and families navigating foster care, immigration stress, and learning disabilities.\n\nAlex\u2019s life is rooted in a deliberate rhythm. He lives in a small but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its foggy mornings and proximity to Golden Gate Park. His 3.8-mile commute on the 5-Fulton bus is his dedicated time for reading or mentally preparing for the day\u2019s challenging sessions. Evenings are for decompressing: a long run through the park, cooking, or quiet time with his long-term partner, Isabelle, a pediatric nurse he met during his residency. Their shared dedication to service is the bedrock of their relationship.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees it as a city built by transplants, a place where chosen family is as valid as blood. His dream isn't wealth, but impact. Alex aspires to one day open a specialized practice focused on supporting transracial adoptees and their families, creating a space of understanding he wished he\u2019d had as a child. He wants to honor the gift his parents gave him by helping others build their own resilient, love-filled homes."
