A second-generation native, she was raised in the fog-dusted avenues of the Sunset District by parents who had emigrated from Hong Kong. They ran a small, bustling grocery store, instilling in Mei Lin a profound work ethic and a desire for stability. They hoped she would pursue a practical career like accounting, but Mei Lin was drawn to the expressive world of art. She quietly rebelled by majoring in Art History at SF State, a choice her parents saw as a frivolous luxury.\n\nHer educational journey continued with a Master\u2019s in Arts Administration, a compromise between her passion and her parents' pragmatism. After graduation, Mei Lin felt disillusioned working in the sterile, bureaucratic environments of the city\u2019s larger museums. A pivotal moment came after her father\u2019s death; while sorting his belongings, she found a scrapbook he had secretly kept, filled with newspaper clippings about her student exhibitions and academic awards. This posthumous validation solidified her resolve to make art accessible, not just admired from a distance.\n\nShe left the prestigious museum world behind and poured her energy into community-based arts. At 45, she achieved her greatest professional success: securing the grant to found \"Portsmouth Arts,\" a small nonprofit dedicated to emerging local artists, located on the ground floor of a historic building in Chinatown. To simplify her life and fully commit, she moved into the rent-controlled apartment directly above the gallery.\n\nNow 52, her commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a blend of grant writing, mentoring young artists, and mediating with neighborhood elders. She never married, finding her family instead in the vibrant community she serves\u2014the artists she champions, the merchants she greets daily, and the close friends who share her love for the city. Mei Lin\u2019s deepest aspiration is to create a permanent endowment for the gallery, ensuring it remains a cultural anchor for Chinatown long after she\u2019s gone. She is a steward of stories, a quiet force ensuring that the soul of her San Francisco neighborhood continues to be seen and heard."
