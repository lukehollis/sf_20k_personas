The only child of a Muni bus driver and a Chinatown garment factory seamstress, her world was shaped by her parents\u2019 unyielding work ethic and their reliance on the city\u2019s public services. She saw firsthand how a well-run system could support a family, and how its inefficiencies could create frustration. This planted the seed for a career dedicated to improving that system from the inside.\n\nAs the first in her family to attend a four-year university, Linda chose UC Berkeley, graduating with a degree in Public Policy. She took an entry-level analyst position at City Hall, quietly learning the labyrinthine corridors of municipal government. The first dot-com boom was a major turning point. While her peers chased stock options, Linda saw the internet not as a path to wealth, but as a tool for democracy. She became an early advocate for digitizing city services, arguing it was the next frontier of public access. Her steadfast vision and competence saw her rise steadily through the ranks, eventually leading to her current role as Director of Digital Services.\n\nNow 52, Linda lives in a cozy Cole Valley Edwardian with her husband, Mark, an architect she met in her late twenties. Their daughter, Jessica, is now a sophomore at NYU, making them recent empty-nesters. Linda\u2019s daily routine is grounded in the city she serves. She takes the N-Judah train downtown, a 3.8-mile journey that mirrors the routes her father once drove. Weekends are for visiting her aging parents, still in her childhood home, often bringing them dim sum, and taking long walks through Golden Gate Park with Mark.\n\nLinda\u2019s ambition is not for power, but for legacy. She dreams of a San Francisco where applying for a building permit is as easy as ordering a meal online. Her ultimate hope is to retire knowing she left the city\u2019s digital infrastructure more efficient, equitable, and accessible for the next generation of families like the one she grew up in."

She saw the weary frustration on his dad\u2019s face as passengers grumbled, the flicker of shame in his eyes. In that moment, watching him try to fix an unfixable machine for an unforgiving public, a quiet, fierce resolve took root in her heart. She wasn\u2019t just going to ride the bus; she was going to make it better. The system shouldn\u2019t fail people like her dad.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998. In a stuffy City Hall conference room that smelled of old paper, a young Linda faced a panel of department heads. While the city buzzed about IPOs, she proposed digitizing permit applications. The dismissive sighs were audible. They saw a frivolous tech trend; she saw equity, a way for a seamstress or a bus driver to access their government without taking a day off. That resistance didn't discourage her; it forged her conviction. This wasn't about hype, it was about access.\n\n3.\nShe was twenty-eight, the only analyst left at a marathon Planning Commission meeting. Then he stood up to speak\u2014an architect named Mark, passionately defending the lightwell in a small residential project. He spoke of community and livability, not just square footage. After the meeting, they were the last two in the hall, sharing a tired smile. In his arguments for thoughtful design, she recognized her own quiet battle for functional systems. She knew then she\u2019d found someone who understood the city\u2019s heart, not just its skyline.\n\n4.\nJust a few years ago, bringing dim sum to her parents, she found them stumped by a new QR code menu at their favorite spot. Her father, who could navigate any street in SF, squinted at his phone in frustration. Linda gently guided him through the process, her heart aching with a familiar tenderness. This was it, the whole point of her career, distilled into one moment. Technology should serve people like her dad, not create new barriers. It renewed her mission with a quiet, powerful urgency.\n\n5.\nLast fall, after they\u2019d hauled the last box into the NYU dorm, she watched Jessica walk away, disappearing into a sea of new students. The city felt impossibly big and her daughter impossibly brave. It was the same thrilling, terrifying leap she had taken herself. In that ache of pride and separation, her life\u2019s work clicked into focus. She wasn\u2019t just building better systems for nameless citizens; she was building a more reliable world for Jessica to one day come home to. It was her legacy, for her daughter."
