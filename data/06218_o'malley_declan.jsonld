            "value": "Declan O\u2019Malley was raised on the other side of the country, in a Boston suburb where practicality was prized above all else. The son of a firefighter and a nurse, his upbringing was grounded in stability and service. From a young age, however, Declan was a tinkerer, always deconstructing old radios or building elaborate Lego cities. His parents, seeing his sharp mind, encouraged a more traditional path. He dutifully enrolled at UMass Amherst, choosing History as a major\u2014a respectable, academic pursuit.\n\nHis turning point came not in a lecture hall, but in the dusty basement of the university\u2019s natural history museum. Taking a part-time job setting up displays, Declan discovered a profound satisfaction in translating historical narratives into tangible, three-dimensional experiences. He realized he didn\u2019t just want to study the past; he wanted to build the worlds that housed it. This fusion of historical knowledge and hands-on creativity became his calling.\n\nAfter graduation, Declan took a definitive leap, spurning law school applications and moving to San Francisco for an unpaid internship at a small cultural museum. The move was a quiet rebellion, a choice for passion over parental expectation. He fell in love with the city\u2019s vibrant, unconventional arts scene and its embrace of creators.\n\nNow 32, Declan is a respected Exhibit Designer for a major city institution. He thrives in his live/work loft in Dogpatch, a former shipbuilding warehouse with exposed brick and steel beams. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are a seamless blend of life and work. Mornings are for coffee and sketching at his massive drafting table, afternoons for 3D modeling or fabricating prototypes in his workshop corner.\n\nHis social life revolves around a tight-knit \"found family\" of artists, chefs, and musicians, often gathering for gallery openings in the Mission or dinners at his loft. Though he remains close with his family back east, San Francisco is his true home. Declan dreams of one day curating and designing a landmark exhibition from scratch, a legacy piece that tells a powerful story. He is a man who found his purpose not through a pre-ordained plan, but by building it himself, one carefully placed artifact at a time."
