For her, that place is a restored Victorian in the Mission District, where her apartment sits one floor above her private clinical social work practice. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a symbol of the stability she craved throughout a transient childhood. Born to an Air Force cartographer, Sarah\u2019s youth was a blur of temporary homes across the country, each move making her an expert observer of human connection and disconnection. She learned to read people quickly, a skill that would later define her career.\n\nInitially, she resisted her innate calling. Seeking financial security, she earned a sociology degree from Cal State East Bay and landed a lucrative but soulless job in tech recruiting during the first dot-com boom. The work felt hollow, a mismatch for her empathetic nature. The turning point came with the bust in 2001; when her job was eliminated, she felt not despair, but relief. It was the push she needed. At 27, she enrolled in SF State\u2019s Master of Social Work program and found her purpose.\n\nNow, at 48, Sarah is a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) specializing in helping adults navigate major life transitions\u2014job loss, divorce, grief. Her own past gives her a unique credibility. Her days are a comforting rhythm: a morning walk to a local panaderia for coffee, sessions with clients (both in-person and via telehealth), and evenings spent with a tight-knit circle of friends, many of whom are fellow therapists or artists she met in the neighborhood.\n\nSingle by choice after a brief, early marriage, Sarah\u2019s deepest connections are with her community and her clients. She loves the Mission's vibrant murals, the hum of different languages, and its unapologetic spirit of resilience. Her dream is not to expand or get rich, but to establish a small, pro-bono mentorship program for new social workers struggling with burnout. Having spent decades building a foundation for herself, Sarah\u2019s greatest aspiration is now to help others find their own solid ground."
