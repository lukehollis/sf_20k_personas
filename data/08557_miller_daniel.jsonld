His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life wholly dedicated to art\u2014a stark contrast to his pragmatic Midwest upbringing. Raised in suburban Ohio by an accountant father and a dental hygienist mother, Daniel was an outlier, a quiet boy who found more truth in museum paintings than in financial statements. His parents saw art as a hobby, a phase he would outgrow in favor of a stable career.\n\nHis rebellion was academic. He pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History, which his parents reluctantly funded, and then a Master\u2019s, which he paid for himself through assistantships and library work. His graduate thesis, \u201cMaterial Memory: The Narrative of Decay in Post-Industrial Sculpture,\u201d became his calling card. It was this niche passion that led him to San Francisco, a city built on reinvention. He started as a junior curator at a larger gallery in SoMa, learning the business side of the art world\u2014the delicate dance of charming patrons and nurturing volatile artists.\n\nA key turning point came when his mentor, the original owner of Axiom, decided to retire. Seeing Daniel\u2019s relentless drive and sharp curatorial eye, she offered him a deal to take over the gallery, which included the live-work loft upstairs. Daniel poured his entire savings and a frighteningly large loan into making it his own.\n\nNow, at 36, his life is a hermetic existence. Mornings begin with strong coffee overlooking the gallery floor, followed by a day of emails, virtual meetings with international artists, and the physical work of installing a new show. His social life merges with his professional one; his closest friends are the artists he represents and the collectors he courts. Relationships have been intense but often fleeting, unable to compete with his devotion to the gallery.\n\nDaniel\u2019s dream is no longer just about personal success. He feels the weight of his position and aspires to use Axiom as a platform to discover and launch the career of a truly groundbreaking artist, particularly someone from an underrepresented community whose voice could redefine a genre. He envisions a future where Axiom isn't just a place that sells art, but a cultural anchor in the ever-changing landscape of San Francisco."
