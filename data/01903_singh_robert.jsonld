The son of Punjabi immigrants who planted their roots in Daly City, Robert grew up in a home where the scent of cardamom tea was inseparable from the weight of expectation. While his peers were drawn to the nascent glamour of programming, Robert was always more fascinated by systems and flow. He pursued a practical Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration from San Jose State, a degree that felt grounded and real.\n\nHe entered the workforce just as the first dot-com boom was igniting the Bay Area. While he didn't write code, he found his calling in orchestrating its physical reality. As a logistics coordinator, he ensured that the servers, routers, and components\u2014the very bones of the digital revolution\u2014arrived where they needed to be. He survived the dot-com bust by being indispensable and pragmatic, weathering the storm that wiped out flashier careers. This period cemented his professional identity: he was the calm center, the one who made things happen without fanfare.\n\nHis twenties and thirties were consumed by work. A marriage in his late twenties buckled under the strain of 80-hour work weeks and his reserved nature, ending in an amicable but lonely divorce. This was his key turning point, shifting his focus from relentless ambition toward a search for stability and peace.\n\nNow, at 51, Robert\u2019s world has shrunk to the cozy confines of his Inner Richmond apartment, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to his desk. The pandemic-induced remote work suits him. His days are measured by a new kind of logistics: a morning walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a perfectly pulled espresso from his favorite cafe on Clement Street, and the steady stream of shipping manifests on his dual monitors. He feels more connected to San Francisco through its quiet neighborhoods than he ever did through its bustling tech campuses.\n\nHis hope for the future is no longer tied to a promotion. He dreams of reconnecting with his estranged niece who is studying art in New York. His quietest aspiration is to one day visit the cities on his manifests\u2014Dublin, Singapore, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2014to finally stand on the ground he has only ever seen as a destination code, trading the digital map for the tangible world."
