The son of Jordanian immigrants who settled in Daly City in the late 1970s, he grew up with the scent of cardamom coffee in the air and the damp Pacific fog clinging to the windows. His father, a stoic architect, envisioned a stable, lucrative career for his son in engineering or medicine. But Karim was a quiet, observant child, more fascinated by the unspoken emotions in his family than by numbers or textbooks. He watched his mother find solace from her homesickness through intricate calligraphy, seeing how ink on paper could channel feelings that words could not.\n\nThis formative experience guided him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Psychology, a choice that caused a gentle rift with his father. It was during an elective course that he discovered art therapy, a field that perfectly fused his psychological curiosity with the memory of his mother\u2019s artistic catharsis. It felt like coming home. After graduation, he earned his certification and began his career, finding his niche working with children navigating trauma, learning disabilities, and the social pressures of school.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when a fire destroyed his family\u2019s home, taking with it his mother\u2019s collection of artwork. The loss was profound, but it solidified Karim\u2019s life\u2019s mission: to help others create new meaning when their own worlds felt lost to flames. He now works for a non-profit that partners with schools and community health clinics.\n\nAt 45, Karim\u2019s life has a gentle, established rhythm. His 3.8-mile commute on the J Church Muni line from his Noe Valley apartment to a clinic in the Mission is a time for quiet reflection. He shares his life with his partner of twelve years, a chef named Marcus, and their social circle is a close-knit group of friends met through work and mutual interests. His hope is to one day open a small, independent art therapy studio focused on serving immigrant and refugee youth, helping children bridge their own worlds, just as he once learned to. For Karim, San Francisco isn\u2019t just a city; it\u2019s a canvas that accepted his unique colors and gave him the space to help others find theirs."

She wasn\u2019t speaking, but her shoulders were heavy with a private sorrow he couldn\u2019t name. Then, she unrolled her paper, dipped her brush in the ink, and the sadness seemed to flow from her fingertips into the elegant, sweeping lines of Arabic. He didn\u2019t understand the words, but he felt their weight lift from her. It was the first time he realized feelings could have a shape, a truth beyond language, planting the seed of his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the specific slide in that SF State lecture hall, the one that changed everything. It was a child\u2019s drawing of a house with a huge, spiky black cloud scribbled over it. The professor explained it was the only way the child could communicate the unspoken violence happening within those walls. Karim felt a jolt of recognition, a click in his mind connecting his mother\u2019s calligraphy to clinical practice. Suddenly, his path wasn\u2019t just a rebellion against his father\u2019s practicality; it had a name and a purpose: art therapy.\n\n3.\nThe night he knew Marcus was the one, they weren't talking about anything important. It was their fourth date, and Marcus was cooking for him in his tiny Mission apartment. Karim watched him chop herbs with intense focus, plating the meal with the same care his mother used for her art. It wasn\u2019t just food; it was comfort, story, and creation offered on a plate. In that quiet act of nourishment, Karim felt profoundly seen and understood, recognizing a partner who also spoke a language beyond words. This was twelve years ago.\n\n4.\nTen years ago, standing before the blackened skeleton of his childhood home, the air thick with wet ash, his father was silent beside him. Karim sifted through the debris, finding a single, water-damaged curl of his mother's art. Most of it was gone, an entire library of her soul turned to smoke. In that moment of profound loss, his professional mission became a personal vow. He would spend his life helping others find a way to create new beauty when their own worlds had been lost to the flames.\n\n5.\nLast year, a seven-year-old girl from Yemen, silent for weeks, finally picked up a brush. In his Mission clinic, she painted two lands. One was bright with sun; the other was San Francisco, shrouded in fog. Between them, she drew a fragile, colorful bridge. Looking at her painting, Karim saw his own history, his parents\u2019 journey, and a perfect, wordless expression of hope. The image affirmed his deepest desire: to build a place dedicated to helping children paint those bridges for themselves, from one world to the next."
