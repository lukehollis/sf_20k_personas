            "value": "Dmitri Ivanov is a product of pragmatic dreams. His parents, immigrants from St. Petersburg, settled in Daly City with the singular goal of providing their son a stability they never had. They envisioned a life for him built on secure, technical skills, not risky passions. Dmitri, dutiful and quiet, absorbed this ethos. He was the kid who built his family's first computer from scavenged parts, finding a quiet satisfaction in the logic of circuit boards and code.\n\nForegoing a traditional four-year university experience, Dmitri enrolled in a community college, earning an Associate's degree in Network Administration. It was a practical choice, one that led directly to a job. His career began with a grueling commute to a Silicon Valley campus, but a key turning point came a year ago when he landed his current role: a fully remote IT Support Specialist. This event reshaped his entire existence.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his world is now largely confined to his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Dmitri\u2019s days are structured by tickets and troubleshooting, a digital ghost helping unseen colleagues across the country. He wakes, logs in, solves problems, and logs off. The isolation, though efficient, can be profound. His social life is small but tight-knit, consisting of a few friends from his old neighborhood he connects with for online gaming sessions and occasional weekend meetups.\n\nTo combat the digital haze, Dmitri has made the physical world his hobby. He knows the best shortcuts through Golden Gate Park for his evening walks and has a running list of the best Russian bakeries on Geary Boulevard. San Francisco isn't a playground of opportunity for him; it's a quiet haven that offers anonymity and independence from his family's watchful eyes. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup or become a CTO. He simply hopes to save enough to travel, perhaps finally visiting the St. Petersburg his parents described, and to one day find a relationship that pulls him away from the screen and more deeply into the fog-laced streets he now calls home."
