A third-generation San Franciscan, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the salty air of Ocean Beach. Her parents, who ran a small, bustling neighborhood grocery store on Noriega Street, instilled in her a formidable work ethic and a deep, unspoken love for the city\u2019s rhythms. While they hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career like medicine, Sarah was captivated by the natural world on the city\u2019s edge\u2014the ecology of Lake Merced and the restoration of the Presidio.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a B.S. in Environmental Science. She dove into the field, starting as a field technician testing soil samples before methodically climbing the ladder. Now, as a Senior Environmental Consultant, she navigates the intricate dance of policy, science, and development from her home office. Her career is a source of pride and quiet conflict; she helps developers comply with environmental laws like CEQA, but privately worries about the relentless pace of change in her hometown.\n\nHer personal life is one of curated tranquility. An amicable divorce five years ago left her single but not lonely, replacing a shared life with a deeper focus on her work and a tight circle of friends. Her commute is a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her home office in her quiet Noe Valley apartment, a move across the city that symbolized her own professional success. Her days are structured: a pre-dawn run up through Twin Peaks to watch the city wake, long hours on Zoom calls and drafting impact reports, and evenings spent either experimenting with recipes from her mother\u2019s cookbook or meeting friends for dinner in the Mission.\n\nAt 48, Sarah looks towards a future beyond private consulting. Her dream is to leverage her two decades of expertise for a public agency or a major nonprofit, like the Bay Conservation and Development Commission. She wants to shift from mitigating damage to actively shaping a more sustainable future for the Bay Area\u2014the only home she has ever known, and the one she is determined to protect."
