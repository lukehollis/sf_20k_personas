The son of Gujarati immigrants who settled in Fremont, he grew up surrounded by the expectation of conventional success: doctor, engineer, a stable path. For a time, he followed it, excelling in math and science with a quiet intensity. The variable that changed his trajectory was his younger sister\u2019s diagnosis with a rare autoimmune disorder. Rohan spent his high school years watching her navigate a labyrinth of clinical trials and conflicting treatment data. He saw firsthand that medicine wasn't just about care; it was about patterns, probability, and the power of information.\n\nThis realization became his calling. Instead of pre-med, he pursued biostatistics at UC San Diego, finding a home in the elegant certainty of numbers. He continued to a graduate program, turning down lucrative offers from pharma and big tech. The pull toward social good was stronger than the allure of stock options. He accepted a position as a Clinical Data Scientist at a UCSF-affiliated research institute, analyzing data to improve health and educational outcomes for underserved communities.\n\nNow 27, Rohan lives in a small but light-filled apartment in the Mission District. His daily routine is a study in contrasts. He begins with a meticulously prepared pour-over coffee before catching the MUNI bus for his 3.8-mile commute. On the ride, he trades the sterile order of his datasets for the vibrant, unpredictable chaos of his neighborhood\u2014the murals, the music, the mix of languages. It grounds him. His social life is a small, close-knit circle of friends from his climbing gym and former colleagues, a chosen family in a city that can feel anonymous.\n\nRohan\u2019s ambition isn\u2019t a flashy startup or a corner office. He dreams of leading a project that creates a predictive model to help identify at-risk pediatric patients earlier, a goal directly inspired by his sister, who is now thriving. He feels deeply connected to San Francisco, not as a tech playground, but as a hub where his analytical mind and compassionate heart can finally solve the same equation. He\u2019s building a life of quiet, data-driven impact."

The doctor showed his parents scatterplots of treatment outcomes, and their faces filled with a blend of hope and confusion. But Rohan saw something different. Beyond the fear for his sister, he saw a language he understood. In the scattered data points, he didn\u2019t see chaos; he saw an equation waiting to be solved. It was the first time he realized compassion needed a blueprint, and that he might be the one to draw it.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent lights of the UCSD library hummed. It was 2 a.m., and Rohan was hunched over a dataset modeling viral transmission in a hypothetical community. Everyone else had left, but he felt electricity in his veins. The numbers weren't just numbers; they were families, consequences, interventions. The elegant curve of the predictive model felt more real and more powerful than any P-chem formula had. In that silent room, he wasn't just doing homework; he was finding his purpose. It felt like coming home.\n\n3.\nAt 24, two letters lay on his kitchen table. One promised a six-figure salary and stock options at a pharma giant. The other, from the UCSF institute, offered a modest stipend and access to messy, complex public health data. He remembered the look in his sister\u2019s eyes years ago\u2014the hope placed in data she couldn't interpret. The choice wasn't a choice at all. He slid the pharma letter into the recycling without a second thought. The real value wasn't in the stock options, but in the dataset.\n\n4.\nOne of his first weekends in the Mission, he was walking down 24th Street, feeling utterly anonymous. Then, the sound of a cumbia beat spilled from a storefront, mixing with the sharp scent of carnitas and the sweet smell of La Reyna\u2019s bakery. He saw a family sharing a fruit cup, laughing. In that moment, the city stopped being an abstract concept. It became a living, breathing organism. His datasets weren't just rows in a spreadsheet; they were these people, this music, this vibrant, complicated life.\n\n5.\nHe was halfway up a V5 at Mission Cliffs, his muscles screaming. The sequence felt impossible, a flawed equation. He was about to drop when his friend yelled from the mat, \u201cRohan, switch your feet! Trust the sloper!\u201d He adjusted his body, and suddenly the path was clear. Tapping the final hold, he looked down at his small circle of friends cheering. It was a different kind of problem-solving\u2014one of trust and shared effort. It reminded him that the most important variables are often the people on the ground with you."
