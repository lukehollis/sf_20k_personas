Her parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small grocery store on Clement Street, instilling in Mei Lin a profound sense of duty and community from a young age. They envisioned a future for her in a prestigious field, a redemption for their own tireless labor.\n\nBright and dedicated, Mei Lin enrolled at San Francisco State University, her sights set on becoming a registered nurse. For two years, she thrived, balancing her studies with shifts at her parents\u2019 store. The dream seemed attainable until her sophomore year, when her father suffered a debilitating stroke. The family store was sold to cover medical bills, and their financial stability collapsed. Putting her family first, Mei Lin made the difficult decision to drop out of SF State. Needing a quick and stable path to employment in a field she understood, she earned a certificate and became a medical assistant.\n\nThat decision defined the next two decades of her life. Today, at 39, Mei Lin works at a small family practice in the Inner Sunset. Her commute is nonexistent because she lives in the cozy, slightly dated in-law unit directly below the clinic\u2014a practical arrangement made with the elderly Dr. Chen, a long-time family friend. Her life is a cycle of care: tending to patients, from toddlers with fevers to elderly neighbors managing chronic conditions, and then heading a few blocks over to check on her aging parents.\n\nHer social life is quiet, consisting mostly of Sunday dim sum with her family and occasional tea with a former college friend. Romance has been a distant thought, secondary to her responsibilities. In the quiet moments after her last patient has left, Mei Lin sometimes pulls out her old nursing textbooks. The dream isn\u2019t dead, just dormant. She hopes to one day go back and finish her degree, not for her parents anymore, but for herself. She yearns to prove that the capable, compassionate woman everyone depends on can still fulfill the promise of her younger self."
