The only child of Indonesian immigrants, she was raised in the foggy suburbs of Daly City, her parents\u2019 pragmatic hopes for her\u2014a stable career in medicine or engineering\u2014a constant, loving pressure. Iona, however, was drawn to the stories hidden within images. She enrolled in Media Studies at SF State, a choice that felt like a quiet act of defiance.\n\nHer post-graduation years were a frustrating blur of freelance video editing gigs and mounting uncertainty. The turning point came during a temp job at a corporate archive, where she discovered the field of Digital Asset Management. It was the perfect synthesis of her creative education and her innate, meticulous nature. She found she didn't just understand media; she excelled at cataloging it, creating an order that made chaos accessible. This revelation led her to her current role as a Digital Asset Manager for a large cultural foundation, where she curates vast digital collections.\n\nNow 31, Iona lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her life is a predictable, comforting rhythm. Her commute is a 3.5-mile journey on the 38 Geary Muni bus, time she uses to listen to history podcasts. Evenings are for walks in Golden Gate Park or trying new restaurants on Clement Street with a small, close-knit circle of friends. Though single, she values the deep platonic connections she\u2019s nurtured since college.\n\nWhile her career provides stability and intellectual challenge, Iona\u2019s true passion project lives on her personal hard drives. She is slowly digitizing and archiving her own family's history\u2014faded photographs from Jakarta, her parents' immigration documents, and recorded oral histories. Her dream isn\u2019t to change the world, but to preserve a small piece of it. For Iona, San Francisco is no longer just a place of work, but the city where she finally learned how to build her own system, one that honors both her family\u2019s past and the future she is carefully constructing for herself."

Her mother pulled out a worn photo of herself as a teenager in Jakarta, impossibly vibrant in a batik dress. While her parents spoke of the future\u2014of Iona\u2019s grades and potential\u2014Iona was lost in the image. She felt the heat, smelled the spices from the unseen market. It was the first time she understood that a photograph wasn't just a memory, but a door. This quiet fascination planted the seed of her need to preserve stories, not just live them.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, in a grim computer lab at SF State, her cursor hovered over \"Declare Major.\" She could hear her father\u2019s loving, pragmatic voice suggesting engineering. But she saw a montage of film stills, of faces telling stories without a word. Clicking \"Media Studies\" was a silent, terrifying act of self-definition. It wasn't about disappointing her parents, but about honoring the quiet, persistent voice inside her that was drawn to the narrative, not the blueprint. It was her first step in building a life on her own terms.\n\n3.\nThe despair of being 24 crystalized one night while editing a wedding video for a faceless couple. The manufactured joy on the screen felt like a mockery of her own mounting uncertainty and debt. Staring at the sterile timeline of other people\u2019s happiness, she felt a profound sense of being adrift, the creative spark she\u2019d cherished in college now just a tool for freelance gigs. That hollow feeling became the metric against which she would later measure true, fulfilling work, a shadow that made her eventual stability feel like sunshine.\n\n4.\nDuring a temp job at 26, her boss pointed to a cart of unlabelled videotapes and dusty slides, calling it \"the backlog.\" Everyone else saw a chore; Iona saw a puzzle. As she created a spreadsheet, meticulously logging dates, subjects, and formats, a deep, resonant calm settled over her. The act of creating order from chaos, of making decades of corporate history searchable and coherent, was a revelation. It was the moment her innate meticulousness and her creative education finally fused. She wasn't lost anymore; she had found her language.\n\n5.\nLast winter, she sat in her Inner Richmond apartment, headphones on, listening to a newly digitized recording of her father recounting their family\u2019s journey from Indonesia. On her monitor was his scanned visa application, all data and official stamps. In her ears was his voice, thick with an emotion he rarely showed, describing the raw hope and fear behind the paperwork. In that instant, her professional skill and her personal quest merged into one. She wasn't just archiving assets; she was safeguarding the soul of her family\u2019s story."
