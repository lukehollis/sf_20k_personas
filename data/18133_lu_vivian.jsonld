Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, her childhood was a fusion of her parents' worlds: her father, an Irish-American history professor from Boston, and her mother, a pragmatic nurse who emigrated from Hong Kong. Their home was filled with books, the smell of her mother's medicinal soups, and lively debates about social justice. This environment instilled in Vivian a deep appreciation for both evidence-based science and the human stories behind the data.\n\nThough she excelled in science at UC Berkeley, Vivian realized during a volunteer stint at a free clinic that she was less interested in treating individual patients and more fascinated by the systemic failures that made them sick. This pivot led her to a Master of Public Health, where she focused on epidemiology and clinical trial design. She found her calling not with a stethoscope, but with spreadsheets and protocols that could affect thousands. Now, as a Clinical Research Manager, she works in a gleaming Mission Bay tower, overseeing complex oncology trials.\n\nHer daily routine is a familiar SF rhythm. An early run through the Panhandle gives way to a crowded Muni ride to her high-stakes job. After work, she decompresses by exploring the farmers' market at the Ferry Building or meeting her tight-knit group of friends for dinner in her Hayes Valley neighborhood. Recently single after a long-term relationship ended, she is navigating the quiet spaces in her life, finding solace in her work and her deep roots in the city.\n\nVivian\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intrinsic; she feels its pulse in the diverse communities her research aims to serve. She dreams of leading a landmark study that significantly improves outcomes for an underserved population, a goal that would honor both her mother\u2019s compassionate care and her father\u2019s belief in changing history. For Vivian, success isn't just professional advancement; it's about making a measurable, lasting mark on the city that raised her."

Her mother, home from SF General, smelled of antiseptic and fatigue as she described a Cantonese-speaking patient struggling to understand their diagnosis. Her father, stirring his tea, quietly noted how language barriers have been a form of medical injustice for a century. In that moment, Vivian first understood that one person\u2019s sickness was just a single data point in a much larger, older story. It rooted in her a need to see the whole pattern.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, her father took her to a World AIDS Day vigil in the AIDS Memorial Grove. Standing in the cold Candlestick Point wind that seemed to funnel into the Grove, she listened to the reading of names\u2014an endless, aching list. She saw the faces of old activists, their grief still raw. The sheer scale of loss, quantified by names spoken into the foggy air, was devastating. It wasn't history in a book; it was a public health catastrophe. That night cemented her resolve to fight indifference with evidence.\n\n3.\nIt was a damp Tuesday at the Berkeley free clinic during her junior year. She was prepping the fifth patient that day with uncontrolled diabetes due to living in a food desert. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming; she was just patching a leak on a sinking ship. She realized then she wasn't interested in the stethoscope. She wanted the blueprints to fix the ship itself. That disillusionment was the most clarifying moment of her life, turning her away from medicine and toward public health.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, a data packet for an oncology trial landed on her desk. The survival curve for a cohort of low-income women\u2014a group historically failed by research\u2014was ticking sharply upward. Looking out at the Bay Bridge from her sterile Mission Bay office, she felt a profound, anonymous connection. This spreadsheet wasn\u2019t cold; it was her mother\u2019s compassion and her father\u2019s social justice, scaled to save lives she\u2019d never meet. It was the quiet, statistical victory that affirmed her entire path.\n\n5.\nTwo months after her breakup, she found herself alone at the Ferry Building market on a Saturday morning. She bought a single, perfect peach and sat by the water. Instead of the familiar ache of a shared weekend ritual, she felt a quiet reclamation of the city. Watching the chaos of vendors and tourists, the Bay shimmering, she felt a solitary rootedness. San Francisco had been her first and most constant partner; in her newfound quiet, she felt it holding her still."
