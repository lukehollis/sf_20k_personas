He was born in Santa Rosa to a white Californian mother, a fiercely independent nurse, and an immigrant father from Pune, India, an engineer who saw elegant systems in everything. Cody\u2019s father passed away in a car accident when he was only seven, leaving him with a proud surname and only faint, warm memories of a man who loved puzzles and taught him how complex things fit together.\n\nRaised by his practical, hardworking mother, Cody identified with his mother's white, Northern Californian upbringing. He inherited his father\u2019s analytical mind, however, finding comfort in order and logic. While his friends were drawn to arts or humanities, Cody was fascinated by the unseen networks that made the world function. This led him to Cal Poly, where he pursued a degree in Supply Chain Management, a field that felt like a direct extension of his father\u2019s engineering legacy.\n\nGraduating with honors, he landed a coveted logistics analyst position in San Francisco, a move that felt like both a homecoming to the Bay Area and a massive leap into adulthood. He settled into a small but modern apartment in Hayes Valley, embracing the 2.7-mile Muni ride to his SoMa office as a daily ritual. His job, tracking shipping containers and optimizing delivery routes, gives him a unique perspective on the city; he sees its invisible circulatory system, the constant flow of goods that keep it alive.\n\nHis days are structured: a morning run through the Panhandle, a focused day of spreadsheets and problem-solving, and evenings often spent at a local climbing gym or trying a new brewery with a small circle of friends from work and college. He is methodical and observant, a planner by nature.\n\nWhile Cody's professional goal is to lead a logistics division within a decade, a deeper aspiration is slowly taking shape. He dreams of one day traveling to India, using the language app on his phone not just as a hobby, but as a tool to one day connect with the Sharma side of his family he\u2019s never known. For now, he finds meaning in ensuring a pallet of goods reaches its destination on time, a small, perfect execution of order in a complex world."

Cody remembers his father\u2019s large, gentle hands guiding his, not giving the answer but showing him how to see the interlocking shapes. The final piece clicks into place. It was the first time he felt the deep, satisfying calm of creating a pocket of perfect, quiet order, a feeling that became the origin point of his lifelong search for structure.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, in the chaotic aftermath of the 2017 wildfires that swept through Santa Rosa, he watched with awe as convoys of trucks delivered water, food, and supplies. While his friends saw tragedy, Cody saw a complex, beautiful ballet of logistics. He realized then that someone, somewhere, had planned this\u2014a system of support laid over a system of chaos. It was in that moment of watching the organized response that his future path to Cal Poly and supply chain management became an absolute certainty, a way to build order.\n\n3.\nDuring his first week of work, he stood at his SoMa office window. Far below, trucks moved along the freeway and container ships dotted the bay. He saw them not as traffic or scenery, but as nodes in a network, a living schematic. It was a dizzying, profound moment of belonging. The abstract concepts from his textbooks were suddenly real, the city\u2019s invisible circulatory system laid bare before him. San Francisco transformed from a place he lived *in* to a system he was a part *of*.\n\n4.\nAlone one evening in his Hayes Valley apartment, he was practicing phrases on his language app. The synthesized voice pronounced a simple greeting in Marathi, his father\u2019s native tongue. Staring at the glowing screen, the word suddenly felt less like a vocabulary lesson and more like a key. A quiet, unexpected ache of connection washed over him, the feeling of a door creaking open to a room he\u2019d never entered. It was then that traveling to India shifted from a vague idea into a necessary future.\n\n5.\nHe called his mom after a brutal day, complaining about a misrouted shipment from Shanghai. After he finished his technical rant, she was quiet for a moment. Then she said, \u201cYour dad would have loved that puzzle. He gave you the blueprint, Cody, but I taught you how to solve it when things get messy.\u201d A wave of warmth and clarity hit him. It wasn\u2019t a negotiation between two worlds anymore; he realized they had both built his foundation, and he was standing firmly upon it."
