Born in Seoul, South Korea, she was adopted as an infant by a warm, bustling Filipino-American family in Daly City. Her parents, a nurse and a union carpenter, raised her amidst a vibrant community where the Filipino concept of *bayanihan*\u2014communal unity and cooperation\u2014was a daily practice. This upbringing instilled in Isabel a profound sense of responsibility for others, shaping her path long before she understood it.\n\nHer journey into social work felt less like a choice and more like a calling. She attended San Francisco State University, drawn to the city's energy and progressive ideals. After earning her degree, she spent over a decade as a frontline case manager, working with immigrant families and at-risk youth. The turning point in her career came during a particularly grueling period in the mid-2000s, where she saw systemic failures repeatedly undermine her best efforts. Frustrated but resolute, she decided she could make a greater impact by shaping policy and programs rather than just navigating them. This ambition drove her to pursue leadership roles, eventually leading to her current position as a Program Director.\n\nNow 52, Isabel lives a life of disciplined purpose in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. Her day begins with a strong coffee and a ride on the J Church streetcar, a 2.5-mile commute that serves as a daily reminder of the diverse, and often struggling, communities she serves. A quiet divorce in her early forties left her with a renewed sense of independence and a deep appreciation for her chosen family\u2014a close-knit circle of friends and colleagues.\n\nIsabel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her very being. She has witnessed the city\u2019s dramatic transformations but remains fiercely dedicated to the people who are its heart and soul. Her dream isn\u2019t for a lavish retirement, but to launch a city-wide mentorship initiative for young social workers, hoping to build the same resilience and community support that has anchored her own life. She finds her joy not in grand gestures, but in the steady, quiet work of making her corner of the world a little more just."

A typhoon had hit the Philippines, and her community mobilized. Her father built the donation boxes; her mother organized the food sale. Isabel\u2019s job was to count the quarters. Watching everyone work together, she felt the pulse of *bayanihan*. It wasn't a concept, but a living thing, and she knew, deep in her bones, that this was how you cared for people.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, her SFSU textbooks felt abstract. Then came her internship. She met a Salvadoran family in a Tenderloin SRO, the child translating complex housing forms for his mother. The room was small, the fear palpable, but their dignity was immense. In that cramped space, Isabel\u2019s vague desire to \"help\" crystallized into a fierce, specific purpose. This was not charity; it was justice. This was the work her whole life had been preparing her for. Her path snapped into focus.\n\n3.\nShe was 36, and the phone call felt like a physical blow. The boy she\u2019d mentored, a bright kid from Guatemala she had spent a year helping, was gone\u2014deported over a clerical error she\u2019d flagged for weeks. The feeling wasn't just failure; it was a profound, suffocating impotence against the system. That evening, staring out her window, her grief hardened into resolve. She could no longer just patch the leaks in the boat. She had to learn how to build a better one.\n\n4.\nShe was 42, and the Mission apartment felt cavernous after her divorce. That first Saturday, she spent all day assembling a bookshelf, instructions spread across the floor. When the last screw turned and the cheap pine stood steady, she felt a quiet click inside herself. It wasn't loneliness, but a sturdy, peaceful solitude. She realized she was not just surviving on her own; she was capable of building her own supports, one piece at a time. The quiet space was hers.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on her morning ride on the J Church. The streetcar lurched past Dolores Park, and Isabel saw a young woman\u2014overflowing tote bag, tired eyes, the unmistakable look of a new social worker\u2014gently give her seat to an elderly man. A wave of profound kinship washed over Isabel. She saw her younger self in that small act of care. It was then her vague dream sharpened into a plan: she had to build a community to sustain them, to anchor them, just as she\u2019d been anchored."
