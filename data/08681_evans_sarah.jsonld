At 54, her life is a testament to curation, a skill she has honed professionally and personally. Her home, a restored Victorian filled with a rotating collection of works by emerging Bay Area artists, doubles as her office. From here, she runs a boutique arts consultancy, advising private collectors and tech companies on acquisitions that are both investments and statements.\n\nRaised in a quiet Ohio suburb by a pragmatic CPA father and a librarian mother, Sarah\u2019s passion for the sublime was an anomaly. They supported her education but hoped she\u2019d \"grow out of\" her artistic leanings. Her escape was an Art History Master's from a university in Boston, which felt like a world away. She arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, initially chasing the promise of the dot-com boom with a brief, miserable stint in corporate marketing. The bust, and a subsequent layoff, was her liberation.\n\nThis period became her crucible. A painful divorce from a man who never understood her passion coincided with her career implosion. With nothing left to lose, she cashed in her meager 401k and started from scratch. She began by offering free curation advice to local cafes, slowly building a portfolio and a word-of-mouth reputation. This hustle forged her into the respected consultant she is today.\n\nNow, her life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco\u2019s art scene. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of gallery owners, chefs, and writers. While she values her independence, she shares a deep, quiet companionship with a landscape architect she meets for walks through the Presidio. Her daily routine is fluid\u2014mornings are for research and calls, afternoons are for studio visits in the Mission or gallery openings in Dogpatch. Her greatest aspiration is no longer financial; she dreams of establishing a grant to support artists struggling to afford a foothold in the city that saved her. For Sarah, art isn\u2019t just on her walls; it was the framework she used to rebuild her life."
