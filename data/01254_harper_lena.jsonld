Raised by pragmatic, working-class parents, she was the first in her family to pursue a four-year degree, attending San Francisco State University. She chose sociology, fascinated by the systems that governed the city she navigated daily from her father's bus window.\n\nHer early career was a grind of administrative roles at non-profits. A pivotal moment came when a mentor at a legal aid society, impressed by Lena\u2019s knack for resolving staff disputes, encouraged her to focus on Human Resources. This ignited a spark. Lena spent the next decade working her way up, earning an MBA at night while holding down a full-time HR assistant job. She landed her first major tech role during the second dot-com boom, finding her pragmatic, people-first approach was a valuable asset in the often-chaotic startup world.\n\nNow 48, Lena\u2019s life is anchored in her meticulously decorated Hayes Valley condo. The 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic gift she savors. Her mornings start with a walk to a local cafe, followed by a day of remote work as a Senior HR Manager for a major tech company. Her role is challenging; she navigates complex DEI initiatives, manages restructuring, and often acts as the human buffer between corporate directives and employee well-being.\n\nA divorce in her late thirties solidified her independence, and her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow professionals and women she\u2019s known since her SF State days. She has a complex love for her hometown, appreciating the opportunities it has given her while mourning the loss of the grittier, more accessible city of her youth.\n\nLena\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. She aspires to start her own HR consultancy focused on building healthier, more equitable workplace cultures in smaller companies. She wants to use her hard-won experience to create positive change, and perhaps, finally find the time to travel somewhere that doesn\u2019t require a Wi-Fi connection."
