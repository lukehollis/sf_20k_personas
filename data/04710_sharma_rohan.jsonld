The only son of Indian immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a math teacher mother\u2014his childhood was a comfortable blueprint for a life in Silicon Valley. His path was pre-paved with expectations of coding camps and a future at a prestigious tech firm. Rohan, dutiful and bright, followed it without question through high school.\n\nThe turning point occurred in a required general education class at UC Davis. He had enrolled as a Computer Science major, but a \"Sociology 101\" course cracked his world open. The lectures on systemic inequality, social mobility, and community resilience resonated more deeply than any algorithm. He saw the struggles of marginalized communities not as data points, but as human stories. Against his parents\u2019 worried advice, he switched his major to Sociology, creating a quiet but persistent rift in his family. They loved him, but they couldn't understand why he would trade a lucrative future for one of service.\n\nAfter graduating, Rohan felt a pull toward direct action. He moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a city of both immense wealth and profound need. He started with an entry-level position at a non-profit in the Tenderloin, and his empathy and tireless work ethic quickly earned him a promotion to Case Manager.\n\nHis current life is one of total immersion. The 0.0-mile commute is literal: Rohan lives in a small subsidized SRO unit within the very supportive housing facility where he works. His clients are his neighbors. The line between his personal and professional life is a single flight of stairs. His days are a whirlwind of navigating bureaucracy, de-escalating crises, and celebrating small victories\u2014a client securing a new ID, another completing a week of sobriety.\n\nHis social life is limited; it\u2019s hard to disconnect when work is an ever-present hum through the walls. He maintains ties with a few college friends and calls his parents weekly, carefully curating conversations to be more about his well-being than the harsh realities of his job. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s for a quiet apartment in the Outer Sunset, to feel the ocean breeze and simply be a resident, not a manager. But for now, he finds purpose in the city\u2019s raw, beating heart, tethered to the belief that he can make a difference, one case file at a time."

For Rohan, whose life was a neat blueprint, it was an earthquake. He suddenly saw the Fremont suburbs not as a haven, but as a place of profound, quiet loneliness. That single academic term, just after his freshman year, wasn't an education; it was an awakening. It shattered his pre-written code and gave him a new, messier, more human language to learn.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe phone call to his parents to explain his major change remains a scar. It was a Tuesday night during his sophomore year. His father, ever the engineer, spoke of salary brackets and career trajectories as if Rohan were a faulty schematic. But it was his mother\u2019s pained silence on the line that truly broke him. In her quiet, he heard not anger, but a deep, sorrowful fear for his future. That conversation created a gulf between them, one he has been trying to bridge with carefully chosen words ever since.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis first week in the Tenderloin, fresh out of college, was a sensory assault. An elderly client named Arthur, a veteran with hands that shook violently, offered him a cup of instant coffee in a styrofoam cup. They just sat in the building\u2019s sterile common room as Arthur spoke quietly about the war. Rohan didn\u2019t solve a single problem that day. He just listened. He went home to his tiny, empty apartment that night feeling utterly overwhelmed, yet more certain of his path than ever before.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe remembers the frantic pounding on his SRO door at 2 AM last winter. It was Maria from down the hall, gripped by a terrifying panic attack. There was no professional boundary to hide behind. He was just Rohan in a t-shirt and sweats, sitting on the cold linoleum floor with his neighbor, breathing with her until the storm passed. That night solidified the impossible reality of his life: his work wasn't a job he left, but a current he lived in, constantly pulling him under.\n\n***\n\n5.\nA few months ago, a young client he\u2019d worked with for nearly a year finally secured a new state ID. The client, who had been living on the streets, held the card up to the fluorescent light of the office, his eyes wide. \"Look,\" he whispered, a real smile spreading across his face. \"I exist again.\" That small piece of plastic represented a hundred tiny battles won. For Rohan, it wasn't a case file closed; it was the entire reason he stayed, a fragile but profound confirmation of his purpose."
