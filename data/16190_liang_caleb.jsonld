Adopted at birth by a second-generation Chinese-American couple\u2014an engineer and a public-school teacher\u2014Caleb grew up in the misty avenues of the Sunset District. His upbringing was a warm blend of cultures: dim sum on Sundays, baseball games at Candlestick Park, and a deep appreciation for the quiet support his parents provided. While they hoped he\u2019d pursue a more stable career, they never discouraged his fascination with the de Young Museum\u2019s eclectic collections.\n\nHis choice to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz felt like a natural extension of his passion, but it left him adrift after graduation. The post-college years were a humbling mix of barista jobs and unpaid gallery-sitting, fueling a quiet anxiety that he\u2019d made a terrible mistake. The turning point came when he volunteered for a small arts non-profit in the Mission. There, amidst grant proposals and artist outreach, he discovered his true talent wasn't just appreciating art, but facilitating it for others. He found purpose in the infrastructure that allows creativity to flourish.\n\nOver the next decade, Caleb methodically worked his way up, moving from volunteer to Program Coordinator and finally to Program Director. He became the crucial bridge between philanthropic donors and the emerging artists his organization championed. Now 37, his life has a comfortable rhythm. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in NoPa (North of the Panhandle), and his daily 2.5-mile bike commute to his SoMa office is a cherished ritual, a moving meditation through the city\u2019s heart.\n\nHis social circle is tight-knit, composed of friends from his early non-profit days and his long-term partner, a landscape architect. Evenings are spent at gallery openings, neighborhood potlucks, or simply unwinding at home. Caleb\u2019s deepest aspiration is to secure a major endowment for his non-profit, ensuring its permanence. He dreams of creating a lasting institution that nurtures the city's creative soul long after he\u2019s gone\u2014a legacy of support, much like the one his parents gave him."

While his friends were obsessed with video games, Caleb felt a profound connection to the anonymous artist who had shaped this wood generations ago. It wasn't just art; it was a lifeline to another world. That feeling\u2014of bridging time and culture through a single object\u2014planted a seed of purpose in him, long before he understood what it was.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-three, he was sitting alone in a silent, sterile Union Square gallery, watching rain streak the windows. An abstract painting worth more than his parents\u2019 house hung opposite him. The crushing irony of being surrounded by immense value while feeling utterly worthless was suffocating. He wasn\u2019t just broke; he was adrift, fearing his passion had led him to a dead end. That chilling memory of artistic isolation became the fuel for his mission to create community and access for others.\n\n3.\nThe Mission non-profit\u2019s projector died five minutes before their main fundraising event. While everyone else panicked, Caleb, then a volunteer, calmly took it apart on the floor. He found a loose connection, tightened it with a borrowed dime, and the artist's vibrant images flooded the screen just as the first donors arrived. In that moment of quiet, technical victory, he felt a surge of fulfillment far greater than just looking at art. He had fixed the conduit, and he knew, with blazing clarity, that this was his calling.\n\n4.\nHe remembers giving his parents a tour of a gallery opening he had organized. An emerging sculptor was explaining her work, and Caleb saw his father, the quiet engineer, listening with intense focus. Later, his dad clapped him on the shoulder. \"I see now,\" he said. \"You build the scaffolding so they can create.\" The simple, technical metaphor was the highest form of praise, a powerful validation that finally bridged the gap between their world and his. It was a moment of profound acceptance and pride.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, cresting the hill on Fell Street during his morning bike commute, the city unfolded below him in the sharp morning light. He wasn't just seeing streets and buildings; he saw a fragile ecosystem of studios, galleries, and performance spaces he fought for every day. The simple, rhythmic push of the pedals felt like an act of devotion. His goal solidified then, not as an ambition, but as a responsibility: to ensure this creative heart of San Francisco kept beating."
