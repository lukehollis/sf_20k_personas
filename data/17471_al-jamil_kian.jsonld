The son of a fiercely intellectual Iranian poet who fled Tehran in the late 1960s and an American anthropologist from Berkeley, Kian grew up in a Haight-Ashbury home filled with the scent of saffron, the sound of spoken Farsi, and impassioned debates over cups of tea. He felt perpetually between cultures\u2014not quite Iranian enough for his father\u2019s \u00e9migr\u00e9 friends, yet set apart by his heritage in the schoolyard. He found his own language not in poetry, but in the silent, structured logic of an early Commodore 64, a machine that bridged his father\u2019s abstract world with his mother\u2019s fascination for human systems.\n\nThis fascination led him to pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from Stanford in the late 1990s, just as the digital world was exploding. He was captivated by the idea of making technology less of a cold tool and more of a natural extension of human intent. Eschewing the frantic startup chase of the dot-com bubble, Kian opted for a stable, methodical career, believing in long-term innovation over disruptive fads. This patient approach saw him rise steadily, eventually becoming the Director of R&D for a major management consulting firm, where he now leads a team shaping the digital tools used by global corporations.\n\nA key turning point was his father\u2019s passing a decade ago. Sorting through volumes of unpublished poetry, Kian had an epiphany: his work, in its own way, was about communication and beauty, just like his father\u2019s. It solidified his commitment to creating technology with a conscience. He lives in a minimalist Hayes Valley condo with his partner of twelve years, Elena, an architect. Their life is a curated routine of shared passions: morning coffee while reading, a short ride-share to his SoMa office, and evenings spent discussing design, visiting the SFMOMA, or walking their rescue dog through the Alamo Square dog park.\n\nNow, at 54, Kian\u2019s aspirations transcend his career. He has a comfortable life, but he dreams of legacy. He wants to fund a fellowship for humanities students to enter the tech field, believing that an understanding of art and history is crucial to building an ethical digital future. San Francisco, for him, isn't just a hub of innovation; it's the city that embraced his parents' disparate worlds and allowed him to synthesize them into a life of purpose."

His own tongue felt thick, inadequate among his father\u2019s friends. In his room, the Commodore 64 hummed. He typed `LOAD \"*\",8,1`. The logic was a balm, a universal language that didn\u2019t care about accents or heritage. It was the first time he understood that structure could be a form of sanctuary, a principle that would define his entire career. He wasn't between worlds here; he was building one.\n\n2. It was 1998 in a Stanford computer lab. A classmate, flush with paper wealth from a pet-food delivery startup, was mapping his exit strategy. The air buzzed with frantic ambition, but Kian felt a profound disconnect. It seemed like a gold rush\u2014all frantic digging, no architecture. He saw the fleeting nature of the fad, a human system destined for collapse. That day, he quietly committed to building things that would last, not just cash out. Patience became his most valuable asset.\n\n3. A decade ago, in the silence of his late father\u2019s study, he sat surrounded by stacks of unpublished Farsi poetry. His fingers traced the delicate script. One line, loosely translated, spoke of \u201cbuilding a house from sound.\u201d In that moment, the division he\u2019d felt his whole life dissolved. His code, his systems, his interfaces\u2014they were all just another form of poetry, an attempt to build a beautiful, logical home for human thought. He finally understood his father\u2019s legacy by fully embracing his own.\n\n4. Soon after moving into their Hayes Valley condo, the space was still an echo chamber. He watched Elena sit on the floor, sketching on a napkin not just furniture, but the flow of their morning routine\u2014the path from the coffee maker to the window seat. She was designing a system for living. He saw his own mind reflected in hers, his HCI principles applied to light and space. He knew then that their life together would be their most meaningful, intentionally designed project.\n\n5. One evening last spring, walking their dog at Alamo Square, Kian saw the glowing Salesforce Tower piercing the fog behind the Victorian rooftops of the Painted Ladies. The contrast struck him as the central metaphor for his life\u2014and for San Francisco. Tech's relentless future silhouetted against culture's deep foundations. He realized then that his legacy couldn\u2019t just be in the tower. It had to be the bridge between the two. The idea for the fellowship clicked into place, clear and urgent."
