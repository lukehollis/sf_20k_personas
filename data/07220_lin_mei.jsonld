The daughter of industrious immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up to the scent of butter and sugar from her parents\u2019 small neighborhood bakery. They instilled in her a profound sense of duty and a quiet resilience, hoping she would pursue a stable, lucrative career as an engineer or doctor. However, Mei\u2019s path was irrevocably altered at sixteen when her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. She watched her proud, capable parents become lost and overwhelmed by the American healthcare system\u2014a labyrinth of complex terminology, impersonal appointments, and crushing paperwork. It was then Mei found her calling: she would become the guide her family so desperately needed.\n\nForsaking the STEM path, she pursued a Bachelor's in Sociology and then earned a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University. Her specialization was clear from the start: medical social work. She wanted to stand in the gap for vulnerable patients, translating not just language, but culture and fear. Now, at 26, Mei is a vital presence at the UCSF Parnassus campus, advocating for patients facing life-altering diagnoses.\n\nHer life is a study in proximity. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her small, rent-controlled studio in Cole Valley to the hospital doors. This hyper-local existence is a necessity; her days are emotionally taxing, spent arranging home care, counseling grieving families, and fighting with insurance companies. Her mornings begin with a grounding walk in the misty edge of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to fortify herself for the day. Evenings are for decompressing: cooking simple, comforting meals reminiscent of her childhood, reading novels that offer escape, and connecting with a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow social workers who understand the weight of their shared profession.\n\nWhile deeply connected to her work and her small corner of the city, Mei dreams of broader impact. She envisions developing hospital policies that are inherently more compassionate and culturally competent. Personally, she hopes to find a relationship with someone who understands her demanding life and, one day, to cultivate a small garden\u2014a patch of quiet growth amidst the city\u2019s constant motion."
