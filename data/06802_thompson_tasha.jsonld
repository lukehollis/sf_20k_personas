Raised in a bustling West Oakland home by a longshoreman father and a teacher\u2019s aide mother, Tasha was the first in her family to earn a four-year degree. She graduated from SF State with a Bachelor's in Sociology, fascinated by how systems and communities function, though uncertain of a direct career path.\n\nHer professional life began not in tech, but at a struggling Bay Area arts non-profit. As an administrative coordinator, she discovered her true talent: bringing order to chaos. She created systems for everything from donor management to event logistics, becoming the de facto operations lead. This experience was her turning point. A friend, dazzled by her efficiency, recruited her for an \"office manager\" role at a promising tech startup. It was a culture shock, but Tasha thrived. She wasn't a coder, but she could organize the brilliant, scattered minds around her. She built the operational scaffolding\u2014HR processes, vendor contracts, office logistics\u2014that allowed the company to scale. Over a decade, her title evolved from Office Manager to her current role as an Operations Manager.\n\nNow 41, Tasha\u2019s life is centered in her Hayes Valley condo, the hub from which she manages a distributed team across multiple time zones. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are a blur of Slack pings and video calls, a digital switchboard connecting people and projects. To decompress, she\u2019s fiercely protective of her analog time. Evenings are for a pottery class where the tactile pull of clay is a welcome antidote to screens, or long walks through the neighborhood, savoring the familiar faces at her local coffee shop and bookstore.\n\nWhile proud of the stability she\u2019s built, Tasha contemplates her next chapter. She dreams of leveraging her hard-won operational expertise for a cause, perhaps consulting for the kinds of non-profits where she began her career. She wants to take the efficiency of Silicon Valley and apply it to organizations that are changing the world, bringing her own story full circle."
