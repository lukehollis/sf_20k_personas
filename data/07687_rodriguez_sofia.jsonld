The only child of first-generation Mexican immigrants, she grew up in Hayward, where the pursuit of the American Dream cast a long, stressful shadow over their home. Her parents, hardworking and loving, communicated their anxieties not with words, but through clipped sentences and weary sighs. Sofia became an expert translator of silence, a pint-sized mediator who learned to read the emotional climate of a room before she could read novels. This innate sensitivity became the bedrock of her future career.\n\nHer academic journey took her across the bay to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree in Psychology, followed by a Master of Science in Counseling Psychology from the University of San Francisco. The transition to the city was both a liberation and a challenge. During her intense graduate studies, a long-term relationship crumbled, a painful turning point that forced her to apply the clinical theories she was learning to her own life. It was a humbling experience that stripped away any pretense of having all the answers, replacing it with a profound empathy for the vulnerability of others. The grueling process of completing 3,000 supervised hours for her licensure solidified her resolve; she wasn\u2019t just choosing a job, she was answering a calling.\n\nNow 27, Sofia lives a deliberately structured life in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is zero miles; a corner of her living room, tastefully sectioned off, serves as her office and sanctuary. Her days are a carefully managed sequence of telehealth sessions with clients grappling with anxiety, relationship issues, and cultural identity conflicts. To decompress, she relies on ritual: morning walks in Golden Gate Park with a thermos of tea, evenings spent experimenting with her mother\u2019s recipes, and weekly dinners with a tight-knit group of friends from her grad program.\n\nSofia feels deeply connected to the quiet, foggy streets of her neighborhood, a peaceful anchor in a bustling city. Her dream is to one day open a small, community-focused private practice with a colleague, specializing in supporting bicultural individuals navigating the space between worlds\u2014a space she knows so intimately. She hopes to provide the clarity and compassion she once yearned for in the silences of her own childhood home."
