The daughter of a geologist and a botanist, her upbringing was a global lesson in ecosystems, from the tide pools of Monterey to the volcanic soil of Costa Rica. She never had one hometown, but her classroom was the planet itself. This unconventional upbringing led her to a formal education at a small, intense liberal arts college in New England, followed by a Master's in Environmental Policy from the London School of Economics.\n\nHer early career began with promise at a major environmental non-profit in D.C. However, she grew disillusioned by the slow pace of change and bureaucratic inertia. The turning point came when a multi-year project she led, which detailed catastrophic environmental risks, was ultimately green-lit due to political maneuvering. Heartbroken and furious, Sarah quit. She moved to San Francisco, drawn by its scrappy idealism and proximity to both nature and innovation, and established herself as an independent consultant.\n\nNow 40, Sarah lives in a cozy, book-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a sunlit home office overlooking a small garden. Her days are a mix of video calls with green tech startups and municipalities, data analysis, and writing policy recommendations. She\u2019s built a reputation for sharp, uncompromising advice. Her partner, Leo, a freelance graphic designer she met at a climate protest, often works alongside her.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. Morning rituals involve grabbing coffee from a cafe on 9th Avenue before a walk through the botanical gardens in Golden Gate Park, her sanctuary. Evenings are for hosting small dinner parties or attending community meetings. While professionally successful, Sarah aspires for more. She dreams of launching her own non-profit, one that actively litigates on behalf of endangered ecosystems, translating her lifetime of passion into tangible, protective action."
