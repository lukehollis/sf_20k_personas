Raised in the stable, predictable suburbs of Madison, Wisconsin, by a high school principal and a dental hygienist, Sarah was encouraged to pursue a practical path. She rebelled in her own gentle way, choosing to study Art History at the University of Wisconsin. She loved the grand narratives behind architecture and the stories embedded in design, even if she had no clear career plan.\n\nHer move to San Francisco was not for a job, but for a college boyfriend who landed a coveted software engineering role. They settled into a small apartment, but as his life accelerated into the tech world\u2019s orbit, theirs drifted apart. The breakup, two years after arriving, was a pivotal moment. Stranded and with a degree that felt useless in this new landscape, Sarah took the first stable job she could find: a temp receptionist at a commercial real estate firm. Unexpectedly, she thrived. Her artistic eye gave her a unique appreciation for building aesthetics, and her studious nature helped her quickly master the complex jargon of leases and zoning laws.\n\nNow, at 33, Sarah is a commercial real estate assistant for a major tech company, working entirely from her tidy, well-decorated apartment in NOPA (North of the Panhandle). Her 0.0-mile commute means her daily routine is a well-managed cycle: a morning walk to The Mill for coffee, hours of coordinating site visits and drafting agreements via Slack and Zoom, and a midday break to walk through the Panhandle or up to Alamo Square to clear her head.\n\nThough she enjoys the security of her job, she feels a lingering disconnect. She facilitates the acquisition of massive, sterile office towers, a world away from the historic, soulful buildings she once studied. Her true aspiration is to pivot, perhaps by getting a real estate license and specializing in the restoration and leasing of historic commercial properties, blending her passion with her hard-won pragmatism. Her social life is a small, tight-knit group of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014met through old jobs and hobbies. San Francisco, once a city she moved to for someone else, has become unequivocally hers. She found her footing not in the life she planned, but in the one she was forced to build for herself."
