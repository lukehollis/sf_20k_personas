            "value": "Omar Hassan Evans is a man built from disparate parts, much like the city he maintains. His name itself tells a story: \"Omar Hassan\" from his Egyptian immigrant father, a quiet intellectual who drove a taxi, and \"Evans\" from his mother, a pragmatic Oakland-born waitress. Raised in the Outer Richmond, Omar grew up between worlds\u2014the aroma of his father\u2019s ful medames in the kitchen and the clang of the N Judah streetcar outside. He never felt fully connected to either heritage, simply identifying as a San Franciscan.\n\nFormal education was a poor fit for Omar\u2019s restless, hands-on nature. While his friends aimed for college, he was fascinated by how things worked, taking apart broken radios and fixing leaky faucets. After high school, he bypassed higher education for a series of trade jobs, learning plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry not in a classroom, but in the guts of old Victorian homes. He found deep satisfaction in restoring order from chaos, a skill that defined his career path.\n\nThe turning point came twenty years ago when he was offered the position of Building Maintenance Supervisor for a large, pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. The role came with a basement apartment, reducing his commute to zero and making the building his entire world. This stability, however, came at a cost. His marriage frayed and eventually broke under the strain of him always being on call, his life inextricably tethered to the whims of aging pipes and faulty wiring.\n\nToday, Omar\u2019s life moves to the rhythm of the building. His routine is a cycle of preventative maintenance, emergency calls, and quiet observation. He knows the residents not as close friends, but as a collection of familiar faces and predictable habits\u2014the law student on the third floor who always clogs her drain, the elderly woman on the top floor whose radiator he adjusts with the changing seasons. His social life is sparse, consisting of polite nods in the lobby and a weekly beer with a fellow supervisor from a building down the street.\n\nOmar\u2019s dream is not of wealth or travel, but of a quiet legacy. He hopes that long after he retires, the systems he's meticulously maintained will continue to function flawlessly. He aspires to one day have a small workshop of his own, a place to tinker on personal projects without the urgency of a tenant\u2019s request. His connection to San Francisco is not in its landmarks or culture, but in the humming, breathing structure he calls both his workplace and his home."
