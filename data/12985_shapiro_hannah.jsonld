Her younger brother, David, was diagnosed with autism at a young age, and Hannah\u2019s childhood was less about playgrounds and more about learning patience, interpreting nonverbal cues, and celebrating small, hard-won victories. While her peers stressed about grades, Hannah was more focused on helping David navigate a world not built for him. School felt secondary; her real education was happening at home. Consequently, she graduated with a general studies diploma, her ambitions practical rather than academic.\n\nThe turning point came at 19. Feeling adrift but certain she wanted to help families like her own, she discovered the role of a Registered Behavior Technician. It was a perfect fit\u2014a hands-on career that didn\u2019t require a four-year degree. After earning her certification, she set her sights on San Francisco, a city known for its progressive resources and a place that promised an identity separate from being \u201cDavid\u2019s sister.\u201d\n\nNow 24, Hannah lives in a shared Inner Richmond apartment, the fog-laced streets a world away from Sacramento\u2019s heat. Her daily routine is a testament to city life on a budget. She wakes early, packs a lunch, and takes the 38R Geary Rapid bus 3.5 miles to a non-public school in the Western Addition. There, she spends her days implementing behavior plans, her calm demeanor a steadying force for elementary-aged children. The work is emotionally taxing but incredibly rewarding.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, revolving around one of her roommates and a colleague. Weekends are for low-cost joys: long walks through Golden Gate Park, exploring Clement Street\u2019s dim sum spots, and cheap beer at a local dive bar. Her connection to San Francisco is rooted in its purpose; it\u2019s the city that gave her a career and a sense of self. Hannah dreams of one day pursuing further education to become a Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst (BCaBA). For now, though, her aspiration is simpler: to continue her meaningful work and afford to stay in the city that finally feels like home."

She was methodically building a small LEGO house, when he silently crawled over, picked up the tiny blue door, and pressed it perfectly into the frame. He didn't look at her, but his shoulder leaned against hers for a second. In that quiet, shared moment of creation, Hannah felt a wave of profound love wash over her. It wasn\u2019t a report card, but it was the best grade she had ever earned.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, adrift and working a dead-end retail job, she was scrolling through community college programs late at night. She saw the description for a Registered Behavior Technician. It detailed using patience and positive reinforcement to help others navigate the world. A jolt went through her. It was as if someone had written a job description for her entire childhood. In the glow of the screen, she saw a future\u2014a purpose\u2014and for the first time, it felt like it was truly hers to build.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHer first morning in the Inner Richmond apartment was disorienting. Instead of the familiar glare of the Sacramento sun, a thick, cool fog pressed against the window, muffling the world. Standing there with her mug of tea, watching the 38R bus rumble down Geary, she realized no one in this entire city knew her as \"David's sister.\" She was just Hannah. The feeling wasn\u2019t loneliness, but a vast, thrilling anonymity. It was the feeling of a blank page, and she couldn\u2019t wait to start writing.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt had been three months of patient work with a nonverbal seven-year-old in her Western Addition school. Three months of tantrums and small, incremental steps. Then one afternoon, the little girl, wanting a break, deliberately located the picture card for \"bubbles\" and handed it to Hannah. Her eyes met Hannah's for a fleeting, perfect second. In that instant, Hannah felt the echo of her brother\u2019s LEGO door. It was the same quiet victory, a validation that made every emotionally taxing day worth it. She was in the right place.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast weekend, she and her roommate were walking through Golden Gate Park, talking about nothing and everything. They stopped near the Conservatory of Flowers, sharing a cheap pastry from a bakery on Clement. The fog was rolling in, the air smelled like eucalyptus and damp earth, and she felt a simple, uncomplicated happiness. This was what it meant to afford San Francisco\u2014not the rent, but these small, perfect moments of peace. She felt a fierce determination to protect this life she had so carefully built."
