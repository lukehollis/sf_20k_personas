Born in Vallejo to a Black American father who worked at the naval shipyard and a Filipina mother who was a registered nurse, Zara grew up understanding life as a bridge between cultures. Her household was a place of loving compromise, where soul food and Sinigang shared the dinner table, and conversations about social justice were as common as discussions about Catholic saints. This upbringing, seeing her parents navigate different worlds with grace and resilience, became the scaffolding of her identity.\n\nDrawn to the city\u2019s vibrant energy, Zara moved to San Francisco to attend SF State, pursuing a degree in Public Health. It was a volunteer position at a free clinic in the Tenderloin during her junior year that became her crucible. Witnessing the raw, unmet needs of the city's most vulnerable populations\u2014from the lingering shadow of the AIDS crisis to the struggles of new immigrants\u2014solidified her calling. She wasn\u2019t interested in policy from a distance; she wanted to be on the ground, building systems of care.\n\nHer career was a steady, determined climb within the city\u2019s non-profit sector. After years of managing outreach and education, she became the Director of Community Health Programs, a role she embodies with fierce compassion. A ten-year marriage ended amicably in her late thirties, a shared decision with a man whose corporate ambitions never quite aligned with her community-focused mission. The experience left her not bitter, but more deeply committed to her own path, surrounded by a tight-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of colleagues and friends.\n\nToday, Zara\u2019s life is rooted in a quiet rhythm. Her 4.8-mile Muni ride from her Inner Richmond apartment is a cherished ritual of reading and observation. Evenings are for walks in Golden Gate Park or perfecting her mother's lumpia recipe. Her dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of legacy: to secure permanent funding for a youth wellness center. Zara Hayes is a quintessential San Franciscan\u2014not by birth, but by choice, her life a testament to building a healthier, more connected city, one program at a time."

Her dad, smelling of metal and shipyard air, was talking about union dues while her mother, still in nursing scrubs, ladled soupy, sour Sinigang into a bowl next to a skillet of cornbread. There was no friction, just a warm, weary harmony. In that moment, watching them bridge their worlds with food and faith, she first understood love not as a single identity, but as the patient, resilient work of building a home between two shores.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent lights of the Tenderloin free clinic hummed, buzzing with a desperation her public health textbooks never captured. It was her junior year at SF State. A young man, his eyes hollowed out by fear and addiction, couldn't stop his hands from shaking as she tried to help him with an intake form. The vast, terrifying gap between policy and his singular, immense pain hit her like a physical blow. Her career path snapped into focus then; she would never work from a distance.\n\n3.\nThe day they decided to separate, she and her husband stood on their small balcony. He gestured toward the gleaming Salesforce Tower, outlining a new corporate strategy. She found her own gaze drifting west, toward the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park. There was no anger, only the quiet, profound recognition of two different maps. In that moment of amicable divergence, she felt not a sense of loss, but of solidifying her own true north, reaffirming that her life\u2019s capital was community, not commerce.\n\n4.\nIt was the first community health fair for immigrant seniors she had organized from the ground up. An elderly Cantonese woman, who had been fiercely distrustful for weeks, approached her, not with a question, but with a small, warm orange she pushed into Zara\u2019s hand. The woman simply nodded, a universe of gratitude in the gesture. That simple, wordless exchange was more validating than any funding report. It taught her that trust is the most vital currency, earned one small, human offering at a time.\n\n5.\nRiding the N-Judah home last spring, her book forgotten in her lap, she watched the city slide by. As the tram slowed, she saw a group of teenagers she recognized from a youth outreach program, laughing and jostling each other on the corner, just being kids. They didn\u2019t see her. In that anonymous, fleeting moment, seeing them safe and vibrant in the city she worked for, she felt the quiet, steady hum of purpose. This was it\u2014not the grand opening, but the living, breathing result."
