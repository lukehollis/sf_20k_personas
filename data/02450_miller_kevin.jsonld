Born and raised in suburban Cleveland, his pragmatic family pushed him toward a stable career, resulting in a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration from Ohio State. He followed the path laid for him, moving to San Francisco in the late 1990s for a lucrative, soul-crushing accounting gig at a burgeoning dot-com. For five years, he crunched numbers while his passion for art\u2014nurtured through elective courses and museum visits\u2014withered.\n\nThe dot-com bust in 2001 was his liberation. Laid off and disillusioned, Kevin had a clarifying moment outside the SFMOMA. He vowed never again to work in a field that didn't feed his soul. He started volunteering at small galleries, eventually landing a part-time position at Galerie Blanche. Now, nearly two decades later, he is the full-time Gallery Assistant, a permanent fixture who knows the history of every artist who has shown there.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute defines his existence. Mornings begin with the smell of coffee and linseed oil, his routine a quiet ritual of checking inventory, arranging lighting, and preparing for the day. He is the quiet guardian of the gallery's soul, the one who can tell a nervous young buyer the story behind a particular brushstroke. His social life is woven into his work; his friends are the artists, the collectors, and the eccentric gallery owner, Elara, who relies on him completely. Past relationships often buckled under the weight of his devotion to this small world.\n\nKevin\u2019s dream isn't to own the gallery\u2014that\u2019s too much business, the life he fled. His aspiration is to one day curate a small, perfect show for an undiscovered local artist he believes in. He finds deep contentment in his role as a custodian of beauty, a quiet anchor in the ever-changing sea of San Francisco. His life may seem small from the outside, but from his window overlooking the gallery entrance, it feels complete."
