The only child of Iranian immigrants who settled in Berkeley, he grew up between his engineer father\u2019s world of precise calculations and his mother\u2019s, a ceramicist whose hands shaped beauty from shapeless clay. Their home, filled with schematics and Persian poetry, became the crucible for his future. A family trip to Isfahan at sixteen was his turning point. Standing beneath the soaring, tiled dome of the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, he saw the perfect synthesis of his parents' passions: mathematics made divine, and engineering elevated to artistry. His path was set.\n\nHe pursued his calling with focus, earning his graduate degree in Architecture from UC Berkeley. While many of his peers were lured by high-paying tech jobs, Kian was drawn to the tangible legacy of building. He landed a position as an architectural designer at a respected firm in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, where he now contributes to projects shaping the city's future skyline.\n\nKian lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant, chaotic energy he finds endlessly inspiring. His 2.8-mile bike commute is a daily ritual, not a chore. It\u2019s his time to observe the city\u2019s details: the ornate ironwork on a Victorian home, the sleek glass curtain of a new tower, the ever-changing murals on Clarion Alley. His life is a balance of intense workdays spent modeling in Revit and relaxed evenings with a small circle of friends, often grabbing burritos or catching an indie film at the Roxie.\n\nSocially, he is warm but reserved, more comfortable in small groups than large crowds. His closest connections are with a few fellow designers and an old college friend who works in biotech. While he is professionally fulfilled, Kian dreams of obtaining his full architect\u2019s license and one day opening a boutique firm. His ultimate aspiration is to design sustainable, community-focused spaces that merge Californian modernism with the timeless, human-centric principles of Persian design\u2014creating structures, like the ones that first inspired him, that feel both innovative and ancient."

Light filtered through the lattice work, illuminating the intricate, spiraling tiles of the dome above. It wasn't just a building; it was mathematics made divine. In that silent, sun-dappled space, the two halves of his world\u2014his father\u2019s precise logic and his mother\u2019s tactile art\u2014fused into a single, profound truth. He wasn\u2019t torn between two worlds; he was the synthesis of them. His life\u2019s purpose clicked into place under that soaring ceiling.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in the Wurster Hall studio at Berkeley, the air thick with the smell of spray mount and despair. His model for a community center felt sterile, a technical exercise without a soul. He thought of his friends coding for startups, their paths so much clearer. In a moment of frustration, remembering his mother\u2019s hands shaping clay, he broke a piece of the facade, creating an unplanned, asymmetrical courtyard. Suddenly, the entire structure came alive. In that small act of defiance, he reaffirmed his commitment to the messy, tangible beauty of building.\n\n3.\nKian recalls the weight of the keys in his hand after signing the lease for his Mission apartment. It was a unicorn: rent-controlled, with a bay window overlooking the neighborhood\u2019s chaotic energy. The overwhelming sense of relief was physical. It wasn't just a place to live; it was a foothold, an anchor of stability in a city defined by transience. Standing in the empty living room, hearing the distant sounds of a mariachi band, he felt he could finally start building a life here, not just a career.\n\n4.\nHe was biking home through Clarion Alley when he saw an artist on a ladder, spraying a vibrant face over an older, fading mural. Kian stopped, straddling his bike, mesmerized. The city wasn't a static museum of Victorian ironwork and glass towers; it was a living canvas, constantly being painted over, re-imagined. This daily dose of ephemeral beauty became a vital part of his process, reminding him that even the most permanent structures must have a soul that speaks to the fleeting, vibrant present.\n\n5.\nAfter a quiet Iranian film at the Roxie, he found himself explaining his dream for a future firm to his friend from college. \"So you want to build spaces that feel like a poem by Hafez,\" she said simply, finishing her popcorn. The accuracy of her statement stunned him. To have his deepest, most abstract ambition\u2014the fusion of modernism with the timeless feeling of Persian art\u2014so effortlessly understood felt more validating than any professional praise. It was the quiet encouragement he needed to believe his dream was truly possible."
