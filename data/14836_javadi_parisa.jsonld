Born in Tehran, she was only five when her parents, a civil engineer and a professor, fled Iran in 1979 with two suitcases and a fierce determination to rebuild. They settled in Fremont, where Parisa watched them turn relentless work into a comfortable suburban life. Their sacrifice instilled in her a profound understanding of risk, resilience, and the tangible value of assets. This became the bedrock of her ambition.\n\nShe excelled, earning a B.A. from UC Berkeley before securing her MBA in Finance from Stanford. Parisa bypassed the allure of tech startups for the discipline of investment banking, cutting her teeth during the brutal dot-com bust. While others saw chaos, she saw a future where tangible assets like real estate would inevitably merge with technology. This foresight was her turning point. She pivoted to venture capital, focusing on the nascent field of PropTech. A decade of savvy investments and sharp negotiations saw her rise to Managing Partner at her firm.\n\nToday, Parisa\u2019s life is a study in curated precision. She resides in a minimalist Pacific Heights condo with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Her day begins at 5:30 a.m. with international market reports and a strong Persian tea. A black car service ferries her the short distance to her Financial District office, a commute she uses for calls with European partners. She is divorced, a conscious trade-off made years ago for her career, and maintains a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, surgeons, and fellow VCs.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deeply symbiotic. The city represents both the sanctuary that welcomed her family and the arena where she conquered her ambitions. At 52, having achieved financial success, her aspirations are shifting. Parisa dreams of establishing a fund dedicated to supporting ventures founded by immigrant and refugee women. She wants to cultivate the same seeds of opportunity that were planted for her, ensuring the city that built her up continues to build others."

A real home.\u201d Standing on the patchy lawn of their first Fremont house, the scent of cut grass felt foreign, American. It wasn\u2019t the grandeur of Tehran, but the solid weight of that key was everything. It wasn't just metal; it was proof. A bulwark against the chaos they\u2019d fled. In that moment, she understood that security wasn\u2019t an idea\u2014it was a deed, a foundation, a tangible asset you could hold.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 1993, her sophomore year at Berkeley. A protest surged across Sproul Plaza, full of righteous energy. But Parisa felt a chill. She saw shadows of another revolution, one that had cost her family everything. These students shouted for change; her parents had fled it. That day, she turned away from the noise. She realized her power wouldn\u2019t be found in a placard, but in a balance sheet. True, lasting change, she decided, was built, bought, and owned, not just demanded on a street corner.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe liquidation felt like a funeral. It was 2001, and she stood in a cavernous South of Market office, the ghost of a failed startup. Aeron chairs were piled high, but Parisa smelled the new carpet and saw the fiber optic cables snaking through the walls. While her colleagues mourned digital dreams, she saw the future. The physical space itself was the enduring asset. Technology and real estate weren\u2019t separate worlds; they were about to collide. It was the spark that ignited her entire career.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe pen felt heavier than the wedding ring ever had. After signing the final divorce papers at age 43, she didn\u2019t cry. Driving back across the Bay Bridge, the city skyline rose before her, sharp and unyielding. It was a conscious trade. She was sacrificing a certain kind of partnership for the ambition the city demanded. The view wasn\u2019t a consolation prize; it was her confirmation. San Francisco was the demanding, all-consuming relationship that would endure. Her ambition now had no rival.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last month, watching fog engulf the Golden Gate from her window, she held a warm cup of Persian tea. The view, once a symbol of her arrival in the arena, now felt different. It was a vantage point. She thought of a woman stepping off a plane at SFO today, carrying the same quiet fear and fierce hope her mother once did. The idea for her fund wasn't just a legacy project anymore; it was a debt of honor. A bridge to be built for them."
