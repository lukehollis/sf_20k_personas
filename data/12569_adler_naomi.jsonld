Born to first-generation Hong Kong immigrants, she grew up in the fog-draped avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. Her parents, who ran a small corner grocery, instilled in her a formidable work ethic, viewing education as the only true currency in their new country. Naomi internalized this lesson, excelling in school with a quiet, fierce determination. She saw the city not just as her home, but as a ladder to be climbed.\n\nHer path was a straight line of ambition. After earning a business degree from UC Berkeley, she was accepted into the Haas School of Business for her MBA. There, she met David Adler, a charismatic classmate whose family had old San Francisco roots. They married shortly after graduation, and Naomi entered the competitive world of finance. She quickly proved to be a formidable force, her sharp analytical mind and immigrant grit setting her apart. She navigated the male-dominated sphere of real estate investment with an unwavering focus, eventually becoming Managing Partner at a prestigious REIT.\n\nHowever, her professional ascent coincided with a personal fracturing. Her marriage to David dissolved amicably; their life goals had diverged too sharply. This turning point solidified her independence, channeling her energy into her career and her son, Leo, who is now a recent college graduate. Today, Naomi lives a life of disciplined success. She resides in a tasteful, modern home in Noe Valley but eschews a luxury car for the daily 2.7-mile BART ride to her Financial District office\u2014a practical habit from her youth she never shed.\n\nAt 52, Naomi is looking beyond accumulation. Her success feels complete, but not yet meaningful. She dreams of launching her own fund, one focused on developing sustainable, mixed-income housing in the Bay Area. It is her way of honoring her own story: leveraging the power she built in the city\u2019s towers to offer stability to families just like the one she came from, back in the quiet streets of the Sunset."

The air smelled of cardboard and quiet duty. It wasn't poverty she felt, but the immense weight of their new life, balanced on those thin stacks of cash. She understood then that money wasn't for comfort, but for building a foundation, brick by heavy brick. That night, stacking fruit for a future she couldn't yet see, solidified the fierce determination that would define her entire ascent.\n\n2.\nIt was a Sunday afternoon in their early 40s, flipping through one of David\u2019s leather-bound family albums. He pointed to his great-grandfather at a building groundbreaking, beaming with pride. He saw heritage; she saw a ladder she\u2019d had to build herself, rung by rung. In that quiet, loving moment, she felt the profound canyon between them. His city was an inheritance, hers was a conquest. That realization wasn't an ending, but the beginning of her accepting her path forward was one she had to walk alone.\n\n3.\nShe was 28, the only woman at a massive negotiation table. A senior partner smiled condescendingly, remarking on her \"fresh-out-of-school enthusiasm.\" Naomi felt a familiar, cold fire ignite in her gut. Instead of reacting, she coolly dismantled their proposal, pointing out three critical financial vulnerabilities no one else had caught. In their stunned silence, she learned her greatest advantage wasn't just being smarter, but being perpetually underestimated. It was armor she learned to wear with satisfaction.\n\n4.\nShe remembers dropping a 16-year-old Leo at a friend\u2019s sprawling home in Sea Cliff. He\u2019d run in without a backward glance, belonging in a world of effortless ease she had fought tooth and nail just to enter. A wave of immense pride washed over her, followed by a strange, hollow echo. She had successfully given him a life without the sharp edges of her own. The moment was a victory, but it also posed a new, unsettling question: now that the climb was over, what was she fighting for?\n\n5.\nJust last year, on her daily BART ride, the train burst from the Transbay Tube into the West Oakland light. She saw the familiar skyline she\u2019d conquered, but her eyes fixed on the neighborhood below: new, sleek condos pushing up against faded, older homes. In that moment, she saw her entire life\u2014the girl from the Sunset grocery and the woman in the FiDi tower. It was no longer enough to climb. She felt an urgent, visceral need to turn around and use her power to build a bridge."
