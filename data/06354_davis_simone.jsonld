Raised by a high school history teacher and a part-time jazz bassist, her childhood was a blend of disciplined study and creative freedom. She inherited her mother\u2019s sense of civic duty and her father\u2019s belief that art was the truest form of communication. A pivotal moment came at sixteen, when she helped paint a community mural that reclaimed a neglected underpass, witnessing firsthand how creativity could foster pride and safety.\n\nThis experience guided her educational path. After an undergraduate degree in Art History, she pursued a Master's in Arts Administration from the California College of the Arts, determined to be a builder rather than solely an observer. She chose to build her life in San Francisco, drawn to its legacy of activism and its concentrated, eclectic arts scene.\n\nNow 38, Simone is the Program Manager for \u201cArtSpan SF,\u201d a nonprofit dedicated to providing studio space and mentorship to emerging artists from marginalized communities. Her life and work are seamlessly integrated; her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs from her loft apartment to the nonprofit's gallery and office space in a converted SoMa warehouse. Her days are a whirlwind of grant writing, artist check-ins, and event planning, fueled by strong coffee from a nearby caf\u00e9.\n\nHer social life revolves around her \u201cchosen family\u201d\u2014a tight-knit circle of artists, chefs, and fellow nonprofit leaders who gather for potlucks in her loft or gallery openings around the city. Though she enjoys her independence, a quiet longing for a deeper partnership sometimes surfaces. Simone\u2019s dream is not for personal renown but for institutional legacy. She is relentlessly working to secure a permanent, larger home for ArtSpan, envisioning a thriving hub that will empower San Francisco\u2019s next generation of artists. Her connection to the city is forged in this purpose: to ensure that the soul and creativity that drew her here continue to have a place to call home."
