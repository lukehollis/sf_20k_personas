Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing schoolteacher mother, David was instilled with a belief in structure and the promise of a life built on merit. He excelled, trading the Midwest for the West Coast to pursue an MBA at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, the degree that would become his golden ticket into the burgeoning tech world.\n\nHis early career was a blur of 80-hour weeks at a top-tier consulting firm, optimizing supply chains and corporate structures. He was brilliant, detached, and effective. He married a fellow ambitious professional in his early thirties, and they bought a condo in Hayes Valley, their dual incomes affording them the quintessential San Francisco lifestyle. The first major fissure in his carefully constructed life was the dot-com bust, which didn't ruin him but taught him humility. The second was his divorce at 41; an amicable but hollowing split born from two careers that left little room for a shared life.\n\nNow 47, David is an independent management consultant. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his success; his office is a sleek, minimalist room in his meticulously clean apartment, overlooking a quiet side street. His days are a disciplined sequence of Zoom calls with anxious startup founders, a midday run through the Panhandle, and meals sourced from Good Eggs or a local trattoria. His social life consists of infrequent, scheduled dinners with a few old colleagues and a string of pleasant but forgettable dates.\n\nHe loves San Francisco for its ambition and its access to nature\u2014a Saturday hike in the Marin Headlands is his primary form of release. Yet, he feels a growing disconnect from the city he helps shape, a place he optimizes but doesn't truly inhabit. Lately, a quiet, persistent dream has taken root: to cash out and open a small, independent bookstore in a quieter coastal town. It\u2019s a fantasy of tangible things\u2014the smell of paper, the weight of a book\u2014an antidote to a life spent perfecting the intangible."
