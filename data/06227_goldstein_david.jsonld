The son of two successful real estate lawyers, David\u2019s path seemed pre-ordained: a top-tier law school followed by a lucrative career. He began to deviate at SF State, where, to his parents\u2019 quiet dismay, he declared a major in Philosophy, more interested in ethics and the nature of a just society than in torts and contracts.\n\nThe true turning point came during his junior year. Seeking a tangible connection to the concepts he was studying, David began volunteering at a drop-in center in the Tenderloin. The experience was a shock to his system. He was no longer debating abstract poverty but looking into the eyes of those living it. He saw the complex web of addiction, mental illness, and systemic failure firsthand. The abstract world of epistemology felt fraudulent compared to the immediate, desperate need for a warm meal or a safe place to sleep.\n\nUpon graduating, he formally severed the path his parents had laid. He took a job as a case manager with a nonprofit providing supportive housing. His 0.0-mile commute is the most telling detail of his life: he lives on-site in a small apartment within the same SoMa building as his clients. His days are a blur of crisis intervention, bureaucratic navigation, and offering counsel to residents battling immense personal demons.\n\nHis personal life has paid the price. A two-year relationship ended six months ago, his ex-girlfriend unable to cope with the emotional spillover and the lack of separation between his work and home. His social circle is now a tight-knit group of fellow social workers who understand the gallows humor and profound burnout that define their profession.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of postcard views and Michelin stars, but of its gritty, resilient core. He loves the city for its radical acceptance and for the vibrant humanity he witnesses daily. His dream isn't wealth, but something quieter: the hope of moving into policy advocacy, to fight the systemic issues that create the very crises he spends his days trying to manage. For now, though, he finds meaning in small victories\u2014a client celebrating one year of sobriety, another securing a part-time job."
