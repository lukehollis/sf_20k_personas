The son of a stoic history professor and a librarian in Madison, Wisconsin, David\u2019s upbringing was scholarly but emotionally reserved. A high school trip to the Art Institute of Chicago was his awakening; standing before Edward Hopper\u2019s \"Nighthawks,\" he felt a profound connection not just to the image, but to the story and emotion held within the canvas.\n\nThis passion led him to pursue a Master's in Art History, specializing in Post-War American Art. After graduating, he landed a coveted junior position at a prestigious New York auction house. There, he learned the intricate dance of provenance, valuation, and, most importantly, managing the egos of high-net-worth collectors. It was during a high-profile auction that he met his future employer, a reclusive San Francisco tech heiress with an insatiable appetite for Abstract Expressionism. Impressed by his deep knowledge and discreet professionalism, she made him an offer he couldn't refuse: to become the sole manager of her private collection.\n\nThe turning point was moving to San Francisco. He left the bustling New York art scene for a life of curated solitude. His \"commute\" is a walk across a manicured garden from his well-appointed carriage house to the main Pacific Heights mansion where the collection resides. His days are a meticulous rhythm of cataloging, liaising with conservators, and researching potential acquisitions. He is a ghost in the machine of the art world, attending exclusive galas and private viewings at SFMOMA not as a guest, but as his client's eyes and ears.\n\nHis social circle is small and specific\u2014a few museum curators and a gallery owner who understand the unique pressures of his insular world. Relationships are a challenge; his life is perpetually on-call, tethered to the whims of his employer. At 37, David is surrounded by immense beauty and value, yet none of it is truly his. His quiet dream is to one day open a small, independent gallery in Hayes Valley, a space dedicated to emerging Bay Area artists\u2014a place where he isn't just a steward, but a founder."
