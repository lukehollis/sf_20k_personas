Born and raised in the Outer Sunset, she\u2019s the daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. Growing up, she saw firsthand how community connections were built over aisles of produce and friendly conversations. While her father was a pragmatist focused on the ledgers, her mother knew every customer\u2019s family story. Chloe inherited both traits: a deeply analytical mind and an innate empathy for people\u2019s needs.\n\nHer path was forged by her younger brother, who struggled with a learning disability. Watching him wrestle with clunky, one-size-fits-all educational software sparked her interest in the intersection of human psychology and technology. She pursued a Cognitive Science degree at UC Berkeley, fascinated by how the brain processes information. This wasn\u2019t just an academic interest; it was a mission.\n\nA key turning point came after graduation. Chloe turned down a lucrative offer from a major social media giant, feeling a profound disconnect from their mission of optimizing for engagement. Instead, she took a lower-paying job at a health-tech startup, designing more intuitive portals for elderly patients. Now, as a UX Researcher, she works with a consultancy that serves non-profits and school districts. Her days are spent conducting interviews and analyzing data, always asking the same core question: \u201cHow can this tool genuinely help someone?\u201d\n\nChloe lives in a bright, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a short MUNI ride from her SoMa office. Her life is intentionally grounded. She shares her home and values with her partner, Alex, a public school teacher. Weekends are for hiking in the Headlands or exploring farmers' markets, not tech conferences. Her connection to the city is that of a local who has watched it transform, yet still finds its soul in places like Golden Gate Park and the diverse small businesses lining Clement Street.\n\nHer ultimate dream isn't a corner office but to lead a project that designs an open-source educational platform for neurodivergent children, making the kind of tool she wishes her brother had. For Chloe, success isn\u2019t measured by stock options, but by the tangible, positive impact she can imprint on the human experience."

Chloe watched her father's brow furrow at the ledger, but her mother simply smiled, adding an extra apple to the bag and whispering, \u201cPay me next week.\u201d A wave of warmth washed over Chloe. It was the first time she understood that community was a currency far more valuable than cash. That quiet act of grace became the bedrock of her empathy.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, she found her younger brother, Leo, staring at his educational program, his small hands clenched. The screen flashed with cartoon animals, but the instructions were layered and confusing. A single tear traced a path down his cheek in pure frustration. A hot, protective anger ignited in Chloe\u2019s chest. It wasn\u2019t just a game; it was a barrier. In that moment, her vague interest in technology sharpened into a specific, lifelong mission: to build tools that open doors, not slam them shut.\n\n3.\nThe offer letter from the social media giant felt cold in her hands. She sat by Lake Merritt after the final interview, picturing a career optimizing clicks and ad revenue. The thought left a hollow space inside her. She remembered Leo\u2019s frustrated face and the feel of her mother\u2019s hand on Mrs. Chen\u2019s. Declining the job was terrifying, but it was also the most grounding decision she\u2019d ever made. It was the moment she chose purpose over prestige, defining success on her own human-centric terms.\n\n4.\nIt was her first real user testing session at the health-tech startup. An 82-year-old man named Arthur, who\u2019d been deeply skeptical of the new patient portal, finally navigated to his medication list by himself. He looked up from the tablet, his eyes wide with surprise and a flicker of pride. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, a slow smile spreading. \u201cThis is for me.\u201d That simple, profound moment of empowerment was more validating than any paycheck. It was tangible proof that her work could restore agency and dignity.\n\n5.\nStanding with Alex on a windswept hill in the Headlands, the city was a distant silhouette through the fog. They didn't need to speak. The shared silence, the scent of sea salt and eucalyptus, and the solid presence of his hand in hers was enough. Looking at the San Francisco she had always called home, she felt an overwhelming sense of peace. This was it\u2014the life she had intentionally built, grounded in quiet connection, shared values, and a love for the world just beyond the screen."
