Born to a Punjabi Sikh mother who immigrated in her teens and a second-generation white American father, Harjit grew up navigating two distinct worlds under one roof. His home was a blend of fragrant curries and backyard barbecues, of Bollywood films and classic rock. In the homogenous landscape of his suburban high school, however, this made him feel perpetually in-between, neither one thing nor the other.\n\nSeeking a path that felt intellectually rich, he pursued a Bachelor's degree in History at UC Davis. He was fascinated by how societies evolved, by the hidden narratives in dusty archives. But upon graduating, he faced a harsh reality: a passion for the past didn't pay present-day bills. This was his crucial turning point. While working a dead-end retail job, he took an online data analytics certification course, discovering to his surprise that the skills were remarkably similar. Instead of historical texts, he was now finding patterns and stories within massive datasets. His unique ability to craft a compelling narrative around the numbers landed him a coveted job at a San Francisco tech firm.\n\nNow, Harjit\u2019s world is his sleek, compact apartment in Mission Bay. The 0.0-mile commute means his days are spent in front of a monitor, his main colleagues existing as avatars on Slack. The structure of his life is dictated by sprints and data queries. To escape the digital confines, he forces himself on long, meandering walks. He\u2019s slowly exploring San Francisco not as a tech hub, but as a living museum, tracing the history of the Barbary Coast through Jackson Square or feeling the echoes of the Beats in North Beach.\n\nHis social life is nascent, a handful of work acquaintances and one close friend from his analytics bootcamp. He hopes to build a real community, to find people who discuss more than stock options and A/B testing. His quiet dream is to eventually pivot his career, using his data skills for a cause he believes in\u2014perhaps analyzing patterns for a housing non-profit or a historical conservation society. For Harjit, San Francisco isn't just a career move; it's a chance to finally integrate the disparate parts of himself into a cohesive, meaningful whole."
