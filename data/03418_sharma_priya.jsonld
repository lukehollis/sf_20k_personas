The daughter of immigrants from Mumbai who settled in Daly City, Priya grew up steeped in the values of diligence and security. Her parents, a small business owner and a bank teller, saw San Francisco as a land of tangible success and pushed her toward a career in business.\n\nShe dutifully enrolled at San Francisco State University, but found the ledgers and marketing plans hollow. A required volunteering placement at a community health clinic in the Mission District became her turning point. There, she wasn't just observing need; she was listening to the complex, interwoven stories of struggle and resilience. She saw how a compassionate guide could help someone navigate the labyrinth of healthcare and personal crisis. Priya changed her major the next semester, eventually earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer career began in the demanding environment of a large city hospital, specializing in crisis intervention and discharge planning for patients facing life-altering diagnoses. The work was emotionally taxing but profoundly meaningful. After a challenging but amicable divorce in her late thirties, Priya decided to build a life on her own terms. She left the hospital system and slowly built a private practice.\n\nNow, at 49, Priya lives and works from her tranquil apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk from her bedroom to a small, dedicated home office where she conducts telehealth sessions. Mornings are sacred, reserved for foggy walks through Golden Gate Park or along Ocean Beach, a ritual that grounds her before she absorbs the emotional weight of her clients' days. Her social life is a small, tight circle of friends, cultivated over years of shared meals and book club meetings.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic skyline and more about its quiet corners. It\u2019s the neighborhood grocers who know her name, the diverse faces in the park, and the feeling of being part of a city that, for all its chaos, still has pockets of deep community. Her dream is to establish a mentorship program for young women of color entering the mental health field, ensuring the next generation of healers is as diverse as the city they serve."

A woman named Elena, clutching a handful of bus transfers, tearfully explained in broken English how she\u2019d missed a crucial appointment for her son because of a language mix-up. In that moment, the abstract business theories Priya was studying felt like dust. She felt a powerful, clarifying anger. This wasn't a system failure; it was a human one. That afternoon, she looked up the requirements for a social work degree, her path suddenly illuminated. It was the first decision she ever made that was truly her own.\n\n2.\nHer first week on the oncology ward, fresh from her Master's program. She was tasked with sitting with a man her father\u2019s age who had just received a terminal diagnosis. He didn\u2019t want to talk. He just wanted to look out the window at the Sutro Tower, its lights blinking in the dusk. Priya simply sat with him in the profound, heavy silence for an hour. She learned then that her most important job was not to fix but to witness, to offer her calm presence as an anchor in an unbearable storm.\n\n3.\nThe day after her ex-husband moved out, Priya stood alone in her new, quiet Inner Sunset apartment. It was 38, and the life she had planned was gone. Fog swallowed the view from her window, and instead of feeling lonely, a sense of profound peace settled over her. This quiet, this space, was entirely hers to define. She made a cup of chai, sat on the floor, and felt the first true stirring of a life built not on compromise, but on her own carefully cultivated tranquility.\n\n4.\nOn a grey morning walk five years ago, she saw Mr. Chen from the corner market struggling with a crate of oranges that had spilled across the wet pavement. Without a word, they both knelt, gathering the bright fruit. He thanked her with a nod and insisted she take a bagful. Every time she saw him after, he\u2019d greet her with a warm, \"Hello, Priya.\" That simple act of mutual aid solidified her love for this city\u2014not its landmarks, but its small, interwoven pockets of everyday humanity.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a telehealth session, a young Black intern at a community clinic confessed her fear that she wasn't \"clinical enough\" because she cared so much. Priya saw her own reflection\u2014the doubt, the empathy, the quiet determination. A fierce, protective clarity washed over her. She knew then that her next chapter wasn't just about her own practice; it was about building a bridge for the young women of color coming after her, ensuring they knew their compassion was their greatest strength."
