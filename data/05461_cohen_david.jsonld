The principle of *tikkun olam*\u2014the duty to repair the world\u2014was a constant refrain in his home, but it became his calling card at age fourteen when his younger sister was diagnosed with leukemia. He watched, mesmerized, as a hospital social worker navigated his parents\u2019 fear and the bewildering medical bureaucracy with profound grace. That woman became his blueprint.\n\nRejecting the East Coast\u2019s familiar constraints, David moved west for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn to San Francisco's promise of progressive ideals and personal freedom in the late 1990s. He found both, building a life and a home with his partner, Marco, an architect. David began his career at a major city hospital, but his path was irrevocably altered when Marco was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. For two years, David\u2019s professional skills became intensely personal. After Marco\u2019s death, David transferred into the palliative care unit, finding a deep, if somber, purpose in guiding families through the very labyrinth that had once ensnared him.\n\nNow 51, David\u2019s life is defined by its proximity to his work. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small, tidy apartment in a building adjacent to the UCSF Parnassus campus, allowing him to be on-call without a second thought. His days are long and emotionally taxing, filled with family conferences and end-of-life discussions. He unwinds not with grand social events, but with solitary walks through the eucalyptus groves of Golden Gate Park or quiet dinners with a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique weight of their profession.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in the city's resilience. He\u2019s seen it weather plagues, tech booms, and social upheaval, always retaining a core of compassion he holds dear. His dream is no longer to change the world, but to mend the small corners of it he can reach. He hopes to mentor new social workers and, perhaps one day, take the trip to Italy that he and Marco always planned, carrying his quiet dedication and a lifetime of hard-won empathy with him."

She didn\u2019t offer platitudes. She brought his parents lukewarm tea in styrofoam cups and just sat with them in the waiting room, a small anchor in their sea of fear. In that quiet, human gesture, David saw his future. It wasn't about grand fixes; it was about offering a cup of tea to someone drowning. This moment became his professional and personal compass.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998. He and Marco were walking up Castro Street after seeing a movie, their hands clasped together. David remembers realizing, with a sudden jolt of pure joy, that he wasn\u2019t looking over his shoulder. The fear he\u2019d carried like a stone in Boston was gone, replaced by the cool city air and the solid warmth of Marco\u2019s hand in his. San Francisco wasn't just a place; it was the first time he felt entirely, unconditionally at home in his own skin, solidifying his love for the city.\n\n3.\nHe knew all the words the oncologist was using: *metastatic, adenocarcinoma, palliative chemo*. The terms were familiar from his own work, but from this side of the desk, they were just noise. All he felt was Marco\u2019s hand gripping his, cold and trembling. In that moment, David\u2019s professional expertise felt like a thin, useless shield. This raw helplessness broke him open, later allowing him to connect with his patients from a place of shared, shattering experience rather than just clinical training, forging his empathy in fire around age 40.\n\n4.\nHis first day in palliative care, just months after Marco died, he felt like an impostor. The grief was a physical weight. Then, a patient\u2019s daughter crumpled, apologizing for her anger. David heard himself say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be angry at the world. You\u2019re allowed to fall apart here.\u201d It was what he\u2019d needed someone to tell him. In that moment, his own immense pain was no longer a wound, but a bridge. He knew then that he was in the right place, mending the world one shattered heart at a time.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a grueling fourteen-hour shift, he didn\u2019t go home. He stepped into the eucalyptus grove on Mount Sutro, right behind the hospital. It had just rained, and the sharp, medicinal scent of the trees was a balm. Leaning against a trunk, surrounded by the fog-dampened quiet, he felt the day's crushing weight begin to lift. This small ritual, born from necessity, became his definition of peace. It's how he endures, by finding solace not away from his work, but right beside it."
