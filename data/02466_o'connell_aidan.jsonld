This union of numbers and narratives defined her childhood; she was encouraged to be creative but also to have a practical backup plan. Throughout her youth, Aidan filled sketchbooks with elaborate drawings, but when it came time for college, she compromised, earning a Bachelor's degree in Communications from the University of Illinois. She dutifully learned about marketing and public relations, but her real education happened late at night in her dorm room, where she taught herself the principles of typography and color theory through online tutorials, designing posters for campus events for free.\n\nThe key turning point in her life came a week after graduation. With a respectable marketing job offer on the table in Chicago, she felt a profound sense of dread. In a moment of defiant clarity, she declined the offer, packed a single large suitcase, and bought a one-way ticket to San Francisco, a city she\u2019d only ever seen in films but which represented a tangible escape from predictability.\n\nThe first two years were a financial and creative struggle. She worked part-time at a coffee shop, taking any small design gig she could find\u2014flyers for bands, menus for cafes, logos for Etsy shops. Gradually, she built a portfolio and a reputation within the city\u2019s independent arts scene. Now, at 27, she is a sought-after freelance graphic designer for galleries, small theaters, and local musicians.\n\nAidan lives and works out of a small, bright apartment in the Inner Richmond, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her bed to her desk overlooking a bustling Clement Street. Her days are structured by her own discipline: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park with a thermos of tea, followed by hours of focused design work, punctuated by the sounds of the neighborhood. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; her closest friends are a musician she designed an album cover for and a playwright whose show posters she creates.\n\nAidan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but sustainability. She hopes to continue making a living by helping other artists realize their vision, perhaps one day co-founding a small, collaborative print and design studio. She found her place not by climbing a corporate ladder, but by embedding herself in the creative fabric of San Francisco, becoming the person who helps give the city's artistic dreams a visual voice."
