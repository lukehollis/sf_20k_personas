Living in the small flat above the shop where he grew up, his 0.0-mile commute is both a convenience and a cage. A second-generation Japanese American, Kenji was raised in the foggy avenues of the Inner Richmond, his childhood soundtrack the clang of the key-cutting machine and his father\u2019s friendly chatter with neighborhood regulars.\n\nHe was supposed to be the one to break the mold. After graduating from Lowell High School, Kenji enrolled at San Francisco State University, his sketchbooks filled with architectural designs and dreams of building something grander than meticulously organized aisles of nuts and bolts. But during his sophomore year, his father\u2019s health began a steep decline. Kenji\u2019s classes became secondary to helping his mother run the store. \"Just for a semester,\" he told himself. That semester bled into a year, and after his father passed, the temporary responsibility became a permanent, unspoken inheritance.\n\nNow 31, Kenji is a cornerstone of the neighborhood, though few know the depth of the sacrifice that keeps him there. He knows which customers need help reaching the top shelf and who prefers which brand of gardening gloves. These small, daily interactions form the bedrock of his social life, replacing the college friendships that faded with time. A past relationship with a nurse named Maya frayed under the strain of his constant proximity to work; he could never truly leave his duties behind, even for a weekend.\n\nHis days are a predictable rhythm: unlock the store at 8 AM, manage inventory, assist customers, and lock up at 7 PM. In the quiet solitude of his apartment, surrounded by his father\u2019s old records and his own forgotten art supplies, Kenji dreams not of escape, but of synthesis. He hopes to one day modernize the store, perhaps launching an online shop with a logo he designs himself. His aspiration isn\u2019t to leave his father\u2019s legacy behind, but to finally build something of his own upon the foundation he so dutifully maintains."
