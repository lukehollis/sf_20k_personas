Adopted as an infant by a warm, working-class Polish-American couple from Milwaukee, he became David, a boy who loved his parents\u2019 kielbasa and pierogi but never quite felt like he fit in his own skin. School was a struggle; he wasn't interested in abstract theories but was fascinated by the tangible world. He spent his youth taking apart VCRs, radios, and eventually the family\u2019s Packard Bell computer, just to see how they worked.\n\nForgoing college, which felt both alien and unaffordable, David entered the workforce. In the mid-90s, he landed a job in the mailroom of a local internet service provider. His turning point came during a graveyard shift when a critical server crashed. While senior techs were unreachable, David, armed with his self-taught knowledge, meticulously worked the problem and brought the system back online. This act of initiative earned him a spot on the tech team. He found his calling not in coding, but in the physical heart of the internet: the data center. He devoured technical manuals, earned certifications, and developed a reputation for being the calmest guy in the room during a system-wide meltdown.\n\nA job offer in the early 2000s brought him to the Bay Area, the epicenter of his industry. He rose through the ranks, his hands-on expertise proving more valuable than any degree. Now, as a Director of Data Center Operations, he oversees a sprawling, humming facility that is a critical node of the digital world.\n\nHe lives a quiet, structured life in the Sunset District with his wife, Maria, a nurse, and their teenage daughter. His 12.5-mile commute in a sensible sedan is a time for classic rock and mental preparation. David is the antithesis of the SF tech-bro stereotype; he\u2019s the blue-collar foundation upon which their cloud-based empires are built. His deepest aspiration is to see his daughter thrive and, one day, to travel with his family to Seoul\u2014not to find his past, but to share his complete present with the place where his story began."

But David felt a strange calm. Surrounded by dead servers, guided by instinct and dog-eared manuals, he meticulously worked the problem. When the green lights blinked back to life, a feeling washed over him: validation. For the first time, his obsession with how things worked wasn't a quirk; it was a skill. It was his future, clicking into place.\n\n2.\nIt wasn\u2019t the Golden Gate, but the Bay Bridge at dusk on his first trip out for the interview in 2001. The city was a circuit board of light sprawling before him. Crossing that bridge, he felt a profound sense of arrival\u2014not as a tourist, but as a technician reporting for duty at the heart of the machine. This wasn't a place to find himself; it was the city where his work lived. For the first time, it felt like he might actually fit somewhere.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the impossible weight of his newborn daughter in the crook of his arm. He looked from her tiny, perfect face to his wife Maria\u2019s exhausted, happy one. In that quiet hospital room, his own story snapped into focus. He wasn\u2019t just a boy from Seoul or a man from Milwaukee. He was a father. The questions about his past didn't vanish, but they suddenly became less important than the future sleeping in his arms. It was the beginning of his own legacy.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, during a late-night check, he stood alone in the main data hall he now managed. The roar of the cooling fans was a constant, powerful hum\u2014the sound of millions of conversations, transactions, and connections. He placed his hand on a server rack, feeling the slight vibration of the data flowing through it. This was his cathedral. He wasn't a founder or a coder, but he kept the lights on for their world. A deep, quiet satisfaction settled in him.\n\n5.\nLast year, his teenage daughter looked up from her phone and asked, \"Dad, what's the food like in Seoul?\" It wasn't about his adoption or a past he couldn't remember, but a simple, curious question about a place. In that moment, the city transformed in his mind. It wasn't a source of mystery or loss, but a destination. A place to take his family\u2014to share his wife and daughter with the city that unknowingly shared him. The trip became a plan, not a hope."
