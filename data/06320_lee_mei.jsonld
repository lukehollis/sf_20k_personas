She was raised in the fog-laced avenues of the Sunset District, the daughter of second-generation Chinese-American parents who ran a beloved neighborhood bakery. Her childhood was a symphony of early morning flour dust, the clatter of mahjong tiles from her grandparents' apartment upstairs, and the quiet diligence of homework. The defining turning point of her youth was watching her grandmother, a native Cantonese speaker, struggle to navigate the labyrinthine American healthcare system. This experience planted a seed of purpose in Mei: a desire to bridge the gaps in community health access.\n\nThis drive led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Public Health at UC Davis. College was an awakening, a place where she could finally put a name to the systemic issues she\u2019d witnessed firsthand. After graduating, she felt the pull of home and landed a role perfectly suited to her mission: a Health Program Coordinator for a major city healthcare provider.\n\nNow, at 24, Mei embodies the modern San Franciscan professional. She traded the familiar quiet of the Sunset for a compact, minimalist apartment in a gleaming SoMa high-rise. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins not on a crowded MUNI bus, but with a short walk to her desk overlooking the city. Her days are a web of spreadsheets and Zoom calls, coordinating outreach programs for non-English speaking seniors and low-income families\u2014the very work inspired by her grandmother.\n\nHer life is a deliberate balance. After shutting her laptop, she explores her new neighborhood, meeting college friends for dinner in Hayes Valley or taking a solo stroll along the Embarcadero. Though she loves her independence, she drives across the city every Sunday for family dinner, grounding herself in the love and traditions that shaped her. Mei\u2019s dream is to one day lead a city-wide initiative focused on geriatric care for the AAPI community. She isn\u2019t just building a career; she\u2019s honoring her roots by building a healthier, more equitable future for her city."
