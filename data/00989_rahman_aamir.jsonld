The son of a roving Pakistani diplomat and a spirited Filipino academic he met in Manila, Aamir\u2019s childhood was a collage of embassy apartments and international schools in Cairo, London, and Tokyo. This upbringing stripped him of a singular ethnic identity, leaving him with a palate for global flavors and a restless spirit. He never pursued a formal university degree, finding the structured world of academia far less instructive than the bustling markets and kitchens he\u2019d always been drawn to.\n\nHis turning point came at 24, during a layover in San Francisco. He was meant to join his father at a consulate post in Brazil, but the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy and its burgeoning food scene captivated him. In an act of quiet rebellion, he cashed in his plane ticket and stayed, severing ties with his disappointed father. With a small inheritance from his mother, he began his real education in the trenches of the city's restaurants: first as a dishwasher in North Beach, then a prep cook in the Mission, absorbing every technique and trade secret.\n\nAfter a decade of relentless work and saving, he partnered with another ambitious line cook to buy a failing diner in Hayes Valley. They transformed it into \u201cSojourn,\u201d a restaurant that mirrored Aamir\u2019s own story\u2014a sophisticated fusion of Pakistani spice, Filipino comfort, and Californian ingredients. The restaurant became his life. At 53, he still lives in the apartment directly above it. His 0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication, a choice that contributed to a divorce years ago but cemented his status as a neighborhood institution.\n\nAamir\u2019s family is now his staff\u2014the young chefs he mentors and the career servers who know his moods by the way he sips his morning coffee. While he dreams of one day reconciling with his aging father, his more immediate hope is to ensure Sojourn outlasts him. He finds contentment not in expansion, but in perfection; in the satisfied hum of a full dining room and the knowledge that he built a home for himself, and for others, one plate at a time."
