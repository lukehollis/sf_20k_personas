The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in Sacramento, Sarah\u2019s childhood was steeped in the scent of produce and the constant hum of pragmatism. Her parents preached the gospel of hard work and stability, which is why her decision to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in English Literature from UC Davis was met with loving confusion. They couldn\u2019t see the career path. For a while, neither could she.\n\nAfter graduation, Sarah drifted, working in bookstores and coffee shops, feeling the pressure of her parents' unspoken expectations. She moved to San Francisco in her late twenties, drawn by a creative scene that felt worlds away from Sacramento. A temp agency, in a moment of serendipity, placed her as a receptionist at a fledgling tech startup. To her surprise, she thrived. The chaotic energy of brilliant but disorganized engineers needed a calm center, and Sarah\u2019s literary-honed skills in communication and structure made her indispensable. She didn\u2019t write code; she wrote the emails that got things done and organized the systems that allowed others to create.\n\nHer career grew in parallel with the tech industry. She hopped from one rising company to the next, her title evolving to Senior Administrative Assistant. A key turning point came in her late thirties with the end of a decade-long relationship. The breakup was painful but ultimately liberating, forcing her to build a life that was entirely her own. She bought a small condo in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its incredible Asian restaurants.\n\nNow, at 45, her life has a comfortable rhythm. Working remotely, her commute is a ten-step walk to a desk overlooking her small patio garden. Her days are a mix of intense scheduling for her executive and peaceful walks in the park with her rescue terrier, Buster. Her social circle is small and loyal, built around a shared love for food and conversation. Sarah\u2019s dream is no longer to write the great American novel, but something more personal. She\u2019s slowly outlining a collection of personal essays about her family, a quiet ambition to finally connect her practical, successful life with the storyteller she\u2019s always been."
