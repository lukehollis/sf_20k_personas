He was born in the same apartment 54 years ago, the only child of a Chinese-American father and an Irish-American mother. His parents, who ran the market before him, rejected rigid labels; to them, David wasn\u2019t one thing or the other, he was simply a San Franciscan. This ethos shaped him profoundly, leaving him with a deep-seated identity tied to place rather than heritage.\n\nHe was never one for academics. While his friends stressed over SATs, David was learning the complex language of inventory, the art of a perfectly stacked apple pyramid, and the names of every regular who walked through the door. His education was in the rhythms of the neighborhood. The turning point came in his late twenties when his parents decided to retire. They offered to sell the store, freeing him to pursue a different life. After a week of soul-searching, David realized this store *was* his life. He took out a loan and bought the family business, renaming it simply \"Lee's Market.\"\n\nHis personal life has been as contained as his professional one. A short-lived marriage in his thirties ended amicably; she craved a life beyond the city's 49 square miles, a place he could never imagine leaving. He has no children, but considers the generations of neighborhood kids who bought their first candy from him to be a kind of extended family.\n\nDavid\u2019s day is a predictable-yet-comforting ritual: up at 5 a.m. to accept deliveries, coffee with the career fishermen and construction workers, a day spent as the neighborhood's unofficial confessor and news hub, and locking up long after dark. He has watched the city transform\u2014the dot-com boom, the busts, the waves of new residents\u2014all from behind his counter. His greatest hope is also his greatest fear: to keep the store afloat against the tide of soulless delivery apps and chain grocers. David Lee isn't just managing a store; he\u2019s a steward of a fading authenticity, hoping to preserve this small corner of San Francisco for as long as he can."
