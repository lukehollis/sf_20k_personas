She grew up absorbing its rhythms from behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Sunset District, watching the N-Judah streetcar lurch by and tracking the delivery trucks that were the store\u2019s lifeblood. Her immigrant parents, who prized stability, hoped she\u2019d become a doctor. Instead, Mei Ling became fascinated by the infrastructure that made their life possible\u2014and often, difficult.\n\nThis fascination led her to a Bachelor\u2019s at UC Berkeley and eventually a Master of Urban Planning. She saw public service not as a fallback but as a calling, a way to untangle the city\u2019s knots from the inside. Now a Transportation Planner III, she is a seasoned and respected analyst. Her career wasn't without trials; a turning point came during a contentious project to create protected bike lanes in the Mission. Facing rooms of angry residents, she learned to defend data with empathy, solidifying her belief that progress required both meticulous planning and thick skin.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute affords her a quiet, ordered life in her Cole Valley apartment. Most days start with coffee and a panoramic view of the Sutro Tower from her window before she dives into GIS maps and policy documents on Zoom. Lunch is often a walk through Golden Gate Park, a welcome analog break from a digital job. Though she lives alone, her life is full. She hosts a monthly board game night for a tight-knit group of friends and spends weekends helping her now-retired parents navigate their appointments, a reversal of roles she cherishes.\n\nMei Ling\u2019s connection to the city is intimate yet analytical. She sees her neighborhood not just as home, but as a case study in traffic calming and pedestrian access. Her deepest aspiration is to shepherd a transformative project from concept to reality\u2014perhaps a new light rail line or a truly effective bus rapid transit system. She dreams of creating a more equitable, efficient San Francisco, leaving a legacy of seamless movement for the next generation of grocers, students, and dreamers."

In that moment of cascading failure, she didn\u2019t feel a child\u2019s panic, but a spark of intense curiosity. It was the first time she saw San Francisco not as a place, but as a fragile system. This curiosity became the blueprint for her entire career, a desire to mend the city\u2019s unseen seams.\n\n2.\nIn a fluorescent-lit lecture hall at UC Berkeley, a professor projected a 1912 map of San Francisco\u2019s streetcar network. Mei Ling felt a jolt of recognition so profound it was almost physical. These were the ghosts of the lines that ran past her parents' store, the ancestors of the N-Judah. In those faded lines, she found the language for her childhood questions. The decision was instantaneous and liberating: she would not be a doctor. She would be an architect of these systems, honoring the city\u2019s past by building its future.\n\n3.\nThe man\u2019s voice shook with anger at the public meeting about the Mission bike lanes. He wasn\u2019t yelling about data; he was terrified of losing the loading zone his small restaurant depended on. In his face, she saw her own father. The spreadsheet in her hands suddenly felt cold and inadequate. It was a humbling, painful moment that taught her that empathy is the necessary bridge between a plan and a community. She learned that night that to truly serve the city, her heart had to be as engaged as her mind.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, she sat in a sterile UCSF clinic, translating a cardiologist's jargon into Cantonese for her father. She carefully explained the transit options to get him to his follow-up appointments, sketching a map on a napkin. Seeing the look of relief and reliance in his eyes was a quiet, bittersweet inversion of her childhood. The abstract goal of \u201caccessibility\u201d became deeply personal. Now, every curb cut and bus schedule she analyzes carries the weight of her father\u2019s hand resting on her arm for support.\n\n5.\nOne recent Tuesday, after a draining day of budget meetings, she stood at her Cole Valley window. The fog was rolling in, wrapping itself around the Sutro Tower. On her monitor behind her was a fledgling GIS map for a new bus rapid transit line, her own secret, ambitious project. A profound sense of purpose washed over her. This view, this city, wasn't just her home. It was her responsibility and her hope\u2014a complex, beautiful machine she was determined to leave running more smoothly than she found it."
