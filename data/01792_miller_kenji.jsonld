The son of a Japanese immigrant mother, a meticulous nurse from Fukuoka, and a second-generation Irish-American father, a pragmatic Silicon Valley engineer, Kenji was raised in San Jose with a blend of quiet discipline and practical curiosity. His childhood was filled with weekends spent hiking redwood trails in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where his father taught him to identify trees, and evenings learning the precise art of making tamagoyaki from his mother. This duality fostered an observant, thoughtful nature and an early appreciation for the delicate balance of natural systems.\n\nThis appreciation solidified into a career path at UC Santa Barbara, where he earned a Master's degree in Environmental Science and Management. His early career was a grind at a large consulting firm in Los Angeles, filled with long hours and cross-country flights to assess industrial sites. The turning point was the global shift to remote work. Freed from the airport terminals and sterile hotel rooms, Kenji rediscovered a sense of place. He moved to San Francisco, securing a senior position at a more boutique firm and embracing the ability to work from his Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nNow, his 0.0-mile commute is a ritual. The day begins with a strong coffee from a cafe on Clement Street and a walk into Golden Gate Park, his sprawling backyard. His work involves analyzing data and writing environmental impact reports for urban development and renewable energy projects. It\u2019s intellectually rigorous work that he finds fulfilling. After logging off, he might meet a few close friends\u2014a mix from college and a local climbing gym\u2014for dumplings or a craft beer. He is single after a long-term relationship fizzled out under the strain of his previous travel-heavy job, and he now values the quiet stability of his life.\n\nKenji loves the Inner Richmond for its unpretentious vibe and proximity to the ocean's fog. He feels a connection to the city's ambition and its natural beauty. His hope is to eventually pivot from consulting to a city-level policy role, wanting to have a more direct, tangible impact on the bay's ecosystem he has grown to love. He dreams of helping to build a more sustainable San Francisco, a goal that perfectly synthesizes the two worlds of his upbringing: the respect for nature and the drive to build something better."
