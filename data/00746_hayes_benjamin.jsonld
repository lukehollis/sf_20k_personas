Growing up in a sprawling Columbus, Ohio suburb, his world was defined by his accountant father\u2019s pragmatism and his dental hygienist mother\u2019s gentle insistence on stable choices. But a quiet frustration simmered in Ben. He saw the cracks in his comfortable world during his grandmother's long, difficult battle with type 2 diabetes\u2014a fight made harder by confusing medical advice and a lack of community support systems. That personal struggle became his professional calling.\n\nForsaking the business track his parents hoped for, he pursued a Master of Public Health at the University of Michigan. There, he became fascinated by the intersection of data, human behavior, and health outcomes. He saw technology not as a disruptive force for profit, but as a potential equalizer. After a few years at a Chicago non-profit, the gravitational pull of San Francisco\u2014the epicenter of both tech innovation and progressive policy\u2014became irresistible. He arrived with a clear mission: to leverage the city\u2019s resources for the public good.\n\nNow 34, Ben\u2019s life is centered in his Inner Richmond apartment, just blocks from Golden Gate Park. His 0.0-mile commute offers flexibility but demands discipline. His days are a blur of Zoom calls, data analysis, and stakeholder management for a regional initiative that uses mobile tech to connect underserved populations with preventative health services. Mornings begin with a foggy run through the park, a ritual that clears his head before he dives into the digital fray.\n\nSocially, Ben is recalibrating. A long-term relationship ended two years ago, a casualty of divergent life goals, and he\u2019s found the city\u2019s dating scene to be a bit transactional for his taste. His friendships are his anchor\u2014a tight-knit group of fellow policy wonks and non-profit lifers who prefer hikes on Mount Tamalpais to loud nights out. He feels a deep connection to the Inner Richmond\u2019s quiet, family-oriented vibe, a stark contrast to the transient energy of other neighborhoods. His dream is simple but ambitious: to see his program create a lasting, measurable improvement in community health, and to build a personal life in San Francisco that feels just as permanent and meaningful."
