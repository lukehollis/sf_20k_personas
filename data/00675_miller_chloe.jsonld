Raised in a quiet Sacramento suburb by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her upbringing was stable, predictable, and underscored by the value of a steady career. Craving a more vibrant and creative environment, she chose UC Santa Cruz for college, immersing herself in film theory and critical analysis, and graduating with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Media Studies.\n\nThe reality after graduation was a harsh pivot. The film production assistant gigs she found were sporadic and low-paying, a stark contrast to the stability she was raised to expect. After six months of uncertainty, a conversation with a more tech-savvy friend became a turning point. She saw a path that blended her understanding of media pipelines with the structure and security of the tech industry. Chloe enrolled in an intensive online certificate program for Digital Project Management, quickly mastering the language of sprints, assets, and deliverables.\n\nShe landed her remote Production Technician role with a Bay Area-based software company just a year ago. The job, which involves managing the digital pipeline for marketing content, was her ticket out of Sacramento. With no physical office to tie her down (her commute is the ten steps from her bed to her desk), she chose San Francisco not for work, but for life.\n\nChloe now lives in a small, rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond. Her days follow a distinct rhythm: a morning walk to a local bakery on Clement Street for coffee, followed by hours of focused work coordinating with teams via Slack and Asana. Her apartment, filled with well-tended plants and posters of classic films, is her sanctuary. Evenings are for unwinding at a climbing gym in the Dogpatch or hosting potlucks with a small, tight-knit group of friends.\n\nWhile she\u2019s grateful for the financial security her job provides, Chloe dreams of reconnecting with her original passion. Her ultimate goal is to leverage her technical expertise to become a producer for independent films, bridging the gap between her pragmatic career and the creative world she still longs for."
