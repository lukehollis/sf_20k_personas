The child of Filipino immigrants, her father a pragmatic nurse and her mother a culinary artist without a restaurant, Jasmine\u2019s upbringing was a blend of practicality and passion. While her parents hoped she would pursue a stable career, Jasmine was captivated by the visual world, finding beauty in the way light caught the steam rising from a pot of sinigang.\n\nShe channeled this passion into a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography from San Francisco State University. Her early career was a grind of freelance gigs\u2014portraits, weddings, and product shots\u2014that paid the bills but starved her soul. The turning point came unexpectedly. Frustrated, she started a personal project: a photo series documenting her mother\u2019s recipes, treating each dish not as food, but as a sculpture of color, texture, and family history.\n\nA creative director for a local food magazine stumbled upon her online portfolio and was struck by the raw emotion in her work. Her first job as an assistant food stylist felt like a homecoming. She had found the perfect alchemy, merging her photographic eye with her inherited love for cuisine. Now, as a Lead Food Stylist, Jasmine orchestrates culinary masterpieces for photoshoots, meticulously placing every herb and perfecting every drizzle.\n\nHer daily routine starts in her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, surrounded by cookbooks and thriving plants. She takes the MUNI bus, a 5.1-mile journey that allows her to people-watch and mentally prepare for the high-pressure creativity of her day. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow creatives and chefs, a chosen family bonded by shared passions and late-night meals.\n\nHaving seen San Francisco transform over four decades, Jasmine feels a deep, protective connection to its authentic corners. Her dream is to finally create that cookbook from her early project\u2014a photographic and narrative tribute to her family\u2019s journey from the Philippines to California, told one recipe at a time. It\u2019s a return to her roots, and the ultimate expression of her life\u2019s work."

As the steam billowed from the pot, it caught the afternoon light, turning the sour, savory mist into a swirling galaxy. In that moment, it wasn't just dinner; it was a sculpture of vapor and love. That was the first true photograph she ever took in her mind, a silent promise to honor the beauty her family\u2019s practicality often overlooked.\n\n2.\nIn her mid-twenties, after a soulless wedding shoot, she drove home feeling like a fraud. Her mother was making lumpia, her hands a blur of practiced, loving motion. Defeated, Jasmine picked up her camera, not for a client, but for herself. The way the light hit the translucent wrapper, the texture of the filling\u2014it felt more honest than any portrait she'd been paid for. Photographing that plate wasn't just about food; it was an act of survival, the first step back to her own soul.\n\n3.\nThe email arrived on a foggy Tuesday morning. She almost deleted it, thinking it was spam. The subject: \u201cYour Mother\u2019s Recipes.\u201d The creative director didn't praise her technique, but wrote, \u201cI can feel the history in your photos.\u201d Jasmine read the line three times, tears blurring the screen. It wasn\u2019t just a job offer; it was a stranger seeing the entirety of her heart. That day, she felt seen for the first time, validating the deeply personal path she had risked everything to follow.\n\n4.\nJust last week, on her usual MUNI ride through the Richmond, she saw it: a tiny, family-run bakery, its signage faded, still there despite the new glass towers nearby. A wave of fierce, protective love washed over her. This was her San Francisco\u2014not the headlines, but the resilient, authentic corners that held the city\u2019s real flavor. The bus ride wasn't just a commute; it was a daily pilgrimage through the city she was determined to remember correctly, one storefront at a time.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, late on a Saturday night, she found herself crowded around a table in a chef friend\u2019s Mission apartment. They were sharing a pot of arroz caldo, debating the merits of crispy garlic versus saffron. Looking at the animated faces of her chosen family\u2014artists, writers, chefs\u2014she realized she had recreated the warmth of her mother\u2019s kitchen, miles away and decades later. It affirmed that her passion for food was never just a job; it was her language for love and community."
