Born in Daly City to a Filipina mother, a compassionate nurse from Cebu, and an Indian father, a driven software engineer from Bangalore, his very name encapsulates his dual heritage. Growing up, Arjun was fascinated by the intricate systems that connected his suburban world to the magnetic pull of San Francisco. He didn't see cars; he saw patterns, flows, and barriers. He saw how a reliable bus line was a lifeline for families like his own who relied on it for work, groceries, and connection.\n\nThis early fascination guided him to UC Davis, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies. It was there his abstract interest sharpened into a vocation. His turning point came during an internship, mapping service gaps in low-income neighborhoods. He saw firsthand how a 20-minute bus delay wasn't an inconvenience but a potential lost wage or a missed doctor's appointment. This cemented his resolve to work in the public sector, to build systems that served people, not just moved vehicles.\n\nNow a Senior Transportation Planner at 37, Arjun lives his work. He resides in the Inner Richmond with his long-term partner, Clara, a landscape architect. Their shared passion for public spaces often spills over their dinner table. His 3.5-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus is his daily field research; he observes riders, notes timings, and feels the rhythm of the city he helps shape. He sees public transit not as a utility, but as the circulatory system of an equitable city.\n\nHis lifestyle is comfortably urban. Weekends involve runs in Golden Gate Park, exploring neighborhood dim sum restaurants, and hosting board game nights with a tight-knit circle of friends. Despite his professional success and $155,000 income, Arjun remains grounded. His dream isn't a tech-bro high-rise, but to spearhead the city\u2019s next major Bus Rapid Transit project\u2014a legacy of efficient, accessible, and sustainable movement for a new generation of San Franciscans."

Her nurse's uniform smelled faintly of antiseptic, and she was so tired she\u2019d rest her head on his shoulder. When the bus finally rumbled up to the curb, its warm, yellow light spilling out, it wasn't just a ride. It was relief. It was home. That feeling\u2014the deep, quiet gratitude for a simple, reliable service\u2014became the bedrock of his empathy, the understanding that a bus schedule is also a human schedule.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, standing on a hill overlooking the peninsula, the streams of headlights and taillights suddenly clicked into place. It wasn't a traffic jam; it was a circulatory system. He saw the city as a living organism, its arteries clogged in some places and flowing freely in others. In that moment of cool, intellectual awe, his father\u2019s engineering mind and his own burgeoning passion fused. He knew then he didn't just want to live in the system; he wanted to be the one to help it breathe.\n\n3.\nDuring his internship at UC Davis, he interviewed an elderly woman in the Bayview. She spoke calmly about missing a weekly dialysis appointment because her bus route was unexpectedly eliminated. Her tired resignation was more powerful than any angry protest. For Arjun, then 21, the abstract data on his service gap map suddenly had a face and a devastating consequence. His career path solidified from an interest into a moral imperative; he wasn't designing routes, he was defending lifelines.\n\n4.\nOn his third date with Clara, they spontaneously decided to walk up the Filbert Street Steps. Halfway up, surrounded by hidden gardens, she stopped and sketched a cross-section of the hill on a napkin, explaining how the public staircase created a unique, car-free community. He saw his passion for transit systems reflected in her love for landscape and human-scale design. It was the moment he realized he hadn't just met a partner, but a collaborator for the life he wanted to build.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, on a packed 38-Geary, the windows were fogged from the rain and the collective breath of the riders. He watched a cook in their stained whites doze off, a student highlight a textbook, and two tourists chatter in another language. He felt a quiet, profound sense of connection to these strangers. They were all part of this shared, moving space he helped maintain. This wasn't a commute; it was a validation. This was why his work mattered."
