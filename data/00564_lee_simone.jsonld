Her parents, immigrants from Mexico, ran a small but beloved panader\u00eda on 24th Street, its warm, sweet-smelling air the backdrop of her childhood. They instilled in her a profound sense of community, teaching her that success wasn't measured by wealth, but by the number of people you could help.\n\nInitially, Simone tried to follow a different path. After earning her bachelor\u2019s degree from SF State, she took a lucrative job in corporate recruiting, believing it was the responsible choice. But the work felt hollow, a world away from the values of her upbringing. The turning point came when a childhood friend's family lost their home to a no-fault eviction. Seeing their displacement ignited a fire in her. She quit her job, returned to SF State to earn her Master's in Public Administration, and dedicated herself to community advocacy. It was during this period she met and married, taking the name Lee, though the marriage ended amicably a few years later, leaving her with a new name and a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nNow, at 40, Simone is a Program Coordinator for a housing rights nonprofit. Her commute is zero miles; she works from the same rent-controlled two-bedroom apartment she\u2019s lived in for fifteen years, just blocks from her parents\u2019 old bakery. Her days are a marathon of Zoom meetings with city officials, grant writing, and urgent calls with tenants facing eviction. Her small apartment is command central, its walls covered in whiteboards mapping out campaign strategies and community outreach plans.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow activists and old friends who\u2019ve managed to stay in the city. Her deepest connection remains with the Mission. She knows the grocers by name, gets her coffee from the corner caf\u00e9, and spends her evenings at community meetings. Simone\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of personal glory but of tangible change: to see a permanent, community-owned housing project built in her neighborhood. She is a guardian of the San Francisco she grew up in, fighting tirelessly to ensure its soul endures."
