At 49, his world has contracted to the confines of a single, gleaming high-rise in SoMa. He doesn\u2019t commute; he merely descends.\n\nThe son of hardworking Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small grocery in the Outer Richmond, Robert was the vessel for all their hopes. He was pushed toward academia, a path of prestige they revered but didn't fully understand. He complied, finding a genuine passion in the hallowed halls of university life. He earned a Master's degree in Art History, specializing in the influence of Zen Buddhism on post-war abstract expressionism. He was brilliant, his mind a gallery of ideas and connections.\n\nThe turning point was the slow, grinding reality of the academic job market. After years of adjunct positions and dwindling grant opportunities, the \"temporary\" assistant manager role at a major downtown department store offered something his passion couldn't: stability and health insurance. That was fifteen years ago. The temporary became permanent, and the academic became a department manager, his expertise on Mark Tobey's brushstrokes replaced by mastery of inventory logistics and staff scheduling.\n\nRobert\u2019s personal life is as meticulously organized and solitary as his apartment. A long-term relationship dissolved under the weight of his career shift, and he has since preferred quiet solitude. His primary connection to San Francisco is through its museums. On his days off, he walks to SFMOMA or the de Young, standing before the very canvases he once wrote about. These visits are a quiet rebellion, a pilgrimage to the man he used to be.\n\nHis hopes are no longer for professorships or published papers. He now dreams of saving enough to one day take a year off to simply travel, to see the Prado in Madrid and the Uffizi in Florence, not as a scholar, but just as Robert. For now, he finds meaning in small kindnesses to his staff and the perfect arrangement of a display, a silent echo of the composition and form he once studied so devotedly."
