Born in Fresno to Punjabi immigrant parents, his upbringing was a blend of Sikh tradition and agricultural pragmatism. His father, a successful farmer, envisioned a future for Raj in engineering or medicine\u2014a stable, prestigious path. However, witnessing a close relative\u2019s silent struggle with depression, shrouded in cultural stigma, carved a different path in Raj\u2019s mind. He saw a profound need for care that his community was hesitant to acknowledge.\n\nThis calling led him to UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work, a decision that initially caused a rift with his family. He chose a profession focused on emotional, not economic, wealth. After graduating, Raj plunged into the demanding environment of a major San Francisco hospital, working with patients and families navigating the emotional shrapnel of chronic illness and sudden trauma. The work was fulfilling but led to severe burnout, a turning point that forced him to re-evaluate his own well-being.\n\nThe shift to remote work during the pandemic provided an unexpected lifeline. Raj transitioned into a private telehealth practice, which explains his zero-mile commute. He now works from his quiet Inner Sunset apartment, a space he deliberately curates for peace. It\u2019s also where he and his wife, a graphic designer named Lena, decided to build their life together. In a progressive act of partnership, he took her surname, Kaur, upon marrying, a choice that symbolizes their egalitarian bond.\n\nHis days are structured yet flexible. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe for coffee, followed by several hours of virtual therapy sessions. He takes long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park to decompress, the cypress trees and ocean air serving as his own form of therapy. His connection to San Francisco is intimate; the city offered him the anonymity to redefine himself while its progressive values supported the life he chose. Raj\u2019s dream is to launch a non-profit dedicated to providing culturally competent mental health resources for South Asian communities, hoping to build the bridges for others that he once had to find for himself."
