The daughter of a quiet Swedish-American architect and a vibrant community organizer from Oaxaca, she grew up in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Her childhood was a blend of two cultures: her father\u2019s methodical calm and her mother\u2019s passionate activism. She spent weekends building meticulous models from blueprints and handing out flyers at tenants\u2019 rights rallies, learning Spanish and social justice in equal measure.\n\nThis duality defined her path. While her friends dreamed of tech careers, Sophie was drawn to the systemic issues she saw firsthand. A pivotal moment came at age sixteen when she watched her mother successfully organize their neighbors to fight an unjust eviction. The power of collective action ignited something within her. She went on to study Sociology at UC Santa Cruz, focusing on the structures that perpetuated inequality. An internship with an immigrant legal aid group solidified her mission, steering her away from law and toward direct community engagement.\n\nNow 26, Sophie is a Program Manager for a nonprofit that provides mentorship to first-generation high school students. Her 0.0-mile commute means her small apartment in the Inner Richmond serves as both her office and sanctuary. Her days are a disciplined cycle of Zoom meetings, grant writing, and virtual check-ins with the teens she champions. To decompress, she runs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a stone's throw from her front door.\n\nThough she is building her own life, the Mission remains her gravitational center. She visits her parents weekly, finding counsel in her mother\u2019s kitchen over homemade mole. She feels the ache of San Francisco\u2019s contradictions daily\u2014the city\u2019s profound beauty shadowed by its stark disparities. Her work is her answer to this tension. Sophie\u2019s quiet dream is to one day launch her own nonprofit, one that merges art and advocacy, a perfect fusion of the two worlds her parents gave her."
