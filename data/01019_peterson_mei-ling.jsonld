            "value": "Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond, Mei-ling Peterson has always lived between two worlds. Her name itself is a testament to her family\u2019s story: a Chinese immigrant mother who found love with a second-generation Irish-American longshoreman. Her childhood was a vibrant mix of her mother\u2019s meticulously crafted dim sum and her father\u2019s boisterous Sunday morning breakfasts. Growing up, Mei-ling was the quiet bridge between her parents, translating not just language but cultural nuances. She was deeply devoted to her family, a trait that would define her life\u2019s trajectory.\n\nHer educational journey was cut short. Though bright, she graduated from high school and immediately entered the workforce to help support her family when her father\u2019s health began to fail. She put aside dreams of attending City College to study horticulture, instead taking jobs in diners and retail stockrooms\u2014anything to ensure the rent on their small apartment was paid. The true turning point came a decade ago. Within two years, she lost both of her parents. Alone and unable to afford the city\u2019s soaring rents, she took a job that offered a solution, albeit a confining one: a live-in housekeeper for a wealthy tech family in Pacific Heights.\n\nNow, at 49, Mei-ling\u2019s world is the immaculate, four-story Victorian she meticulously maintains. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her small basement room to the gleaming kitchen upstairs. Her days are a quiet rhythm of others\u2019 needs: preparing breakfast, polishing silver, and ensuring the household runs invisibly. Her relationships are polite but distant; she is an employee, a fixture in the home but not part of the family. Her primary social connection is a weekly phone call with her cousin in Sacramento and brief, friendly chats with the mail carrier.\n\nMei-ling\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of memory and longing. From the mansion\u2019s bay windows, she watches the fog roll over the Golden Gate Bridge, remembering walks with her father at Land's End. Her dream isn't for wealth, but for autonomy. She saves every dollar she can, hoping one day to afford a small studio of her own, perhaps back in the Richmond. There, she dreams of tending to a small balcony garden, filling the air with the scent of jasmine, and finally cooking her mother's recipes just for herself."
