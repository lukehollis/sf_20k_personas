The only son of immigrants from Delhi, he grew up in the suburban warmth of Fremont, a world away from the city he now calls home. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, instilled in him the value of a stable, predictable path. Rahul, a natural history enthusiast with a love for narratives and patterns, initially enrolled at UC Berkeley as a History major. However, parental pressure and the practical allure of a secure future led him to pivot, graduating with a Bachelor's in Economics and quickly landing a job as a financial analyst.\n\nHis career began with a standard commute to the Financial District, but the pandemic was a crucial turning point. His company went fully remote, and Rahul\u2019s 0.0-mile commute was born. He moved from a shared apartment in the East Bay to a small one-bedroom in Hayes Valley, seeking the city's energy to combat the isolation of working from home. Now, his apartment is both office and sanctuary, a space where the line between professional and personal life blurs into a series of Zoom calls and spreadsheet analyses.\n\nHis daily routine is disciplined. Mornings start with strong coffee and market reports. The workday is a digital marathon. To escape the screen, evenings are sacred. He\u2019s an avid runner, his routes taking him through the Panhandle and into Golden Gate Park, or exploring the architectural history of Alamo Square. This is how he connects with San Francisco\u2014not through a commute, but through intentional exploration of its physical, analog world.\n\nSocially, Rahul maintains a tight-knit circle of college friends, but finds the unstructured nature of remote work makes new connections difficult. He feels the absence of casual workplace interactions acutely. His dream is to bridge the gap between his passion and his profession. He spends late nights outlining a book idea: a narrative history of the financial crises that shaped the modern world. It\u2019s a project that allows the historian in him to breathe. Rahul aspires to a future where his work is not just about forecasting numbers, but about telling the stories behind them, finding a deeper sense of purpose within the city that is now, inextricably, his own."
