Born in Tehran to an engineer father and a librarian mother, his family fled to Berkeley just ahead of the 1979 revolution. He grew up in a home filled with the scent of saffron rice, the sound of Farsi poetry, and a deep appreciation for the freedom and opportunity of Northern California. This duality\u2014a profound connection to his Persian heritage and an embrace of American civic life\u2014became his defining feature.\n\nHis educational journey reflected this. An undergraduate degree in Art History from UC Berkeley nurtured his passion, but an early career in arts non-profits left him frustrated by the constant struggle for funding. A key turning point came during a city budget hearing, where he realized real, sustainable change was championed from within the system. This epiphany led him to earn a Master's in Public Administration from SF State, determined to become a force for the arts inside City Hall. His career was a steady, methodical climb, built on a reputation for being both a passionate advocate and a pragmatic administrator.\n\nNow, at 51, Kian is a respected figure in San Francisco's cultural landscape. He lives in a meticulously kept apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant murals and rich Latino heritage he deeply admires. His daily 3.8-mile commute on the J-Church MUNI isn't a chore but an immersion in the city's rhythm. He is amicably divorced, and his greatest pride is his daughter, Soraya, now studying architecture at UCLA. His evenings are often spent at gallery openings or community performances, his work and social life seamlessly intertwined.\n\nKian dreams of establishing a legacy project: a city-wide, international arts biennale that would celebrate San Francisco's unique position as a Pacific Rim cultural hub. Personally, he harbors a quiet hope of one day traveling to a peaceful Iran with his daughter. He sees his role not as a bureaucrat, but as a steward, tasked with protecting and nurturing the diverse, chaotic, and beautiful soul of San Francisco."

She pointed to the immense orange structure and recited a poem by Hafez in Farsi, her voice a warm thread against the chill. He didn't understand how ancient words about love and wine could relate to this giant steel thing. In that moment, he learned that his two worlds\u2014the Persian one he lost and the American one he was gaining\u2014could be held together by beauty.\n\n2.\nHe was 28, sitting under the droning fluorescent lights of a City Hall hearing room. An arts program he championed was being dismantled by a line-item veto, dismissed with bureaucratic indifference. The feeling of powerlessness was a physical ache. But then, watching a deputy city manager calmly defend the budget, he had a revelation. He was on the wrong side of the table. He couldn't just plead from the outside; he had to be inside, helping write the policy himself. That night, he started researching MPA programs.\n\n3.\nHe recalls a Saturday when his daughter Soraya was ten, walking through Balmy Alley. He was explaining the political history of a mural when she pointed not at the art, but at the building. \"Dad,\" she\u2019d said, \"look at how the lines of the wall work with the lines of the painting.\" He stopped, stunned by her innate grasp of form and space. It was the first time he truly saw the architect she would become. Her vision wasn\u2019t just surface deep; she understood the city's bones.\n\n4.\nIt was a rainy Tuesday on the J-Church about five years ago. The train groaned through Dolores Park, its windows streaked with water. Inside was a collage of the city: a tech worker with headphones, a grandmother speaking Cantonese, a musician with a cello case. Nobody spoke, yet the shared journey created a silent, temporary community. Kian felt an overwhelming sense of purpose. This quiet, chaotic, moving tableau\u2014this was the masterpiece he was sworn to protect. The feeling settled in him not as a job, but as a calling.\n\n5.\nHe was at a gallery opening in SoMa a few years ago, surrounded by the work of a young Indonesian painter. The art vibrated with the energy of Jakarta, but the themes of migration and identity felt intensely San Franciscan. The room buzzed with a dozen languages, a testament to the city's Pacific crossroads. Holding a glass of cheap Chardonnay, his vision for the biennale crystallized. It wasn't just a dream; it was a necessity. San Francisco needed a global stage to tell these stories, and he knew he could build it."
