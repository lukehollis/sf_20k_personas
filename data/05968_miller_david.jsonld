Raised in a methodical, middle-class home in Burlington, Massachusetts, by an engineer father and a teacher mother, David was an outlier\u2014a boy who devoured history books instead of building models. He pursued this love at Tufts University, earning a Bachelor's in European History, with dreams of a life in academia. However, facing the stark reality of the academic job market and his father\u2019s gentle but persistent pressure for a \u201csecure future,\u201d David made a pivotal choice. He pivoted, applying his analytical mind to a more lucrative field, eventually earning an MBA from Stanford.\n\nHis career as a management consultant in finance was meteoric. For two decades, David lived out of a suitcase, a blur of airports, boardrooms, and hotel suites from New York to Hong Kong. He was brilliant at restructuring companies, finding efficiencies, and maximizing shareholder value, but the human cost was high. A serious long-term relationship disintegrated in his late thirties, the final break happening over a staticky phone call while he was in Zurich. He moved to San Francisco in the early 2000s, following a major tech client, and simply never left.\n\nThe pandemic was an unexpected turning point. Grounded indefinitely, the 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his home office in his pristine Russian Hill apartment forced an introspection he\u2019d avoided for years. The silence, initially jarring, became a comfort. His daily routine now begins not with a rush to SFO, but with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, watching the fog burn off the bay. He still consults, advising on billion-dollar deals via Zoom, but the relentless drive has softened.\n\nHis social circle is small; a few old colleagues and a neighbor he shares wine with occasionally. He\u2019s reconnected with San Francisco itself, no longer just a financial hub but a city of steep hills, stunning views, and quiet corners. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to climb another rung on the corporate ladder. He harbors a quiet dream of finally writing a book on the economic history of the Hanseatic League\u2014a nod to the young man he once was. He\u2019s searching for a different kind of return on investment, one measured not in market share, but in personal meaning."
