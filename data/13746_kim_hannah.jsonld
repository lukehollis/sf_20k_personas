Her 4.5-mile commute from her quiet Inner Richmond apartment to the bustling SoMa office of her startup is a cherished ritual. It\u2019s a moment of stillness before the controlled chaos of her life as a Lead Clinical Psychologist, developing digital mental health tools for students.\n\nBorn in Daly City to first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store, Hannah\u2019s path was expected to be straightforward: excel in school, attend a top university, and become a medical doctor. She started on that track at UC Berkeley, but everything changed during her sophomore year when her roommate suffered a severe depressive episode. Witnessing the silent struggle and the stigma surrounding it ignited a new purpose in Hannah. She switched her major to psychology, a decision that caused friction with her parents, who equated it with a less stable, less prestigious future.\n\nHer conviction only deepened through her Ph.D. program at Stanford and her early years in private practice. While she found the one-on-one work fulfilling, she felt a nagging sense of limitation. The same barriers she saw in college\u2014cost, accessibility, and cultural stigma\u2014persisted. This frustration led her to a turning point: leaving the security of her traditional practice for the volatile world of tech. She joined a startup aiming to integrate mental health support directly into educational platforms, a mission that felt like the culmination of her life's work.\n\nNow 42 and navigating life after the recent end of a long-term relationship, Hannah finds solace in her city. Her weekends are spent exploring Golden Gate Park, browsing the shops on Clement Street, or sharing meals with a tight-knit circle of friends. She dreams of a future where asking for mental help is as normal as seeing a doctor for a cold, especially within the AAPI community. Her work is demanding, but as her bus weaves through the San Francisco streets each morning, Hannah feels a profound sense of purpose, knowing she is building the very tools she wishes had existed for her community all those years ago."

Hannah would sit in the hallway, textbook unopened, listening to the unnerving silence from her roommate's side. The helplessness was a physical ache, a frustration at the whispered stigma and lack of resources. In that silence, her pre-med path dissolved. It was no longer about fixing bodies, but about understanding the silent battles waged behind closed doors. This moment, which occurred at Berkeley when she was 19, ignited her life\u2019s true purpose.\n\n2.\nThe air in her parents' Daly City store was thick with the scent of cabbage and cardboard boxes. She was 20 when she told them she was leaving pre-med for psychology. Her father didn't look up from stocking shelves, but his shoulders tensed. Her mother\u2019s sigh was laced with a disappointment that hurt more than yelling. \u2018Psychology?\u2019 she\u2019d asked, the word sounding fragile. Standing there, amidst their life's work, Hannah felt a painful gulf open between their dreams and hers, but also a new, steely resolve to prove them wrong.\n\n3.\nOn her last day in private practice at 35, she stood looking out the window of her quiet office. She remembered the faces of the clients she\u2019d helped, but was haunted by the countless others she couldn't reach due to cost or cultural fear. The security of the leather chair suddenly felt like a comfortable cage. The thought of joining an unproven startup was terrifying, but the fear was eclipsed by a thrilling sense of possibility. It was the moment she chose uncertain impact over predictable security, a choice that still defines her.\n\n4.\nA month after her breakup last year, she walked through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in, muffling the city. She stopped by Stow Lake, watching the ducks glide on the still, grey water. There was a pang of loneliness, a ghost of the hand she used to hold. But then, a quiet sense of peace settled in. The city, this park, felt like a loyal, steadying presence. In that moment of solitude, she realized she wasn't adrift, but simply rediscovering how to stand on her own two feet again.\n\n5.\nLast spring, she was reviewing early user data when an anonymous feedback message caught her eye. It was from a Korean-American student in the Midwest. \"I never could've told my parents I was struggling,\" he wrote. \"This app was the first place I felt safe.\" Hannah had to close her laptop, tears blurring the screen. It was her college roommate, her parents\u2019 worried faces, her entire journey culminating in that one message. The immense risk she took felt entirely, profoundly validated, confirming her work was changing lives."
