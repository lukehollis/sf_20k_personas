Raised in the Sacramento suburbs, he was the son of a pragmatic contractor father who saw the world in terms of load-bearing walls and building codes, and a librarian mother who saw it in stories and imagination. Brandon spent his childhood sketching fantastical structures in the margins of his notebooks, a fusion of his parents' worlds that no one quite understood. He dutifully pursued architecture at Cal Poly, mastering the technical foundations his father respected.\n\nThe turning point came during his master's program at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). Surrounded by experimental design, he realized that a building could be more than shelter; it could be a sculpture, a statement, an experience. After graduating, he took a lucrative job at a large corporate firm in San Francisco, designing sleek but soulless office towers. The work was prestigious but left him hollow. The pivotal moment was designing a small, pro-bono gallery space for a friend. The process of shaping light and flow to elevate art reignited his original passion. At 31, he quit his stable job to specialize in architecture for the arts.\n\nNow 37, Brandon lives the life he designed for himself. His home and office are one and the same: a spacious, minimalist live/work loft in SOMA, where exposed concrete walls serve as a canvas for blueprints and inspirational art. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing for a seamless blend of life and work. Mornings are for deep focus\u2014drafting on his computer, building physical models\u2014fueled by coffee from a local roaster. Afternoons are for virtual meetings with museum boards or onsite collaborations with installation artists.\n\nHis social life is woven into his professional one, consisting of a tight-knit circle of artists, curators, and designers he meets at gallery openings and industry events. He is a quiet observer, more comfortable discussing the nuance of a material than engaging in small talk. Brandon\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tethered to its vibrant, often challenging, arts scene. He sees the city as a living gallery in need of thoughtful curation. His ultimate aspiration is not to build the tallest tower, but to design a small, perfect museum or a groundbreaking performance space\u2014a permanent contribution to the city\u2019s cultural landscape that finally proves art and structure can be one."
