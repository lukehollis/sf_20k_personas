Born in the Richmond District to immigrants from Hong Kong, his childhood was steeped in the aromas of his parents\u2019 small corner market and the damp kiss of the Pacific fog. He was a dutiful son, expected to excel and lift the family\u2019s prospects. He was on that path, enrolled at San Francisco State University with a nascent passion for history, when his father suffered a major stroke.\n\nThat event was the pivot point of David\u2019s life. At 21, he dropped out of college to help his mother run the market and care for his ailing father. The temporary measure became permanent. For over a decade, his world shrank to the store\u2019s four walls and the familiar routes to his father\u2019s medical appointments. The dream of graduation faded, replaced by the immediate needs of his family.\n\nAfter his father passed away and his mother retired, they sold the struggling market. Needing stable work with benefits, David found a job at the UCSF Medical Center on Parnassus Heights. He became a patient transporter, a role he\u2019s now held for twelve years. It\u2019s a life in motion, spent pushing gurneys and wheelchairs, offering a steady hand or a reassuring word to people at their most vulnerable. He\u2019s a repository of the city\u2019s anxieties and hopes, known by face but rarely by name.\n\nDavid lives in a small, rent-controlled in-law unit in the Inner Sunset, just a few blocks from the hospital, making his commute a short, familiar walk. His social life is modest; his closest relationship is with his elderly mother, whom he visits in her Outer Richmond apartment every other day. He finds solace in the simple routines: the morning light over Golden Gate Park, the familiar banter with the nurses, and late-night pho from a spot on Irving Street.\n\nHis aspirations are now small but deeply felt. He dreams of finding a partner who understands his quiet life and, perhaps one day, being able to afford a small condo somewhere, anywhere, in the Bay Area. More than anything, David yearns for a sense of peace, a feeling that his quiet sacrifices for family and community have mattered in the ever-changing landscape of his beloved city."

His father found him, not with a scolding look, but with a rare, soft smile. He simply nodded and placed a cold bottle of soy milk beside David before walking away. In that silent moment, David felt the full weight of his father\u2019s unspoken hope. His academic future wasn't just his own; it was the family\u2019s vessel, a quiet promise exchanged between the sacks of rice and boxes of dried noodles.\n\n2.\nThe call came while he was studying in a carrel at SF State. His mother\u2019s voice, a frantic, splintered version of itself in Cantonese, cut through the academic quiet. He doesn\u2019t remember walking out of the library, only standing at the MUNI stop on Holloway, the history textbook feeling impossibly heavy in his bag. He watched the streetcar heading downtown, towards a life of ideas, then boarded the one heading west, towards duty. That ride back to the Richmond felt like the longest journey of his life, a silent farewell to the man he was supposed to become.\n\n3.\nTen years into running the market, an elderly woman he was wheeling to oncology began to weep silently. She was terrified. On impulse, David stopped the gurney in a quiet hallway. He didn\u2019t know her name, but he recognized the fear he\u2019d seen in his dad\u2019s eyes. He just rested a hand on her shoulder and said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m right here.\u201d She squeezed his arm, a fragile, desperate grip. It was the first time his job felt like more than a paycheck; it was a continuation of his duty, giving others the quiet comfort he\u2019d always tried to give his father.\n\n4.\nThe day they sold the market, its shelves nearly bare, he felt an unexpected ache. Mrs. Lin, a regular for twenty years, shuffled in for her weekly newspaper. David handed it to her, their usual ritual, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it was the last time. He just watched her walk away, another small, familiar part of his world dissolving like a ghost. He wasn't mourning the store; he was mourning the loss of his post, the quiet purpose of being a background fixture in so many people\u2019s daily routines.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his pre-dawn walk to UCSF, the fog was so thick it felt like an embrace. He paused at the edge of Golden Gate Park, watching the headlights swim past on Irving Street. He could hear the city waking up, but in his small pocket of mist, there was only silence. He felt a profound sense of peace, realizing that this\u2014the quiet commute, the familiar gray light, the steady purpose of his day\u2014was enough. The yearning for more hadn't vanished, but for a moment, it was quieted by a feeling of belonging."
