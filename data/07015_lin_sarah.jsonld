Raised in Cupertino, she was the only child of Taiwanese immigrants who had built a stable life through engineering and unshakable diligence. Her childhood was defined by high expectations and the ambient hum of Silicon Valley ambition. While her parents saw her future in code or medicine, Sarah found refuge in the worlds of fiction, spending her youth lost in the library. This love for stories led her to UC Berkeley, where she declared her major in Comparative Literature, a decision met with quiet concern at home.\n\nThe turning point came during her senior year. Faced with the daunting reality of the Bay Area\u2019s cost of living and her parents\u2019 gentle but persistent pressure, she made a compromise. She added a business administration minor, a practical shield for her humanities degree. After graduation, the path of finance beckoned, offering a security that literature could not promise. She excelled, her sharp, analytical mind, honed by deconstructing complex texts, proving equally adept at deciphering market trends.\n\nNow, at 30, Sarah\u2019s life is contained within her sleek Hayes Valley apartment, the 0.0-mile commute a testament to her remote work life. Her days follow a rhythm: a morning coffee from a local cafe, hours spent analyzing data on dual monitors, and an evening run through the neighborhood's tree-lined streets. She\u2019s built a comfortable existence, yet the old dichotomy remains.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. The city provides her career, but it\u2019s the proximity to the SFJAZZ Center and the independent bookstores in her neighborhood that truly feeds her soul. Her social circle consists of a tight-knit group of college friends, with whom she maintains a fiercely competitive book club. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to abandon her career, but to find a synthesis. She quietly works on a novel manuscript on weekends, hoping one day to bridge the gap between the secure life she built and the creative one she still yearns for."
