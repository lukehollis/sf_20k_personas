He grew up in Modesto, a world away from the coastal fog of San Francisco. His was a working-class family; his father a mechanic with grease-stained hands, his mother a cashier at a grocery store. The defining feature of his adolescence was the shadow cast by his older brother's escalating battle with opioid addiction. Cody watched helplessly as his family, lacking resources and understanding, navigated the crisis with a mixture of tough love and despair, a combination that ultimately failed.\n\nThis painful experience became Cody\u2019s north star. While his friends pursued trades or four-year degrees, he enrolled in a community college program for an Associate's in Human Services. He needed to understand the systems that had failed his brother. Upon graduating, he made a decisive move to San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s progressive, if imperfect, approach to public health.\n\nHis career began with entry-level outreach work in the Tenderloin, a stark immersion into the realities of urban poverty and substance use. The turning point was seeing the principles of harm reduction in action\u2014meeting people where they are, without judgment, offering clean supplies, and providing a sliver of dignity. It was the compassion his brother never received. He worked his way up to his current role as a Harm Reduction Case Manager, where he helps clients navigate the labyrinthine systems of healthcare and housing.\n\nNow 39, Cody lives a life of determined simplicity in the Inner Richmond. His small, rent-controlled apartment is his sanctuary from the emotional demands of his job. His daily routine is marked by the rumble of the 5-Fulton Muni bus, which carries him the 2.8 miles to his office. Evenings are for decompressing: a run through Golden Gate Park, cooking, or quiet trivia nights with a tight-knit circle of fellow social workers who understand the weight of their work. He is currently single, a past long-term relationship having buckled under the strain of his career.\n\nCody\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of a tech transplant or artist; he sees himself as a civic caretaker. His dream isn\u2019t a promotion for more pay, but to see systemic change\u2014advocating for more funding, better policies, and ultimately, a city that treats its most vulnerable with the humanity he knows they deserve."

The smell of asphalt, urine, and street food hit him with a force that Modesto never could. He saw a man huddled in a doorway, his face a mask of desperation that mirrored his brother\u2019s. In that moment, the city wasn\u2019t a place of adventure, but a battlefield. It stripped away any idealism, leaving a raw, unshakeable sense of purpose. He was exactly where he needed to be.\n\n2.\nHe was 24, shadowing a veteran worker in an alley off 6th Street. He watched her speak to a woman with gentle familiarity, offering clean needles and a foil-wrapped packet of naloxone. There was no lecture, no judgment\u2014only quiet dignity. He felt a profound, gut-wrenching click. This simple act of compassion was the very thing his family, in their fear and confusion, had denied his brother. This memory became the bedrock of his entire professional philosophy: meeting people with humanity first.\n\n3.\nFour years ago, he sat on a flimsy chair in Maria\u2019s new SRO room. After six months of navigating bureaucracy, she finally had a key. The room was bare, but she stared out the window at the traffic below, a quiet smile on her face. For Cody, who so often only saw the process, this single moment of peace was overwhelming. It wasn't a victory against the system, but a victory for one person within it. It became the fuel he burned on the hardest days.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a specific evening run last autumn, pounding the path near Spreckels Lake as the fog rolled in, muffling the city. The cold air burned his lungs, a clean pain that scoured the day\u2019s trauma from his mind. He stopped, watching the mist swallow the cypress trees, and felt the immense weight of his clients\u2019 lives momentarily lift. This ritual shaped his survival, teaching him that he had to find moments to be just a man running in a park, not just a caretaker.\n\n5.\nHe was 35 when his long-term partner, her face etched with frustration, asked, \u201cCan\u2019t you ever just leave it at the office?\u201d He stood in their Inner Richmond kitchen and had no answer. He realized with devastating clarity that the work wasn\u2019t a coat he could take off; it was woven into his skin. That quiet, impossible question marked the end of the relationship, cementing in him a lonely acceptance that his mission would always be his most demanding and defining partner."
