The only child of a doctor and an engineer who emigrated from Delhi to Fremont in the 1980s, Priya grew up steeped in a culture of academic rigor and high professional ambition. While her parents envisioned a future for her in medicine, Priya\u2019s heart was captured by the wild, natural landscapes of her new home. Childhood weekends spent hiking in the Marin Headlands and family trips to Yosemite instilled in her a profound sense of responsibility for the environment.\n\nChoosing to defy familial expectations was her first major turning point. She pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and then earned a Master of Environmental Management from Duke University, where she met her future husband, Mark Miller, an aspiring architect. Their shared passion for sustainable design and ecological preservation formed the bedrock of their relationship. They married and moved back to the Bay Area, drawn by professional opportunities and a desire to be near the coast.\n\nNow, at 42, Priya is a Senior Environmental Consultant, a leader in a field she fought to enter. Her 0.0-mile commute is a recent, deliberate choice, allowing her to work from their tastefully renovated Edwardian home in Cole Valley. Her days are a blend of intense focus and domestic rhythm. Mornings begin with a foggy walk with their scruffy terrier, Chai, in Golden Gate Park, just steps from her door. This is followed by a cascade of Zoom calls with developers, city planners, and legal teams, where she meticulously analyzes environmental impact reports, her expertise directly shaping the physical future of San Francisco.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to the city is both professional and deeply personal. She isn\u2019t just a resident; she is a guardian of its delicate ecosystem. Her current dream isn't about climbing higher on the corporate ladder, but about pivoting to the public sector to gain more direct influence over municipal sustainability policy. As she watches her ten-year-old daughter, Maya, explore the same trails in Golden Gate Park that once inspired her, Priya\u2019s greatest aspiration is simple: to leave behind a city, and a world, that is healthier and more resilient for the next generation."
