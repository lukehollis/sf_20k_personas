Days were long, filled with the scent of five-spice and the expectation of hard work. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable profession like medicine, Meilin was drawn to systems\u2014the intricate, often invisible structures that governed city life. This fascination led her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master's degree in Public Policy, intent on fixing the urban machinery from within.\n\nHer early career unfolded in the bureaucratic maze of City Hall. Meilin was sharp and effective, but grew frustrated by the slow pace of change. The turning point came during a collaboration on a public transit data project, where she worked alongside engineers from a local tech startup. She was captivated by their agile methodology and the tangible speed of their progress. A coffee meeting with the startup's lead engineer turned into a job offer. Leaving the civic world felt like a betrayal of her ideals, but she took the leap.\n\nIn tech, Meilin thrived. She discovered that her ability to mediate between competing interests and untangle bureaucracy was even more valuable in software development. She rose quickly, becoming a Senior Project Manager known for her calm authority and an uncanny ability to deliver complex projects on time.\n\nNow 43, Meilin lives a life of ordered independence in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a deep connection to her neighborhood. Her days begin with a pour-over from a local roaster, followed by a flurry of video calls and digital planning. She breaks for a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green, observing the community she once studied academically. Her social life is a curated circle of old friends from Cal and a few trusted colleagues, with whom she shares dinners and attends performances at the nearby SFJAZZ Center.\n\nLately, her original ambitions have resurfaced. While financially secure, Meilin feels a pull toward more meaningful work. She dreams of leveraging her corporate expertise to lead a major civic tech initiative, reconnecting her career with her foundational desire to improve the city she has always called home."
