His commute is zero miles because his small, tidy basement apartment is part of his compensation. He is the building\u2019s custodian, a role he inherited from his father five years ago.\n\nBorn in a small town in El Salvador, Ricardo came to San Francisco with his parents at age 15. The city was a bewildering landscape of steep hills and shocking fog. While his friends back home were finishing school, Ricardo was washing dishes alongside his father, contributing to the family\u2019s precarious finances. He learned English in crowded night classes and eventually earned his GED, a quiet achievement he keeps framed above his small desk. He never had the luxury to dream of college; survival was the priority.\n\nHis father, a man of immense pride and few words, taught him the custodial trade. He learned how to fix a leaky faucet, the science of polishing century-old brass, and the importance of being an invisible, reliable presence. The turning point in Ricardo's life was his father's sudden death from a heart attack. At 31, Ricardo stepped into his father\u2019s worn work boots, becoming the sole caretaker for both the grand building and his grieving mother, who eventually returned to El Salvador to be with her sisters.\n\nNow, Ricardo\u2019s days are a steady rhythm. He wakes before the first tenants, ensuring the lobby is immaculate and the boiler is humming. He is a quiet ghost in the machine of their lives, knowing who gets takeout every Friday and whose dog needs walking at 3 a.m. His social life is limited, but he finds camaraderie on Sunday mornings at a Mission District soccer field, where the shared language of the game offers a brief escape.\n\nRicardo\u2019s dream is not to leave the building, but to build something of his own. He diligently saves money, hoping to one day bring his mother back to the U.S. and buy a small house with a yard, perhaps in Daly City. From the building's roof, where he sometimes eats his lunch, he has a millionaire's view of the bay. It\u2019s a profound, daily reminder of the city he serves but doesn't fully belong to, a beautiful world he keeps clean for others, waiting for his own chance to put down roots."
