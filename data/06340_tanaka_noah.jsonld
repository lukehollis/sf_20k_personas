A third-generation Japanese American, he grew up in a modest Sacramento suburb where his family\u2019s love was expressed through action, not words. His grandparents, who had endured the indignity of internment camps during WWII, rarely spoke of the past, embedding a legacy of stoic resilience in the family culture. This unspoken history fascinated and frustrated a young Noah, who felt the weight of emotions that had no name. The turning point came when his grandfather passed away; the family mourned with a profound, aching quietness that drove Noah to understand the language of grief they could not speak.\n\nThis pursuit led him to UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work. He fell in love with the Bay Area\u2019s vibrant energy and intellectual curiosity, a stark contrast to his reserved upbringing. After graduating, he became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, finding his calling in the demanding healthcare sector. For over a decade, Noah has worked within a large San Francisco hospital system, though his office is a quiet room in his Inner Richmond apartment. From here, he conducts telehealth sessions, offering counsel to patients and families navigating the complex emotional terrain of chronic illness and end-of-life care.\n\nHis days are structured and serene. Mornings often begin with a walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park before he logs on, spending hours holding space for others' pain. His work is emotionally taxing, so his evenings are for quiet restoration. He shares his life with his partner of eight years, Alex, a landscape architect whose work creating beautiful, living spaces provides a soothing counterpoint to Noah\u2019s intense focus on the internal world. Their social circle is small but deep, comprised mostly of friends from grad school.\n\nNoah feels deeply connected to the Inner Richmond, its blend of cultures and proximity to the park offering a sense of groundedness. He aspires to one day open a small private practice specializing in grief counseling, particularly for Asian American families, helping them bridge the same generational silences that first set him on his path. For Noah, San Francisco is not just a home; it\u2019s the place where he finally learned to give voice to the quiet."
