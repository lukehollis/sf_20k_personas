His father, a mechanic, and his mother, a payroll clerk, were baffled when he chose to major in History at UC Davis. To them, it was a degree in the abstract, a path with no clear destination. For Dimitri, it was an escape into the grand narratives of the past, a brief respite before the inevitable collision with the present.\n\nAfter graduation, he fled the valley's heat for San Francisco's fog-laced uncertainty. The city was a formidable, expensive beast, and his history degree opened few doors. Needing to pay rent on a tiny room in the Inner Richmond, he took a stockroom job at a national clothing retailer. It was meant to be temporary, but Dimitri discovered an unexpected satisfaction in the role. He found he had a knack for logistics and a quiet authority that calmed workplace chaos. The systems of inventory and sales were a modern, tangible history he could influence.\n\nHis ascent was steady and methodical. Sales associate, shift lead, assistant manager, then store manager. The key turning point came a decade ago when he was offered a regional manager position, overseeing all Bay Area locations. The offer came with a unique perk: a spacious, modern loft apartment directly above the company\u2019s flagship store in Hayes Valley. He accepted without hesitation. The 0.0-mile commute cemented his life's trajectory; work and home became one. This dedication, however, cost him his long-term relationship with a partner who grew tired of competing with quarterly reports.\n\nNow, at 47, Dimitri\u2019s life is a well-oiled machine. He wakes, checks regional sales data from his laptop, and walks downstairs into his primary store. He is a fixture in Hayes Valley, recognized by baristas and fellow shop owners, a constant in a neighborhood of perpetual motion. He enjoys the city's energy from a slight remove, observing it from his window or during quiet weeknight dinners alone at a small Italian place on Belden Place. Deep down, he sometimes dreams of a different life\u2014one where he uses his History degree to lead tours through Roman ruins. But then the morning comes, the inventory needs counting, and Dimitri Miller, the consummate manager, gets back to work."
