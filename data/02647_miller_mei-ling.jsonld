Born at Chinese Hospital to a mother from a large Chinatown family and a second-generation Irish-American father from the Sunset District, her childhood was a blend of dim sum on Sundays and Giants games on the radio. Growing up, she wasn\u2019t an academic star; she was practical, observant, and deeply empathetic, qualities that weren\u2019t always measured on report cards.\n\nThe trajectory of her life shifted in her early twenties when her father had a major heart attack. Witnessing the calm, compassionate competence of the nurses at SF General Hospital ignited a purpose within her. She enrolled in the nursing program at City College of San Francisco, working nights as a waitress to pay her way. It was a grueling period, but it solidified her resolve. Upon graduating, she accepted a position as a Registered Nurse at SF General, the very place that had inspired her, and has worked there ever since, primarily in the demanding environment of the Emergency Department.\n\nHer personal life is woven into the fabric of her work and neighborhood. She met her husband, Mark, a San Francisco firefighter, when he brought a patient into her ER. They bonded over the shared stresses and dark humor of their public service professions. Twenty years ago, they stretched every penny to buy a small, charming Edwardian duplex in Potrero Hill, a lucky move that has allowed them to stay in the city.\n\nToday, at 48, Mei-Ling\u2019s life is a disciplined routine. Her 0.0-mile commute is a cherished luxury\u2014a ten-minute walk down the hill to the hospital, allowing her a few quiet moments to steel herself for the 12-hour shift ahead. Her days off are for her teenage son, Leo, for grocery shopping, and for walks with Mark up to the top of the hill for its panoramic views. She dreams not of wealth, but of peace: for her patients to heal, for her son to find a happy path in an expensive world, and for a future where she and Mark can retire and travel somewhere quiet. Her connection to San Francisco is one of deep, complicated love\u2014she mourns the city she\u2019s lost to tech booms but fiercely protects the community she still has in her small corner of it."
