Raised in the planned-out, sun-baked suburbs of Davis, her childhood was stable and predictable, defined by her engineer father's logic and teacher mother's structured compassion. This emotionally reserved environment fostered in her a deep curiosity about the unspoken feelings that simmered beneath the surface of family life. She sought an escape at UC Santa Cruz, where she immersed herself in sociology, drawn to understanding the architecture of human systems.\n\nThe definitive turning point came during her senior year. Her father suffered a massive, unexpected heart attack. In the sterile, chaotic environment of the ICU, it was a clinical social worker who became her family\u2019s anchor, translating medical jargon, navigating insurance, and offering a space for their grief. Witnessing that grace under pressure was a revelation. Sarah abandoned plans for academia and enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work with a clear, unwavering purpose.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco for an internship and never left, taking a full-time position at the UCSF Parnassus campus. For fifteen years, she endured the MUNI commute, the daily grind draining the same empathy she needed for her patients. Finally, eight years ago, she made a radical change. She bought a small one-bedroom condominium in Cole Valley, directly across the street from the hospital. Her 0.0-mile commute became her life\u2019s greatest luxury.\n\nNow, at 47, her days have a rhythm. She wakes, shares coffee with her long-term partner Alex, a graphic designer, and then walks to her office. Her work is emotionally demanding\u2014guiding families through end-of-life decisions, securing resources for uninsured patients, and absorbing the trauma of an urban hospital. She de-stresses with long, solitary walks through the eucalyptus groves of Golden Gate Park, just blocks away. Her connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; her world is the few blocks encompassing her home, her work, and the park. Her dream isn\u2019t one of promotion, but of legacy: she hopes to secure funding to create a dedicated palliative care support program within the hospital, modeled on the support that once saved her own family."
