Raised in Bend, Oregon, by a high school English teacher and a carpenter, her upbringing was steeped in practicality, books, and the scent of pine. This grounded, nature-filled childhood instilled in her a quiet resilience that would later serve her well in the fast-paced world she chose.\n\nShe attended the University of Oregon, earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. While she loved dissecting novels and crafting essays, she graduated with no clear career path. Driven by a desire for a life more dynamic than her hometown could offer, she moved to San Francisco in her early twenties, crashing on a friend\u2019s couch in the Mission. Her first few years were a patchwork of jobs\u2014barista, bookstore clerk, and eventually, an administrative assistant at a fledgling tech startup.\n\nThis last role was her turning point. While the founders were focused on code, Sarah found herself naturally gravitating toward their early clients, patiently walking them through the software and smoothing over issues. She discovered that her humanities degree had given her a unique superpower in the tech world: empathy and clear communication. She transitioned into a formal \"customer happiness\" role, which evolved into her current position as a Customer Success Manager.\n\nNow 38, Sarah lives a life centered in her Hayes Valley apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are framed not by traffic, but by personal rituals. A morning jog past the Painted Ladies in Alamo Square, followed by coffee and focused work on a stream of Slack messages and Zoom calls. She manages a portfolio of enterprise clients, acting as their advocate and guide\u2014a digital shepherd of sorts.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends, most from her pre-tech days, and a weekly pottery class that keeps her hands grounded in something tangible. San Francisco is no longer a grand adventure but a comfortable, complex home. Lately, a quiet dream has been taking root: to one day use her savings and business acumen to open a small, curated bookstore-caf\u00e9, perhaps in a quieter corner of the city. A place that feels more like Oregon than Silicon Valley, bringing her journey full circle."
