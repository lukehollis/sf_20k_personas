The daughter of a longshoreman and a church administrator, she learned the value of a steady hand and a reliable paycheck early on. Her childhood was filled with the rhythmic clang of the port and the harmonies of the Sunday choir. She was the first in her family to attend college, enrolling in a business administration program at a local community college with dreams of managing something of her own one day.\n\nThat dream was deferred when her mother fell ill. At 20, Tonya dropped out to work full-time, taking a job on an electronics assembly line to help with medical bills. The work was meticulous and demanding, but she discovered she had a knack for it\u2014an unwavering focus and dexterity that supervisors praised. This unexpected path became her career.\n\nAfter her parents passed away a decade later, Tonya sought a change. A recruiter told her about opportunities in San Francisco's burgeoning medical device industry. She took a position as a production assembler, trading the familiar streets of Oakland for the steep hills of a city that felt both close and a world away. Her greatest stroke of luck was finding a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Dogpatch, just a three-block walk from the facility. That 0.0-mile commute became the foundation of her new life, a rare gift of time and calm in the bustling city.\n\nNow 47, Tonya\u2019s days follow a predictable rhythm. She walks to work before the sun has fully risen over the bay, spending her shifts in a cleanroom, her hands expertly assembling components for devices that will monitor heartbeats and aid in surgeries. There\u2019s a quiet pride in her work; she\u2019s building things that matter. Her life is contained and peaceful. Evenings are for reading library books, tending to her surprisingly resilient pothos plants, and listening to old R&B records. Her social circle is small but solid\u2014a few coworkers she shares lunch with and the proprietor of her corner market.\n\nTonya\u2019s old dream hasn\u2019t died, it has just matured. She\u2019s slowly taking online classes, chipping away at the business degree she abandoned decades ago. Her new aspiration isn\u2019t to build a corporate empire, but to become a floor supervisor\u2014to guide others with the same steady hand that has defined her entire life."
