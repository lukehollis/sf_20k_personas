She grew up watching her mother work tireless double shifts, yet still find time to check on elderly neighbors and dispense informal medical advice over the fence. Nia witnessed both the compassion of healthcare and its systemic failures, particularly as she watched her mother navigate the system\u2019s inadequacies in managing her own Type 2 diabetes. This formative experience instilled in Nia a fierce drive not just to treat illness, but to prevent it.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. in Sociology from UC Berkeley, Nia pursued a Master of Public Health, focusing on urban health disparities. Her career began with on-the-ground outreach, but her strategic mind and deep empathy quickly propelled her into management. Now 41, Nia is a Program Manager for a large healthcare provider, designing and overseeing preventative health initiatives for San Francisco's most vulnerable populations.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice. Nia lives and works from her bright, plant-filled apartment in the Western Addition, a neighborhood whose rich history she deeply respects. Her days are a blur of Zoom meetings with community partners, data analysis to track program success, and writing grant proposals. Her work is her life, but she maintains balance. Evenings often involve a yoga class, hosting potlucks for her tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her \"chosen family\"\u2014or serving on the board of a local youth center.\n\nA key turning point was a long-term relationship that ended amicably in her late thirties, leading to a period of profound self-reflection. She channeled her energy into her career and her community, finding a different, but equally valid, kind of fulfillment.\n\nNia\u2019s dream is to eventually launch her own non-profit focused on food justice and accessible health education for Black women and seniors. She envisions a San Francisco where a zip code doesn't determine life expectancy. For Nia, health isn't just about the absence of disease; it's about justice, access, and the strength of a neighborhood that looks out for its own\u2014a lesson she learned in Oakland and now champions every day from her home in San Francisco."
