As a third-generation Japanese American raised in the South Bay, Kenji grew up in the quiet shadow of his grandparents\u2019 internment, a trauma never spoken of but deeply felt in his parents' stoic resilience. They valued hard work and discouraged emotional displays, believing endurance was the key to success in America.\n\nInitially, Kenji tried to honor this by pursuing a practical path, studying Sociology at UC Berkeley to understand the systems that shaped his family\u2019s life. However, a turning point came during a visit with his aging grandfather, who, in a rare moment of vulnerability, spoke of the shame and loss of the camps. In that instant, Kenji saw the deep, unhealed wounds left by unspoken history. He pivoted, driven to help others process the very things his own family could not, and earned his Master of Social Work.\n\nHis career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker began in the high-stress environment of a downtown hospital, but the emotional toll led him to reimagine his practice. Today, his commute is a zero-mile walk from his bedroom to his home office. He provides telehealth services, his days a series of video calls where he creates a safe space for patients navigating illness, grief, and mental health crises.\n\nHis life is structured and intentional. Mornings begin with a brisk walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a necessary ritual to clear his head before absorbing the emotional weight of his clients. Evenings are for himself: exploring the restaurants on Clement Street, reading, or connecting with a small, tight-knit circle of friends. His connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused rather than expansive. He doesn\u2019t just live in the city; he uses its rhythm to ground himself. Kenji\u2019s deepest aspiration is to eventually open a small group practice, specifically to help other Asian Americans unpack the complexities of intergenerational trauma\u2014turning his family\u2019s quiet legacy into a source of open healing for his community."

Suddenly, his grandfather looked past him at the wall and whispered about the dust of the camps, a shame that never washed off. For the first time, Kenji saw the trauma not as a historical fact, but as a living wound in the man he loved. That quiet confession became the compass for his entire career, a debt of listening he felt compelled to repay.\n\n2.\nHe remembers a specific Tuesday in his late twenties, working at the downtown hospital. He was trying to console a grieving family when his pager buzzed violently against his hip, another crisis demanding his immediate attention. He felt a profound hollowness, a sense of giving away pieces of himself he couldn't get back. That stark realization\u2014that he couldn't heal others while actively breaking himself\u2014was the catalyst for designing a practice rooted in intention and sustainability, not institutional urgency.\n\n3.\nIt was last autumn, on a typically dense Inner Richmond morning. He was walking a dirt path near the Dutch Windmill in Golden Gate Park as the fog muffled the city into a distant hum. He breathed in the sharp, clean scent of eucalyptus and felt the cold air cleanse him of the residual weight from the previous day's sessions. This simple, sensory ritual taught him that his own peace wasn't a luxury; it was the foundation of the sanctuary he offered his clients.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the silent weight of the family dinner table when he was about ten. He had asked a simple question about where his grandparents lived before the war, and the silence that followed was absolute. His parents exchanged a look, and the topic was changed. He learned then that love in his family was about providing and enduring, not explaining. That hollow space, where questions went to die, shaped his mission to build rooms where silence could finally be filled with words.\n\n5.\nA year ago, during a telehealth session. His client, a young Asian American struggling with anxiety, stared at his own hands on screen and finally whispered, \"My parents\u2026 we just don't talk about being sad.\" In that digital space, Kenji felt a jolt of profound resonance\u2014a direct echo of his own family's quiet pain. This breakthrough was not loud, but it affirmed his entire journey. It proved that healing could begin even through a screen, one shared, understood silence at a time."
