The daughter of Korean immigrants, she grew up in a cramped Los Angeles apartment, the scent of her mother's kimchi jigae mingling with the ozone smell from her father's electronics repair shop. Her parents preached the gospel of education as the only path forward, and Joanne, a gifted observer who preferred disassembling radios to playing with dolls, listened.\n\nHer journey north to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree was a revelation. For the first time, she was surrounded by people who shared her passion for systems and structures. She continued to Stanford for her Master's in Mechanical Engineering, where she navigated a male-dominated field by being twice as prepared and ten times as resilient. Her early career was a blur of late nights in sterile labs and manufacturing floors, climbing the ladder from junior engineer to team lead. A marriage in her late twenties, to a fellow engineer, ended in an amicable divorce a decade later; they were better colleagues than partners. The experience solidified her independence, channeling her focus into her career and raising her son, David.\n\nNow, at 50, Joanne is the Director of Hardware Engineering for a robotics firm in the Dogpatch neighborhood. She drives her Tesla the short 3.5 miles from her meticulously renovated Victorian in Potrero Hill, a home she bought after her last big promotion. Her daily routine is disciplined: a 5:30 AM alarm, Nespresso with a view of the bay, and a full day of managing teams, budgets, and complex manufacturing timelines.\n\nWith her son now a sophomore at UCLA, Joanne is navigating an empty nest. The silence in her house is both liberating and daunting. She\u2019s reconnected with a small, powerful circle of female friends in tech and has started mentoring young women in STEM. While she\u2019s proud of the professional success she has built, her dreams are shifting. She envisions a future with more international travel for pleasure, not just business, and perhaps starting a small consulting firm on her own terms. San Francisco is no longer just a place of opportunity; it is her home, a city whose constant reinvention mirrors her own."

He found her, screwdriver in hand, and she froze, expecting a scolding. Instead, he knelt down, wordlessly trading her clumsy tool for one of his own precision instruments. It wasn\u2019t praise, but it was permission. In that quiet exchange, he validated her curiosity, planting the seed that her path was her own to build, not one she had to inherit.\n\n2.\nAt Stanford, her graduate team\u2019s prototype failed spectacularly during a final presentation. The silence in the lecture hall was crushing, the condescending glances from her male peers burning into her. That night, she didn't cry. She went back to the lab, spread the schematics across the table under the harsh fluorescent lights, and worked until dawn. The embarrassment hardened into pure resolve. She vowed to never be out-prepared again, forging a meticulous resilience that would define her entire career in Silicon Valley.\n\n3.\nThe divorce was finalized not with a dramatic fight, but over coffee at their kitchen table. With a shared legal pad, she and Michael calmly listed assets and timelines, dissecting their marriage with the same clinical precision they applied to engineering problems. There was a profound, quiet sadness in recognizing they were simply better colleagues than partners. In that moment of amicable dissolution, her independence crystallized. Her focus narrowed to two things: her career and her son, David. It was a lonely, but clarifying, moment.\n\n4.\nShe brought a twelve-year-old David to her lab one Sunday. He wasn't intimidated by the whirring robotic arms or the server hum. He pointed to a complex actuator and asked, \"How does it know how much pressure to apply?\" The question was so insightful, so like one she would ask. A wave of fierce pride washed over her, so potent it almost brought tears to her eyes. This was her legacy\u2014not just the machines she built, but the curiosity she had passed on to her son.\n\n5.\nThe day she got the keys to her Potrero Hill home. She stood alone in the empty living room, dust motes dancing in the afternoon light pouring through the bay window. Below, the city sprawled out, a landscape she had conquered on her own terms. The silence wasn't the lonely quiet of an empty nest; it was the sound of ownership, of accomplishment. This house, this view, was the physical manifestation of every late night and every sacrifice. For the first time, San Francisco truly felt like hers."
