Raised in suburban Ohio by a stoic civil engineer father and a meticulously organized librarian mother, his childhood was a quiet landscape of logic puzzles and science fiction novels. He was built for academia, a path that led him to a PhD program in computational astrophysics. For years, David found solace in modeling the chaotic dance of distant galaxies, a pure intellectual pursuit far removed from earthly concerns.\n\nThe turning point came during a bleak academic job market in the late 2000s. A friend, already swept up in the Bay Area\u2019s tech boom, pointed out that David\u2019s skills in modeling complex systems were exactly what emerging tech companies were desperate for. The idea of applying his models to human behavior instead of celestial bodies felt like a compromise, but a lucrative one. He left his PhD program with a master's degree, trading the midwestern sky for the promise of San Francisco.\n\nHe arrived and thrived professionally, his analytical mind perfectly suited for the burgeoning field of data science. He ascended the ranks, becoming a Principal Data Scientist who could find elegant patterns in messy, human-generated data. His life was the commuter train, the open-plan office, and late-night ramen with colleagues.\n\nThen, the pandemic rewrote his routine. The mandatory work-from-home order was a revelation. The constant churn of the office disappeared, replaced by the quiet focus of his Inner Richmond apartment. He discovered he was more productive, less stressed, and happier. When his company adopted a permanent remote-first policy, David sold his car and embraced the 0.0-mile commute.\n\nNow, David\u2019s San Francisco is a hyperlocal one. His days are structured: pour-over coffee, a deep-work session analyzing user telemetry, and a long afternoon walk through the fog-dusted trails of Golden Gate Park, which he considers his backyard. His social life is small but meaningful: a weekly Dungeons & Dragons campaign with other tech veterans and occasional dinners with a few trusted friends.\n\nWhile financially secure, David feels a growing pull back toward the stars. He dreams of using his savings not for a flashier condo, but to build a small, private observatory somewhere far from the city\u2019s light pollution. His greatest aspiration is to once again point a telescope at the sky and analyze data not for profit, but for the simple, profound joy of pure discovery."

It sounded so mundane, so terrestrial. Staring at a beautiful, useless simulation of galactic collisions on his screen, David felt a pang of intellectual grief. But then came the offer\u2019s undeniable logic\u2014a clear path, a salary. He agreed, feeling the weight of a necessary compromise. It was the moment he traded the cosmos for the cloud, a calculation that would define his next decade.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in a SoMa ramen shop around 2014, his team buzzing after shipping a new feature. He felt the electric camaraderie, the shared victory of their late-night coding sessions. But as his colleagues celebrated optimizing ad revenue by 0.8%, he felt a sudden, hollow echo. He was an expert at finding patterns, yet the pattern of his own life\u2014work, commute, ramen, repeat\u2014felt profoundly empty. This fleeting, drunken success wasn't the same as discovering a new truth about the universe. It was the first clear sign he was on the wrong trajectory.\n\n3.\nThe first Monday of the lockdown in March 2020 was the turning point. The usual roar of the N-Judah train was gone, replaced by the hum of his espresso machine. In the profound silence of his Inner Richmond apartment, a coding problem that had eluded him for weeks clicked into place before 10 AM. He realized the constant churn of the office wasn't a feature but a bug in his own operating system. It was a dizzying sense of relief, the feeling of finally finding a signal in the noise of his own life.\n\n4.\nOn a foggy afternoon in 2021, he took an unfamiliar trail in Golden Gate Park and found the Dutch Windmill. He stood there, watching the fog wrap around its arms, the roar of the nearby ocean a constant, soothing presence. This wasn't a destination; it was a discovery. In that moment, the park ceased to be a place he visited and became his backyard\u2014a sprawling, living system he could explore and understand. Selling his car had untethered him, but this place, this feeling, had anchored him completely.\n\n5.\nHe saw the NEOWISE comet from a pullout on the Marin Headlands in July 2020. Through his binoculars, the wisp of cosmic dust was sharp against the velvet black. It wasn\u2019t data to be analyzed for profit; it was simply, magnificently *there*. A visceral ache of longing hit him\u2014a feeling he hadn't truly felt since graduate school. The abstract dream of an observatory suddenly became a concrete plan. He wasn\u2019t just running from the city anymore; he was finally building a path back to the stars."
