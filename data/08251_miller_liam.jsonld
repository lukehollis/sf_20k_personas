The son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District. His parents, who ran a small, bustling dry-cleaning business, preached the gospel of stability. They had hoped for a doctor, but Liam, a quiet and observant boy, recoiled from the pressure and chaos of patient interaction. He was never a standout student, but he possessed a deep, methodical patience that often went unnoticed.\n\nHis turning point came in a biology class at City College of San Francisco. While his peers groaned through lectures, Liam was captivated by the cellular world under the microscope\u2014a universe of intricate, predictable order. It was here he found his calling. He earned an Associate's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology, a practical path that satisfied his parents' desire for a career in healthcare while allowing him to work within his comfort zone.\n\nUpon graduating, he landed a coveted lab technician position at a UCSF research facility. To simplify his life, he moved into one of the campus-affiliated apartments, reducing his commute to a five-minute walk across a manicured plaza. For the past decade, this has been his reality. His days are a rhythm of running diagnostics, preparing slides, and calibrating sensitive equipment. He is good at his job, valued for his precision and reliability.\n\nLiam\u2019s social life is minimal, orbiting his work. He shares polite lunches with colleagues and occasionally joins them for a happy hour, but he mostly retreats to his solitary world after hours. His evenings are spent with complex video games, meticulously assembling Gundam model kits, and watching historical documentaries. A relationship a few years ago ended when his girlfriend grew tired of his predictable routine, a heartbreak that only reinforced his insular tendencies.\n\nHis San Francisco is not the vibrant, chaotic city of tourists, but a quiet, functional enclave. Yet, he harbors a quiet dream. Pinned to a corkboard above his desk is a picture of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove in Kyoto. He hopes to one day break his routine, save enough money, and travel to a place whose beauty he imagines is as serene and orderly as the microscopic world he navigates every day."
