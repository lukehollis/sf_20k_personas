            "value": "Meilin Cohen\u2019s name has always been a conversation starter, a perfect summary of her upbringing in a Berkeley home filled with the scent of both brisket and jasmine tea. The only child of a pragmatic Jewish-American history professor and a fiercely passionate immigrant calligrapher from Shanghai, Meilin grew up navigating two rich cultural worlds. She inherited her father\u2019s methodical mind and her mother\u2019s deep reverence for art, a duality that would define her life.\n\nWhile her heart was in the art world, her father\u2019s influence guided her toward a more stable path. She initially pursued an undergraduate degree in economics, but found the corporate world sterile. The turning point came during a post-college trip to Taipei, where she was mesmerized by the complex logistics of a traveling museum exhibit. It was a revelation: she could serve the art without being an artist. She returned to the U.S. and earned an MBA, specializing in non-profit management. This led her to San Francisco and a junior role at SFMOMA, where she quickly proved her genius for untangling the complex webs of international shipping, insurance, and installation for large-scale exhibitions.\n\nNow fifty, Meilin is the Logistics Director for a consortium of major Bay Area galleries. Her life and work are seamlessly integrated. Following a divorce a decade ago, she moved into a spacious SoMa loft, a minimalist space of concrete floors and white walls that doubles as her command center. With a 0.0-mile commute, her days consist of calls to shipping agents in Berlin, video conferences with artists in Mexico City, and meticulously planned timelines on massive monitors. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of curators and art handlers who appreciate her ability to make the impossible happen.\n\nThough successful, Meilin feels a pull toward creating a more personal legacy. She dreams of establishing a grant for emerging AAPI artists, a tribute to her late mother\u2019s struggles and talent. She finds peace in the quiet moments\u2014walking through the de Young sculpture garden on a foggy morning or enjoying a bowl of noodles in a Clement Street dive\u2014feeling deeply connected to the city she helps fill with beauty, one masterpiece at a time."
