Raised in a Sacramento subdivision by a high school history teacher father and a dental hygienist mother, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and saturated with the expectation of a practical career path. Liam, however, was always more interested in the \"why\" than the \"how.\" He was the kid who dismantled the family VCR not to see how it worked, but to understand the design choices behind its buttons.\n\nThis fascination with systems led him to UC Davis, where he sidestepped computer science for a degree in Economics. He was captivated by behavioral economics\u2014the irrational, messy, and deeply human logic that drives markets. A key turning point was a junior year internship at a major tech firm. While his peers coded, Liam used economic models to predict user engagement with stunning accuracy. He wasn't building the product; he was explaining the people who used it. The company offered him a full-time research analyst position before he even had his diploma.\n\nNow, at 24, his life is a study in digital-age contrasts. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bed to a standing desk in the corner of his small, tidy apartment in the Haight-Ashbury. His days are a blur of data sets, trend reports, and Zoom calls, deciphering the digital footprints of millions. To escape the screen, he\u2019s cultivated a strict routine: a morning run through the Panhandle, a ritualistic afternoon walk in Golden Gate Park, and weekly trivia at a dive bar with a small, tight-knit group of college friends.\n\nThough he feels a constant, low-grade sense of imposter syndrome among hardcore engineers, Liam dreams of carving out his own niche. He aspires to become a leading voice on the human impact of technology, perhaps by starting a widely read newsletter or writing a book. His connection to San Francisco is less about the city\u2019s grand landmarks and more about his hyperlocal existence\u2014the familiar faces at his local coffee shop, the precise route of his daily walk, the hum of the N-Judah. He came to San Francisco for the future, but he\u2019s found his footing by building a life of deliberate, analog routines."
