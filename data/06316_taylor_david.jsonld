Raised in a neat suburb of Naperville, Illinois, he was the son of a high school history teacher and a CPA. His childhood was stable and predictable, steeped in Midwestern sensibilities of hard work and practicality. He absorbed his father\u2019s love for the grand-sweeping narratives of the past and his mother\u2019s knack for orderly balance sheets.\n\nHis educational journey reflected this duality. At the University of Illinois, David majored in History, losing himself in the complexities of the Byzantine Empire and the economic collapses of the 20th century. However, graduating into a lukewarm job market, he pivoted, taking an entry-level job at a Chicago investment firm his mother\u2019s acquaintance recommended. He discovered an innate talent for seeing patterns in market data, a skill not unlike tracing timelines through history. The work was demanding but clear-cut, and the financial security it offered was a powerful lure.\n\nFive years ago, a promotion brought him to his firm\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. The move was a key turning point. Initially just a career step, the city itself captivated him. The dramatic topography and the proximity to the wild coast were a world away from the flatlands of his youth. When the pandemic normalized remote work, David embraced it fully, trading an office commute for a 0.0-mile walk from his bed to his desk in his sleek Hayes Valley apartment.\n\nHis current life is one of disciplined routine. Mornings begin with a run through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park, the cool fog a welcome companion. The rest of his day is consumed by spreadsheets and market analysis, a world of numbers that feels both secure and strangely detached from the vibrant city outside his window. His social life is small but meaningful, centered around a few friends from a running club and the familiar bartender at a nearby natural wine bar.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to reconcile his two selves. He\u2019s successful but unfulfilled, the history major still alive beneath the analyst\u2019s tailored shirt. He spends his evenings reading historical non-fiction and fantasizes about using his financial acumen for something more tangible\u2014perhaps impact investing or consulting for a historical preservation non-profit. For now, he remains in his quiet apartment, a man who analyzes the future by day while contemplating how to reconnect with the past."
