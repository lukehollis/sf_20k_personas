Raised in Richmond, his father was a union carpenter and his mother a bookkeeper, both espousing the value of a steady hand and a sharp eye over academic accolades. David was a middling student, not because he lacked intellect, but because the rigid structure of school bored him. He was captivated by systems and patterns, spending hours mapping bus routes or tracking player statistics for fantasy baseball, finding a narrative in the raw data that his textbooks lacked.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was his turning point. At 21, he watched his parents lose a significant portion of their retirement savings to financial instruments they couldn't comprehend. This ignited a fire in him\u2014not of anger, but of fierce curiosity. He decided he would master the system that had humbled his family. Forgoing college, he took a data entry job at a small downtown investment firm. By day, he did monotonous work; by night, he devoured books on market theory, taught himself Python for algorithmic trading, and ran endless simulations on his home computer. His superiors eventually noticed the uncanny accuracy of the market predictions he\u2019d leave on his desk. He was promoted, not for a degree, but for his raw, demonstrable talent.\n\nNow 37, David is a successful financial analyst who works entirely from his Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute offers a structured, monastic lifestyle. His day begins with a 6 AM run through the quiet streets, followed by coffee from the same local cafe where the baristas know his order. From market open to close, his focus is absolute, a world distilled into three glowing monitors.\n\nSocially, David maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends from a rock-climbing gym, his one non-digital escape. He is single but not searching, content with his disciplined routine. His connection to San Francisco is deeply hyperlocal; he knows the merchants on his block better than the city\u2019s landmarks. His dream isn\u2019t a bigger salary, but to one day start a small, transparent investment fund for people like his parents\u2014people who deserve to see their hard work secured, not gambled away by systems designed to confuse them. He wants to finally turn the complex patterns he loves into a source of stability for others."
