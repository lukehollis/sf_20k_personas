Raised in the meticulously planned suburbs of Fremont, she is the only child of Indian immigrants who equated success with a stable career in tech or medicine. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, an accountant, provided a life of comfort and clear expectations. For them, art was a hobby, not a livelihood.\n\nPriya, however, found her true language in the hushed halls of museums. A high school trip to SFMOMA was her turning point; standing before a vast, challenging abstract piece, she felt a sense of belonging that her calculus homework never provided. To appease her parents, she pursued a Bachelor's in Communications at UC Davis, a practical degree they believed would lead to a corporate marketing job. Priya, however, saw it as a tool. She learned how to craft a narrative, not for a product, but for a piece of art.\n\nUpon graduating, she made her definitive break, turning down a marketing internship in Silicon Valley for a low-paying gallery assistant position in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. The move was a declaration of independence. Her world shrank to a few vibrant blocks, facilitated by her 0.0-mile commute. She lives in a small converted loft directly above the avant-garde gallery where she works. Her mornings begin not with an alarm, but with the faint scent of floor polish and the sound of the gallery owner preparing for the day below.\n\nHer daily routine is a blend of mundane administration\u2014updating inventory, answering emails\u2014and moments of pure transcendence when she\u2019s alone with the art before the doors open. Her social life is woven into her work; evenings are spent at other gallery openings, sharing cheap wine with struggling painters and sculptors who have become her found family. Priya dreams of becoming a curator, of having the influence to champion emerging artists, especially women of color whose stories are often overlooked. While the financial strain is constant and her parents\u2019 disappointment still stings, all it takes is the thrill of a new exhibition installation to reaffirm her path. In the quiet chaos of the city\u2019s art scene, Priya is slowly, painstakingly, curating her own life."
