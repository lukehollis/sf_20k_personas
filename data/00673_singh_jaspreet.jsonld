Born in Yuba City to Punjabi immigrants, his childhood was a landscape of farmland and the tight-knit Sikh community. His parents, who sacrificed everything for their children\u2019s future, envisioned a stable path for their eldest son: a respectable degree, a secure corporate job, a life far from the physical toil they knew. Jaspreet obliged, earning a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration and landing a sterile analyst role in Sacramento. He lasted two years before the beige cubicle walls felt like they were closing in.\n\nThe turning point was a weekend trip to San Francisco. He was captivated by the city's chaotic energy, particularly the electric atmosphere of its restaurants. It was a world of controlled fire, artistry, and immediate human connection\u2014everything his office life lacked. Against his parents\u2019 wishes, he quit his job, moved to the city, and started at the bottom as a busser in a Financial District eatery.\n\nHe absorbed everything, his business degree providing an unexpected edge in understanding operations and efficiency. He moved from serving to bartending, eventually catching the eye of a renowned chef opening a new modern Indian-Californian concept in Hayes Valley. Impressed by Jaspreet\u2019s relentless work ethic and intuitive grasp of hospitality, she hired him as front-of-house manager.\n\nNow, at 31, Jaspreet\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. His 0.0-mile commute is from his small apartment directly above the restaurant. His days are a marathon of inventory checks, staff scheduling, greeting regulars, and putting out the inevitable fires of a dinner rush. His social life consists of late-night drinks with his chef and sous-chef, debating new menu items.\n\nThough dedicated, he feels the isolation of his singular focus. Relationships are fleeting, often fizzling out under the demands of his schedule. His deepest connection is to the restaurant itself and the dream it fuels: to one day open his own place. He envisions a small, intimate restaurant that reinterprets the Punjabi food of his youth for a new generation, a legacy that would finally make his parents proud, but on his own terms. His San Francisco is not one of landmarks, but of purveyors, loyal patrons, and the rhythm of a kitchen, all within walking distance of home."
