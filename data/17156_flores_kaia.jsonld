Growing up in Daly City, she was the daughter of a pragmatic Filipina-American mother who worked as a meticulous seamstress and a creative Mexican-American father, a graphic designer with a love for bold murals. Her childhood home was a collage of her two worlds: the scent of adobo mingling with the bright aesthetics of Dia de Los Muertos art, her mother\u2019s precise patterns laid out next to her father\u2019s expressive sketches. This fusion instilled in Kaia an innate understanding of how color, texture, and form could tell a story.\n\nChoosing San Francisco State University for its Fashion Merchandising program felt like a natural homecoming. To support herself, she landed a part-time job at Aster & Loom, a chic boutique in Hayes Valley. She wasn't just folding sweaters; she was absorbing everything\u2014customer psychology, inventory management, the intuitive art of visual display. Her passion and sharp eye did not go unnoticed. The owner, seeing her potential, mentored her. The turning point came a year after graduation when she was promoted to Manager and Assistant Buyer. Suddenly, her trend forecasts and designer scouting trips were shaping the store's entire identity.\n\nNow at 26, Kaia\u2019s life is a carefully curated rhythm. She lives in a modest but sunny one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, where Golden Gate Park serves as her sprawling backyard. Her daily 2.8-mile commute on the MUNI bus is her quiet time, a space to scroll through emerging designers on Instagram or listen to business podcasts. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of college friends, often meeting for pho on Clement Street or drinks after work. A recent, amicable breakup has shifted her focus inward, reinforcing her independence and drive.\n\nKaia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She loves the city's celebration of individuality, which mirrors her own work. Her ultimate dream is to open her own boutique, a space that champions independent, POC designers and reflects the multiracial heritage that is the very fabric of her identity. For now, she thrives on the thrill of discovering a new talent, knowing that each piece she chooses for the shop is another thread in the beautiful, complex story she continues to weave for herself in the city by the bay."

On one side, her mother\u2019s sharp pins held a delicate pi\u00f1a silk pattern in place; on the other, her father\u2019s markers bled brilliant color into a sketch of a joyous calavera. Kaia picked up a discarded fabric scrap and a red marker, drawing a bold line across the woven texture. In that moment, she felt the click of understanding: the beauty wasn't in choosing one world, but in weaving them together. This became the foundational stitch of her identity.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, terrified and folding sweaters at Aster & Loom, she watched the owner struggle with a window display. \u201cWhat do you think, Kaia?\u201d The question was a shock. Heart thudding, Kaia recalled her father\u2019s lessons on color theory and hesitantly suggested a more dramatic, high-contrast arrangement. The owner\u2019s approving nod felt like a key turning in a lock she hadn\u2019t known was there. It was the first time her innate perspective felt not just seen, but valuable, transforming her self-doubt into a quiet, budding confidence.\n\n3.\nThe promotion didn\u2019t happen in an office. It happened over lattes at a cafe in Hayes Valley when she was 23. Her boss slid an envelope across the table. It wasn\u2019t a bonus; it was a plane ticket to a trade show in Los Angeles. \u201cYou\u2019re the Assistant Buyer now. Go find us something amazing.\u201d The weight of the ticket in her hand felt heavier than any textbook. The fear was electric, but the trust her mentor showed her was profound, cementing her ambition to not just follow trends, but to create them.\n\n4.\nHer first night in the Inner Richmond apartment, just after the breakup last year, was foggy and quiet. She walked down Clement Street, the keys to her own place a solid weight in her coat pocket. The neon glow of a Filipino restaurant sign cut through the grey, and she bought a container of hot pho. Back in her empty, sun-starved living room, the comforting taste felt like a profound declaration of self-reliance. She was home, entirely on her own terms, and the feeling was more grounding than heartbreaking.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, sitting on a blanket in Golden Gate Park, she saw it on Instagram: a jacket by a Berkeley designer that fused the structure of a Barong Tagalog with the raw edges of modern denim. It was a jolt, a physical echo of her own heart. It was the art she\u2019d seen in her childhood home made real and wearable. Without hesitating, she typed a direct message, her thumbs flying. This was it. This was the work she was meant to champion. Her dream sharpened from a vague hope into a clear, tangible mission."
