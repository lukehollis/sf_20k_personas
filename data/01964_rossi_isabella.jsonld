Born and raised in North Beach, her childhood was a cacophony of clanging cable car bells and the aromatic blend of garlic and espresso from her family\u2019s small, third-generation delicatessen. Surrounded by history, she developed a love for the past, which led her to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Art History at SF State, dreaming of a curator position at a prestigious museum.\n\nHer post-college reality, however, was less romantic. She landed a job as an administrative assistant at a sleek, minimalist art gallery in SoMa. The work was sterile, the environment isolating. The turning point came during a volunteer day at a local family shelter. Tasked with watching the children, she found herself captivated not by a static painting, but by the messy, vibrant, and joyful chaos of toddlers discovering finger paints. In that moment, she realized she craved connection, not collection. She quit her gallery job, enrolled in an early childhood education credential program, and never looked back.\n\nNow, at 39, Isabella\u2019s world is intentionally small and deeply fulfilling. She is a beloved preschool teacher in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she chose for its family-oriented feel and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her zero-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of stairs; her apartment sits directly above the small, independent preschool where she works. Her days are a whirlwind of storytelling, mediating disputes over toy blocks, and wiping away tears.\n\nIsabella is single but surrounded by community\u2014the parents who greet her warmly, her fellow teachers, and her own family, who she sees every Sunday for dinner. Her life isn't defined by grand ambitions but by quiet purpose. Her dream is to one day open her own small, art-focused preschool, a place that blends her two great loves. For now, she finds profound joy in her corner of the city, nurturing the next generation of San Franciscans just a few miles, but a world away, from where her own story began."
