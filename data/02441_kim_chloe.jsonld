Raised in the tranquil, sun-drenched suburbs of the East Bay, she is the only child of Korean immigrants who built a successful accounting firm on principles of pragmatism and security. From a young age, Chloe was steered toward a stable career in finance or law, a path she began to follow dutifully.\n\nHer turning point came not with a bang, but with the hushed reverence of a museum gallery. During her sophomore year at UC Berkeley, where she was an undeclared business major, a mandatory art history class unexpectedly captivated her. The stories embedded in sculpture and the societal shifts captured on canvas felt more significant than any stock market trend. Against her parents\u2019 gentle but persistent protests, she declared her major in Art History, a decision that felt like claiming her own identity for the first time.\n\nUpon graduating, Chloe\u2019s passion and sharp eye landed her a coveted position as a Curatorial Assistant at a small but influential contemporary art gallery in Hayes Valley. The job was the perfect excuse to move into the city proper. She found a small, charming in-law unit attached to a Victorian just a few blocks from work, making her commute a pleasant 0.0-mile walk. Her life is now deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Mornings begin with an oat milk latte from a local roaster, and evenings are often spent attending exhibition openings or simply reading in Patricia\u2019s Green.\n\nHer social life revolves around a small, close-knit circle of fellow arts professionals and a couple of old college friends who work in the booming tech sector, providing a stark but amusing contrast. While her parents still worry about her modest income, they are slowly beginning to understand her fulfillment. Chloe\u2019s dream is to rise to the level of Curator, creating shows that amplify the voices of emerging Asian-American artists. She envisions a future where she can bridge the world of her heritage with the contemporary art scene she so deeply loves, proving that a life built on passion can be just as successful as one built on practicality."
