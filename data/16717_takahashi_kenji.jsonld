Raised in Sacramento by Nisei (second-generation) parents, he grew up in a household where emotional expression was a private affair. His father, a meticulous landscape gardener, and his mother, a detail-oriented seamstress, instilled in him a powerful work ethic but offered few tools for navigating complex feelings. The turning point came during his college years at UC Davis when his grandmother\u2019s struggle with Alzheimer's disease exposed the cracks in the healthcare system, particularly the lack of culturally competent care for elderly Japanese Americans. Witnessing his family\u2019s stoic suffering ignited a purpose in him.\n\nHe pivoted from a biology major to social work, earning his MSW from San Francisco State University. His early career was spent in Japantown, working for a nonprofit that supported aging residents, directly addressing the gap he had observed in his own family. After a decade, seeking to broaden his impact, Kenji transitioned into educational services. He now works as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for the city\u2019s public school district, stationed at a high school where he helps teenagers navigate everything from academic pressure and identity issues to family trauma and poverty.\n\nKenji lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with his wife, Elena, a public-school teacher, and their 10-year-old daughter, Maya. His 2.5-mile commute on the 5R Fulton bus is a sacred time for decompression, a buffer between the intense emotional needs of his students and the warmth of his family life. Weekends are for their neighborhood: strolls through Golden Gate Park, grabbing dim sum on Clement Street, and taking Maya to the Cal Academy.\n\nDeeply connected to the city\u2019s history and its evolving challenges, Kenji\u2019s aspirations are not material. He dreams of a San Francisco where mental health support is as fundamental as infrastructure. On a personal level, he hopes to one day open a small private practice focused on intergenerational trauma within the AAPI community. For now, he finds solace in his family, his community, and the quiet hours he spends at a local pottery studio, shaping clay into something balanced and whole."

He watched her shrink, her confusion masked by a lifetime of polite nodding. In that cold, clinical moment of ignored dignity, Kenji felt a hot, unfamiliar anger. It wasn\u2019t about biology anymore; it was about the space between people, the words unsaid and unheard. It was the moment he knew he had to change his major. He had to learn how to bridge that silence.\n\n2.\nHe was barely a year out of his MSW program. Mrs. Tanaka, an Issei widow who lived alone in a Japantown SRO, sat across from him, a stack of incomprehensible Medicare forms on the desk. He spent two hours slowly translating, using the formal Japanese his parents had taught him. When they finished, she placed her frail, wrinkled hand on his and said *\u201cArigatou.\u201d* It wasn't just thanks for the paperwork; it was a profound acknowledgment. For the first time, he felt he was mending the exact fissure he\u2019d witnessed in his own family.\n\n3.\nMaya, then seven, had dropped her favorite clay bird, shattering it on their hardwood floor. Her wail was immense, a storm in their small living room. His first instinct, inherited from his own quiet upbringing, was to say \u201cIt\u2019s just a toy.\u201d Instead, he knelt down. \u201cYou're so sad and angry it broke,\u201d he said softly. She collapsed into his arms, sobbing. In that hug, he felt a generational levy break. He wasn't just comforting his daughter; he was giving her a language for her feelings he\u2019d never had.\n\n4.\nOne afternoon, rattling home on the 5R Fulton, he saw a teenager with headphones ignoring his grandmother, who was trying to tell him a story in Cantonese. The boy\u2019s dismissive sigh was loaded with an impatience Kenji recognized in himself. The grandmother\u2019s silence that followed was devastatingly familiar. He realized then he was only treating the symptom\u2014the isolated elder. The wound was relational, passed down. He knew he had to move upstream, to work with kids before the silence between generations became permanent.\n\n5.\nThe intake session with a new student had been brutal, a story of family neglect that mirrored traumas he knew too well. He left school feeling frayed, his own history vibrating under his skin. That night at the pottery studio, he slammed the cold clay onto the wheel. As his hands worked to center the wobbling mound, he felt his own breathing steady. The rhythmic pressure, the focus, the physical act of creation\u2014it was a therapy without words. He understood that this was the quiet, tangible healing he hoped to offer others someday."
