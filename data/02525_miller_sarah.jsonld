Raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a practical teacher and an accountant, Sarah was taught the value of stability and diligence. Her rebellious act was pursuing a Master of Library and Information Science at UC Berkeley, a degree fueled by a romantic love for the organized silence of archives and the tangible history of books.\n\nUpon graduating in the late 90s, however, she found the Bay Area\u2019s librarian salaries couldn\u2019t compete with its soaring cost of living. On a whim, she took a temp job as a records manager at a small financial firm. Her talent for creating order from chaos was immediately apparent. The intricate systems of finance, she discovered, were not so different from the Dewey Decimal System, just with higher stakes. One promotion led to another, and the accidental career became a permanent one. She navigated the dot-com bust by being indispensable, the calm operator who kept the back office running while traders panicked. A marriage in her late thirties ended amicably a decade later, leaving her with a well-appointed Noe Valley condo and an even deeper devotion to her work.\n\nNow, at 52, her world is contained within the walls of that condo. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to her home office, where she manages global operations teams via Zoom. Her daily routine is a metronome of precision: a 6 AM espresso, market checks with London, afternoon calls with her team in Asia, and a solitary late-afternoon walk through the steep neighborhood streets. She observes San Francisco more than she lives in it\u2014watching the fog consume Twin Peaks from her window, appreciating the Victorian architecture on her prescribed route.\n\nLately, a quiet yearning has returned. Her financial success feels like a gilded cage she diligently built for herself. Her hope is no longer for another promotion, but for reconnection. She has started volunteering on Saturdays at a small historical society, cataloging brittle photographs of the city she fell in love with decades ago. Sarah\u2019s dream is to one day apply her hard-won operational expertise not to maximizing profit, but to preserving the past\u2014auditing a life less pragmatic, and far more meaningful."
