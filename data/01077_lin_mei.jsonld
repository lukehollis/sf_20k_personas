The only child of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up in the back of her parents' small grocery store. Her world was defined by the L Taraval line, the roar of the ocean, and the unspoken pressure to achieve a stability her parents never had. While they saw success in a steady job and a paid-off mortgage, Mei saw the limitations of their car-dependent life\u2014the hours her father lost commuting to restaurant supply warehouses, the isolation her aging mother felt when she could no longer drive.\n\nThis observation became the seed of her career. After earning a practical undergraduate degree, she pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, fascinating her parents who couldn't understand her obsession with bus routes and zoning codes. For Mei, it was a calling. She wanted to build cities for people, not just for cars. She took a transportation planner position with the city of San Francisco, seeing it as the ultimate puzzle.\n\nAt 39, Mei has curated a life that is a direct reflection of her professional principles. She lives in a modest apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that places her a mere three-block walk from her office in the Civic Center. Her 0.0-mile commute is both a personal luxury and a professional statement. Her days start with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, nodding to the same group of neighbors, before immersing herself in the complex web of MUNI lines, bike lane proposals, and traffic flow data that is her work.\n\nSocially, Mei maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a public defender, a non-profit director, and a landscape architect\u2014who share her civic-minded view of the world. They meet for drinks in their neighborhood, debating city politics and sharing frustrations and triumphs. Her dream isn\u2019t grand or flashy; it\u2019s to see a project she championed, like a genuinely rapid bus corridor on a major street, come to fruition and tangibly improve thousands of daily commutes. She wants to grow old in a San Francisco that is more accessible, equitable, and walkable than the one she first knew, a city she actively helped to shape."
