The only child of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up in the back of her parents' small grocery store. Her world was defined by the L Taraval line, the roar of the ocean, and the unspoken pressure to achieve a stability her parents never had. While they saw success in a steady job and a paid-off mortgage, Mei saw the limitations of their car-dependent life\u2014the hours her father lost commuting to restaurant supply warehouses, the isolation her aging mother felt when she could no longer drive.\n\nThis observation became the seed of her career. After earning a practical undergraduate degree, she pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, fascinating her parents who couldn't understand her obsession with bus routes and zoning codes. For Mei, it was a calling. She wanted to build cities for people, not just for cars. She took a transportation planner position with the city of San Francisco, seeing it as the ultimate puzzle.\n\nAt 39, Mei has curated a life that is a direct reflection of her professional principles. She lives in a modest apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that places her a mere three-block walk from her office in the Civic Center. Her 0.0-mile commute is both a personal luxury and a professional statement. Her days start with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, nodding to the same group of neighbors, before immersing herself in the complex web of MUNI lines, bike lane proposals, and traffic flow data that is her work.\n\nSocially, Mei maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a public defender, a non-profit director, and a landscape architect\u2014who share her civic-minded view of the world. They meet for drinks in their neighborhood, debating city politics and sharing frustrations and triumphs. Her dream isn\u2019t grand or flashy; it\u2019s to see a project she championed, like a genuinely rapid bus corridor on a major street, come to fruition and tangibly improve thousands of daily commutes. She wants to grow old in a San Francisco that is more accessible, equitable, and walkable than the one she first knew, a city she actively helped to shape."

The MUNI was too slow, and her mother no longer drove on the freeway. That day, Mei didn't just see her mother's loneliness; she saw the city as a cage built of distance and inconvenience. It was a quiet, sharp pang of anger, not at her parents, but at the gridlock that isolated them. This feeling became the foundation of her life's work, the moment a problem became a purpose.\n\n2.\nDuring her master's program, she tried explaining her thesis on transit-oriented development to her father over the phone. He didn\u2019t understand \"infill housing\" or \"zoning overlays.\u201d Frustrated, Mei finally said, \u201cBaba, I\u2019m studying how to build cities so men like you don\u2019t have to waste two hours a day in a truck just to get supplies.\u201d There was a long pause, then a quiet, \u201cAh.\u201d In his understanding, she felt the validation she craved\u2014not for her ambition, but for its heart.\n\n3.\nHer first big project proposal, a bus-only lane on Van Ness, was savaged in a public hearing. She stood stiffly in her practical blazer, listening to residents shout about parking, her data-filled binder feeling naive and useless. The defeat was crushing, a cold introduction to the political reality of her job. Walking home that night, disillusionment warred with a new, harder resolve. It wasn't enough to be right; she had to learn how to win the fight for a better city, block by block.\n\n4.\nOne Saturday, she walked from her Hayes Valley apartment to the farmers market, picking up coffee and a pastry on the way. She ran into her landscape architect friend, and they strolled back, debating a new parklet design. The entire morning unfolded within a ten-block radius, an effortless ballet of proximity. She thought of her mother, trapped in the Sunset fog. This simple, car-free morning felt like a quiet, profound victory\u2014the living embodiment of the principles she fought for every day at her desk.\n\n5.\nShe stood on a corner on Geary, an anonymous face in the crowd, and watched the first 38R bus sail past a line of stopped cars in the new red transit lane she\u2019d championed for two years. She saw a woman on the bus look up from her phone, a small, surprised smile on her face at their sudden speed. No one knew Mei was the reason, but in that passenger\u2019s smile, Mei felt an overwhelming, deeply personal pride. This was it\u2014the invisible, tangible improvement that fueled her entire existence."
