Born to a Filipina mother who filled their home with the scent of adobo and a third-generation Irish-American father with a love for Giants baseball, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was a vibrant fusion of cultures. She navigated the world with a quiet curiosity, feeling most at home in the city's diverse, neighborhood-centric pockets.\n\nAfter high school, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a degree in Art History. She dreamed of curating exhibits, of telling stories through forgotten paintings. However, her life veered sharply off course during her sophomore year when her mother was diagnosed with a fast-moving illness. Without a second thought, Sarah left school to become a full-time caregiver alongside her father. The two years that followed were a blur of hospital visits, quiet moments, and profound lessons in empathy and resilience.\n\nFollowing her mother\u2019s passing, a grieving Sarah needed an anchor. She found one unexpectedly at \"Little Sprouts Academy,\" a small preschool just two blocks from her father's house. Hired as a Teacher\u2019s Aide, she discovered a surprising passion in the chaotic, joyful world of three-year-olds. The work was demanding but deeply rewarding, providing a sense of purpose that her art history books never could.\n\nNow 26, Sarah\u2019s world is beautifully small. She lives in a modest in-law unit attached to the preschool, making her commute a simple walk across the playground. Her days are a symphony of finger painting, story time, and navigating the emotional landscapes of toddlers. Evenings are often spent sharing dinner with her father or exploring Golden Gate Park on her vintage bicycle. Her social circle is tight-knit, composed of a few childhood friends and fellow teachers.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream has shifted. The ambition for museum halls has been replaced by a new aspiration: she plans to return to CCSF part-time to earn her ECE certificate. Her ultimate goal is to one day open her own small, arts-integrated preschool in the Richmond, a place that honors her mother\u2019s nurturing spirit and her own rediscovered passion for creation."
