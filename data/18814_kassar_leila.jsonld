She was born and raised in the foggy Inner Richmond, the daughter of a Filipino mother, a nurse at UCSF, and a Lebanese-American father who ran a small corner market. Her childhood home was a vibrant fusion of aromas\u2014lumpia frying in the kitchen for family parties and the scent of za'atar from her father's pantry. This blend of heritages taught her early on that communication transcends language.\n\nThe turning point came during her teens. Her beloved *Lola* (grandmother) began to slip into the fog of dementia. Words became a labyrinth for her grandmother, but a shared sketchpad became a bridge. Leila discovered she could connect with her Lola through drawing, coaxing out memories and emotions that language could no longer access. This experience illuminated her path, leading her from a B.A. at SF State to a specialized graduate program in Art Therapy & Counseling.\n\nNow, as an Associate Art Therapist, Leila puts that lesson to use daily. Her 3.4-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus takes her from her quiet neighborhood to the varied communities she serves\u2014schools where she helps children process trauma and assisted living facilities where she works with elders battling isolation. Her days are a careful balance of absorbing others' pain and protecting her own peace. The $68,500 salary requires careful budgeting and life with two roommates in a classic Edwardian flat, but the fulfillment is immeasurable.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school, the only ones who truly understand the emotional weight of their shared profession. They decompress over cheap pho on Clement Street or with long walks through Golden Gate Park, where Leila is never without her own sketchbook. She finds solace in capturing the city's quiet moments. Leila\u2019s dream is to earn her full licensure and one day open a sliding-scale community art studio in the city that raised her. For Leila, art isn\u2019t just a career; it\u2019s the language of her heritage and the compassionate tool with which she helps others navigate their own complex inner worlds."

The air was a mix of her mother\u2019s garlic-heavy adobo wafting from their apartment upstairs and the earthy smell of the bulk lentils her father was teaching her to bag. In that moment, nestled between the scents of Lebanon and the Philippines, she felt a profound sense of completeness. It wasn\u2019t a collision of two worlds, but the creation of one, uniquely hers. This taught her that home wasn't a place, but a fusion of love.\n\n***\n\n2.\nShe remembers the weight of the silence with her Lola, a fog as thick as any on the Richmond streets. Leila was fifteen, frustrated and heartbroken by her grandmother\u2019s dementia. On a whim, she drew the stem of a sampaguita flower on a notepad. Her Lola, whose hands had trembled for months, picked up a pen and shakily drew a perfect, five-petaled blossom. Tears streamed down Leila\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t a cure, but it was a conversation\u2014a realization that art could speak when memory could not.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was her third month as an associate, working with a child who hadn't spoken about the fire. For weeks, his pages were just black and grey scribbles. Then one afternoon, without a word, he picked up a yellow crayon and drew a tiny, hesitant sun in the top corner of the page. Leila felt a jolt of pure, quiet hope. It was a pinprick of light in his darkness, and it affirmed that her path, first discovered with her Lola, was truly one of healing.\n\n***\n\n4.\nExhausted after a draining week, she sat with her friends at their usual Clement Street pho spot. No one spoke for the first ten minutes, the only sounds being the clatter of spoons and the slurping of noodles. Looking at their faces, reflected in the steamy windows, she didn\u2019t feel pressure to perform or explain. The shared silence was a balm, a mutual understanding of the emotional weight they all carried. It cemented for her that chosen family was the anchor that made her work possible.\n\n***\n\n5.\nThe 38-Geary bus rumbled down the avenue on a drizzly Tuesday. Through the rain-streaked window, Leila saw an elderly woman carefully fold a plastic bag and tuck it into her purse. It was a simple, unnoticed gesture. On her lap, Leila\u2019s pencil flew across the page, capturing the careful line of the woman\u2019s shoulders and the set of her hands. In that quick sketch, she found a moment of profound peace\u2014a reminder that her art wasn\u2019t just for her clients, but her own way of honoring the city's quiet stories."
