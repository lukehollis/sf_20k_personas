Raised in a quiet, tree-lined suburb of Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a pragmatic civil engineer and a high school literature teacher. Her childhood was filled with books, museum visits, and encouragement to follow her intellectual curiosity. This led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History, a field she adored for its blend of visual beauty, human stories, and meticulous research. She imagined a future surrounded by Renaissance masterpieces, working as a curator or academic.\n\nThe reality after graduation was a series of underpaid internships and a disillusioning job at a small, struggling art gallery. Faced with mounting student loans, Clara took a temp job as an office coordinator at a logistics startup, seeing it as a temporary detour to pay the bills. However, her new bosses quickly discovered her uncanny ability for organization and pattern recognition. The same skills she used to trace the provenance of a 16th-century painting were perfectly suited to tracking a global supply chain. She taught herself SQL and advanced data analysis on nights and weekends, impressing her superiors and carving out a new career path.\n\nThis unexpected success led her to a lucrative offer in San Francisco, and she moved into a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her apartment is both her office and her sanctuary. Her days are a structured rhythm of coffee, spreadsheets, and video calls, the Pacific fog often rolling past her window. To combat the WFH isolation, she forces herself out for a daily walk, getting pastries on Clement Street or running in the nearby Presidio. Her social life is tight-knit; a weekly trivia night with former colleagues and weekend hikes in Marin with a small group of friends form her core connections.\n\nAt 30, Clara feels stable but restless. She doesn\u2019t regret her career change, but a part of her mourns the art historian she left behind. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a way to merge her two worlds. She aspires to save enough for a six-month sabbatical to finally see the European art she only studied in textbooks, believing that true logistics is understanding the journey of things, whether it's a microchip from Taiwan or a Caravaggio from Rome."
