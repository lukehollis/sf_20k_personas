Raised in West Oakland, he is the son of a compassionate Black American nurse and a charismatic first-generation Dominican immigrant who ran a small auto shop. His childhood home was a hub of community, constantly filled with the sounds of bachata, the scent of his father\u2019s unbelievable sancocho, and the warmth of his mother\u2019s open-door policy for any neighbor in need. From a young age, Caleb learned that hospitality wasn't a service, but a way of life\u2014a way to create joy and belonging.\n\nThis innate understanding led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. To support himself, he took a job barbacking at a sleek, upscale lounge in Hayes Valley. It was there, amidst the clinking of shakers and the low hum of conversation, that he found his calling. He was fascinated by the craft of mixology\u2014the precise chemistry, the history behind each spirit, and the performance of creating a perfect cocktail. He quickly moved from barback to bartender, his natural charm and meticulous attention to detail earning him a loyal following.\n\nThe key turning point was his promotion to Lead Bartender at age 24. It was more than a title; it was validation that his passion could be a profession. Now 26, Caleb commands the bar program, creating seasonal menus and mentoring new staff. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant Latino culture reminds him of his father\u2019s heritage. His 3.1-mile commute on the Muni bus is a time for reflection, listening to podcasts about spirits or brainstorming new drink recipes.\n\nHis life is steady and full. He\u2019s in a serious relationship with Maya, a graphic designer he met when she came into his bar. Their days off are spent exploring Golden Gate Park or trying new restaurants. Caleb\u2019s dream is to one day open his own establishment: a small, intimate cocktail bar that fuses the rum-centric traditions of the Caribbean with California\u2019s farm-to-glass ethos. For him, it\u2019s the ultimate expression of his identity\u2014a place built on the foundation of welcome he learned in his Oakland home, refined by the craft he has mastered in San Francisco."

            "value": "1.\nAt ten years old, a winter storm knocked out the power in their West Oakland neighborhood. Instead of panic, his father lit candles and began ladling his famous sancocho for everyone huddled in their kitchen. The rich scent of cilantro and beef filled the small, dim room. In that moment, watching his father create a haven of warmth and community out of darkness, Caleb understood that hospitality was the ultimate act of care. It was a feeling he would chase for the rest of his life.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, a barback at the Hayes Valley lounge, polishing glasses on a frantic Saturday night. He stopped to watch the lead bartender craft a Sazerac. The ritual of the absinthe rinse, the methodical stir, the perfect lemon peel\u2014it silenced the noise of the bar. It was a performance, a history lesson, and chemistry all at once. In that instant, a simple job became a calling, and he felt a desperate, thrilling need to master that craft himself.\n\n3.\nThe night he was promoted to Lead Bartender at 24, his manager told him after the bar had closed. The room was quiet except for the hum of the ice machine. Hearing the words, he felt a profound stillness. It wasn\u2019t just about the title; it was validation. He thought of his father's calloused hands fixing engines and his mother\u2019s steady compassion. This, he realized, was his way of honoring them\u2014by building something of his own with skill and heart.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a Sunday in Golden Gate Park with Maya, a few months after they met. He was excitedly describing the grassy, funky notes of a new rhum agricole. She stopped sketching, looked at him, and said, \"You talk about spirits the way I think about color palettes.\" In her eyes, he didn't just see love; he saw genuine understanding. It was the moment he realized his world wasn't just his alone anymore\u2014it was something they could share and build together.\n\n5.\nRiding the 14 Mission bus home just after his 26th birthday, the bus passed a vibrant mural depicting scenes of Latino life. The thought struck him with the force of a physical jolt. He suddenly saw his dream bar: the rum of his father\u2019s island, the fresh ingredients from California farms, the welcome of his childhood home. It was a fusion of his commute, his heritage, and his craft. The dream finally had a form, a taste, and a place."
