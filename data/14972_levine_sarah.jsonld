Raised in a quiet Chicago suburb, she was the daughter of a methodical accountant father and a passionately curious librarian mother. Their home was a blend of spreadsheets and storybooks, a dichotomy that would define her future. The 2008 financial crisis was her crucible. She was a sophomore in college, watching the national news while hearing the whispered anxiety at her own dinner table as her father\u2019s clients panicked. The crisis wasn't an abstract economic event; it was a narrative of lives upended, and she was determined to learn how to tell it.\n\nThis conviction propelled her through Northwestern\u2019s Medill School of Journalism, where she pursued a graduate degree with a laser focus on financial reporting. She cut her teeth at a wire service in New York, reporting on the fallout from the very crisis that inspired her. But after five years, the lure of a new financial frontier\u2014tech\u2014pulled her west. She accepted a senior reporter position in San Francisco, trading Wall Street\u2019s old-money canyons for Silicon Valley\u2019s disruptive energy.\n\nNow 37, Sarah\u2019s life is anchored by a deliberate ritual. Her day begins before dawn in a small, light-filled house in Sausalito she shares with her partner, an architect named Ben. The 8.5-mile ferry ride across the bay is her sanctuary. With headphones on, watching the city skyline emerge from the fog, she mentally organizes the day\u2019s market data and potential stories. In the city, she is immersed in the frantic pace of breaking news, but the evening ferry returns her to the relative tranquility of Marin, where she and Ben hike the headlands or kayak in the bay.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is professional, but her sense of home is in Sausalito. Sarah finds the city a fascinating, chaotic subject to be observed, while her community offers genuine connection. Her ultimate aspiration is to write a book\u2014a deeply researched narrative exposing the human element behind the algorithmic trading and venture capital deals that now define the global economy. For Sarah, the goal remains the same as it was in college: to find the human story buried in the numbers."

He wasn\u2019t typing; he was just staring at a spreadsheet, his shoulders slumped. When she asked, he didn\u2019t talk about markets, but about the Klines, a family whose retirement had just vanished. Seeing her methodical father so shaken by the human cost behind the numbers wasn\u2019t a lesson in finance; it was the moment her life\u2019s question took root. That night, she stopped seeing spreadsheets and started seeing stories.\n\n2.\nIt was a cramped coffee shop in Queens, five years after the crash. She was interviewing a former Lehman analyst who now managed the shop. He spoke not of derivatives, but of the shame of telling his son they couldn\u2019t afford summer camp. He just looked at his hands, calloused from work he never imagined. For Sarah, then 26 and new to New York, the interview was a confirmation. She wasn't just a financial reporter; she was a translator for the wreckage, tasked with preserving the human footnotes of history.\n\n3.\nShe was 30, at a stale banking conference in New York. The presenters spoke of recovery in lifeless jargon, and she felt a sudden, suffocating sense of covering an epilogue. During a break, she read an article about a small San Francisco startup using code to upend lending practices. The founders\u2019 language was brash, arrogant, but alive with a vision for the future. In that moment, she realized she was tired of reporting on ghosts. She wanted to chase the new gods of money, for better or worse.\n\n4.\nAfter a brutal first week covering a chaotic tech IPO, she felt utterly depleted. On the ferry back to Sausalito, the city\u2019s frantic energy clung to her. Ben met her at the dock. He didn't ask about her day, just took her hand and led her on a silent hike up the headlands. As they watched the fog consume the distant skyline, she felt the city\u2019s noise finally release its grip. That was the moment San Francisco became her work, and this quiet shore with him became her home.\n\n5.\nIt was an interview last year with a reclusive genius who'd built a new trading algorithm. She expected pride. Instead, the young man was haunted. He described his own creation as a \u201chungry ghost,\u201d operating at speeds he couldn\u2019t comprehend, and confessed he had nightmares about the phantom wealth it created and destroyed. Hearing the creator\u2019s fear of his own creation\u2014that was it. The book wasn\u2019t just about victims; it was about the architects of this new world, terrified of the machinery they\u2019d unleashed."
