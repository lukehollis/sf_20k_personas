Born and raised in the Outer Sunset, she was the quiet, observant daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small, cluttered grocery store. Her childhood was a symphony of the rattling Muni bus, the clang of the shop bell, and her parents\u2019 constant reminders about the value of practical work. While they stocked shelves, Mei sketched in notebooks, dreaming of a more colorful world.\n\nThis artistic inclination led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Graphic Design from SF State. She loved the theory, the precision of typography, and the power of visual communication. After graduating, however, the reality of a freelance career was daunting. The instability and constant hustle clashed with the steady rhythm of commerce she\u2019d known her whole life. After two years of struggling to land consistent clients, a pragmatic pivot felt necessary. She took a job as a sales associate at a high-end apparel boutique in Hayes Valley, intending for it to be temporary.\n\nBut Mei discovered she had an innate talent for retail operations\u2014a skill inherited from her parents but refined with her designer\u2019s eye for detail. She understood inventory flow, visual merchandising, and managing staff with a calm authority. She rose quickly through the ranks, becoming the Retail Operations Manager within five years.\n\nThe most significant turning point was when the apartment above the boutique became available. Seeing an opportunity for ultimate efficiency, she took it. Her commute is now a single flight of stairs. Her life is a closed loop within a four-block radius of Hayes Valley. Her days begin with the scent of coffee from the cafe below and end with her locking the shop\u2019s gate, the final act before she\u2019s truly \u201chome.\u201d Her social life is woven into her work; her staff are her confidantes, and regulars are her neighbors.\n\nWhile content with her stability, Mei, at 37, feels a familiar creative restlessness. She channels her design skills into the store\u2019s window displays and marketing materials, but it\u2019s not enough. Her dream is to fuse her two worlds: to open her own small, curated shop in a quieter neighborhood like the Richmond, selling artisan home goods and local art. It would be a tribute to her parents\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit, but built on her own terms\u2014a space where practicality and beauty are no longer in conflict."
