            "value": "Caleb Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s quieter west side, a child of the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District. His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a bustling Cantonese bakery, their lives a testament to pragmatic hard work. They envisioned a secure future for Caleb, preferably one with \"M.D.\" after his name. But a fifth-grade field trip to the Asian Art Museum derailed their plans. Standing before a 1,000-year-old ceramic vase, Caleb felt a profound connection\u2014not just to his heritage, but to the power of an object to hold a story. It was a silent, pivotal moment.\n\nHis decision to pursue an undergraduate degree in Art History at SF State was met with weary resignation from his family. His graduate degree in Museum Studies, however, was an act of quiet rebellion. He chose his passion over the prescribed path, a decision that created a subtle but persistent rift. Landing his role as Assistant Curator at a prominent contemporary art museum near Yerba Buena was his vindication. At $82,000 a year, he wasn\u2019t wealthy by San Francisco standards, but he was self-sufficient, doing work that fulfilled him.\n\nNow 33, Caleb\u2019s life is a curated experience. He lives in a minimalist SoMa apartment, just a 0.8-mile walk from the museum. His daily routine is a cherished ritual: a pour-over coffee from a local cafe, a walk through the Yerba Buena Gardens, and then a day spent researching artists, writing exhibition text, and collaborating with a team that shares his vocabulary and vision. His social life revolves around the art world\u2014gallery openings, artist talks, and late-night discussions with friends over ramen. He is currently single, more invested in his professional development than romance.\n\nCaleb\u2019s connection to San Francisco is layered. He\u2019s a native who has watched the city transform, a bridge between the old-world bakeries of his youth and the glass-and-steel modernity of his daily life. His ultimate dream is to curate a landmark exhibition that re-examines the Asian-American experience through a contemporary lens, giving voice to a new generation of artists. It\u2019s his way of building on his parents' legacy\u2014not by following their path, but by honoring the stories they, and so many others, brought to this city."

It was more than old; it was a vessel of stories, of hands and dynasties he couldn't name but could feel. A silent conversation across a thousand years. His parents\u2019 aspirations for him blurred. In that moment, he didn\u2019t want to heal bodies; he wanted to preserve the souls of things. It was the quiet, indelible start of his true life.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the thick, sweet scent of egg tarts when he told them. He was 18, home from SF State, sitting at the small back table of the bakery. He confessed he was majoring in Art History. There was no shouting. Just his mother\u2019s hands pausing over the dough, and his father\u2019s long, weary sigh. Their disappointment was a physical weight in the floury air. He had chosen his passion, but in doing so, had laid the first stone in a wall separating their worlds from his.\n\n3.\nThe vinyl lettering was still being applied to the gallery wall. It was late, the museum quiet except for the squeak of the installer's tool. And then he saw it: *Exhibition text by Caleb Wong, Assistant Curator*. He was 29. He took a photo, the image slightly blurry. He never sent it to his parents, but in his heart, it was a telegram: *I\u2019m okay. I made it. My way.* That night, his SoMa apartment didn't feel small; it felt earned.\n\n4.\nHe saw them from across the lawn in Yerba Buena Gardens, just last year. His parents, looking small against the glass facade of the arts center. They\u2019d taken the bus downtown for a dim sum lunch. He waved, and they spoke for a few minutes, the conversation polite, stilted. They didn\u2019t understand his world of installations and concepts, and he no longer belonged to theirs of early mornings and wholesale flour. The love was there, but it existed across the green expanse\u2014a beautiful, unbridgeable distance.\n\n5.\nIt was last winter, in a drafty Dogpatch studio. He was visiting a young painter whose work pulsed with the chaotic energy of being third-generation. She spoke of her grandparents' journey not with nostalgia, but with a raw, questioning honesty. Looking at her canvases\u2014a mashup of traditional motifs and graffiti tags\u2014Caleb felt his personal ambition sharpen into a communal responsibility. His dream exhibition wasn't just for him, or even his parents' legacy. It was for her. It was for a new story that desperately needed a platform."
