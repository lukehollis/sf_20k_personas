A native San Franciscan born in the Excelsior to a Muni driver and a diner waitress, David grew up with a practical, hands-on view of the city. He was a bright but restless kid who found the confines of a classroom maddening. To his parents\u2019 dismay, he dropped out of high school at 17, trading textbooks for a toolbox and a job as a maintenance helper at the very building he now supervises.\n\nFormal education was never his path; his classroom was the building\u2019s labyrinthine network of pipes, wiring, and freight elevators. David possesses a sharp, intuitive intelligence for systems and spatial logic. Over 25 years, he quietly worked his way up from apprentice to Operations Supervisor, becoming the building's institutional memory. He knows every groan of the boiler and every ghost in the wiring. This singular focus, however, cost him his marriage a decade ago; his ex-wife grew tired of competing with his job, of literally living at his office. He rarely sees their daughter, who now lives in Oregon.\n\nDavid's daily routine is a quiet ritual. He\u2019s up before the sun, walking the perimeter and checking the previous night\u2019s security logs before the first tech startup tenants and artists begin their day. He is the quiet anchor of his vertical neighborhood, respected by all but truly known by few. He\u2019ll share a quick nod with a coder in the elevator or help an artist install a heavy sculpture, his social interactions woven into the fabric of his duties.\n\nThough he seems content in his managed world, David dreams of escape. Not a lavish one, but a small cabin near the Russian River, a place where nothing needs fixing and the only system is the changing of the seasons. More than that, he holds onto the quiet hope of one day reconnecting with his daughter, to show her the man he is outside the brick fortress he has built around his life."
