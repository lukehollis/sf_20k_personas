The son of a passionate Japanese ceramicist and a pragmatic third-generation Irish-American history professor, Kenji grew up in a quiet college town in Oregon. His childhood home was a study in contrasts: his mother\u2019s serene, minimalist pottery studio on one side, his father\u2019s chaotic, book-cluttered office on the other. This duality shaped his aesthetic\u2014a blend of Japanese wabi-sabi and clean, Western modernism. He learned to find beauty in imperfection and order in storytelling.\n\nDrawn to structure and narrative, Kenji pursued a Master of Architecture at UC Berkeley. He excelled, but found the corporate architecture path uninspiring. The turning point came during a graduate seminar where he designed a hypothetical museum exhibit on the internment of Japanese Americans. The project consumed him; he wasn't just designing a building, but crafting an emotional journey through space, light, and artifacts. He realized his calling was not to build structures for people to live in, but to create spaces that tell stories.\n\nNow 41, Kenji is one of the Bay Area\u2019s most sought-after freelance exhibition designers. His 0.0-mile commute is to the drafting table in his spacious Dogpatch live-work loft, a former warehouse with exposed brick and soaring ceilings. He works with institutions like SFMOMA and the Asian Art Museum, translating curatorial visions into immersive physical realities. His days are a methodical routine of digital modeling, material sourcing, and intense focus, often broken by long walks along the waterfront with his rescue dog, Kuma.\n\nHis social life is small and intentional, preferring intimate dinners with a close-knit circle of artists and academics over crowded parties. Kenji feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014a city that, like him, is a vibrant mix of cultures and histories. His quiet dream is to design a permanent exhibition for the Japanese American National Museum, a project that would honor his mother\u2019s heritage and his father\u2019s love for history, finally harmonizing the two halves of his own story."

Later, he saw them on his father\u2019s desk, arranged methodically like artifacts from a forgotten dig. In that moment, he saw how a broken thing could become a story, how his mother\u2019s art and his father\u2019s history could coexist on a single surface. It was his first unconscious lesson in curated imperfection, planting the seed for his entire aesthetic.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in the Berkeley architecture studio, the only light from his desk lamp. Kenji placed a tiny wooden figure inside his scale model of a Manzanar barrack. Suddenly, it wasn't just a project; it was a ghost story told in basswood and light. He felt the weight of his grandmother's unspoken history. That night, at 25, he stopped designing buildings and started designing memories, realizing that the most powerful narratives are told not with words, but with the careful manipulation of space.\n\n3.\nThree years after moving to San Francisco, Kenji brought Kuma home to the vast, empty Dogpatch loft. The rescue dog, scarred and timid, curled into a tight ball by the industrial windows. Kenji sat on the floor, not touching, just sharing the industrial silence. When Kuma finally rested his head on Kenji\u2019s knee, the cavernous space suddenly felt like a true home. At 32, he learned that companionship, like good design, was about creating a safe, intentional space for a damaged story to unfold.\n\n4.\nHe stood anonymously near the back during the opening of his first major exhibition at the Asian Art Museum. He watched a young man pause before a single, illuminated ink scroll, the low light creating an intimate, focused world just for him. The man\u2019s shoulders relaxed, his posture shifting from observer to participant. In that quiet moment of connection, Kenji felt a profound sense of purpose. At 38, he understood his job wasn't to be seen, but to help others truly see.\n\n5.\nOn a recent walk, Kenji stopped at the waterfront overlooking Alcatraz. He remembered his father explaining the island's layered history\u2014prison, but also the site of Indigenous occupation and resistance. He saw the fog rolling in, partially obscuring the view, not erasing it but making it more evocative. At 41, he felt a deep peace. San Francisco itself was his greatest teacher: a city that never hid its scars, but layered them into a complex, imperfect, and breathtakingly beautiful narrative he was proud to be part of."
