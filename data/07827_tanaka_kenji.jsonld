The son of second-generation Japanese-American parents in San Jose, he was raised on the promise of the Silicon Valley dream. His path seemed pre-written: excel in school, study a practical, high-earning field, and secure a stable future. He followed the script perfectly, earning a graduate degree in computer science from UC Berkeley and landing a lucrative software engineering job at a burgeoning San Francisco startup before he was 25.\n\nFor years, Kenji wrote code, debugged systems, and attended catered lunches, feeling a growing sense of detachment. He was building elegant systems but felt disconnected from the people they served. The turning point came during a massive company layoff. Seeing colleagues he respected reduced to names on a spreadsheet crystallized his discontent. He wasn't solving human problems; he was optimizing a business model.\n\nAt 28, in a move that baffled his parents, Kenji quit his job. He cashed in his stock options and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program. He had decided to start debugging the most complex system of all: the human mind. The rigorous clinical hours required for his LCSW licensure felt more meaningful than any line of code he had ever written.\n\nNow 35, Kenji lives and works in the same building in the Inner Richmond. His zero-mile commute is a short walk downstairs to the community health clinic where he provides therapy for a diverse, often underserved, patient population. His days are a mosaic of listening, counseling, and navigating the labyrinth of healthcare bureaucracy.\n\nHis small, tidy apartment above the clinic is his sanctuary. In the evenings, he unwinds by walking through Golden Gate Park with his camera, finding solace in capturing fleeting moments of light and shadow. He maintains a small circle of close friends, a mix of old tech colleagues and fellow social workers who understand his journey. He has a complicated but loving relationship with his parents, who have finally come to see his new career not as a failure, but as a different, more profound kind of success. Kenji\u2019s dream is to secure enough funding to expand the clinic\u2019s mental health services, creating a youth outreach program. He didn't find his purpose in the booming heart of SF's tech world, but in the quiet, compassionate work of tending to his own community."
