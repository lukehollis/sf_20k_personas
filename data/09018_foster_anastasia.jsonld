Her parents, immigrants from the Philippines, instilled in her a deep respect for education and community. Her father worked as a nurse at UCSF, her mother a seamstress, and their combined efforts built a stable, if not lavish, life for Anastasia and her younger brother.\n\nGrowing up surrounded by a vibrant Filipino-American community, Anastasia witnessed firsthand the health disparities that affected her neighbors. This sparked her interest in public health, fueled by countless hours volunteering at local health fairs in her teens. She excelled academically, driven by a desire to make a tangible difference. She pursued her Bachelor's in Public Health at UC Berkeley, where she immersed herself in coursework focusing on health equity and community engagement.\n\nA pivotal moment came during an internship at a non-profit serving low-income families in the Mission District. She saw the direct impact of accessible health education and solidifyied her commitment to the field. After graduation, she landed a position as a Health Educator at a community health clinic in the Richmond District. On $60,000 a year, she lives consciously within her means.\n\nHer days are a dynamic mix of developing and leading workshops on nutrition, chronic disease prevention, and sexual health, often tailored to the diverse linguistic needs of her clients. Her commute, a 3.5-mile journey by Muni bus, is a time for quiet reflection or catching up on health policy news.\n\nAnastasia is close to her family, and Sunday dinners at her parents\u2019 place remain a cherished tradition. She maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from university and work, often gathering for hikes in Lands End or exploring new restaurants in the Inner Sunset.\n\nHer current lifestyle is grounded and purposeful. She enjoys cooking healthy meals, practicing yoga, and volunteering at a local food bank on weekends. Her connection to San Francisco feels deeply rooted; it is the city that nurtured her, shaped her values, and provided her with the opportunities to pursue her passion.\n\nLooking ahead, Anastasia dreams of pursuing a Master's degree in public health policy to influence systemic change. She aspires to lead community health programs, advocating for greater access to healthcare and resources for marginalized populations. Her hope is to empower individuals and communities to take control of their health, creating a more equitable and healthier San Francisco for all."

The quiet dignity in her mother's focused hands, the unspoken trust in their small living room \u2013 it taught Anastasia the profound strength in humble service and community interdependence long before she understood \u201cpublic health.\u201d\n\n2.  The smell of disinfectant and the controlled chaos of the UCSF emergency room, visiting her dad on a quiet shift as a teenager. Seeing the calm focus on his face as he checked on a patient, the way he gently spoke \u2013 it cemented her respect for the healthcare profession and the dedication required to care for others in their most vulnerable moments.\n\n3.  Graduation day at Berkeley, a bittersweet mix of pride and the realization of how hard her parents had worked for this. Standing on the stage, looking out at them beaming, felt like a culmination of generations of hope and sacrifice, solidifying her resolve to use this education to give back to the community that had given her so much.\n\n4.  Helping set up a makeshift health screening station in a Mission District church basement during her internship. The grateful smiles of people receiving blood pressure checks, the relief in a mother's eyes getting advice on child nutrition \u2013 seeing the immediate, tangible impact of accessible care ignited a deep passion and confirmed this was the work she was meant to do.\n\n5.  Walking along Ocean Beach at sunset after a particularly challenging day at the clinic. The vastness of the Pacific, the familiar comfort of the salty air \u2013 it was a reminder of her roots, the resilience of this city, and the quiet strength she draws from her connection to this place and the people she serves, fueling her hope for a healthier future."
