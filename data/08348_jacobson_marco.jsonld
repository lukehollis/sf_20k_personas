The son of a spirited Oaxacan immigrant mother and a second-generation carpenter father from Richmond, Marco grew up with the scent of sawdust in his nostrils and the grit of the job site under his fingernails. His name, a compromise between his parents\u2019 cultures, mirrored his upbringing\u2014a blend of warm family tradition and a blue-collar, Bay Area work ethic. He had little interest in traditional academics, finding more purpose in the tangible logic of a well-built frame than in any textbook.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Marco went straight to work, joining a union crew as a laborer. His turning point came at 24, when his father suffered a debilitating fall from a scaffold. The event instilled in Marco a fierce commitment to safety and process. He wasn't just working for a paycheck anymore; he was working to protect his crew, his 'brothers'. He absorbed every detail of the trade, from pouring foundations to intricate finish work, earning a reputation for being tough but fair. His meticulous nature saw him promoted to foreman by his early thirties, a position of respect earned through sweat, not a degree.\n\nToday, Marco\u2019s life is the towering residential project he oversees in the Mission District. The 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; he lives in a small, spartan apartment across the street, its window facing the steel skeleton he commands. His alarm is the 6 a.m. roar of the generator. He drinks his coffee black while reviewing blueprints, his social life consisting of after-work beers with his crew at a local dive bar. His connection to San Francisco is profoundly physical. While others see a changing skyline, Marco sees the welds, the bolts, and the precise measurements that make it possible.\n\nHe sends money to his mother in Richmond every month and calls his father for advice on complex structural challenges. Marco\u2019s dream is simple and solid: to stand on the roof of the finished building, look out over the city, and know that every inch of it is perfect. Then, maybe, he\u2019ll think about finding a small, broken-down house somewhere in the city to fix up\u2014a final project, built just for himself."
