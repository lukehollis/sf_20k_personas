From the window of his stark, minimalist apartment, he can see the entrance to The Crucible Stage, the independent theater he resurrected from the brink of failure a decade ago. At 49, his life is a testament to the fact that one can run away from home and, in doing so, find the truest way back.\n\nThe only son of Chinese immigrants who ran a bustling grocery store in the Richmond District, Andrew\u2019s childhood was a landscape of practicality and filial piety. His parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned their son as a doctor or an engineer. But Andrew found his scripture in the dim lighting and hushed anticipation of the American Conservatory Theater, spending his meager allowance on rush tickets. It was a secret, passionate rebellion.\n\nHe placated his family by attending UC Berkeley but broke their hearts when he eschewed law school for an MFA in Directing from Yale. Those years on the East Coast were a crucible of their own; he was a freelance director in New York, honing his voice, often broke but creatively fulfilled. He felt the pull of San Francisco not as a retreat, but as a challenge. The offer to become Artistic Director of a failing theater was a gamble no one advised him to take.\n\nThat gamble became his life's work. His key turning point was staging a controversial new play by a young, Asian-American playwright. The show sold out, won awards, and put The Crucible Stage on the map, silencing the board members who wanted safer, more commercial productions. It was a victory that felt deeply personal, vindicating the quiet dreams of his youth. His relationship with his aging father, strained for years, found a quiet peace when the old man finally attended a show and, with a simple nod, acknowledged his son's success on his own terms.\n\nAndrew\u2019s personal life is woven into the fabric of his profession. Past relationships buckled under the weight of 80-hour workweeks and the all-consuming nature of running a theater. His social circle is his \"theater family\"\u2014the actors, designers, and playwrights he nurtures. His daily routine is a ritual: coffee and proofs at a local cafe, hours of grant writing and fundraising, intense afternoon rehearsals, and nights spent in the back row, watching his vision come to life. His aspiration is no longer for personal acclaim, but for institutional legacy: to ensure The Crucible Stage remains a permanent, audacious home for voices that struggle to be heard elsewhere."
