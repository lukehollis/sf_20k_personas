Raised in the Sunset District, he was the only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. His childhood was a gentle rhythm of school, helping stock shelves, and sketching superheroes on receipt paper behind the counter. His parents, pragmatic but loving, encouraged his artistic talent, seeing it as a path to a stable career in the burgeoning tech world. Kevin enrolled in the graphic design program at San Jose State, eager to trade the city\u2019s fog for Silicon Valley\u2019s sun and opportunity.\n\nHis educational journey was cut short during his third year. A sudden heart attack left his father unable to work, and Kevin, burdened by filial duty, dropped out of college to run the family store. For five years, his life was a blur of early morning produce runs and late-night accounting. He sacrificed his design ambitions for his family's survival. When his father finally recovered enough to sell the business and retire, Kevin found himself adrift at 27, his degree unfinished and his portfolio years out of date.\n\nHe took a barista job at a small, independent coffee shop just three blocks from his rent-controlled in-law apartment\u2014hence the 0.0-mile commute. The role was meant to be temporary, but it became an anchor. Kevin is now a neighborhood fixture, the calm presence who remembers everyone\u2019s order and can pull a perfect espresso shot. His social life revolves around the shop's regulars and a few old high school friends. He\u2019s friendly but reserved, his deeper thoughts often lost in the hiss of the steam wand.\n\nToday, Kevin\u2019s life is one of routine. He opens the shop, serves the morning rush, and walks home. But the old dream isn't dead. In his quiet apartment, surrounded by the familiar scent of roasted coffee clinging to his clothes, he still sketches. His current aspiration isn\u2019t a lofty tech career anymore; it\u2019s smaller, more tangible. He hopes to save enough to buy a quality drawing tablet and start taking on small freelance design jobs for local businesses\u2014perhaps starting with a new logo for the coffee shop that gave him a second start."
