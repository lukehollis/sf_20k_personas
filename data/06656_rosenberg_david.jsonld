            "value": "David Rosenberg\u2019s life is a testament to the quiet rebellion of finding one\u2019s own path. Raised in Scarsdale, New York, he was the only son of a demanding law professor father and a reserved concert pianist mother. The Rosenberg household was one of intellectual rigor and unspoken emotional distance. David was groomed for an Ivy League future in law or finance, a destiny he initially accepted by enrolling in pre-law at Columbia University. However, surrounded by ambitious peers, he felt a profound sense of alienation, more fascinated by their anxieties and motivations than by case law.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year after a difficult breakup left him feeling adrift. He sought campus counseling and, for the first time, experienced the power of being truly heard. This ignited a new passion. Rejecting his father\u2019s carefully laid plans, he switched his focus to psychology. After graduating, he moved across the country to intentionally sever the East Coast tether, earning his Master's in Counseling Psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley.\n\nHe began his career in the trenches of community mental health in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, an experience that honed his skills and exposed him to a spectrum of human struggle far from his privileged upbringing. A decade ago, he established his private practice. He now lives and works out of a tastefully restored Victorian in Noe Valley, with a ground-floor office that allows for his 0.0-mile commute. His own divorce five years ago was a painful but professionally transformative event, deepening his empathy and making him a more effective therapist for couples in crisis.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are structured. He starts with meditation and a walk to a 24th Street caf\u00e9 for coffee before seeing clients. Evenings are for reading, playing the cello\u2014a private nod to his mother\u2019s musical legacy, but on his own terms\u2014or quiet dinners with a close-knit circle of friends. He cherishes Noe Valley\u2019s calm, village-like atmosphere, a peaceful container for the emotional intensity of his work. His dream is to eventually write a book, not a prescriptive self-help guide, but a philosophical exploration of connection and loneliness in the digital age. He has found contentment not in achieving the life his parents wanted for him, but in carefully building one that is authentically his own."
