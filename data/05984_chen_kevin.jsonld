Raised in the manicured suburbs of Cupertino by Taiwanese immigrant parents, his path was pre-paved with expectations of stability and success. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a similar future for their son. Dutifully, Kevin earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from UC Davis, a respectable choice that led directly to a promising but soul-crushing job as a financial analyst in the Financial District. For five years, he crunched numbers in a high-rise, feeling a growing disconnect from the vibrant city just outside his window.\n\nThe turning point came unexpectedly. A city-wide arts festival, \"Art in the Alleys,\" brought murals and pop-up performances to the lanes near his office. During his lunch breaks, he found himself captivated, not just by the art, but by the diverse community it gathered. He began volunteering on weekends at a small community arts center in SOMA, initially just to escape his spreadsheet-filled reality. It was there, helping kids mix paint and seeing the pride on a senior\u2019s face after their first pottery class, that he found a sense of purpose he\u2019d never known.\n\nWhen his firm announced a round of layoffs, Kevin felt relief instead of panic. He took his severance package and enrolled in a certificate program for arts administration. He now serves as the Program Coordinator for the same center where he once volunteered, living in a subsidized live/work loft directly above the gallery space. His commute is a single flight of stairs.\n\nHis days are a whirlwind of grant writing, coordinating artist workshops, and outreach to local schools. His relationship with his parents is loving but strained; they struggle to understand why he abandoned a six-figure salary for a life of modest means. His dream isn't fame or fortune, but to secure enough funding to build a dedicated digital arts lab for teens. Kevin\u2019s San Francisco is not the world of tech IPOs he left behind, but the rich, messy, and creative ecosystem of his SOMA neighborhood. He found his wealth not in a portfolio, but in the community he helps empower through art."
