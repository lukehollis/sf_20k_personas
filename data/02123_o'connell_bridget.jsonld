Raised in the Sunset District by second-generation Irish-American parents, her childhood was defined by the rhythm of the N-Judah streetcar and walks along a blustery Ocean Beach. A thoughtful and observant child, she felt more at home in books than in the city\u2019s bustling tech scene. She pursued this passion at San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, envisioning a future surrounded by words, perhaps in publishing or teaching.\n\nThe pivotal moment of her life arrived not in a classroom, but in a sterile hospital waiting room. When she was 27, her mother suffered a major stroke. Suddenly, Bridget was thrust into the labyrinthine world of healthcare, trying to decipher insurance policies, coordinate specialist appointments, and advocate for her mother's care. Amidst the chaos, a hospital case manager became their lifeline\u2014a calm, organized presence who translated medical jargon and navigated the bureaucracy with tireless compassion. The experience was a profound awakening. Bridget realized her communication skills and empathy could serve a more immediate, tangible purpose than literary analysis.\n\nShe pivoted. Bridget took a certification course and landed an entry-level position as a Case Manager Assistant. Now 33, she works from her small apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her zero-mile commute means her day starts by logging into a patient management system, her laptop perched on a desk overlooking a foggy residential street. She spends her hours on the phone, scheduling follow-ups for post-op patients, arranging transportation for the elderly, and being that clear, reassuring voice for families in crisis.\n\nHer life is one of quiet purpose. After work, she decompressess with long walks through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that reconnects her with the city of her youth. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few old friends and her close-knit family. Bridget doesn\u2019t dream of a corner office or a startup windfall. Her aspiration is to become a fully licensed Case Manager, perhaps pursuing a Master of Social Work. She finds fulfillment in being the person she once desperately needed, bringing order and humanity to the overwhelming moments of others' lives."
