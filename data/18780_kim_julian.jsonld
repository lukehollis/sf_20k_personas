Born in Oakland to a Korean immigrant father who ran a small grocery store and a second-generation Irish-American mother who taught public school, Julian grew up navigating a tapestry of cultures. He spent his childhood observing the city's rhythms from behind the counter of his father\u2019s store, noticing how the bus routes dictated the flow of customers and how the lack of a nearby park shaped the lives of neighborhood kids. This early fascination with urban mechanics became the foundation for his future.\n\nHis educational journey took him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree, where he discovered the field of Urban and Regional Planning, a discipline that gave a name to his lifelong passion. He pursued his master's degree, focusing his thesis on the socioeconomic impact of public transit access in Bay Area communities. Upon graduating, landing a position with San Francisco\u2019s transportation agency was a dream realized. Over two decades, he has meticulously worked his way up to Principal Planner, his career marked by a quiet dedication to improving the city's arteries and veins. A key turning point was overseeing the transit redesign for the Van Ness Improvement Project, a challenging, multi-year endeavor that tested his patience but ultimately solidified his reputation as a pragmatic and thoughtful planner.\n\nNow 46, Julian lives a life deeply intertwined with the city he serves. Divorced for five years\u2014a casualty, in part, of his devotion to his demanding career\u2014he resides in a modern condo in Hayes Valley. His daily 2.8-mile commute on the Muni is a field study; he notes passenger loads, on-time performance, and the human drama unfolding around him. His social circle consists of a few old friends and colleagues with whom he debates policy over craft beer.\n\nJulian\u2019s aspiration isn't grand wealth, but a legacy of efficiency and equity. He dreams of spearheading a new light-rail line connecting the city's western neighborhoods, a project he believes could fundamentally reshape San Francisco for the better. He hopes to one day find a partner who understands his deep-seated need to solve the city\u2019s living puzzle, but for now, he finds fulfillment in the hum of a well-run system and the view of the city lights from his window."

She leaned her heavy bags against the counter, her sigh filling the small space. It wasn\u2019t just pity he felt, but a hot, blooming anger at the injustice of it. Her entire afternoon was now captive to a schedule that failed her. This moment cemented a core belief: a city\u2019s compassion could be measured by its timetables, a lesson that became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the exact moment in a Berkeley lecture hall, around age 19, when a professor projected a map of Bay Area transit lines over a map of income data. The lines suddenly shifted from abstract routes to lifelines\u2014or barriers. He saw his childhood street, the bus stop Mrs. Gable used, everything snapping into a coherent, powerful system. It was a dizzying, clarifying shock of recognition. He wasn't just a curious kid anymore; he had found the name for his purpose, a field where he could finally solve the puzzle.\n\n3.\nAt 39, during a contentious Van Ness community meeting, a merchant screamed in his face about losing three parking spots. Julian felt a familiar surge of defensive anger, his meticulously planned data packet feeling flimsy against such raw emotion. But instead of arguing, he took a breath and just listened. In that moment, he learned that progress wasn't about being right, but about absorbing the city\u2019s pain and proving, slowly and patiently, that a better system was worth the immediate sacrifice. It forged his quiet, pragmatic resolve.\n\n4.\nThe quiet packing of boxes five years ago is a memory that still stings. His ex-wife looked at the transit maps spread across their dining table and said, \u201cYou\u2019re already in your most meaningful relationship, Julian.\u201d Her words weren\u2019t cruel, just true. The admission, to her and to himself, was a quiet heartbreak. It cemented a profound loneliness but also clarified his identity. He had chosen to love the complex, frustrating, and beautiful mechanics of San Francisco, accepting the personal cost that came with it.\n\n5.\nLate one night last year, standing at his Hayes Valley window, he watched the red taillights of the 21-Hayes bus recede down the street. He wasn't just watching a bus; he was seeing the city\u2019s circulatory system, a living thing he helped tend. This quiet, solitary observation brought a deep sense of fulfillment that eclipsed his loneliness. He wasn\u2019t just a planner; he was a steward. This, he realized, was his legacy\u2014not in a grand building, but in the steady, rhythmic pulse of the city itself."
