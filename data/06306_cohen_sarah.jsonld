Raised in a quiet Boston suburb by a civil engineer father and a librarian mother, she grew up understanding the world as an intricate network of logical structures and public trusts. Her childhood fascination wasn't with dolls but with the color-coded lines of the MBTA map, tracing the flow of people like blood through a city\u2019s veins. This passion led her to pursue a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, trading the colonial brick of the East Coast for the vibrant, chaotic experiment of the Bay Area. She never looked back.\n\nFor over two decades, Sarah has been a dedicated transportation planner for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). She started as a junior analyst mapping bus route efficiencies and gradually became a senior planner, a respected, steady hand who understands the city\u2019s complex topography and even more complex politics. A key turning point was her work championing the bike lane expansion along The Wiggle, a project that required battling neighborhood groups and bureaucratic inertia but resulted in a tangible improvement for thousands of cyclists.\n\nHer devotion to the city came at a personal cost. A long-term relationship ended seven years ago when her partner wanted to move to Marin for a yard and better schools; Sarah couldn\u2019t fathom abandoning the urban fabric she was actively trying to stitch together. Now, her life is her work, her neighborhood, and a close-knit circle of friends\u2014architects, policy wonks, and artists who share her love for dense, walkable living.\n\nLiving in a meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her philosophy. Her day begins with a walk to a local caf\u00e9 and is spent in her home office, overlooking the street traffic she analyzes. Her dream isn't a promotion but a legacy: a fully pedestrianized Market Street and a Muni system so reliable it becomes the default choice for all San Franciscans. Sarah Cohen doesn\u2019t just live in San Francisco; she is an integral, thoughtful part of its circulatory system, continually working to improve its flow."
