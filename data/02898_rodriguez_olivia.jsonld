Raised in Fresno as the only child of Mexican-American parents who ran a small, meticulously organized corner grocery, she learned the value of a logical system early on. While her parents alphabetized cans and categorized produce, Olivia found her sanctuary in the quiet, structured aisles of the public library. This love for accessible information led her to pursue a Master\u2019s in Library and Information Science (MLIS) from UCLA, intending to become a university archivist.\n\nHer career began as predicted, but she soon found the academic pace stifling. A friend introduced her to the burgeoning field of User Experience (UX), and Olivia had a revelation: the digital world was a messy, sprawling library in desperate need of a cataloger. She pivoted, leveraging her MLIS into a role as an Information Architect. The transition was sharp and successful, culminating in a job offer from a major San Francisco tech company a decade ago. The offer coincided with the painful end of a long-term relationship, making the move north feel less like a career choice and more like a necessary personal reset.\n\nToday, Olivia lives and works from her airy, minimalist apartment in the Mission District. The 0.0-mile commute offers her the deep focus her job requires, structuring complex data systems for millions of users. Her days are disciplined: a morning walk for coffee at a local panaderia, hours of focused work, and an afternoon break to walk through Dolores Park, mentally de-cluttering. She loves the Mission for its vibrant murals and the echoes of her own heritage, though she is quietly conscious of her role in its ongoing gentrification.\n\nTo balance the solitude of remote work, Olivia has intentionally built a life outside of tech. Her closest friends were met not at a happy hour, but in a community ceramics class in Bernal Heights. She finds navigating the city's intense dating scene exhausting but remains hopeful. Her ultimate aspiration is to use her high-level skills for a social-good project, perhaps designing a digital archive for immigrant stories or consulting for a nonprofit. For Olivia, the goal remains the same as it was in her parents\u2019 store: to build elegant structures that help people find exactly what they need."
