Born in suburban Ohio to a first-generation Chinese mother and a white American father, she grew up navigating the space between two cultures. Her name itself was a bridge: \"Mei,\" her mother\u2019s choice, for beauty and resilience; \"Harrison,\" her father\u2019s, for its solid, Midwestern sound. While she excelled academically, she always felt slightly out of sync, her ambition and perspective not quite matching her surroundings.\n\nDriven by a practical desire to please her parents, she initially pursued an undergraduate degree in economics. However, a soul-crushing internship at a finance firm became a pivotal turning point. She realized she didn\u2019t want to just move money; she wanted to build things that people connected with. This epiphany led her west to pursue a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, where she finally found her tribe\u2014people who saw technology not as cold code, but as a tool for human connection.\n\nNow 33, Mei is a successful Product Manager for a major tech company. Her 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing her to trade office politics for a curated life in her Hayes Valley apartment. Her days are a structured blend of remote work and city life. Mornings begin with a walk to a local caf\u00e9 for an oat milk latte, followed by hours of video calls and strategy documents from her light-filled workstation. To combat the isolation of remote work, she breaks up her day with a run through Patricia\u2019s Green or a bouldering session at a nearby climbing gym, where she\u2019s found a small, tight-knit community.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and intentional. It\u2019s not defined by a downtown office but by the baristas, shop owners, and climbing partners within a ten-block radius. While she\u2019s proud of her career, Mei dreams of more. She aspires to one day launch her own startup, creating assistive technology that is both beautiful and accessible. It\u2019s a goal that perfectly marries her technical skill with her innate desire to build bridges, a reflection of the identity she has so carefully crafted for herself."
