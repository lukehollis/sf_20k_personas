Born in central Ohio, he was adopted as an infant by a loving, middle-class couple who could not have children of their own. Growing up white in a predominantly white suburb, David always felt a quiet, internal dissonance\u2014a sense of being chosen but also slightly displaced. His anchor was his adoptive grandmother, Helen, whose stories and struggles with aging in a world that often forgot her ignited in David a fierce, protective empathy.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work, driven by Helen\u2019s memory. Feeling the pull of a more inclusive environment, he moved to San Francisco in his early twenties. The city, with its fog-swept avenues and promise of acceptance, felt like a true home. He began his career as a frontline caseworker, navigating the complex, often heartbreaking bureaucracy of social services. It was during this time that he met Alan Wei, a gentle, witty landscape architect. Their bond was immediate. They built a life together, and when they married in 2008, David chose to take Alan\u2019s surname, a gesture of creating a new family tree, one planted firmly in the San Francisco soil they both loved.\n\nDavid\u2019s career steadily advanced. His dedication and firsthand understanding of the system saw him promoted to Program Coordinator and, eventually, to his current role as Program Director for Senior Services. He found deep purpose in creating programs that fostered dignity and connection for the elderly. His life took an unexpected turn five years ago when Alan passed away after a sudden illness. The loss hollowed him out but also deepened his professional resolve, giving his work an even greater poignancy.\n\nToday, at 50, David\u2019s life is one of quiet routine and profound meaning. He lives in the same Inner Richmond apartment he once shared with Alan. His day starts with a MUNI ride downtown, a 2.5-mile journey that allows him to read and observe the city waking up. He dedicates his days to securing funding, managing staff, and ensuring his clients feel seen. Evenings are often solitary but not lonely, filled with books and calls with his small circle of enduring friends. His hope is not for grand reinvention, but for the continued strength to serve his community, to mentor the next generation of social workers, and to honor a love that reshaped his name and his heart."

He felt a hot, protective anger\u2014not at her, but at a world that made her feel invisible. In that quiet Ohio living room, the abstract idea of a career sharpened into a specific mission: he would fight for the dignity of those the world was beginning to forget. It was the moment, around age 18, that his life\u2019s work truly began.\n\n2.\nIt was a rare, sunny afternoon in Golden Gate Park. He\u2019d sought refuge in the Conservatory of Flowers, and there was Alan, sketching a particularly stubborn orchid. David was struck first by his gentle focus, then by his witty, self-deprecating humor when he introduced himself. In that humid, fragrant air, the quiet dissonance of David\u2019s youth finally dissolved. He felt seen, not as an adoptee or a transplant, but simply as himself. It was in his early twenties, and it felt like coming home.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the weight of the pen at City Hall in 2008. When he signed \u2018David Wei\u2019 on the marriage license, it wasn\u2019t an erasure of Thompson, but a culmination. Alan squeezed his hand, a silent acknowledgment of the gesture's weight. It was the singular moment where he wasn't just chosen by a family, but actively chose his own. He was planting roots, creating a new lineage born not of blood, but of love and sheer, joyful intent. For the first time, his name felt entirely his.\n\n4.\nThe first morning after Alan was gone, the Inner Richmond apartment felt cavernous. David stood by the window, watching the fog obscure the view, feeling just as erased. His grief was a physical weight. But then, looking at the city Alan had loved to design for, a new resolve settled in his hollowed chest. His work with seniors was no longer just a job; it was his way of tending to the world Alan had left behind. Five years ago, his deepest loss became his most profound purpose.\n\n5.\nLast winter, he spent a whole night on the phone, refusing to give up until he\u2019d secured emergency housing for an elderly woman displaced by a fire. He saw his grandmother Helen in her frightened eyes. After the final call confirmed her placement, he sat alone in his quiet office, bone-weary but steady. This was it. This was honoring Alan. This was the fierce, protective empathy Helen had ignited in him so long ago, now a sustaining fire against the San Francisco cold."
