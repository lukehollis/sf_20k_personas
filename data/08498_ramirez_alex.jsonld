The daughter of immigrant farmworkers from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, she grew up understanding the deep-seated value of *comunidad*\u2014community. Her parents\u2019 tireless work ethic and their unwavering support for their neighbors, sharing meals and pooling resources, became the foundational blueprint for Alex\u2019s life.\n\nSeeking a world beyond the agricultural fields, she moved to San Francisco to attend SF State, immersing herself in the study of Sociology. The city was a revelation; a vibrant, chaotic tapestry of cultures that both challenged and thrilled her. After graduating, she poured her passion for community directly into her work, taking a job at a grassroots non-profit in the Mission District. For over a decade, she was on the front lines, running after-school programs and organizing food drives.\n\nThe key turning point came in her late thirties. She saw too many passionate, well-meaning organizations buckle under the weight of administrative inefficiency and burnout. Her own included. Alex realized her true talent wasn't just in direct service, but in seeing the system from above. She was an organizer, a planner, an architect of efficiency. This led her to her current role as a Project Coordinator for a firm that consults for other non-profits, helping them streamline operations so they can better serve their communities.\n\nNow 43, Alex\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of her Noe Valley neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a small desk in the corner of her living room, her window overlooking a quiet, tree-lined street. Her days are a mosaic of Zoom calls with organizations across the Bay Area, her calm voice guiding them through strategic planning and grant reporting. Her social life is intimate; a close circle of friends, many former colleagues, with whom she shares weekly dinners and hikes through Glen Canyon Park.\n\nThough content, Alex dreams of launching her own small consultancy, focusing exclusively on empowering immigrant and farmworker advocacy groups like the ones that supported her own family. She is a builder, not with bricks and mortar, but with strategy and support, strengthening the foundations of the city she loves, one non-profit at a time."
