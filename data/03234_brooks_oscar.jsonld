The son of a landscape architect and a high school teacher, he was a contemplative child who found his escape in books. This passion led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, immersing himself in a world of dense text and subtle meaning, far removed from the data-driven precision he would later encounter.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life arrived during his senior year. His mother was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and Oscar spent months shuttling between classes and the UCSF Medical Center. He witnessed not only the emotional toll but also the intricate, often impersonal system behind the care. He was fascinated by the clinical trials, the data collection, and the researchers working tirelessly behind the scenes. It was here he realized his talent for analysis\u2014honed by deconstructing Faulkner\u2014could be applied to something with tangible, life-or-death stakes.\n\nAfter graduation, he leveraged his analytical skills and newfound purpose to land a research assistant position in a healthcare data firm. Today, Oscar\u2019s world is largely confined to his small Inner Richmond apartment, where a 0.0-mile commute means his desk is just feet from his bed. His routine is disciplined: a morning run through the fog in Golden Gate Park, followed by hours spent cleaning and organizing datasets for clinical studies. He knows the neighborhood intimately\u2014the best dim sum on Clement Street, the quietest corner at his local coffee shop, the precise timing of the N Judah train\u2019s rumble.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few college friends and a running club that forces him out into the city. Oscar\u2019s dream is twofold: to advance in his field, perhaps managing research projects that make medicine more personalized, and to one day finally write the novel he started in college. He remains a man of two worlds, finding poetry in spreadsheets and human stories within raw data, forever connected to the city that both challenged his family and gave him his purpose."

The world felt enormous yet silent, the scent of damp earth and pine filling the air. It was a perfect, contained universe where the only conflicts were on the page. This memory is the bedrock of his contemplative nature, a quiet solitude he now seeks in the foggy corners of Golden Gate Park. It occurred when he was about thirteen, solidifying his love for stories before they became real.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIn the UCSF cafeteria, fluorescent lights hummed over his untouched tray. He saw two researchers at a nearby table, their laptops displaying complex charts that meant nothing and everything. They weren't talking about his mother, but they were talking about her *illness*\u2014as a puzzle, a set of variables. In that moment, grief mingled with a startling, electric curiosity. He saw not just pain, but a problem being systematically deconstructed. This was during his senior year of college, the moment his life\u2019s path pivoted from literature to data.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis first major assignment at the data firm felt impossible: a hopelessly messy spreadsheet from a canceled clinical trial. For days, imposter syndrome was a physical weight. Then, staring at the wall of numbers, he started treating it like a flawed Faulkner novel. He spotted the narrative, the illogical entries, the hidden story within the errors. When he finally submitted the clean, structured dataset, the relief was profound. It happened six months into his first job, cementing the belief that his literary mind had a place in this world.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday morning, running his usual loop around Stow Lake, the fog was so thick he could barely see the path ahead. The only sounds were his own breathing and the distant, mournful cry of a foghorn. He wasn't in Mill Valley, but for a moment, he felt that same sense of peaceful isolation. Here, in the heart of the city he chose, he had found his own quiet. This recurring memory from the last few years grounds him, turning his disciplined routine into a cherished ritual of belonging.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe was cleaning data for a new oncology drug, his eyes scanning rows of anonymized patient IDs. He paused on row 347. The numbers\u2014biomarkers, dosage adjustments, response times\u2014suddenly weren't abstract. They told a story of a single, fighting body, a narrative of hope and setback measured in decimal points. He felt a deep, quiet empathy, both for the person he'd never know and for his mother. This recent moment at his desk affirmed his purpose: to honor the human story hidden inside every cell of data."
