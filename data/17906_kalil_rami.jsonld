Born in San Diego to Palestinian immigrants, he was the bridge between his parents' world of Ramallah memories and the sun-drenched individualism of Southern California. His father ran a small grocery store, his stoicism a stark contrast to his mother\u2019s expressive warmth. Rami grew up navigating these dualities, becoming an adept observer of unspoken tensions and the quiet sacrifices made for a better future.\n\nWhile his parents hoped he would pursue medicine or law, Rami was drawn to the space between people. The true turning point was his older sister\u2019s difficult divorce, an event met with hushed tones in their community and a profound lack of culturally sensitive support. Witnessing her struggle, Rami felt a calling. He pursued a B.A. in Psychology at UC Santa Cruz before moving north for his Master's in Counseling Psychology at San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 31, Rami is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist at a community health nonprofit serving immigrant and refugee families in the Mission and SoMa. He found his purpose in the city, using his background not as a barrier but as his greatest tool. His days are a rhythm of empathy and decompression. The 2.5-mile bike ride from his Mission District apartment is a mental buffer, the whir of his chain a mantra bookending sessions filled with trauma, hope, and resilience.\n\nHis apartment, though small, is an oasis of calm filled with plants and the scent of cardamom from the coffee he brews. His social circle consists of a tight-knit group of fellow therapists who trade gallows humor and genuine support over beers at Toronado. He is deeply connected to the Mission; its vibrant murals, overlapping languages, and constant energy remind him of the communal, if chaotic, warmth of his family gatherings. Rami\u2019s dream is to one day open a private practice specializing in therapy for bicultural individuals. He hopes to find a partner who understands his passion and, one day, to travel to Palestine with his parents, to finally see the olive groves he has only ever known through their stories."

Rami translated, but he changed the words, softening their sharp edges to protect his father\u2019s pride. He saw the flicker of understanding in his father\u2019s eyes\u2014a silent acknowledgment of the gentle deception. In that moment, he learned that translation was more than language; it was an act of care, a buffer against a world that didn't always understand stoicism as strength.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he found his sister Amira sitting on her bedroom floor, suffocating under the weight of community judgment after her divorce. She wasn\u2019t crying over the marriage's end, but over the isolating whispers. He sat with her, offering no solutions, just his silent presence. The profound injustice of her loneliness burned in his chest. In that quiet room, his vague interest in psychology sharpened into a fierce, undeniable purpose: he would build the safe spaces where people like his sister could finally be heard.\n\n3.\nDuring his practicum at SFSU, he worked with an Eritrean teenager who hadn't spoken for three sessions. Then, one Tuesday, the boy looked up and quietly described the color of the door of his house back home. It was a tiny crack of light in a fortress of trauma. Rami felt a jolt of connection so profound it almost made him dizzy. This, he realized, was the work. Not fixing, but sitting in the dark with someone until they were ready to describe the door.\n\n4.\nHe was twenty-eight, biking home from a brutal session, his mind heavy. He stopped at 24th and Mission, straddling his bike. The air was a mix of roasting corn and diesel fumes. He heard cumbia blasting from a storefront, saw a mural of ancestors watching over the street, and felt a sudden peace. The neighborhood\u2019s resilient, chaotic energy felt like a conversation he\u2019d been having his whole life. The city understood his dualities without him needing to say a word. He was home.\n\n5.\nLast year, his mother described the olive harvest in Ramallah, her voice soft with a longing that felt ancient. \"The whole village would work together, your grandfather singing,\" she\u2019d said, putting her hand on his. \"You carry that scent inside you, Rami.\" In that moment, her stories became a map. Palestine was no longer just his parents' past, but a pilgrimage he was destined to make\u2014to find a part of himself he had only ever known through their memory."
