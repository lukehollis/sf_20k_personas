Raised in the sprawling, sun-baked suburbs of Concord, her upbringing was defined by pragmatism. Her father, a mechanic, and her mother, a homemaker, valued stability above all else, which clashed with Susan\u2019s burgeoning interest in art history. She enrolled in Diablo Valley College, but after three semesters, the pressure to earn a reliable income led her to drop out and take an office job.\n\nIn her early twenties, seeking an identity separate from her family\u2019s expectations, Susan moved to San Francisco. The city, with its fog-laced rebellion and artistic soul, felt like a true beginning. She found a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a haven she still calls home today. She fell into administrative work, her organized nature making her a natural fit. After navigating various industries, she landed in a tech startup during the first dot-com boom and has remained in the sector ever since, a steady hand amidst the frenetic energy of ambitious twenty-somethings.\n\nHer life has been shaped by deep but sometimes fleeting connections. A decade-long partnership with a musician dissolved in her late thirties, leaving her with a profound sense of independence rather than regret. She never had children, instead nurturing a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends met through pottery classes and neighborhood volunteer work.\n\nThe pandemic shifted her work entirely remote, shrinking her world to the confines of her apartment but also granting her a new autonomy. Her days are now structured by the chime of Slack notifications, punctuated by long walks through Golden Gate Park and trips to Green Apple Books. Susan harbors a quiet dream of one day finishing her degree online or perhaps retiring to a small coastal town. For now, however, she is content. Susan Miller is a testament to the lives lived in the city's margins\u2014the essential, steadfast individuals who keep the engine running while the world focuses on the next big thing."
