Adopted as an infant by a free-spirited, multicultural couple in the Haight-Ashbury, her upbringing was a vibrant collage of art, activism, and community potlucks. Her parents, a sociologist and a sculptor, eschewed traditional schooling, opting for an \"unschooling\" approach. Consequently, Mei-Ling's education came from library books, long conversations, and practical experience. She learned fractions by helping her father mix plaster and prose by reading her mother\u2019s academic journals.\n\nWhile her parents thrived on creative chaos, they were notoriously disorganized with their finances. By sixteen, Mei-Ling, possessing a natural affinity for order, took it upon herself to balance their checkbooks and manage their invoices. She discovered a quiet satisfaction in bringing coherence to columns of numbers. This skill became her trade. An older shop owner in the Castro, impressed by her diligence, took her on as an apprentice, teaching her the fundamentals of small business accounting.\n\nThe passing of her parents five years ago marked a profound turning point. Inheriting little more than their rent-controlled apartment and a legacy of intellectual curiosity, Mei-Ling solidified her freelance bookkeeping practice. She now works entirely from her small home office, her commute a few steps from bed to desk. Her clients are the lifeblood of old San Francisco: legacy bakeries in North Beach, independent bookstores in the Mission, and artists she grew up with.\n\nNow 42, Mei-Ling lives a quiet, structured life in the Inner Richmond. Her days are built around routine: a morning walk to a local cafe for a green tea, hours spent meticulously managing her clients' finances, and an evening spent reading or listening to history podcasts. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few lifelong friends who understand her unique history. Mei-Ling\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it is one of permanence. She hopes to one day save enough to buy a small condo in her neighborhood, a tangible anchor in the city that has always been her home. Through her work, she feels she is a quiet steward, helping preserve the soul of the San Francisco she has always known."
