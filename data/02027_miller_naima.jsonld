Born in San Jose to a third-generation Japanese-American mother and a white academic father, she grew up between two worlds: the stoic resilience and subtle traditions of her mother\u2019s family and the analytical, structured world of her father. This duality fostered a deep sense of observation and an innate ability to listen to what was left unsaid.\n\nHer path to social work was forged in personal crisis. During her undergraduate years at UCLA, her father was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Witnessing her mother\u2019s exhaustion and the family\u2019s struggle to navigate a confusing and often impersonal healthcare system became her defining crucible. It was then she knew she had to be an advocate for families in similar situations. She pursued her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, driven by a fierce new purpose.\n\nNaima\u2019s first decade as an LCSW was a baptism by fire in the chaotic emergency department of a major San Francisco hospital. She thrived on the intensity but the constant exposure to trauma and systemic failures led to profound burnout. The turning point came after a grueling 16-hour shift; she realized she was becoming the kind of depleted caregiver she so often counseled.\n\nThree years ago, she took a leap. Naima established her own private telehealth practice from her quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is now a short walk from her bedroom to her sunny home office. Her days are structured and calm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park with her rescue shiba inu, Kiko, followed by back-to-back video sessions with clients, many of whom are healthcare workers and caregivers like her former self.\n\nNow at 40, Naima has found a fragile peace. She maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends and has a deep connection to the Richmond, with its family-run grocery stores and foggy evenings. Her dream is to develop workshops on preventing caregiver burnout, turning her personal and professional pain into a wider lesson. For Naima, San Francisco is not a city of frantic ambition, but a place where she has carved out a space to heal\u2014both for herself and for others, one session at a time."
