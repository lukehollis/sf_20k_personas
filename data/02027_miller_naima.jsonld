Born in San Jose to a third-generation Japanese-American mother and a white academic father, she grew up between two worlds: the stoic resilience and subtle traditions of her mother\u2019s family and the analytical, structured world of her father. This duality fostered a deep sense of observation and an innate ability to listen to what was left unsaid.\n\nHer path to social work was forged in personal crisis. During her undergraduate years at UCLA, her father was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Witnessing her mother\u2019s exhaustion and the family\u2019s struggle to navigate a confusing and often impersonal healthcare system became her defining crucible. It was then she knew she had to be an advocate for families in similar situations. She pursued her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, driven by a fierce new purpose.\n\nNaima\u2019s first decade as an LCSW was a baptism by fire in the chaotic emergency department of a major San Francisco hospital. She thrived on the intensity but the constant exposure to trauma and systemic failures led to profound burnout. The turning point came after a grueling 16-hour shift; she realized she was becoming the kind of depleted caregiver she so often counseled.\n\nThree years ago, she took a leap. Naima established her own private telehealth practice from her quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is now a short walk from her bedroom to her sunny home office. Her days are structured and calm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park with her rescue shiba inu, Kiko, followed by back-to-back video sessions with clients, many of whom are healthcare workers and caregivers like her former self.\n\nNow at 40, Naima has found a fragile peace. She maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends and has a deep connection to the Richmond, with its family-run grocery stores and foggy evenings. Her dream is to develop workshops on preventing caregiver burnout, turning her personal and professional pain into a wider lesson. For Naima, San Francisco is not a city of frantic ambition, but a place where she has carved out a space to heal\u2014both for herself and for others, one session at a time."

He looked at the spoon in his hand, then at Naima, his eyes clouded with a frustration she had never seen. \"What is this... what is this for?\" he asked, the words a betrayal of his entire life. In that quiet kitchen moment, watching her brilliant father\u2019s world shrink, her own path was forged. She wouldn't fix the unfixable, but she would learn to stand beside those who were lost in it.\n\n2.\nAt 3 AM in the hospital parking garage, the silence was louder than the chaos she\u2019d just left. The 16-hour shift had ended, but her body still hummed with a phantom urgency. She rested her head on the steering wheel, waiting for tears that wouldn't come. There was just a hollow space where empathy used to be. That terrifying numbness was the signal. She wasn't just burned out; she was becoming a ghost. She knew then she had to leave to save what was left of herself.\n\n3.\nThe first day of her practice felt like an exhale she\u2019d been holding for a decade. Sunlight streamed into her Richmond apartment, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Her shiba inu, Kiko, rested his head on her knee. Holding a warm mug of genmaicha, she looked out at the fog retreating over the green of the park. There were no alarms, no overhead pages, just the quiet promise of a new, sustainable peace. It was the first day of her own recovery.\n\n4.\nOn a visit to her mother\u2019s San Jose home, she watched her fold a basket of towels with silent, practiced precision. Her mother handed her a perfectly squared hand towel, their fingers brushing. No words were exchanged, but Naima felt the immense weight of her mother\u2019s years as a caregiver\u2014the stoic resilience, the love expressed in quiet acts of service. In that single, inherited gesture, Naima understood the source of her own strength, a current running silently through generations.\n\n5.\nA client, a nurse with shadowed eyes, finally whispered it into the screen between them: \"I'm just so tired of being strong.\" Naima didn\u2019t offer a strategy or a platitude. She just met her gaze, held the silence, and replied softly, \"I know.\" In the shared acknowledgment\u2014the simple, profound act of bearing witness to another caregiver's exhaustion\u2014she felt the entire purpose of her new life click into place. This was the work. This was healing."
