            "value": "Mei Lin Abramov is a product of an old San Francisco, born in the foggy avenues of the Inner Richmond to a pragmatic seamstress from Hong Kong and a verbose Russian-Jewish intellectual who fled the Soviet Union. Her childhood was a quiet negotiation between cultures: the scent of her mother\u2019s steaming bao mingling with the must of her father\u2019s beloved books. Mei Lin learned early to be a bridge, translating not just languages but emotional currents between her mother\u2019s stoic resilience and her father\u2019s deep, melancholic history.\n\nThis role as the family\u2019s emotional interpreter became a vocation. Watching her father struggle with an unarticulated trauma that no one had a name for steered her toward the field of mental health. After earning her bachelor's degree at SF State, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, driven by a desire to give others the language and tools her own family lacked. Her early career was spent in the demanding environment of a public hospital, navigating bureaucracy to advocate for the city's most vulnerable patients.\n\nThe key turning point in her life was her divorce at 38. The amicable but painful separation from her ex-husband, a fellow academic she\u2019d married young, forced her to confront her own patterns of caretaking. The experience reshaped her therapeutic approach and gave her the courage to start her own private practice.\n\nNow, at 43, Mei Lin\u2019s life is defined by a quiet, deliberate rhythm. Her commute is zero miles because her therapy office is the converted in-law unit on the ground floor of her Edwardian home. Mornings begin with oolong tea and a review of her case notes, the familiar Richmond fog a comforting blanket outside her bay window. Her days are filled with telehealth sessions and in-person clients, helping them navigate grief, anxiety, and cultural dislocation.\n\nHer social life is small but deep\u2014a weekly dinner with two close friends and regular walks through Golden Gate Park. She remains deeply connected to her neighborhood, frequenting the bakeries on Clement Street. Her hope for the future is not grand ambition but quiet contribution: to write a short, accessible book for immigrant families on navigating intergenerational trauma, finally putting her own childhood experience into words that can help heal others."
