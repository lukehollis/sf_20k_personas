Born into a CHamoru family that followed his Navy father to San Diego, Keanu\u2019s upbringing was a blend of military base precision and warm, communal island culture. His childhood was filled with the scents of red rice and kelaguen at sprawling family gatherings, where he first observed the unspoken stresses his community carried\u2014the burdens of relocation, service, and assimilation. These early observations planted the seed of his desire to heal not just bodies, but spirits.\n\nHe pursued this calling with quiet determination, earning a Bachelor's degree from San Francisco State and then a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Keanu was drawn to the complex, challenging environment of healthcare, finding his niche as a clinical social worker in a major city hospital. He became a guide for patients and families navigating the terrifying landscapes of chronic illness and end-of-life care. His calm demeanor and deep empathy made him a rock in moments of crisis. A key turning point was the COVID-19 pandemic, which thrust him onto the frontlines of grief and burnout, and permanently shifted his practice to a remote model.\n\nNow, Keanu\u2019s commute is a walk from his bedroom to his home office in the Inner Sunset. His days are a series of telehealth sessions, holding space for others\u2019 pain through a screen. This 0.0-mile commute dissolves the boundary between work and life, a challenge he manages with ritual. He starts each day with coffee with his long-term partner, Alex, a graphic designer, and ends it with long, grounding runs through Golden Gate Park. His connection to San Francisco is tactile and sensory\u2014the fog rolling over the hills, the diverse food on Irving Street, the quiet camaraderie of his neighbors.\n\nKeanu dreams not of wealth, but of sustainability. He hopes to one day open a small private practice focused on mental health for the AAPI community, creating a culturally competent space for healing. He aspires to find a healthier balance, to travel with Alex, and to spend more time simply being present\u2014a quiet man who has dedicated his life to helping others find peace, now diligently seeking his own."
