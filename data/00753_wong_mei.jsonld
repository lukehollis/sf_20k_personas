She was raised in the Sunset District, her childhood scented by the ocean-chilled fog and the savory aroma of her parents\u2019 small Cantonese bakery. They were immigrants who poured their life savings and every waking hour into the business, teaching Mei Ling the language of sacrifice and relentless hard work. While they prized a practical, stable path, Mei Ling found refuge in literature, eventually earning a BA in English from UC Davis, a choice that quietly worried her parents.\n\nThe turning point came during her senior year. Watching her father struggle to negotiate a new lease and adapt his old-world business to a digital-first market ignited a new ambition in her. She realized that the systems and strategies that governed success were a language she didn\u2019t speak, but desperately wanted to master. This revelation propelled her toward a Master of Business Administration from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\n\nNow 29, Mei Ling is a high-earning management consultant, navigating the digital battlegrounds of the tech industry from the controlled quiet of her immaculate Hayes Valley apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her standing desk. Her days are a blur of video calls, slide decks, and intense problem-solving for billion-dollar companies.\n\nHer connection to a physical workplace gone, Mei Ling cultivates her social life with the same precision she applies to a project plan. Weeknights often end with late work, but she carves out time for a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and a rock-climbing group at a gym in the Mission, a necessary physical release from her cerebral job. Her romantic life consists of a long-distance, on-again-off-again relationship with a fellow consultant she met at Haas, their schedules perpetually clashing.\n\nThough she has achieved the financial security her parents dreamed of for her, Mei Ling feels a growing disconnect. Her ultimate aspiration isn't to make partner, but to one day leave the corporate world. She dreams of starting a venture that uses her strategic expertise to empower small, immigrant-owned businesses like the one she grew up in, helping them thrive in the very city that both built her and now feels increasingly foreign."
