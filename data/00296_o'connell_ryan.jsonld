Growing up in a Sacramento suburb, the son of an auto mechanic and a primary school teacher, his childhood was filled with the smell of motor oil and the satisfaction of a well-repaired engine. While his friends were obsessed with video games, Ryan was fascinated by the systems that made them possible. He didn\u2019t just want to play; he wanted to understand how the plastic controller was molded and how the circuits were printed onto the board.\n\nThis practical curiosity led him to Cal Poly for a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. The lecture halls were a necessity, but his real education took place in the university\u2019s machine shop. There, amidst the hum of lathes and CNC machines, he discovered his calling: not just designing objects, but designing the *process* of their creation. Upon graduating, he was recruited by a Silicon Valley hardware giant, a move that brought him to San Francisco.\n\nRyan\u2019s role as a Manufacturing Engineer situates him at the critical junction between digital design and physical reality. From his bright, tidy apartment in Hayes Valley, he designs and optimizes assembly lines for factories in Southeast Asia. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his standing desk is a testament to modern industrial work. His days are a mix of intense video calls, poring over CAD models, and analyzing production data, ensuring millions of units can be built flawlessly.\n\nHis life is one of structured precision. Mornings start with pour-over coffee from a local cafe, followed by deep work. A midday run to the Panhandle clears his head. Evenings are for his own projects\u2014tinkering with his high-end 3D printer\u2014or catching up with a small, close-knit group of college friends for craft beer. Ryan isn't a socialite; his connections are deliberate and meaningful. He values the city not for its nightlife, but for its undercurrent of innovation and its community of makers. San Francisco is the perfect backdrop for him: a place of abstract ideas where he gets to figure out, concretely, how to build the future. His ultimate dream is to one day design a fully automated, zero-waste manufacturing process, leaving his mark not on a single product, but on the art of making itself."

His dad had a car\u2019s transmission completely disassembled, its gears laid out on a tarp in perfect, logical order. It wasn\u2019t a mess; it was a language. In that moment, seeing the intricate system before it was reassembled, Ryan understood it wasn\u2019t the car he loved, but the beautiful, clean order of how it all went back together. That feeling of profound clarity\u2014of seeing the blueprint behind the machine\u2014never left him.\n\n***\n\n2. Sophomore year, in the Cal Poly machine shop after hours. He\u2019d just finished his first solo CNC project: a small, intricate aluminum part. Holding the cool, precise metal in his palm, still faintly warm from the mill, was a revelation. It was the first time an idea from his mind had become a perfect, tangible object through a process he completely controlled. It was then he knew he\u2019d spend his life closing that exact gap between digital design and physical reality.\n\n***\n\n3. His first year at the company. He was on a 5 AM video call, watching a grainy feed from a factory in Shenzhen. And there it was: the line he designed. Dozens of workers moved in a rhythm he had orchestrated from his tidy apartment. Seeing the real-world, human scale of his digital work was humbling. It instilled in him a profound sense of responsibility that went beyond data, a drive to make his systems not just efficient, but elegant and humane.\n\n***\n\n4. Last spring, his pour-over coffee setup always felt clunky. After a few hours designing and iterating on his computer, his 3D printer whirred. The next morning, he snapped the newly printed custom bracket into place. It fit with a satisfying, perfect click. It was a tiny object, insignificant to anyone else, but for Ryan, it was pure joy. This was mastery on a personal scale: identifying a flaw in his own small world and engineering a perfect, bespoke solution for himself.\n\n***\n\n5. Two years after moving to the city, at a brewery in SOMA, the conversation turned to a tricky injection molding problem. A stranger at the next table, an industrial designer, leaned over and offered a brilliant solution. For the next hour, they sketched ideas on napkins, lost in a shared language of material stresses and process flow. Ryan went home that night feeling a deep sense of belonging. He hadn't just moved to San Francisco; he had finally found his people."
