Growing up in a Sacramento suburb, the son of an auto mechanic and a primary school teacher, his childhood was filled with the smell of motor oil and the satisfaction of a well-repaired engine. While his friends were obsessed with video games, Ryan was fascinated by the systems that made them possible. He didn\u2019t just want to play; he wanted to understand how the plastic controller was molded and how the circuits were printed onto the board.\n\nThis practical curiosity led him to Cal Poly for a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. The lecture halls were a necessity, but his real education took place in the university\u2019s machine shop. There, amidst the hum of lathes and CNC machines, he discovered his calling: not just designing objects, but designing the *process* of their creation. Upon graduating, he was recruited by a Silicon Valley hardware giant, a move that brought him to San Francisco.\n\nRyan\u2019s role as a Manufacturing Engineer situates him at the critical junction between digital design and physical reality. From his bright, tidy apartment in Hayes Valley, he designs and optimizes assembly lines for factories in Southeast Asia. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his standing desk is a testament to modern industrial work. His days are a mix of intense video calls, poring over CAD models, and analyzing production data, ensuring millions of units can be built flawlessly.\n\nHis life is one of structured precision. Mornings start with pour-over coffee from a local cafe, followed by deep work. A midday run to the Panhandle clears his head. Evenings are for his own projects\u2014tinkering with his high-end 3D printer\u2014or catching up with a small, close-knit group of college friends for craft beer. Ryan isn't a socialite; his connections are deliberate and meaningful. He values the city not for its nightlife, but for its undercurrent of innovation and its community of makers. San Francisco is the perfect backdrop for him: a place of abstract ideas where he gets to figure out, concretely, how to build the future. His ultimate dream is to one day design a fully automated, zero-waste manufacturing process, leaving his mark not on a single product, but on the art of making itself."
