Growing up in a practical, middle-class family in Ann Arbor, Michigan, her fondest memories were not of school, but of the warm, yeasty air in her grandmother's kitchen. Her parents, both university employees, preached the value of a traditional degree, a path Sarah dutifully began at the University of Michigan. However, the structured world of academia felt pale and theoretical compared to the visceral reality of a busy kitchen. A part-time job washing dishes at a popular bistro quickly turned into an obsession. The controlled chaos, the camaraderie, and the creation of tangible joy on a plate felt more like home than any lecture hall.\n\nAfter two years, she made the difficult decision to drop out. It was a turning point that disappointed her family but ignited her spirit. She threw herself into the restaurant world, working her way up from line cook to sous chef, absorbing every technique she could. Drawn by its legendary food scene, she moved to San Francisco at 26 with meager savings and a wealth of ambition. The city was demanding, and she spent years honing her craft in the intense, high-stakes kitchens of Hayes Valley and the Financial District.\n\nIt was during a stint at a celebrated Italian restaurant that she met Marco, a charismatic front-of-house manager who shared her vision for food that was refined but unpretentious. They bonded over long shifts and dreams of a place of their own. For five years, they saved, planned, and built a network.\n\nNow, at 36, Sarah is the co-owner and head chef of \u201cMarrow,\u201d a cozy, 40-table restaurant in the Mission District. She lives in the apartment directly above it, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to her all-consuming passion. Her days are a blur of farmer\u2019s market runs, menu development, and leading her kitchen team through the nightly rush. Her social life is intertwined with her work\u2014post-service drinks with her staff, trading tips with neighboring chefs, and knowing her produce suppliers by name. Sarah's dream isn't about expansion or fame, but sustainability: earning a coveted Bib Gourmand for Marrow and creating a lasting neighborhood institution where both her staff and patrons feel like family."
