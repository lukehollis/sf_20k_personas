The only son of a pragmatic Japanese immigrant father, an accountant, and a mother who channeled her stifled artistic talents into immaculate ikebana arrangements, Kenji grew up navigating the space between expectation and inclination. His childhood was filled with silent observation, sketching in notebooks his father believed were for math equations, and taking solace in the grand, story-filled halls of the de Young and Asian Art Museums.\n\nTo appease his family, he enrolled at UC Berkeley with an undeclared major, heavily leaning toward economics. The turning point was a general education class on the history of architecture. It was a revelation. The structured beauty, the human stories embedded in physical spaces\u2014it was everything he\u2019d ever tried to draw. After a tense family discussion that felt more like a negotiation, he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Design, a compromise between his father\u2019s practicality and his own creative calling.\n\nHis early career was a series of freelance gigs, but he found his niche in exhibit design. It was the perfect synthesis of his skills: architectural precision, a storyteller's heart, and a deep reverence for objects. He didn't just place artifacts in a room; he built worlds for them, using light, shadow, and flow to evoke emotion and understanding.\n\nNow at 46, Kenji lives in a live-work studio in Dogpatch, the industrial-chic neighborhood mirroring his own aesthetic. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life built entirely around his craft. His days follow a quiet rhythm: pour-over coffee, hours lost in digital mockups and sketches, and afternoon walks along the waterfront to watch the cranes and cargo ships. His social life is small but meaningful, centering on a few trusted friends\u2014a curator, a lighting designer, and a chef whose restaurant he helped design.\n\nKenji\u2019s great ambition is to lead the design on a major permanent collection in one of the very museums he escaped to as a boy. It's a desire not just for professional achievement, but to bring his story full circle, creating a space in his native city that might inspire another quiet, observant child."
