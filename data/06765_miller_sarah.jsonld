Raised by a meticulous carpenter father and a librarian mother, she grew up appreciating both the structural integrity of a well-made object and the stories contained within it. Her childhood was one of hiking trails and quiet afternoons spent sketching in notebooks, a stark contrast to her current life.\n\nShe pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History at the University of Oregon, a degree her practical parents found esoteric but supported nonetheless. It was during a part-time job at a small Eugene boutique that she discovered her true calling. She found more joy in redesigning the window display on a quiet Tuesday than in writing essays on Renaissance sculpture. She realized she didn't just want to study art; she wanted to create tangible, immersive experiences with it.\n\nAfter graduation, Sarah took a leap of faith and moved to San Francisco, drawn by its vibrant creative scene. The initial years were a struggle, working entry-level retail jobs and sharing a cramped apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her turning point came when a manager at a large Union Square department store noticed her voluntarily staying late to perfect mannequin layouts. Recognizing her raw talent, he sponsored her entry into the company\u2019s visual merchandising program.\n\nNow 31, Sarah is a Senior Visual Merchandiser, a role that has evolved from hands-on floor work to regional strategy. Her 0.0-mile commute is a recent, hard-won luxury; she orchestrates the aesthetic direction for dozens of stores from a meticulously organized home office in her Hayes Valley apartment. Her space is a testament to her profession\u2014a curated collection of mid-century furniture, minimalist art, and perfectly placed textiles.\n\nSarah\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She starts most days with a coffee from a local cafe, finds inspiration in the architecture and street style she observes on walks with her partner, a UX designer, and maintains a close-knit circle of friends from her early retail days. While she's proud of her corporate success, her ultimate dream is to distill her experience into something of her own: a small, independent home goods and lifestyle boutique, perhaps right there in Hayes Valley."
