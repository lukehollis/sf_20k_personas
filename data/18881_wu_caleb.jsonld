His biological father was a brief, forgotten chapter. The defining male figure of his childhood was David Wu, the quiet, steadfast Chinese-American accountant his mother married when Caleb was seven. Caleb, who took his stepfather\u2019s name, grew up admiring David's diligence and unwavering work ethic, a stark contrast to his own restless energy.\n\nHis educational journey was pragmatic, not passionate. Enrolling in Business Administration at San Jos\u00e9 State felt like the logical next step, but the slow pace of academia grated on him. He saw friends cashing in on the periphery of the tech and real estate booms and felt he was falling behind. After two years, he dropped out for a junior loan processor position at a small mortgage brokerage in the city. It was a gamble, trading a degree for a chance at real-world experience. The risk paid off. Caleb discovered a natural talent for sales and an ability to connect with clients, translating complex financial jargon into achievable dreams.\n\nThe turning point was the 2008 financial crisis. While others fled the industry, Caleb dug in, learning the intricacies of a restructured market. He built a reputation for being honest and relentless, working his way up to Senior Mortgage Loan Officer. Now, at 35, his life is a testament to that hustle. His daily routine starts with a pre-dawn workout before he catches a crowded Muni bus from his Marina apartment to his office in the Financial District. His days are a blur of calls, client meetings, and underwriting reviews, often ending with networking drinks.\n\nCaleb enjoys the fruits of his labor\u2014a comfortable income, a vibrant social life\u2014but feels a persistent sense of being an outsider. He's professionally successful but lacks the academic credentials of many peers. Socially, he navigates the city\u2019s transient dating scene with a degree of detached amusement. His deepest connection to San Francisco is through his work, helping others buy into a city he sometimes feels is only renting to him. His ultimate dream isn't just to write loans, but to be on the other side of the table\u2014using his insider knowledge to invest in and flip properties, finally building the tangible wealth his stepfather so carefully managed for others."
