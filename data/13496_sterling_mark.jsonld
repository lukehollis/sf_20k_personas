A native of suburban Ohio, his journey to San Francisco in the mid-90s was a flight from Midwestern predictability. He initially found his niche in the nascent dot-com boom, working in tech support, but found the work isolating and the culture hollow, trading human connection for the glow of a monitor.\n\nThe dot-com bust of the early 2000s proved to be a difficult but necessary turning point. Jobless and adrift at 32, Mark\u2019s purpose arrived in the form of a family crisis. His younger sister was in a severe car accident, and during her long recovery, he witnessed the profound impact of her Occupational Therapy team. He watched them patiently help her relearn simple tasks\u2014holding a fork, tying a shoe\u2014and realized he wanted to practice that same tangible, life-altering craft. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning his Associate's degree as an Occupational Therapy Assistant, a choice that finally aligned his work with his values.\n\nNow, at 53, Mark has built a life of quiet purpose. He works primarily within the San Francisco Unified School District, helping children with developmental and learning disabilities navigate their world. His days are spent creating adaptive strategies for writing, playing, and socializing. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its village-like feel.\n\nHis earlier marriage dissolved under the strain of his career change, but for the past decade, he\u2019s been in a stable, loving relationship with a landscape architect named David. Their life is a comfortable routine of shared meals, weekend bike rides to Ocean Beach, and tending to their small collection of succulents. Mark\u2019s dreams are no longer grand; he hopes to mentor new OTAs entering the field and save enough to take a long cycling trip through Spain with David. He has traded the promise of stock options for the deep satisfaction of seeing a child successfully button their own coat, a reward he finds infinitely more valuable."

The finality wasn't in the CEO\u2019s email, but in powering down his monitor for the last time. The screen went black, and in his own reflection, he saw a 32-year-old stranger. The hollowness of that moment became the foundation he had to rebuild his life upon, forcing him to seek substance over shimmer.\n\n2.\nHe\u2019ll never forget the fluorescent light of the rehab facility in Ohio. His sister, frustrated and trembling, was trying to eat mashed potatoes. The OT, a woman with impossibly calm hands, guided her grip on the fork. After several attempts, his sister brought a small spoonful to her mouth and wept with relief. In that quiet, monumental victory, Mark saw his future. He wasn't just watching a recovery; he was witnessing the restoration of dignity, a craft he knew he had to learn.\n\n3.\nHis first year as an OTA, he worked with a seven-year-old named Leo who couldn't hold a crayon without his fist cramping. They spent weeks with therapeutic putty and weighted pencils. Mark remembers the day Leo proudly showed him a drawing: a lopsided sun with shaky rays. Below it, in wobbly letters, he'd written his name. That scrawled signature was the first real paycheck Mark felt he\u2019d ever earned, a profound validation that he was finally in the right place, doing essential work.\n\n4.\nAbout a year into dating David, they were repotting succulents on their small balcony in Cole Valley. David was gently explaining how the plants thrive on routine and modest care. Mark looked from David's soil-dusted hands to the setting sun over the park, a quiet warmth spreading through his chest. After the drama of his divorce, he realized this was the love he craved: not a roaring fire, but a garden. Steady, patient, and quietly beautiful. It was the moment he knew he was home.\n\n5.\nJust last week, biking through the Panhandle, the morning fog felt like a cool blanket. The scent of eucalyptus mixed with coffee from the cafe on the corner. He saw the familiar N-Judah train rumble past, its bell a comforting sound of home. He thought of the frantic ambition of his old life and felt a wave of profound gratitude. This simple, rhythmic commute\u2014pedaling toward a day of meaningful work\u2014was the quiet, invaluable prize he had won for himself. This was wealth."
