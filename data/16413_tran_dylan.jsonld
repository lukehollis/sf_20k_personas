Adopted at birth by a loving white couple with a Vietnamese surname from a previous marriage, he was raised in Daly City with a clear-cut, practical worldview. His adoptive father, a building contractor, filled their garage with tools and projects, teaching Dylan the quiet satisfaction of working with his hands. While academic subjects in high school never clicked, the tangible logic of shop class did. It was there, amidst the smell of sawdust and cutting oil, that he found his direction.\n\nInstead of pursuing a four-year degree that felt abstract and pointless, Dylan enrolled in a vocational program for CNC machining at City College. The precision and power of programming a machine to carve steel to within a thousandth of an inch was a revelation. It was a language he understood perfectly. After graduation, he landed an apprenticeship and quickly proved his worth, earning a full-time position at a small, specialized manufacturing plant in the Dogpatch.\n\nNow 25, Dylan's life runs on a predictable, comforting rhythm. His alarm blares before the sun rises in his shared Outer Sunset apartment. The 9.5-mile commute on the Muni T-Line is his time to decompress, listening to industrial metal podcasts as the city wakes up around him. At work, he is meticulous and focused, a respected craftsman in a field increasingly rare in the tech-dominated city.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of colleagues and neighborhood friends, preferring a pint at a dive bar over a trendy SoMa club. He feels like a part of San Francisco's unseen backbone\u2014the makers and laborers who keep the physical city running. His dream isn't wealth, but mastery. He aspires to one day open his own small fabrication shop, a place of precision and pride. Dylan finds his identity not in his unusual name or the city's glittering facade, but in the tangible, perfectly machined objects he creates every day."

He demonstrated how to cut a dovetail joint by hand. Dylan fumbled the first one, but the second\u2026 it slid together with a satisfying, snug fit. For the first time, he felt a spark of true competence, a logic his hands understood even if his mind couldn't grasp variables. That quiet click of wood on wood set the course for his entire life.\n\n2.\nOn his first day of shop class, the teacher did a double-take at the roll call. \u201cTran?\u201d Dylan just nodded, bracing himself. The question came, loaded with curiosity. Instead of getting flustered, 15-year-old Dylan simply replied, \u201cMy dad\u2019s last name.\u201d The teacher shrugged and moved on. It was a small moment, but it taught him that a direct, unadorned fact was the best tool to disarm awkwardness. It was the first time he handled it completely on his own, a quiet declaration of his un-negotiable identity.\n\n3.\nHe was 19, standing before the hulking Haas CNC mill at City College. He\u2019d spent a week writing the G-code. With a deep breath, he hit \u2018Cycle Start.\u2019 The machine roared to life, a controlled thunder that vibrated through the concrete floor. The end mill descended, showering the aluminum block with a stream of coolant and perfect, spiraling chips. It wasn't just cutting metal; it was translating a pure, logical language into physical reality. In that moment, he knew he wasn't just learning a trade; he was finding his voice.\n\n4.\nAround 23, after a brutal 12-hour shift wrestling a warped titanium billet, his mentor bought him a pint at a no-name Dogpatch bar. They didn't talk much, just sat there, hands stained with cutting fluid, the scent of metal still on their clothes. Looking around at the other laborers, Dylan felt a profound sense of belonging. This was his San Francisco\u2014a city of tired hands, honest work, and shared respect. It was a quiet pride that no gleaming downtown office building could ever offer.\n\n5.\nJust last year, rattling along on the T-Line past Islais Creek, he saw it: a 'For Lease' sign on a roll-up door of a small, forgotten-looking garage. Staring at the grimy windows, his vague dream of \u2018one day\u2019 sharpened into a blueprint. He could almost see the mill over there, the lathe by the wall. The commute was no longer just a ride to work; it became a daily reconnaissance mission. That fleeting glimpse of a dusty building transformed his quiet ambition from a wish into a plan."
