A second-generation Chinese American, she was raised under the gentle but firm scaffolding of unspoken expectations. Her parents, who owned a small but bustling grocery store on Irving Street, preached the gospel of hard work and practicality. Emotions were a luxury, a private matter not to be aired. The turning point came in her teens when she watched her father, a man of immense stoicism, quietly buckle under the stress of his business. He never spoke of his depression, but its shadow lengthened over their home. Chloe felt a profound helplessness, a feeling that would become the cornerstone of her career.\n\nVowing to understand the language her family couldn't speak, she pursued psychology at UC Davis before earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. She deliberately chose a field her parents found perplexing; healing wounds they didn\u2019t acknowledge existed. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, she is employed by a major healthcare provider, her work life contained entirely within her one-bedroom apartment. Her commute is the ten steps from her coffee maker to her laptop.\n\nChloe\u2019s days are a structured rhythm of digital sessions, her apartment transforming into a conduit for the pain and healing of others. To preserve her own sanity, she has strict rituals: a morning walk through the Panhandle before her first appointment, a hard shutdown of her computer at 6 PM, and evenings often spent with a tight-knit circle of friends, decompressing over dinner in Hayes Valley. This life is a world away from the Sunset, a conscious choice to build her own identity.\n\nWhile proud of her work, Chloe dreams of more. She yearns to open a small private practice one day, one that specifically serves the Asian American community and bridges the cultural and generational gaps around mental health she knows so well. On a personal level, she hopes to finally learn to surf at Ocean Beach, a daunting challenge that represents a connection to her city on her own terms\u2014not as a daughter or a therapist, but simply as Chloe."
