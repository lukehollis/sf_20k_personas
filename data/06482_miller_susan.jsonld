Raised by an engineer father and a practical mother, her childhood was stable and loving, but emotionally reserved. Susan was the family\u2019s listener, the one who could sense unspoken tensions, a skill that would later define her career. She pursued an English degree, losing herself in the complex inner lives of literary characters, before a post-college volunteer stint at a crisis hotline ignited her true calling. The raw, immediate need for compassionate guidance was a revelation.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco in her late twenties to earn her Master of Social Work, drawn by the city\u2019s reputation for acceptance and progressive thought. Her early career was forged in the crucible of a busy public hospital\u2019s oncology ward, where she guided patients and their families through the most profound crises of their lives. For two decades, she absorbed the relentless trauma and grief of her work, finding solace in the city's foggy embrace and long, restorative walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago with the amicable end of her fifteen-year marriage. The divorce, while sad, catalyzed a shift toward greater self-reliance and professional autonomy. Five years later, feeling the weight of vicarious trauma, she left the hospital system. She converted a spare bedroom into a serene office and transitioned to a private telehealth practice, embracing the 0.0-mile commute.\n\nNow, at 54, Susan\u2019s days are structured but calm. She begins with tea overlooking the fog-draped hills, followed by a walk to a local bakery on Irving Street. Her work consists of back-to-back video sessions, providing a steady, empathetic presence for clients grappling with anxiety and loss. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of old friends, mostly fellow healthcare workers who understand the unique pressures of the field. Her hope is not for retirement, but for evolution. She dreams of leading small, therapeutic writing workshops\u2014blending her old love for literature with her life\u2019s work\u2014and finally taking the extended trip to coastal Japan she has long planned, finding for herself the peace she so expertly helps others to find."
