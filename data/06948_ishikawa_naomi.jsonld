            "value": "Naomi Ishikawa\u2019s name often prompts questions, a story she is happy to tell. She is the daughter of a quiet, second-generation Japanese-American father and a vibrant, warm mother who immigrated from Puebla, Mexico. They met and fell in love in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, the neighborhood that raised Naomi amidst a symphony of Spanish, the scent of fresh pan dulce, and the disciplined structure of her father's small handyman business. She inherited her father's meticulous nature and her mother's effortless ability to connect with anyone.\n\nHer artistic spirit, nurtured by the Mission's murals, led her to SF State to study art history. For two years, she was immersed in a world of theory and beauty, dreaming of becoming a museum curator. However, that path was abruptly cut short when her father suffered a debilitating stroke. Naomi left school without a second thought, taking a full-time job in a retail stockroom to help her mother with the sudden crush of medical bills and living expenses.\n\nThe stockroom job, meant to be temporary, became her career. Naomi\u2019s eye for aesthetics and her innate sense of order made her a natural at merchandising. She was promoted to the sales floor, then assistant manager, and finally, five years ago, to Store Manager of a chic, independent home goods boutique in Hayes Valley.\n\nNow 38, Naomi\u2019s life is contained within a few city blocks. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her small, tidy apartment directly above the shop down a single flight of stairs. Her days are a routine of opening the store, managing inventory, coaching her small team, and charming the neighborhood regulars. Her social life is quiet, consisting of weekly dinners with her widowed mother and drinks with a few trusted friends, most of whom also work in retail.\n\nNaomi finds contentment in the world she has built, but the dream of the curator she might have been lingers. Late at night, after the receipts are tallied, she sometimes sketches designs for her own small shop\u2014a place that would sell curated objects reflecting both the minimalist grace of her Japanese heritage and the brilliant color of her Mexican roots. It\u2019s a distant hope, but it\u2019s hers, a private blueprint for a future just beyond the front door of her store."
