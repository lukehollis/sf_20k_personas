The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up amidst the aisles of his parents\u2019 small neighborhood grocery store on Taraval Street. From an early age, he learned the rhythm of the city through the lives of their customers and the weight of his parents' expectations. They envisioned a prestigious, stable future for him\u2014a doctor or an engineer\u2014a tangible return on their years of sacrifice and hard work.\n\nFollowing their dream, David enrolled at UC Davis as a pre-med student, diligently working through biology and chemistry lectures. The turning point came during his sophomore year when his beloved grandmother was diagnosed with late-stage Type 2 diabetes. He watched helplessly as she struggled to navigate a complex healthcare system, her understanding fractured by language barriers and a deep-seated cultural mistrust of Western medicine. He realized that the greatest barrier to her health wasn't a lack of treatment, but a lack of accessible, culturally competent education. This profound experience reshaped his ambition; he switched his major to Public Health, determined to bridge that exact gap.\n\nNow 25, David works as a Health Education Specialist for a major Bay Area healthcare provider. His 0.0-mile commute is a modern perk; he develops multilingual health literacy campaigns and virtual wellness workshops from his small apartment, just a few blocks from his childhood home. His days are a disciplined blend of old and new San Francisco. A morning run along the Great Highway, buffeted by Pacific winds, is followed by hours of focused work on his laptop.\n\nSocially, David remains close to a tight-knit group of college friends who work in tech and creative fields, often meeting for trivia nights in the Inner Richmond or grabbing dim sum. His relationship with his parents has evolved into one of mutual respect, though they don\u2019t fully grasp his modern, remote career. David\u2019s dream is to eventually launch his own non-profit focused on creating health resources for AAPI seniors, directly honoring the memory and struggle of his grandmother. He is a young man defined by his roots, using the tools of the future to serve the community that raised him."
