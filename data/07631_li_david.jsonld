            "value": "David Li is a cornerstone of his small corner of the Richmond District, as fixed and familiar as the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. Born to parents who immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s, David\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American aspiration. He was a dutiful son, the first in his family to attend college. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, his future feeling bright and open, though he was still unsure what he wanted to be.\n\nThat future narrowed abruptly in his sophomore year when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. David dropped out to help his mother run their small family grocery on Clement Street. The next decade was a blur of stocking shelves, managing finances, and caring for his ailing father. The store eventually closed, and after his father passed, David found himself in his early 30s with a stalled education and a thin resume.\n\nSeeking stability, he completed a certificate program to become a Medical Assistant. It felt right\u2014a profession built on quiet care and meticulous order. For the last twenty years, he has worked for Dr. Evans, a kind, old-school general practitioner. In a unique arrangement, David lives in a small apartment directly above the clinic, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nHis daily routine is his life\u2019s anchor. He opens the clinic at 8 a.m., organizes patient files, and greets the same elderly patients he\u2019s known for years. His relationships are forged in these brief, gentle interactions. He is a bachelor, his life devoted to work and a quiet solitude. His deep connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t in its trendy restaurants or tech booms, but in the fog-laced morning walks to his favorite bakery and the unchanging view from his apartment window.\n\nDavid\u2019s greatest hope is also his greatest fear: that Dr. Evans will retire. The thought of losing his job, his home, and the community he serves in a single blow is a constant, low-level anxiety. His quiet dream is to one day find the time to dust off the old film camera from his college days and simply photograph the quiet, overlooked details of the neighborhood that has been his entire world."
