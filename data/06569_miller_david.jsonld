Raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a thoughtful librarian mother, David inherited a unique blend of analytical thinking and a deep curiosity for human systems. This led him away from a predictable business path to a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown, where he genuinely believed he could redesign civic institutions for the better.\n\nThe reality of governmental bureaucracy, however, felt like a slow-moving glacier. A recruiter from a top-tier consulting firm saw his potential, framing corporate restructuring as a faster, more impactful way to fix broken systems. Lured by the challenge, David dove in. For fifteen years, his life was a blur of airports, client sites, and sterile hotel rooms, his success measured in slide decks and increased shareholder value. He became a Senior Management Consultant, a master problem-solver who was a stranger in his own home.\n\nThe key turning point was involuntary. The global shift to remote work in 2020 grounded his high-flying career, confining him to the two-bedroom SoMa condo he\u2019d previously only used for sleeping between trips. The silence was deafening. The 0.0-mile commute erased the clear line between his work and his life, forcing him to confront a man he barely knew: himself. A long-term relationship had crumbled years earlier under the weight of his travel schedule, leaving him with a wide professional network but few deep, personal connections.\n\nNow, David\u2019s daily routine is radically different. He starts with a run along the Embarcadero, watching the bay wake up, before settling into a day of Zoom calls from his minimalist home office. He has rediscovered his city, not as a hub, but as a community. Weekends are for hiking in the Marin Headlands or exploring the quiet corners of Potrero Hill. He\u2019s re-engaging with his old ideals, pondering pro-bono consulting for local non-profits. His aspiration is no longer just a partnership at the firm; it\u2019s to build a life with authentic connections and a purpose that resonates beyond a balance sheet, finally putting down roots in the city he now truly calls home."
