The son of software engineers who had immigrated from Delhi, Rohan was expected to follow a similar path paved with logic and code. He broke from this script in his senior year of high school, announcing over a tense dinner that he wasn't applying to engineering programs, but to theatre schools. His passion wasn\u2019t in building apps, but in building worlds. His parents, though initially dismayed, eventually conceded, seeing the undeniable talent in his sketches and scale models.\n\nHis time pursuing an MFA in Theatrical Design at UCLA was creatively fulfilling but fraught with financial anxiety. He loved designing sets for Chekhov plays, but realized the path to a stable career in traditional theatre was narrow and arduous. A turning point came during a freelance gig designing a pop-up launch party for a tech company. He recognized that the principles were the same: guiding an audience, creating an atmosphere, and telling a story through space, light, and sound. He had found his niche. He reframed his portfolio, marketing himself not as a set designer, but as an \u201cExperience Designer.\u201d\n\nNow, as a Lead Experience Designer, Rohan orchestrates immersive worlds for everything from themed restaurants to interactive museum exhibits. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District with his partner, Clara, a freelance illustrator. His daily routine begins with a crowded MUNI bus ride to his studio in SoMa. Days are a flurry of team brainstorms, 3D modeling, and client presentations. He loves the energy of San Francisco, a city that uniquely values both his artistic sensibilities and his ability to commercialize them.\n\nEvenings are for unwinding. He and Clara might catch an experimental play at Z Space, share pupusas from a cart on Mission Street, or simply watch the fog roll in from their bay window. Rohan\u2019s ultimate dream is to one day open his own small studio, taking on commercial projects to fund one purely artistic, large-scale immersive theatre piece a year\u2014a way to finally merge the world his parents wanted for him with the one he built for himself."

His dad ran a hand over a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tree trunk, then turned to him. \u201cThe structural integrity is quite sound,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t effusive praise, but it was understanding. It was the first time Rohan felt his father\u2019s world of engineering truly see and respect the world of imagination he was building. That moment cemented his resolve.\n**(Late High School)**\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe air at the tech launch party was thick with manufactured buzz. Standing in the back, Rohan watched venture capitalists navigate the sleek, glowing pathway he\u2019d designed. They were moving exactly as he\u2019d intended, drawn from one product demo to the next. It wasn't Chekhov, but the realization was electric: it was still stagecraft. The audience, the atmosphere, the story\u2014it was all there. In that moment of clarity, his financial anxiety eased, replaced by the thrill of a new, viable path for his art.\n**(During his MFA Program)**\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe and Clara sat on their fire escape, a foil-wrapped pupusa shared between them, the fog slowly erasing the Sutro Tower. They had just left an incomprehensible but beautiful piece of performance art at Z Space. \u201cI have no idea what that was about,\u201d Clara said, laughing. \u201cMe neither,\u201d Rohan replied, \u201cbut wasn't it amazing?\u201d In the comfortable silence that followed, he felt a profound sense of peace. This was it\u2014the life he\u2019d fought for, shared with someone who understood his language of feeling and form.\n**(A few years ago)**\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe first time he rode the MUNI to his SoMa studio after being promoted to Lead Designer, he felt a surge of belonging. Pressed between a startup founder checking stock prices and a line cook smelling of garlic, he gazed out at the city. He wasn't the anxious Fremont kid or the struggling UCLA student anymore. He was a part of this chaotic, creative, commercial engine. This crowded, rumbling bus ride wasn\u2019t a chore; it was a daily confirmation that he had found his place.\n**(After his promotion)**\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn opening night for the interactive exhibit at the Academy of Sciences, he watched a small child gasp, reaching out to touch a projection of glowing phytoplankton he\u2019d designed. The child\u2019s uninhibited wonder was the purest form of audience feedback. It wasn't a grade or a paycheck; it was magic. That tiny, perfect moment of connection between his design and a human heart crystallized his ultimate goal: to build worlds that could fund his life, but also worlds that could simply inspire awe.\n**(Last year)**"
