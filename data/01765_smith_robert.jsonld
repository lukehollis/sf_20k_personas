But to the students and staff of Sunnyside Elementary, Robert is as real as the polished gleam on the hallway floors. Born in Daly City to a stoic handyman and a tired waitress, Robert\u2019s upbringing was one of practicality, not ambition. He learned to fix things because they were broken, not because it was a career path.\n\nSchool was a place he endured, not embraced. The abstract concepts on the blackboard felt distant compared to the tangible reality of a leaky faucet or a sputtering engine. He left after high school, forgoing college for a string of jobs that stained his hands with grease and sawdust: auto body shops, construction sites, warehouse inventory. A brief, ill-fated marriage in his twenties ended as quietly as it began, leaving him with a deeper sense of solitude. For two decades, he drifted, a competent but unremarkable worker in the background of other people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe turning point came at 45. A temp agency sent him to cover a custodial shift at Sunnyside Elementary in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. The retiring custodian, a man named Arthur, saw in Robert a kindred spirit\u2014a quiet man who took pride in his work. When Arthur left for good, he recommended Robert for the permanent position, which came with a small apartment in the school's basement. His commute became zero.\n\nNow, at 54, Robert\u2019s life is defined by the school\u2019s rhythms. He wakes before the first bell, the smell of coffee mingling with floor wax. He is the silent keeper of the school\u2019s secrets\u2014he knows which teacher stress-eats cookies, which fourth-grader draws comics on the bathroom stalls, and which floorboards creak the loudest. His social connections are observational; a nod to a teacher, a rare smile for a child who thanks him. His dream is not of wealth or travel, but of convincing the district to fund a small garden in the neglected patch behind the cafeteria. He imagines teaching a few interested kids how to grow tomatoes.\n\nRobert Smith doesn't have a grand story for a database to parse. Instead, his story is written in the spotless windows, the scuff-free floors, and the unwavering security of a place he has quietly, diligently, made his home."
