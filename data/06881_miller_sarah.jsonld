Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her childhood was defined by drizzly hikes and a sense of pragmatic, middle-class stability. Her fascination wasn't with code, but with systems. She loved seeing how cities breathed, how infrastructure shaped human behavior, which led her to a Master's degree in Urban Planning from the University of Washington.\n\nHer dream of redesigning public spaces collided with the 2008 recession. With municipal jobs scarce, Sarah took a temp position as an office coordinator at a burgeoning Seattle startup to pay her student loans. It was there she discovered her true talent. While engineers and designers created chaos, Sarah created order. She instinctively built Gantt charts, managed stakeholder expectations, and translated creative ideas into actionable steps. A senior manager noticed her knack for \"herding cats\" and sponsored her Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. This was her key turning point\u2014the moment she consciously traded city blueprints for product roadmaps.\n\nA lucrative offer brought her to San Francisco eight years ago. Today, she\u2019s a Senior Project Manager for a major tech firm, working entirely from her apartment in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a unique kind of freedom and confinement. Her days are anchored by a ritual: a morning walk down Valencia Street for an oat milk latte, followed by a relentless schedule of international Zoom calls. She decompressing by tending to the absurd number of plants on her fire escape or attending a weekly pottery class, a tangible escape from her digital world.\n\nHer social life is a curated collection of close friends, mostly former colleagues, who understand the industry's pressures. Though successful, she feels a professional restlessness. The urban planner inside her is reawakening, and Sarah dreams of pivoting once more. Her ultimate goal is to lead a civic tech initiative, using her project management expertise to tackle the very urban problems she once studied\u2014homelessness, transportation, public resource allocation. She loves San Francisco for its vibrant, chaotic energy, and now hopes to finally leave her mark on its system, not just as a resident, but as a builder."
