Born and raised in the Richmond District, David is the only son of immigrants from Hong Kong who poured their life savings and every waking hour into the restaurant they opened in 1972. His childhood was a soundtrack of clattering woks, the cadence of Cantonese spoken in the kitchen, and the friendly greetings he was taught to offer regular customers.\n\nWhile his parents envisioned him taking over the family business, David harbored his own dream. In the early 90s, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, fascinated by graphic design. For two years, he sketched logos and studied typography, imagining a life outside the familiar world of food service. That future evaporated when his father suffered a major heart attack. With his mother overwhelmed, David made the quiet, dutiful decision to drop out of college and step into his father\u2019s shoes. He never looked back.\n\nWhat started as an obligation slowly transformed into a source of pride. David learned the business from the inside out, mastering inventory, managing staff, and cultivating the warm, familial atmosphere his father had established. He met his wife, Mei, when her family became regulars; their courtship unfolded over shared plates of salt-and-pepper crab. Now, she manages the books while he runs the floor.\n\nToday, David is a fixture of the neighborhood. His daily routine is a familiar rhythm: waking before dawn to review orders, greeting suppliers at the back door, and personally orchestrating the lunch and dinner rushes. His social life consists of the other merchants on Clement Street and the generations of families he has served. His deepest hope and anxiety revolve around his daughter, a junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science. He is immensely proud of her ambition but privately grieves that she has no interest in the restaurant. He dreams not of retirement, but of finding a way to preserve his parents\u2019 legacy, wrestling with the knowledge that he may be the last Wong to keep the Golden Dragon\u2019s doors open."
