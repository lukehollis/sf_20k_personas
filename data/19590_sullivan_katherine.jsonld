Her mother was her hero, and Katherine grew up assuming she would follow her into the demanding but rewarding world of nursing. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, her heart set on a career in hands-on patient care.\n\nThe turning point came during her second year of clinicals. Her own mother was diagnosed with a fast-moving cancer, and Katherine found herself providing grueling, around-the-clock care. The raw, emotional reality of nursing her own family member, witnessing the pain up close, fractured her professional ambition. The burnout was profound. Feeling she no longer had the emotional fortitude for the front lines, she left the program just a few credits shy of her degree.\n\nNeeding a job, she took an entry-level administrative position at a UCSF health clinic. Her innate empathy and deep understanding of the medical world, however, made her invaluable. Over the decades, she proved her worth, rising from a scheduler to the trusted Patient Care Coordinator she is today. She is the calm, organized hub that connects anxious families to social workers, translates insurance jargon, and ensures a patient\u2019s journey through the complex medical system is as smooth as possible. She never became a nurse, but she helps hundreds of patients every year.\n\nNow 53, Katherine lives a quiet, ordered life in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Divorced in her late thirties with no children, her social life is a small, tight constellation of friends from work and a neighborhood book club. Her daily routine is defined by the N-Judah Muni line, which carries her the 3.5 miles to and from work. For Katherine, San Francisco isn't the city of tech booms and disruption; it's the comfort of her foggy neighborhood, weekend walks in Golden Gate Park, and the stability she has painstakingly built. Her dream isn't grand ambition, but quiet contentment: to retire with enough savings to travel to Ireland, connect with her Sullivan roots, and continue finding fulfillment in the life she created from the pieces of the one she left behind."

Katherine watched her kick off her white nursing shoes, a deep sigh escaping her lips. But when her mother sat down at the kitchen table and told a story about holding an elderly patient\u2019s hand through the night, her fatigue was replaced by a quiet pride. In that moment, Katherine knew. She didn\u2019t just want to be like her mom; she wanted to *be* her mom, a bringer of comfort.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in the Daly City house she grew up in, now a makeshift hospice. The only sounds were her mother\u2019s shallow breaths and the hum of the oxygen machine. Her mom, paper-thin in the dim light, whispered for a glass of water. As Katherine\u2019s hands trembled, spilling water on the bedside table, she felt a profound, chilling emptiness. She wasn't an aspiring healer; she was just a terrified daughter watching her hero fade. Her ambition fractured in that cold splash of water.\n\n3.\nA few months into her new desk job at UCSF, feeling like a failure in her sensible shoes, an elderly man was weeping with frustration over an insurance denial. On instinct, Katherine sat with him, took the paper, and quietly translated the jargon, step by step. When he looked at her with immense gratitude and said, \"You saved me,\" she felt a familiar warmth spread through her chest. It wasn't the hands-on care she'd trained for, but it was care all the same.\n\n4.\nShe recalls the first truly quiet Sunday in her Inner Richmond apartment, a year after the divorce. The fog was thick outside, muffling the world, and the N-Judah rumbled past on the street below. She was sitting with a book and a cup of tea, surrounded only by her own things. Instead of the loneliness she\u2019d dreaded, a wave of profound contentment washed over her. This small, quiet space was hers. This peace was something she had built all by herself.\n\n5.\nDuring a book club meeting a few years ago, the novel was set in County Clare. As her friend flipped through photos of her own trip\u2014misty green hills, crumbling stone walls, a landscape that looked as beautifully stubborn as her own family\u2014Katherine felt an unexpected, powerful pull. It wasn't just wanderlust. It was a call home to a place she\u2019d never been. Seeing those pictures, her retirement savings suddenly had a name, a face, and a purpose: Sullivan. Ireland."
