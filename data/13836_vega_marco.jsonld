            "value": "Marco Vega is a product of San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, born to a Filipino mother who worked as a nurse at SF General and a Chicano father who ran a small auto body shop. Growing up in the 80s, the neighborhood was his world\u2014a vibrant, chaotic mosaic of cultures and languages. He was bright but restless, more interested in the city's pulse than in textbooks. He enrolled at SF State with vague intentions but dropped out after two years, captivated by the raw energy of the 90s real estate market.\n\nLacking a degree, Marco compensated with raw charisma and an instinct for opportunity. He started as a real estate agent, his deep local knowledge giving him an edge. He sold Mission Victorians to young dot-com professionals, witnessing the first wave of gentrification from the front lines. This was his first turning point; he saw that the future wasn't just in property, but in the technology that managed it. He leveraged his sales record to join an early-stage Proptech startup, convincing them they needed his industry knowledge more than an MBA. He was right. His career ascended with the tech booms, built on handshakes and a genuine understanding of the market.\n\nHis relentless drive came at a personal cost, contributing to a divorce in his late thirties. Now, at 52, his life has found a steadier rhythm. He lives in a tastefully renovated Noe Valley home, where his 0.0-mile commute takes him to a sleek home office overlooking the city. His days are a mix of intense video calls and quiet moments with his partner, a landscape architect. He has a solid, if sometimes distant, relationship with his daughter, now a graduate student at UCLA.\n\nMarco\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and complicated. He loves the city that made him, but grapples with the paradox of his success\u2014his work in real estate technology has accelerated the very changes that have displaced communities like the one he grew up in. His quiet aspiration is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder. He dreams of using his capital and influence to fund a Mission-based incubator for local entrepreneurs, a way to invest back into the roots he sometimes feels he betrayed."
