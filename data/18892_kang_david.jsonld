The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in Daly City, David grew up straddling two worlds. His parents preached the virtues of tireless work and financial security, hoping he would become an engineer or doctor. But while studying economics at UC Berkeley, a volunteer position at a youth shelter in Oakland rewired his ambitions. He saw systemic cracks that no spreadsheet could fix and felt an undeniable pull toward mending them.\n\nHis decision to pursue a Master of Social Work was a point of gentle, prolonged friction with his family. They couldn't understand why he would choose a path of such emotional toil for modest pay. David, however, felt he had found his calling. His early career was spent in the trenches as a case manager in San Francisco's Tenderloin, working with homeless youth and families in crisis. The burnout was immense, but the small victories\u2014a teen enrolling in community college, a family securing stable housing\u2014fueled his resolve.\n\nA key turning point came in his late thirties with a promotion to Program Director. The shift from direct service to administration was challenging, trading fieldwork for grant writing, staff supervision, and strategic planning. It also coincided with the amicable end of his marriage; his work, a source of immense purpose, had left little room for his partner. Now, at 51, David lives a life of contented routine in the Inner Sunset.\n\nHis day begins with the rumbling harmony of the N Judah MUNI line, a 3.5-mile journey downtown where he reads or listens to podcasts. His work is a cascade of meetings, mentoring younger social workers, and ensuring the programs he built have a lasting impact. Evenings are for decompression: long walks through Golden Gate Park, cooking simple Korean dishes from his mother\u2019s recipes, and occasional dinners with a close circle of friends from his field. David no longer dreams of changing the world, but of leaving his small corner of it stronger and more compassionate. His aspiration is to see the leaders he has mentored carry the torch, ensuring the work continues long after he retires."

When he finally told his parents he was pursuing social work, not an MBA, his father simply set down his chopsticks with a soft click. His mother\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears she wouldn't let fall. It wasn't anger, but a deep, sorrowful confusion. In that quiet, David learned that his own conviction would have to be his primary source of warmth and validation.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt the Oakland youth shelter, he found a crayon drawing taped to the metal frame of a bunk bed. It depicted a perfect little house with a smoking chimney and a smiling stick-figure family underneath a bright yellow sun. Seeing such a pure, simple hope in a place defined by its absence was a physical blow. He felt the cold, abstract world of his economics textbooks dissolve, replaced by a visceral need to protect that fragile dream. In that moment, his life\u2019s purpose clicked into focus with startling clarity.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe phone call came late, on a Tuesday when burnout felt like a physical weight on his shoulders. It was Marcus, a teen he\u2019d worked with for two years in the Tenderloin, calling from a payphone. \u201cI got in, man. City College. I start in the fall.\u201d David sat in his small office, the city\u2019s sirens a dull moan outside, and felt a tidal wave of joy so fierce it almost knocked the wind out of him. That single victory sustained him for years, a shield against the cynicism that threatened his work.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe end of his marriage wasn\u2019t a dramatic fight but a quiet conversation on their sofa in the Inner Richmond. Streetlight filtered through the bay window as his wife, Sarah, said, \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, David, but you\u2019re married to your work.\u201d He didn\u2019t argue because he knew it was true. Looking at her, he felt a profound, aching sadness\u2014not of failure, but of consequence. It was a stark lesson on the finite nature of one\u2019s energy and the sacrifices a calling can inadvertently demand.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, he watched from his office doorway as Maria, a young social worker he\u2019d mentored, handled a distraught parent with a kind of masterful empathy he hadn't explicitly taught. She was firm, compassionate, and incredibly patient. He felt a swell of pride so deep it was almost paternal. He wasn\u2019t needed. The work would continue. It was a profound shift, a feeling of peaceful release, realizing his greatest impact was no longer his own actions, but in the people he had empowered to carry the torch."
