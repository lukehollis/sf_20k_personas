            "value": "Sarah Davies was a product of a quiet, academic household in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The daughter of a university librarian and a philosophy professor, her childhood was defined by the hushed reverence of libraries and the Socratic method applied at the dinner table. This upbringing instilled in her a deep appreciation for structure, logic, and the elegant organization of knowledge. She naturally pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, expecting a stable career managing university archives.\n\nThe turning point came in 1997. The nascent internet was a chaotic, digital Wild West, and a friend who had moved to San Francisco called her, describing a desperate need for people who understood how to structure information. Lured by the revolutionary promise and a significant pay increase, Sarah moved west. She became an \"Information Architect\" before the title was common, trading card catalogs for sitemaps and user flows. She weathered the dot-com bust, her foundational skills proving more durable than the fleeting business models of her employers.\n\nFor over two decades, Sarah helped build the digital architecture for a half-dozen tech companies, from scrappy startups to the giants that now define the skyline. Her personal life followed a similar arc of boom and bust; a long-term partnership with a software engineer, forged in the crucible of 120-hour work weeks, eventually fractured under the same pressure, leaving her single but self-sufficient in her mid-forties.\n\nNow 54, Sarah lives a deliberately tranquil life in a sun-drenched Cole Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a walk to a local cafe before settling into her home office. There, she untangles complex data systems for her remote employer, bringing order to digital chaos. Her social life is a curated collection of long-held friendships\u2014other tech veterans who, like her, prefer a hike in the Presidio to a networking event.\n\nSarah feels like a permanent, settled transplant. She loves the city's intellectual vigor and proximity to the ocean but has grown weary of the relentless pace of her industry. Her dream isn't another promotion but a final career pivot: to take her decades of experience and apply it to a museum or a non-profit, helping them preserve and present their collections to the world\u2014a return to her roots, bringing the wisdom of the library to the digital age on her own terms."
