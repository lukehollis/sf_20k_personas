Raised in the predictable comfort of Walnut Creek, his parents\u2014an accountant and a dental hygienist\u2014envisioned a practical, lucrative career for their bright, bookish son. Kevin, however, was drawn to the past. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially just a BART ride away, but the city\u2019s dense, layered history and chaotic energy quickly became his true major. He stayed for his Master's in History, dreaming of a tweed-jacketed life in academia.\n\nThe turning point came during his late twenties. The PhD path felt isolating, a world of publish-or-perish pressures far removed from the tangible world he studied. While working on his thesis and feeling adrift, he took a long-term substitute position at a public high school in the Sunset District. The experience was a revelation. Explaining the fall of Rome to a room of skeptical teenagers was more challenging and infinitely more rewarding than any academic conference. He found his calling not in the ivory tower, but in the classroom. He changed his focus, earned his teaching credential, and never looked back.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, Kevin has been a history teacher at a high school just a few blocks from his rent-controlled apartment in the Outer Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a morning walk through the fog, coffee from a local cafe in hand. His life is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. He\u2019s a familiar face at Green Apple Books, knows the best dim sum spots on Clement Street, and spends his weekends grading papers at Java Beach Cafe or taking long, contemplative walks along the coastline at Lands End.\n\nNow 41 and single after a long-term relationship ended over the classic SF dilemma\u2014stay or go\u2014Kevin finds fulfillment in his small, stable world. He has a close circle of friends, mostly fellow teachers with whom he shares potlucks and cynical-but-loving gallows humor about their profession. His dreams are no longer grand; he hopes to see his students, especially those from challenging backgrounds, make it to college. He nurtures a quiet ambition to write a popular history book, something accessible and exciting. Kevin Miller is a fixture, a piece of San Francisco\u2019s less-glamorous but essential foundation, finding his purpose in shaping the future by teaching the past."
