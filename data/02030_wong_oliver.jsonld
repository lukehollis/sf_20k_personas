He was born and raised across the city in the Richmond District, the son of a pragmatic auto mechanic and a diligent seamstress. His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, valued stability and tangible skills, so they were quietly baffled when Oliver enrolled at UC Santa Cruz to study Art History. For them, art was a hobby, not a career. For Oliver, it was a language of form and fabric he understood better than anything else.\n\nHis post-college plan to work in a museum quickly soured. The academic world felt slow and stuffy, disconnected from the living, breathing art he loved. A part-time job to pay his student loans at a high-end clothing store became his unlikely calling. He wasn\u2019t just selling a sweater; he was explaining the ethics of its merino wool and the heritage of its cable-knit pattern. His passion was infectious.\n\nThe turning point came when he was hired at \u201cAtelier Valise,\u201d an exclusive boutique known for its minimalist Japanese and Scandinavian designers. The owner, a discerning woman named Isabelle, saw his potential immediately, mentoring him from sales associate to store manager in just three years. When the chic loft apartment above the shop became vacant, she offered it to him as part of his compensation\u2014a golden handcuff that cemented his life around his work.\n\nNow, at 28, Oliver\u2019s commute is a single flight of stairs. His days are a routine of steamed garments, inventory management, and charming clientele. His social life consists of after-work drinks with other local retailers and the occasional date with someone who rarely understands his devotion to the perfect collection. He is deeply connected to his small corner of San Francisco, a polished world of his own making. His dream is to become a buyer for the brand, to travel to Tokyo and Copenhagen, but he also quietly fears his world has become too small. In the late hours, after locking the shop, he sits in his apartment above, the quiet hum of the street below a constant reminder of the life contained within his perfect, beautiful block."
