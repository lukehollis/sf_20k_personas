His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this: his apartment is in a sleek, mixed-use building in Hayes Valley, a development he helped shepherd through the city\u2019s labyrinthine approval process years ago.\n\nBorn in San Jose to first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business, David\u2019s childhood was defined by the scent of steam and the endless sprawl of the South Bay. He watched orchards turn into strip malls and felt a burgeoning desire to create order from the chaos. This drive propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master\u2019s in Urban and Regional Planning, fascinated by the power of design to shape human experience.\n\nInitially drawn to the private sector, the 2008 financial crisis was a turning point. Seeing ambitious projects crumble overnight, David pivoted to public service, believing that government had a more stable, long-term role in building equitable communities. He joined the San Francisco Planning Department, where his meticulous nature and quiet dedication saw him rise to a senior position.\n\nAt 42, David\u2019s life is a curated map of his own making. His morning routine involves a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green, coffee from a local cafe whose permit he reviewed, and an analytical eye on pedestrian flow and public space usage. His social life is small but solid, built around a handful of colleagues and a few old university friends. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a quiet casualty of his intense focus on his career\u2014a fact he reflects on with a mix of regret and acceptance.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is his life\u2019s work. He sees the city not just as a home, but as a complex, living organism he is privileged to tend to. His dream isn't fame, but legacy: to walk through a neighborhood in 20 years and see families thriving in a park he zoned, or a community flourishing around a transit corridor he championed. Lately, however, a new aspiration has surfaced\u2014a desire to build a personal life as thoughtfully designed as his professional one, finding a human connection that exists outside of blueprints and policy reports."

The air, which should have smelled of fruit, smelled of diesel and upturned earth. His father, a man of few words, just sighed. It wasn\u2019t anger, but a deep, weary acceptance. David felt it not as a loss of trees, but as the erasure of a place. It planted a quiet, fierce seed in him: to build things that could withstand that sigh.\n\n2.\nThe architectural model of the waterfront tower felt like a tombstone. It was 2008, and David, then 28, had just been laid off from the private development firm. His boss had said \u201cmarket realities,\u201d but looking at the miniature glass building, a future that would never exist, he felt only a profound hollowness. In that empty sales office, he vowed his work would serve something more resilient than a stock ticker. It would serve communities. The next day, he started his application for the SF Planning Department.\n\n3.\nThe fight over the extra five feet of sidewalk width had been brutal, lasting months. But years later, standing across from the finished Hayes Valley building where he now lived, he saw it. A mother paused to tie her child\u2019s shoe, out of the main flow of pedestrians, using the space he\u2019d championed. No one knew his role. It wasn\u2019t a grand, triumphant feeling, but a deep, quiet resonance. The abstract language of zoning variance had become a small, human moment of grace. It was everything.\n\n4.\nIt wasn't a fight. That was the worst part. Five years ago, his partner Sarah had looked at him across their dinner table and said, \u201cYou describe the sightlines on Market Street with more passion than you describe our future.\u201d The statement was delivered without accusation, as a simple fact. David looked down at his plate, the city maps in his head suddenly feeling like a prison. He had no counterargument. In that silence, he felt the foundation of his personal life crack, a structural failure he had completely failed to notice.\n\n5.\nJust last week, sitting in Patricia\u2019s Green, he watched an elderly couple wordlessly share a croissant, tearing off pieces for each other. His planner's brain, usually calculating pedestrian density, went quiet. He was just watching them, feeling an acute sense of their shared, unplannable history. A pang hit his chest\u2014not the familiar sting of regret, but a new, gentler ache of pure longing. It felt like seeing a blueprint for the first time, for a life he now desperately wanted to build."
