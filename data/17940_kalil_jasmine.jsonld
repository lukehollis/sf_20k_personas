Raised in Daly City, she grew up in a home filled with the aromas of both Filipino adobo, from her pragmatic nurse mother, and Lebanese kibbeh, from her entrepreneurial father who ran a small import business. Her childhood was spent not with dolls, but with the broken electronics and gadgets her father brought home. While her parents saw curiosities, Jasmine saw puzzles, methodically disassembling and reassembling them, fostering an innate curiosity for how things worked.\n\nHer educational path was practical and focused. She attended Cal Poly for her undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering, excelling in a hands-on learning environment. A key turning point came during her senior project, where her team designed a low-cost, adaptive eating utensil for individuals with limited mobility. Seeing her design tangibly improve someone's daily life ignited a new passion; engineering wasn't just about mechanics, it was about human impact. This realization propelled her to pursue a Master's at UC Berkeley, specializing in product design.\n\nNow, at 26, Jasmine has carved out a life that reflects her values. She works as a Product Design Engineer for a hardware startup in the Dogpatch, a perfect fit for her desire to create tangible products. Her 2.8-mile commute is a cherished daily ritual; a brisk bicycle ride from her shared apartment in the Mission, over the Potrero Hill climb that serves as her morning coffee. Her days are spent in CAD software and on the workshop floor, collaborating on prototypes for next-generation consumer electronics. Evenings often involve bouldering at Dogpatch Boulders with work friends or exploring the Mission's vibrant food scene.\n\nJasmine loves San Francisco\u2019s blend of grit and innovation, a reflection of her own upbringing. While professionally fulfilled, her ultimate dream is to lead her own design firm focused on sustainable, accessible technology\u2014products that, like that first university project, make a discernible difference in people's lives. She remains deeply connected to her family, often cycling back to Daly City on weekends for a comforting home-cooked meal that tastes of her unique heritage."

The house smelled like burnt wiring for three days as she meticulously took it apart on the living room floor. Her mother sighed, her father chuckled. But the moment she found the disconnected filament, coaxed it back into place, and was rewarded with a loud *POP* and a perfectly golden-brown slice of bread\u2014that was pure magic. It wasn\u2019t about fixing a thing; it was about understanding its secret language. That satisfaction became her life\u2019s compass.\n\n2.\nAt Cal Poly, it wasn\u2019t the diploma but Mrs. Gable\u2019s quiet \u201cthank you\u201d that changed everything. During the final user test for her adaptive utensil, she watched the elderly woman, whose hands trembled with Parkinson\u2019s, feed herself a spoonful of soup without spilling a drop. Tears welled in Mrs. Gable\u2019s eyes, and in that instant, Jasmine\u2019s world shifted. Engineering was no longer about gears and forces; it was about dignity. The realization hit her with the force of a physical blow, setting her on a definitive path.\n\n3.\nHer first week at the Dogpatch startup, she crested Potrero Hill on her bike, lungs burning. Below, the early morning fog broke, revealing the shipyard cranes and the glittering bay. It felt like a private coronation. This daily climb, this physical price of admission to a city she loved, became her ritual. It wasn\u2019t a commute; it was a promise she made to herself each morning\u2014a promise of hard work, grit, and the breathtaking view that comes after the struggle. It felt like earning her place.\n\n4.\nJust last month, cycling home to Daly City, the familiar aroma hit her before she even opened the door: her mom\u2019s garlicky adobo and her dad\u2019s earthy kibbeh, their scents mingling in the small kitchen. Sitting at the table, listening to their familiar banter, she felt every facet of herself click into place. The pragmatic nurse and the dreaming entrepreneur, the engineer and the designer\u2014it all made sense there. That meal wasn't just food; it was her entire history, served warm on a plate.\n\n5.\nShe\u2019d been stuck on a V4 problem at Dogpatch Boulders for an hour, her knuckles raw and her ego bruised. Her friend yelled up from the mat, \u201cTry the side pull! Change your hip angle!\u201d Jasmine recalibrated, trusted the tiny foothold, and suddenly, the route flowed. Hanging at the top, chalk-dusted and breathing hard, she felt the same electric thrill as debugging a complex circuit board. The joy wasn\u2019t just in solving it, but in seeing the problem from a new perspective. It was collaboration in motion."
