Born to an Iranian father who arrived in California as an engineering student after the revolution, and a white American mother from Ohio with a passion for local history, Kian grew up in San Jose navigating two distinct cultural currents. His home was filled with the aroma of saffron rice and the sound of Persian poetry, while his life outside was classic Silicon Valley suburbia. This duality made him a keen observer of systems\u2014how they connect people and, more often, how they fail them.\n\nHe saw the stark contrast between the booming tech campuses and the aging, underfunded public infrastructure around them. This observation fueled a passion that led him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree and later, a Master's in Public Policy. He resisted the lucrative pull of the tech industry, drawn instead to the complex, human-centric problems of urban life. He chose to work for the city that embodied this challenge most acutely: San Francisco.\n\nNow, as a Policy Analyst for the SFMTA, Kian is living his mission. His 1.8-mile commute from his modest Hayes Valley apartment to his office at 1 South Van Ness is daily, unofficial fieldwork. He doesn\u2019t just ride Muni; he analyzes it, noting the headways on the N Judah, the crowding on the 21 Hayes, and the real-world impact of the policies he helps shape. His days are spent deep in transit data and impact reports, translating complex spreadsheets into recommendations for a more equitable and efficient system.\n\nKian\u2019s social life is a mix of grad school friends who work in various city departments and a close-knit soccer team he joined. He unwinds by running through the Panhandle or trying new restaurants in his vibrant neighborhood. He is a pragmatic idealist, often frustrated by bureaucratic inertia but undeterred in his belief that good policy can improve lives. His dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder, but to one day look at a seamless, reliable Muni map and know his data helped connect a senior to a doctor's appointment or a student to their school."

His father, an engineer, muttered about schedules and system failures. But Kian watched an elderly woman, her grocery bags heavy on the pavement, her face etched with exhaustion. In that moment, the transit failure wasn't a technical problem; it was a deeply human one. It was the first time he saw infrastructure not as concrete and steel, but as a lifeline that could be fragile and broken.\n\n2.\nIt was a career fair during his senior year at Berkeley. He stood between a tech giant\u2019s gleaming booth offering stock options and the City of Oakland\u2019s modest table. His classmates flocked to the tech side. He picked up a pamphlet on zoning regulations, its text dense and unglamorous, and felt a quiet, defiant pull. This was real. This was the complex, messy work he was meant for. He walked away from the promise of wealth without a second thought, his path into public service firmly set.\n\n3.\nSix months into his job at SFMTA, he got an email. It was a forwarded message from a custodial worker at SF General. Kian\u2019s analysis had justified adding one earlier 22 Fillmore run at 5:15 AM. The message was simple: \u201cThank you. I can get to my shift on time now.\u201d Reading it, Kian felt a warmth spread through his chest that no spreadsheet could quantify. It wasn\u2019t a revolution, but it was proof. Proof that his data points had a heartbeat, reinforcing his belief in incremental change.\n\n4.\nLast spring, playing soccer under the lights at the Beach Chalet fields. The salty fog rolled in so thick they could barely see the opposite goal. After a tough-fought tie, his teammates\u2014a public defender, a teacher, a chef\u2014huddled together, laughing, their breath pluming in the damp air. Covered in mud and exhausted, Kian felt a profound sense of belonging. In that moment, San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a network of transit lines to be analyzed; it was a team, and he was part of it.\n\n5.\nJust last week, waiting for a ghosted N Judah train at Duboce Park. He watched a young woman in scrubs, clearly a nurse, anxiously checking her phone, likely late for a hospital shift. He felt a familiar knot of frustration\u2014not just as a rider, but as an analyst who knew the cascading data points behind this one woman\u2019s delay. It wasn\u2019t an abstract problem; it was her stress, her commute. The moment sharpened his resolve, turning bureaucratic annoyance into a personal mandate to make the system work for *her*."
