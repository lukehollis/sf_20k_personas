Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, he is the only child of immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, bustling laundromat on Clement Street for thirty-five years. His childhood was a soundtrack of humming dryers and the precise, rhythmic folding of sheets. While his parents valued tangible labor, Benjamin was drawn to the logical, invisible world of computers, spending his youth tinkering with a secondhand PC in his bedroom.\n\nForegoing a four-year university, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems. His timing was imperfect; he entered the workforce just as the first dot-com bubble burst. Witnessing the city's frantic boom-and-bust cycle firsthand instilled in him a deep appreciation for stability over glamour. He found his niche not in a fast-paced startup, but as a dependable IT Support Specialist. For the past decade, he\u2019s worked for a large, established tech firm that allows him to work entirely from home\u2014a 0.0-mile commute from his bed to his desk in his cozy, rent-controlled apartment, just six blocks from his childhood home.\n\nA key turning point was the passing of his father five years ago. Now, his connection to his aging mother is his life\u2019s anchor. Their weekly dim sum ritual is non-negotiable. His social life is small but solid, consisting of a few high school friends who, like him, have remained in the Bay Area. His days are a quiet routine: logging in to solve a global stream of technical problems, breaking for a walk to a local bakery for an egg tart, and logging off precisely at 5 PM.\n\nThough comfortable, Benjamin feels a growing disconnect. His entire professional life exists on screens, a world away from the physical work he grew up around. His quiet dream is to open a small workshop dedicated to restoring vintage audio equipment\u2014turntables, amplifiers, and speakers. It\u2019s a hope to reconnect with the tangible, to fix things with his hands, and to create something lasting in a city that constantly reinvents itself. He remains a quiet observer of his evolving city, a bridge between the analog San Francisco of his parents and the digital world he now maintains."

His father, smelling of detergent and steam, is trying to show him the impossible geometry of folding a fitted sheet. Benjamin\u2019s hands fumble, his mind miles away, picturing the logical circuits of his video game console. When his father sighs, not with anger but with a quiet acceptance, Benjamin feels the first true pang of divergence. It isn't a rebellion, but a quiet understanding that their hands were built to solve entirely different kinds of problems.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, the fog is a permanent curtain outside his bedroom window. He finally gets the secondhand PC to boot up. The triumphant, mechanical chime cuts through the distant hum of the dryers from the family business downstairs. In the glow of the monochrome screen, he feels like he\u2019s discovered a secret portal. This machine, with its predictable logic and endless possibilities, is a clean, ordered universe he can command\u2014a world away from the chaotic, tangible labor that defines his family\u2019s life.\n\n3.\nIt\u2019s 2001, just after he finished at CCSF. Walking through SOMA, he sees the ghosts of the dot-com bust everywhere: ergonomic chairs piled on a curb, a forlorn foosball table in a dark, empty office. The city\u2019s manic ambition had evaporated overnight. While his friends despaired, Benjamin felt a strange sense of calm. The frantic bust made his parents\u2019 steady, predictable work seem like the wisest thing in the world, cementing in him a deep-seated craving for stability over glamour that would define his career.\n\n4.\nIt\u2019s the first Sunday dim sum after his father's funeral. The empty seat at the small table feels vast and cavernous. His mother pushes the last char siu bao towards him, her movements suddenly seeming fragile. He looks at her, truly seeing the weight of the last thirty-five years in her eyes. In that silent moment, he feels his role shift permanently. He is no longer just her son; he is now the keeper of their routine, the anchor holding their little world together.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, cleaning out a closet, he uncovers his father\u2019s old, broken turntable. On a whim, he takes it apart on his dining table. As he traces the cold, silent mechanics with his fingers\u2014the platter, the tonearm, the wires\u2014he feels a jolt of purpose his remote IT work has never provided. He spends a month researching schematics and soldering a new capacitor. The instant the needle drops and crackling music fills his apartment, his quiet dream is born: to fix things with weight, history, and a soul."
