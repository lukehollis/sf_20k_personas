            "value": "Daniel Harrison\u2019s identity was forged in the fog of Daly City, the child of an Irish-American ironworker and a Filipina nurse. He grew up navigating two distinct cultures, never feeling fully a part of either, which made him a keen observer of human behavior. His parents instilled in him a profound sense of duty and compassion, values that steered him away from the tech gold rush and toward a life of service. He saw the tangible impact of his mother's work and felt a pull to understand the systems that shaped people's lives.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line toward this calling. After an undergraduate degree at SF State, he pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. Daniel wasn't interested in theory alone; he wanted to be on the front lines. He began his career as an LCSW at a busy San Francisco hospital, working with patients facing catastrophic diagnoses and complex family crises. The work was grueling but deeply rewarding. However, the relentless pressure of the healthcare system, exacerbated by the pandemic, led to severe burnout. This was his key turning point.\n\nSeeking sustainability, Daniel transitioned to his current role, providing clinical therapy for a large healthcare provider, primarily through telehealth. This explains his zero-mile commute; his office is a quiet corner of his Inner Richmond apartment. His days are structured around virtual sessions, helping clients navigate anxiety, depression, and trauma from the calm of his own home.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond suits his introspective nature. He de-stresses with long runs through Golden Gate Park and finds comfort in the culinary diversity of Clement Street. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, often gathering for dim sum or low-key game nights rather than loud bars. Daniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its glamour and more about the communities within it. He dreams of eventually opening a small, private practice focused on supporting other healthcare workers. For now, he finds fulfillment in the quiet, consistent work of helping others heal, one session at a time."
