The only child of a stoic civil engineer and a librarian who battled a quiet but persistent storm of anxiety, Matthew grew up acutely aware of the unseen currents that shape a person\u2019s world. While his father built bridges, Matthew learned to navigate the emotional landscape of his mother\u2019s life, becoming an intuitive and compassionate listener from a young age.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct line from this upbringing. After completing his undergraduate degree at UC Davis, he was drawn to the Bay Area's progressive intellectual climate, earning his graduate degree from The Wright Institute in Berkeley. He chose to specialize in adolescent psychology, driven by a desire to provide the support and vocabulary to young people that his own family had lacked.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was his mother's death from cancer eight years ago. The experience was profoundly challenging, forcing him to apply his professional training to his own deep grief. It solidified his belief in his work's importance and deepened his empathy for the families he served.\n\nNow, at 41, Matthew has built a stable and meaningful life in San Francisco. He lives in a cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond with his partner of six years, Alex, a graphic designer whose creative energy provides a welcome balance to the emotional intensity of Matthew's work. His 4.5-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus is a cherished ritual\u2014a liminal space for decompressing with a podcast before arriving at the community health clinic where he supports students from various city schools. His $160,000 income affords them a comfortable life, a choice to live without a car, and weekend explorations of the neighborhood\u2019s dim sum restaurants.\n\nMatthew\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in its blend of natural beauty and human complexity. He finds peace on long, misty walks through Golden Gate Park and purpose in the diverse challenges his patients face. His aspiration isn\u2019t wealth or renown, but to one day write a practical guide for parents on recognizing and supporting adolescent anxiety, turning his life\u2019s work and personal history into a resource for others."

The panic in her eyes was a storm only he could see, a sudden squall in the placid lighting. He didn\u2019t understand the source of the storm then, but he learned to read the weather of her face, to anticipate the shifts in atmospheric pressure. That day, he stopped being just a boy and became a quiet observer, learning to listen to the silence between words.\n\n2.\nIt was their first date, six years ago, a misty walk around Stow Lake. Matthew was still carrying the weight of a difficult session when Alex, instead of asking about his work, pointed to the absurdly stoic posture of a nearby heron. They spent the next hour inventing a dramatic interior life for the bird. In that shared, silly moment, Matthew felt a profound sense of lightness. He realized this was what balance felt like\u2014not an escape from his professional life, but a joyful, creative counterweight to it.\n\n3.\nEight years ago, in the sterile quiet of the hospice room, his mother\u2019s breathing softened. For a moment, the anxiety that had shadowed her life seemed to lift, her face settling into a deep calm he\u2019d never seen before. She squeezed his hand once, a final, weightless touch. In that silent exchange, his clinical knowledge dissolved into the raw grief of a son, but it also forged a new conviction: to help other families name their storms before the final calm, turning his loss into a fierce, unwavering purpose.\n\n4.\nA breakthrough came last year with a 15-year-old boy who hadn\u2019t spoken a full sentence in weeks. \u201cIt feels,\u201d the boy said, staring at his hands, \u201clike a buzzing in my bones.\u201d Matthew recognized it instantly\u2014the same unseen static that had surrounded his mother. He gave the boy a simple vocabulary for his anxiety, and in the palpable relief that washed over the teen's face, Matthew saw the path forward. It was then he knew he had to write the book, to make a map for other parents.\n\n5.\nOn a rainy Tuesday two winters ago, the 38-Geary was crowded and fogged with condensation. After a session with a particularly withdrawn teen had left him feeling helpless, he leaned his head against the glass, watching the city blur into watercolor streaks. He wasn't a psychologist then, just another San Franciscan heading home. Surrounded by the diverse collage of sleeping, reading, listening faces, he felt a deep, anchoring peace. This commute wasn\u2019t just a trip; it was his daily practice of rejoining the world."
