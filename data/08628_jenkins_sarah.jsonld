            "value": "Sarah Jenkins lives a life of meticulous quiet in her Inner Richmond apartment, a world away from her upbringing. Raised in a small lumber town in southern Oregon, her childhood was analog: the scent of pine and sawdust from her father's carpentry workshop, and the hushed order of the local library where her mother worked. Sarah inherited her father\u2019s precision and her mother\u2019s reverence for story, finding comfort in the structured world of the Dewey Decimal System.\n\nDrawn to the Bay Area\u2019s cultural magnetism rather than its tech boom, she pursued a Master of Library and Information Science with a specialization in Digital Curation. A key internship digitizing the frail, forgotten archives of a small Oakland community arts center became her turning point. She discovered a profound calling in bridging the gap between the tangible past and the accessible future, preserving the ghosts of art in pristine code. Now, as a digital archivist for a major arts foundation, her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her coffee pot to her standing desk, where she spends her days cataloging, migrating, and safeguarding digital-born art and performance pieces.\n\nHer life is a deliberate balance. After hours spent with pixels and metadata, she unplugs completely. Her daily routine involves a foggy run through Golden Gate Park or losing herself in the tactile messiness of a pottery wheel at a neighborhood studio. Her social circle is small and cherished, a \"found family\" of fellow creatives and thinkers she meets for bibimbap on Clement Street. A recent, amicable end to a long-term relationship has left her in a state of quiet introspection rather than grief.\n\nSarah doesn\u2019t see San Francisco as a city of disruption, but of layers. She feels a deep connection to its history, which she experiences through its architecture and hidden public stairways. Her dream is to one day use her skills on a more personal project: creating a comprehensive digital archive for a forgotten Bay Area folk artist. For Sarah, preserving a legacy is the ultimate act of creation, ensuring that the ephemeral beauty she curates on her screen will never truly fade away."
