Her father worked as a construction manager while her mother taught elementary school. Growing up in a stable household that valued practical skills, Jessica developed an early appreciation for financial security and helping others navigate complex systems.\n\nAfter high school, Jessica enrolled at Sacramento City College, pursuing business administration with dreams of a corporate career. However, during her sophomore year, her father suffered a severe workplace injury, upending the family's finances. The subsequent struggle with insurance companies and loan modifications opened Jessica's eyes to the importance of financial literacy. She left college to work full-time, eventually moving to San Francisco in 2010 during the post-recession housing market recovery.\n\nJessica's entry-level position at a small mortgage brokerage became her unexpected career path. She discovered a talent for explaining complicated financial processes to anxious homebuyers and found satisfaction in helping people achieve homeownership. Over twelve years, she worked her way up to become a respected loan officer at a mid-sized firm in the Financial District.\n\nIn 2016, Jessica met her partner Marco, a high school history teacher, at a mutual friend's housewarming party. They now share a one-bedroom apartment in the Sunset District with their rescue cat, Mortgage (Morty for short). Though they've discussed marriage, both prioritize saving for a home of their own\u2014an increasingly challenging goal in San Francisco's housing market.\n\nJessica's daily routine involves catching the N-Judah train downtown, working with clients to secure favorable loans, and unwinding with evening yoga or walks along Ocean Beach. Weekends often include farmers' market visits and volunteering with a financial literacy program for low-income residents.\n\nHer relationship with San Francisco is complicated\u2014she loves the city's vibrancy and diversity but struggles with its affordability crisis, having witnessed firsthand how rising housing costs affect everyday families. Jessica dreams of advancing to a position where she can help reform lending practices to be more equitable, while eventually purchasing a modest home where she and Marco can build their future together.\n\nDespite never completing her degree, Jessica has found fulfillment in using her financial expertise to help others navigate the path to homeownership that remains elusive for her\u2014at least for now."

            "value": "# Jessica Miller's Significant Memories\n\n1. Jessica still remembers the night her father came home after his accident in 2008, his face ashen with pain and fear. Sitting at the kitchen table, hearing her parents whisper about mortgage payments and medical bills, she felt her sense of security crumble. The loan modification paperwork spread across the table became her first real education in financial systems. This moment transformed her from a casual student into someone determined to understand the machinery that could so easily crush a family's stability.\n\n2. In 2011, Jessica helped her first clients\u2014a young couple not much different from herself\u2014secure a loan for their modest Excelsior District home. When they handed her a small potted succulent at closing, tears welled in her eyes. The plant (which still thrives on her desk) became a symbol of what she could build for others even while her own dreams of homeownership remained distant. This success cemented her unexpected career path and sense of purpose.\n\n3. On a foggy evening in 2015, Jessica stood alone at Ocean Beach after receiving another rental increase notice. As the waves crashed and the sky darkened, she contemplated leaving San Francisco altogether. Instead, she decided to dig in her heels, feeling a fierce determination to carve out her place in a city that seemed determined to push out its middle class. This moment of defiance\u2014choosing to fight rather than flee\u2014defined her relationship with her adopted city.\n\n4. Jessica remembers exactly where she was on the N-Judah in 2018 when her oldest Sacramento friend texted a photo of her new suburban home. The mixture of happiness and envy that washed over her was so intense she nearly missed her stop. That evening, she and Marco had their first serious conversation about whether their San Francisco dream was sustainable. This bittersweet moment deepened their commitment to each other, even as their housing goals seemed increasingly unreachable.\n\n5. In December 2021, Jessica helped a formerly homeless single mother close on a below-market-rate apartment. Walking through the empty rooms that would soon be filled with life, Jessica felt an overwhelming sense of purpose. The woman hugged her and whispered, \"You made this possible.\" That night, Jessica created the first draft of her housing equity proposal. This moment transformed her from someone who worked within the system to someone determined to change it."
