The only child of Taiwanese immigrants, he watched his parents navigate a maze of city permits, taxes, and regulations. He saw their quiet dignity and tireless work ethic, and it instilled in him a foundational belief: the system should work for people like them, not against them.\n\nThis conviction led him to UC Berkeley for a political science degree. While his peers chased dreams of Washington D.C., David was drawn back to the tangible, block-by-block politics of his hometown. He began his career as a low-level intern at City Hall, learning the intricate dance of policy, personality, and public pressure. Over two decades, he steadily climbed the ladder through sheer competence and an encyclopedic knowledge of municipal code, eventually becoming a Senior Legislative Aide to a City Supervisor.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when he successfully championed a bill that streamlined the permitting process for small businesses, a direct echo of his parents\u2019 early struggles. The quiet satisfaction from that victory dwarfed any political ambition. His personal life, however, has been less linear. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of long hours and a focus he admits was more on policy briefs than partnership.\n\nToday, David lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His daily routine is a ritual of city life: a short Muni ride to City Hall, lunch from a food truck at Civic Center Plaza, and evenings spent either at neighborhood meetings or decompressing with a book at a local cafe. He\u2019s a familiar face to his neighbors, known for his calm demeanor and ability to explain complex housing policy in simple terms.\n\nHis youthful dreams of holding office have mellowed. Now, David hopes to mentor the next generation of public servants and see a major affordable housing project he\u2019s worked on for years finally break ground. He aspires to a quieter legacy\u2014not of a name on a building, but of a city that is a little bit fairer and easier to navigate for the families who are its backbone."

He watched his father, a man of endless patience, stare at a city tax form, his brow furrowed in frustration. David saw his dad\u2019s shoulders slump\u2014not in exhaustion, but in a quiet, simmering defeat. In that moment, seeing his capable father bested by confusing paperwork, a resolve hardened in his young heart. An unspoken promise was made: he would learn to understand these forms, to master this system that tried to humble good men.\n\n2.\nA decade ago, months after his permit streamlining bill passed, he was walking down Clement Street on a foggy afternoon. He glanced into a new bakery and saw it: the simple, one-page form he\u2019d designed, taped neatly inside the window. A young woman who looked barely older than his intern was behind the counter, laughing with a customer. It wasn't a jolt of pride he felt, but a deep, foundational stillness. He had untangled one small knot. It was a private victory that felt more real than any public accolade.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, the click of their apartment door closing was the loudest sound he\u2019d ever heard. His partner was gone. He looked from the door to the stacks of policy briefs and zoning maps covering their dining table. In the sudden, immense silence of the room, he understood with painful clarity that he had spent years crafting airtight arguments for policy but had neglected to build a case for his own relationship. The professional wins felt achingly hollow, a poor substitute for the warmth that had just walked out.\n\n4.\nJust last year, during a heated Land Use Committee hearing, a young, nervous intern he was mentoring stepped to the podium. Using research David had helped her compile, she calmly and expertly dismantled a NIMBY argument against an affordable housing project. Watching her, David didn't feel a flicker of his old ambition. Instead, a wave of profound pride washed over him. He realized his purpose had shifted from being the voice at the microphone to being the one who empowers new, smarter voices.\n\n5.\nOn his Muni ride to City Hall last week, the train emerged from the darkness of the Sunset Tunnel into the bright morning of Cole Valley. He looked at the other passengers: a student, a cook in his whites, an elderly woman with a shopping bag. It was the same view, the same mix of people he'd seen since he was a boy taking the N-Judah with his mother. This daily ritual wasn't just a commute; it was a recommitment. These were the faces of San Francisco, a quiet reminder of why his work mattered."
