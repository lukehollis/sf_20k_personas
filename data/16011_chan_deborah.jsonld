The daughter of Cantonese immigrants, she grew up in the fog-laced streets of the Richmond District, her childhood punctuated by the clatter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Clement Street. They instilled in her a profound sense of duty and the unwavering belief that education was a bridge to a better life. This pushed her towards a practical, service-oriented career, and she initially became a registered nurse, working long, demanding shifts at SF General.\n\nIt was in the trenches of patient care that she found her true calling. Deborah witnessed firsthand how outdated systems and poor data management led to inefficiencies and, in one harrowing case, a preventable medical error. The incident was a turning point. Frustrated but galvanized, she saw a new way to serve. She enrolled in a Master of Public Health program, specializing in the nascent field of Health Informatics.\n\nNow, at 47, Deborah is a Clinical Informatics Specialist at UCSF Health. She is the crucial link between clinicians and the complex software they use, designing workflows and training staff to use technology to improve patient outcomes. Her background as a nurse gives her invaluable credibility. She isn't just an IT person; she\u2019s one of them, fighting the same fight from a different angle.\n\nHer life is a stable, well-curated routine. After a amicable divorce years ago, she bought a modest row house in the Inner Sunset. Her 5.1-mile commute on a rattling N Judah MUNI car is her time to decompress, listening to public health podcasts. Her son is now a sophomore at UC Davis, a source of immense pride. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of old friends, often gathering for dim sum in the city or hiking the trails of Mount Sutro. San Francisco is more than her home; it\u2019s the landscape of her entire life. Her dream is to one day see a system she helped build prevent the very error that set her on this path, ensuring the city that raised her has the safest, smartest healthcare possible."

While her mother tallied receipts, her father showed her how to stack cans, label facing out, not just for looks but for efficiency. \"Make it easy for people,\" he\u2019d said in Cantonese. It wasn't just a chore; it was a lesson in service. The weight of the cans in her small hands felt like the first stirrings of a duty she would carry her whole life, a quiet promise made under fluorescent lights.\n\n2.\nThe memory from SF General is less a picture and more a feeling: the cold dread of realizing the medication error. It was in the frantic flip through disorganized paper charts, the sinking certainty that a different system could have stopped it. She remembers the exhausted face of the resident and the patient\u2019s trusting eyes. That night, her frustration wasn\u2019t just with a single mistake, but with a broken process. The anger was clarifying, a jagged piece of glass that pointed her toward a new, necessary path away from the bedside.\n\n3.\nShe can still feel the sun on her face outside the UCSF conference room. A veteran surgeon, famous for his cynicism about new tech, had been railing against the EMR system. Deborah didn't argue with data; she shared a story from her nursing days. She described a close call, explaining how the exact workflow he hated would have caught it. He went quiet, then nodded slowly. \"Okay, Chan. I get it.\" In that moment of earned respect, she wasn\u2019t IT; she was a colleague. She was the bridge she\u2019d set out to be.\n\n4.\nDropping her son off at his UC Davis dorm was a memory she held like a polished stone. She watched him, tall and impossibly grown, navigate the check-in line with a nervous confidence. When he hugged her goodbye, his embrace was brief, already pulling toward his future. Driving back over the Yolo Causeway, tears of pure, unadulterated pride streamed down her face. This was it. This was the better life her parents had dreamed of, passed from their hands, through hers, and now to him. The work had all been worth it.\n\n5.\nJust last week, the N Judah MUNI shuddered out of the tunnel into the bright Inner Sunset morning. The fog was breaking over Mount Sutro. A public health podcast played in her ears, discussing predictive analytics in patient care. She looked out at the familiar rooftops of her neighborhood, a landscape of steadfast routine, and felt a profound sense of rightness. Her past as a nurse, her present as a builder of systems, and her city all clicked into place. She was exactly where she was supposed to be."
