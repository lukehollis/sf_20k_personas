The only child of an engineer father and a librarian mother from New Delhi, Anika was expected to excel. She fulfilled this promise, but on her own terms. While her parents envisioned a future in medicine or law, she was captivated by the stories behind objects, earning an undergraduate degree in Art History from Northwestern University.\n\nThis initial passion, however, soon collided with a pragmatic desire for financial independence. Seeing the formidable glass ceiling for women of color, she made a deliberate pivot. Anika enrolled at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where her sharp, analytical mind, once used to deconstruct Renaissance paintings, proved exceptionally adept at dissecting financial models. This was her first major turning point: the choice of security over sentiment.\n\nHer career was a swift, relentless climb through the grueling world of management consulting. She moved to San Francisco in her late twenties, drawn by the tech boom and the city\u2019s vibrant cultural pulse. For two decades, her life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and 80-hour weeks. This dedication came at a cost; a marriage in her late thirties dissolved under the pressure of her career, a quiet casualty of her ambition.\n\nNow 51 and a senior partner, Anika has curated a life of formidable autonomy. The pandemic normalized a lifestyle she had already begun to crave. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a sleek home office in her Rincon Hill condo, with panoramic views of the Bay Bridge. Her days are a disciplined rhythm: a 5 AM start with black coffee, intense international calls, and a mid-day walk along the Embarcadero to clear her head. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of a few trusted colleagues and friends who understand the demands of her world.\n\nSan Francisco is no longer just a career stop; it\u2019s her chosen sanctuary. Anika is finding her way back to her first love. She sits on a junior board at SFMOMA and quietly funds a scholarship for art students. Her greatest aspiration is no longer a bigger title, but to build a legacy that bridges the two halves of her life\u2014the pragmatic strategist and the woman who still sees the world\u2019s stories in a single brushstroke."
