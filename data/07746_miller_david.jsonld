Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a patient elementary school teacher mother, David was the family\u2019s creative outlier. He devoured books, finding more comfort in fictional worlds than in organized sports. Against his parents\u2019 gentle advice to study business, he pursued an English Literature degree at UC Davis, convinced a life of meaning was found in stories, not spreadsheets.\n\nPost-graduation, San Francisco promised anonymity and opportunity. David found both, first as a barista, then through a friend who landed him a technical writer gig at a burgeoning startup. It was a turning point. His ability to translate complex engineering jargon into clear, human language, combined with an unexpected knack for organization, made him invaluable. He soon transitioned from documenting projects to managing them, climbing the ladder to his current role as a Project Manager.\n\nAt 36, David\u2019s life is contained within a few square miles. His 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to his ergonomic desk, where he juggles Gantt charts and Slack channels. The end of a five-year relationship six months ago has made his world feel even smaller. His social life, once built around his ex-partner, is now a work in progress, consisting of occasional team happy hours and trying new coffee shops.\n\nHis daily routine is disciplined: a morning run around Dolores Park, long hours of focused work, and an evening spent either decompressing with a video game or, more often, staring at a half-finished screenplay on his laptop. That screenplay is his true North. His primary aspiration isn't climbing the next corporate rung, but finally typing \"FADE OUT\" on a story that reconciles his creative soul with his structured, professional life. He loves the Mission\u2019s vibrant energy\u2014the murals, the food, the constant hum of life outside his window\u2014and hopes to one day feel less like an observer and more like a true participant in its narrative."
