Her father, a brilliant and dissident Soviet biologist, met her mother, a second-generation Chinese-American librarian, at a tumultuous academic conference in the 1970s. He defected, and they built a life in San Francisco, a city that embraced their unconventional union. Mei\u2019s upbringing was anything but ordinary. Her education wasn\u2019t in lecture halls but in the tidal flats of the Bay and the redwood forests of Marin, guided by her father\u2019s passionate, hands-on instruction. She learned the scientific names of coastal sage scrub before she perfected her cursive.\n\nThis unorthodox foundation made a traditional career path impossible. Without a formal degree, Mei took on gritty, low-level jobs: a field assistant for the Presidio Trust, a volunteer water sampler for a local non-profit. She absorbed everything, building a formidable practical knowledge base. The turning point came with her father\u2019s passing when she was 28. Grief-stricken but galvanized, she realized his legacy was her responsibility. She decided her field experience was more valuable than any diploma and began marketing herself as an independent consultant, building a reputation on results, not a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nNow 42, Mei lives a life of disciplined purpose in the Inner Sunset. Her apartment, smelling of damp earth and old books, is also her office, making her commute nonexistent. Her days begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that connects her to the ecosystem she fights to protect. The rest of her day is spent in deep focus: analyzing soil composition data, drafting environmental impact reports for tech companies aiming for a smaller footprint, or advising city planners on green infrastructure.\n\nHer social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of fellow scientists and old activist friends who understand her singular focus. Mei feels profoundly connected to San Francisco, not through its landmarks, but through its vulnerabilities\u2014the threatened shoreline, the urban water runoff, the delicate balance of its microclimates. Her dream isn't for wealth or recognition, but to see the projects she advises come to fruition: a restored wetland thriving, a native species returning. It is a quiet, tireless mission to honor the man who taught her to read the earth itself."
