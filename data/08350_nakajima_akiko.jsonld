A third-generation Japanese American, she was raised in San Jose by a pragmatic, soft-spoken father who was an engineer, and a mother who channeled her emotions into the quiet discipline of ikebana. Growing up, Akiko felt caught between her father's world of logic and her mother's world of silent, artistic expression. Communication about difficult feelings was rare, a void that became painfully apparent when her older brother battled a severe depression in his late teens, unable to articulate his inner turmoil. It was during this time that Akiko, then a freshman at UC Davis, saw how art could serve as a vital outlet, a bridge across the chasm of silence.\n\nThis family crisis became her turning point. She abandoned her practical business major for psychology, eventually earning a Master's in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Art Therapy. She felt a calling to help others find the words they didn't have, using clay, paint, and charcoal as their vocabulary. After completing her licensure, she moved to San Francisco, drawn to its embrace of both therapeutic innovation and artistic soul.\n\nNow 45 and ten years divorced, Akiko lives and works in a cozy Edwardian flat in the Inner Sunset. The front room, bathed in morning light, is her studio and office. Her zero-mile commute requires strict personal boundaries; at 6 p.m., the studio door is closed, and the space returns to being part of her home. Her days are structured by client sessions\u2014helping children process trauma or couples navigate conflict through creative expression. Evenings are for herself: walks through Golden Gate Park, tending to her own small collection of bonsai, or quiet dinners with a close circle of fellow therapists and artists.\n\nAkiko\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in this blend of personal and professional life. Her neighborhood provides both the clients she helps and the peace she requires to recharge. Her dream is to one day travel to Japan to study *kintsugi*, the art of repairing broken pottery with gold lacquer. To her, it\u2019s the perfect metaphor for her work: acknowledging the breaks and scars not as flaws, but as an integral part of a beautiful, resilient history."
