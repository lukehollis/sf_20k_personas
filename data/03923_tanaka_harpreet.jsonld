Born to a Nisei Japanese American father, a stoic gardener, and a vibrant Punjabi Sikh mother, an immigrant who ran a small fabric shop, his childhood was a fragrant blend of dal, dashi, and the damp sea air. He was a quintessential San Francisco kid, navigating the cultural confluence of his home with the ease of a native.\n\nFollowing a pragmatic path, Harpreet earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College of San Francisco. For two decades, he worked a series of unfulfilling office jobs in the Financial District, processing invoices and managing databases. He was competent but passionless, a small gear in a vast machine, commuting home each day feeling disconnected from the work he\u2019d done.\n\nThe turning point came at age 42. After a corporate restructuring eliminated his department, Harpreet found himself adrift. To fill his days, he started volunteering at a neighborhood co-op preschool his friend\u2019s child attended. Amid the joyful chaos of finger-painting, story time, and scraped knees, he discovered a profound sense of purpose. The direct, unfiltered honesty of toddlers felt more meaningful than a lifetime of spreadsheets.\n\nHe returned to CCSF for his Early Childhood Education credits and, a year later, accepted a position as a teacher\u2019s assistant at a small, family-run preschool just three blocks from his apartment. He has worked there ever since.\n\nNow 53, Harpreet\u2019s life is defined by a gentle routine. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his rent-controlled apartment to the school\u2019s front door. He\u2019s a beloved figure, known for his endless patience and his ability to calm the most epic tantrum. His social life is woven into his community; he knows the baristas, the grocers, and every parent by name. His aspirations are modest: to help build a small vegetable garden for the children and, one day, to save enough to visit his ancestral villages in Japan and India. Harpreet found his calling not by climbing a ladder, but by choosing to kneel down to meet the world at a child\u2019s eye level, becoming a quiet anchor in his corner of the city."

            "value": "1.\nAt age seven, he stood in the doorway between his father\u2019s garden and his mother\u2019s kitchen. The scent of damp soil and Japanese maples from his father\u2019s work clothes met the warm, fragrant cloud of turmeric and cardamom from his mother\u2019s simmering dal. In that foggy Outer Richmond air, the two worlds merged into one singular, comforting aroma: the smell of home. This sensory blueprint taught him that seemingly disparate parts could create a beautiful, coherent whole, a lesson he would carry his entire life.\n\n2.\nHe was 39, staring out of a sealed window on the 28th floor of a FiDi high-rise. The fog rolled in, slowly erasing the Bay Bridge from view. Below, the city bustled with a life he felt utterly disconnected from, a ghost in his own hometown. The mechanical click of his keyboard was the only sound. A profound hollowness settled in him\u2014not sadness, but the stark realization that his life lacked tangible meaning. That feeling became the silent, grinding prelude to his eventual reinvention.\n\n3.\nJust after his 42nd birthday, volunteering at the co-op, a four-year-old named Chloe had a meltdown, hiding under a table and sobbing. Harpreet didn\u2019t coax or command. He just sat quietly on the floor a few feet away. After a minute, a tiny hand, sticky with jam, reached out and took his. The simple, trusting weight of it felt more significant than two decades of spreadsheets. In that silent gesture, he felt a purpose so profound it was like waking up for the first time.\n\n4.\nAround age 48, a furious tantrum erupted over a single red crayon. Instead of imposing order, Harpreet knelt down and began softly describing the color red: the shade of a fire engine, the sweetness of a strawberry, the color of his mother\u2019s wedding sari. The screaming toddler quieted, captivated by the imagery, and eventually opted for blue. It wasn't a victory of discipline, but of connection. This moment cemented his belief that patience was his true calling, a quiet anchor in any storm.\n\n5.\nLast spring, looking at the weedy patch destined to become the school\u2019s vegetable garden, he saw his father\u2019s hands in his mind\u2019s eye\u2014calloused and gentle, patting soil around a young plant. He imagined teaching the children to plant daikon radish and cilantro, foods from his two heritages. The aspiration wasn\u2019t just about gardening; it was about legacy. It was a tangible way to honor his father and sow the seeds of his own story for a new generation, right in his corner of the city."
