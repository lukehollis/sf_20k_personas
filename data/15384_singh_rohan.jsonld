Born and raised in Fremont, he was the only son of Punjabi immigrants who ran a successful chain of convenience stores. They instilled in him the values of relentless hard work and the pursuit of a stable, respectable career. While they hoped for an engineer, Rohan, armed with a natural charisma and a mind for systems, chose business. He excelled, earning a coveted spot at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\n\nHis post-graduation path was a straight shot into the high-stakes world of management consulting in San Francisco's Financial District. The work was demanding, a blur of data analysis, client presentations, and PowerPoint decks, but the paycheck and prestige were tangible rewards. His key turning point came not from a promotion, but from a breakup. His long-term girlfriend had grown tired of competing with his career for his time. The split forced Rohan to confront the life he was building\u2014one that looked perfect on a spreadsheet but felt hollow in practice.\n\nHe traded his shared apartment in the East Bay for a sleek one-bedroom in Hayes Valley. The 3.5-mile MUNI ride to his downtown office became a daily ritual, a time to disconnect with a podcast before the onslaught of work. Now 33, his routine is disciplined: 6 AM gym sessions, long days at the firm, and carefully scheduled evenings with a tight-knit group of friends from college and work. They are his anchor, gathering for trivia nights at a local brewery or weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nRohan loves the energy of San Francisco\u2014the ambition in the air, the proximity to nature, the world-class food scene he can finally afford. Yet, a quiet restlessness persists. He dreams of a future where his work has more tangible meaning. His secret aspiration is to leave the corporate ladder behind and leverage his business acumen to launch a mission-driven tech startup, one focused on sustainable urban living. For Rohan, the ultimate success is no longer about climbing higher, but about building something that lasts."

His dad stared at the panoramic view of the Bay, then back at Rohan\u2019s dual monitors. \"So much money,\" he\u2019d said, his voice thick with pride, \"for numbers on a screen.\" In that moment, Rohan felt a gulf open. His father saw security, the culmination of his own hard work in the store. Rohan saw validation, but also abstraction. It was the first time he realized that making his parents proud and feeling fulfilled were two entirely different goals.\n\n2.\nThe breakup wasn\u2019t a fight; it was an audit. He was 30. Maya stood in the living room of their East Bay apartment, her bags packed. \"Your life is a perfectly optimized spreadsheet, Rohan,\" she said, her voice devoid of anger, just exhausted. \"There's just no column for me.\" The words didn't just sting; they re-architected his reality. After she left, the silence in the apartment felt like a negative value on a balance sheet, exposing the profound hollowness of the life he had so meticulously built.\n\n3.\nHis first weekend hike after moving to Hayes Valley. He was 31, raw from the split. At a peak in the Marin Headlands, the fog broke, revealing the Golden Gate Bridge below. His friend Sameer clapped him on the shoulder, saying nothing, just sharing the view. It wasn't advice or pity; it was simple presence. In that quiet moment of camaraderie, breathing the salt-laced air, Rohan felt anchored for the first time in months. He understood that these friendships were the only part of his life that required no performance review.\n\n4.\nThe first night in his Hayes Valley apartment, he sat on the hardwood floor eating Thai takeout from a box, his furniture still in transit. Through the large window, he heard the rumble and chime of the MUNI N-Judah line, a sound that felt like the city\u2019s heartbeat. It was the first space that was entirely his, a direct consequence of a life falling apart and being rebuilt. The emptiness of the room didn't feel like a loss, but like a blank page. It was terrifying and thrillingly full of potential.\n\n5.\nHe was 32, on his daily MUNI ride, listening to a podcast about circular economies. He glanced out and saw overflowing city compost bins next to a thriving community garden. The disconnect was jarring. Then, a jolt. The systems thinking, the efficiency models he built for corporate clients\u2014he could apply it all *here*. To this. The restless energy inside him finally found a direction. It wasn't just a vague dream anymore; it became a tangible problem he suddenly, desperately, wanted to solve. The commute home felt like a journey toward a new purpose."
