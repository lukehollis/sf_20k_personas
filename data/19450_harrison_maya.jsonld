Born in the Sunset District to pragmatic Chinese immigrant parents who ran a small grocery store, Maya\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American aspiration. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable career in medicine, Maya was drawn to the vibrant murals of the Mission and the hallowed halls of the de Young Museum. She found a compromise that honored both her passion and her parents\u2019 practicality: a degree in Arts Administration from San Francisco State University.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of the city\u2019s non-profit world, writing grants and coordinating volunteers for a shoestring theater company. It was there she learned the grit required to keep art alive in an increasingly expensive city. A key turning point came during the 2008 financial crisis when the cultural center she worked for faced closure. Maya, then a junior program manager, devised an innovative community partnership and secured a crucial grant, saving the organization and proving her mettle.\n\nHer personal life has been marked by a deep, enduring love for her late husband, David Harrison, a graphic designer who championed her ambitions before his passing over a decade ago. She keeps his name as a tribute. Now, her social life is a close-knit circle of friends from the arts community and her widowed father, with whom she has dim sum every Sunday in the Richmond.\n\nToday, Maya lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is quintessentially SF: a brisk morning walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by a 1.8-mile MUNI ride on the 38R Geary, where she reads grant proposals on her tablet. As the Executive Director of \u201cPacific Plates,\u201d a non-profit in the Fillmore District celebrating Pan-Asian culinary traditions through classes and events, her days are a whirlwind of fundraising, community outreach, and strategic planning.\n\nAt 50, Maya\u2019s aspirations are not for personal wealth but for legacy. Her dream is to secure a permanent, endowed home for Pacific Plates, ensuring that the city\u2019s diverse cultural stories, told through food, will have a stage for generations to come. For Maya, her work is not just a job; it\u2019s the continuation of her family\u2019s immigrant story and a love letter to the city that raised her."

            "value": "1.\nShe was ten, the scent of her parents\u2019 Sunset grocery store permanently in her clothes: cardboard, dried mushrooms, and the sharp tang of ginger root. One afternoon, while stacking cans of water chestnuts, she stared at her hands\u2014small, capable hands her parents hoped would one day hold a scalpel. But Maya was mesmerized by the label\u2019s green and red design, tracing the logo with her finger. It was the first quiet acknowledgment of a gap between her parents' pragmatic dream and her own, a future painted in color, not sterile white.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she\u2019d take the MUNI to Balmy Alley, her art history textbook hidden in her bag. She remembers the specific afternoon the sun hit a mural of matriarchs, their faces lined with struggle and resilience. It wasn't just paint on a wall; it was a testament. In that silent, sun-drenched alley, she felt a profound sense of purpose. Art wasn't a frivolous hobby; it was a way to honor the stories of those, like her parents, who rarely told their own. It solidified her resolve to find a place within that world.\n\n3.\nThey were in Golden Gate Park, not long before David got sick. She was despairing over a grant rejection, convinced her non-profit career was a foolish dream. David simply squeezed her hand, pointed toward the de Young\u2019s spire piercing the fog, and said, \u201cYour work is just as important as what\u2019s in there. You\u2019re keeping the city\u2019s heart beating.\u201d His faith in her was absolute. After he passed, that moment became her anchor, a memory that transformed his name from a loss into a standard she carried forward.\n\n4.\nIt was 3 AM during the 2008 financial crisis. The cultural center she worked for was weeks from closing, and its survival depended on the grant proposal glowing on her screen. She remembers the tremor in her hand as she clicked \u201csubmit.\u201d It felt less like an act of hope and more like a desperate prayer. The subsequent email confirming they\u2019d secured the funding wasn\u2019t just a relief; it was a forging. It taught her that in a city of booms and busts, true grit wasn't just surviving, but creating something lasting against the odds.\n\n5.\nA few years ago at Pacific Plates, she watched a Filipino grandmother teach a class how to make lumpia. The woman\u2019s hands, wrinkled and sure, moved with an inherited grace as she folded the delicate wrappers. In that moment, Maya suddenly saw her own mother and father bagging rice in their store. The connection was visceral and humbling. Her work wasn't a departure from her family's immigrant grind; it was the evolution of it, transforming their labor into legacy and ensuring their story, and others like it, had a place at the table."
