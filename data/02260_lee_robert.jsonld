Raised in a practical Iowan family\u2014a mechanic father and a librarian mother\u2014Robert was expected to find a stable trade. He dutifully earned an Associate's Degree in Graphic Design from a community college, a compromise between his artistic sensibilities and his parents' pragmatism. For five years, he designed soulless corporate pamphlets, feeling a growing disconnect between his work and his spirit.\n\nThe turning point was a week-long trip to San Francisco at 27. He was mesmerized not by the landmarks, but by the food: the vibrant produce at the Ferry Building, the alchemy happening in small, unpretentious kitchens. He tasted flavors he never knew existed. Within a year, he had quit his job, packed his car, and moved to the city with no plan other than to be near that energy. He started at the bottom, washing dishes in a North Beach trattoria, absorbing everything. His graphic design background unexpectedly became his superpower; his sense of composition, color, and negative space translated into stunning, architectural plating that got him noticed.\n\nHe worked his way up through several respected kitchens before landing his current role as Executive Chef at \"Canvas,\" the signature restaurant within the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. His culinary philosophy\u2014minimalist, ingredient-driven, and visually narrative\u2014was a perfect match for the institution. The 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; Robert lives in a small, starkly modern apartment on the museum's top floor, a space usually reserved for artists-in-residence.\n\nHis life is his work. Mornings are for sourcing from local markets, afternoons for prep and service, and evenings are often spent walking the silent museum galleries, finding inspiration for new dishes in a Rothko color field or a Calder mobile. His social circle is small and intertwined with the museum\u2014curators, visiting artists, and his tightly-knit kitchen staff. Robert\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a Michelin star, but something more ephemeral: to create a tasting menu that perfectly translates a single art exhibition into an edible experience. He is a man who found his true medium not on paper, but on a plate, quietly creating his life\u2019s masterpiece in the heart of SoMa."
