The daughter of a pragmatic Pakistani engineer and a vibrant Trinidadian-Indian artist, her home was a mix of structured ambition and expressive warmth. From her father, she inherited a sharp, analytical mind; from her mother, an innate empathy and a fierce sense of community justice. This duality defined her path. While her peers were drawn to the tech boom, Aaliyah was captivated by the complexities of human connection and resilience she saw in her own extended family.\n\nThe turning point came during her undergraduate years at UC Davis. Her beloved maternal grandmother, her *Nani*, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Aaliyah watched her family grapple not just with the emotional toll, but with a fragmented and culturally insensitive healthcare system. The experience ignited a quiet fire within her. She changed her major and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, specializing in medical social work.\n\nNow 27 and a fully Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Aaliyah lives and works from her cozy apartment in the Castro. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to a sunlit corner of her living room, where she conducts telehealth therapy sessions for patients navigating chronic illness and end-of-life care. Her days are structured and intense, filled with holding space for others\u2019 grief and fear. She decompresses by taking long, rambling walks through Duboce Park, losing herself in podcasts, and attempting to replicate her mother\u2019s complex curry recipes.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but specific; she loves the Castro\u2019s history of activism and community care, feeling a kinship with its spirit. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of fellow therapists who understand the unique pressures of their work. While content, Aaliyah dreams of something more tangible. Her ultimate goal is to open a small, integrative wellness practice\u2014perhaps in the Mission\u2014offering culturally competent counseling and support groups for families like her own, ensuring no one has to navigate the labyrinth of healthcare alone."

It wasn't just the word \"Alzheimer's.\" It was hearing that Nani, her vibrant, story-telling grandmother, had packed a small bag to go visit a brother who had been dead for thirty years. The profound helplessness she felt in that moment wasn't passive; it was a seed of fierce resolve. That call, at age 20, was the sound of her life\u2019s path snapping into focus. She knew she had to help families navigate that specific heartbreak.\n\n2.\nIt was her first Pride in the city, just after starting her Master's program at SF State. Walking alone near Castro and 18th, she saw two elderly men, holding hands, carefully helping each other fix a rainbow flag on their balcony. A younger neighbor saw them and rushed up to help. The simple, unspoken act of community care struck her with profound force. This wasn't just a neighborhood; it was a promise. At 23, feeling the spirit of the place, she knew she had found her home.\n\n3.\nHer first telehealth client after licensure was a Filipino family whose patriarch was refusing hospice. He felt it was giving up. Aaliyah spent an hour just listening to his daughter, validating her exhaustion and fear. She then gently reframed hospice not as surrender, but as a way to honor her father\u2019s strength by providing comfort. The shift in the daughter's voice\u2014from despair to a sliver of hope\u2014was everything. That day, at 26, her work stopped being a theory and became a tangible act of service.\n\n4.\nLast winter, after a brutal week of sessions, she tried her mother's Trinidadian chicken curry for the tenth time. Her engineer father had once transcribed the recipe, but her mother cooked by feel. Aaliyah followed the script but added a final dash of cumin purely on instinct. The aroma that filled her small Castro apartment wasn't just food; it was her whole childhood. It was the perfect fusion of her father's logic and her mother's soul. In that moment, she felt completely, wholly herself.\n\n5.\nJust last month, sitting on a bench in Duboce Park, she overheard a young woman on the phone, trying to explain her mother's care needs in halting Spanish to an insurance agent. Aaliyah felt that old, familiar ache of her Nani\u2019s ordeal. But this time, it was different. It wasn\u2019t just pain; it was a blueprint. She pictured a real space in the Mission, a place where that phone call wouldn't be so hard. Her dream of a wellness center stopped being an abstract goal and became an urgent, actionable plan."
