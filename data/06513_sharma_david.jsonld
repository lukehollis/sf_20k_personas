He was raised on intellectual curiosity and the belief that a well-structured argument could change the world, a principle he took to heart.\n\nInitially driven by a youthful idealism, he pursued a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard, intent on reforming public systems from the inside. However, a frustrating internship on Capitol Hill soured him on the slow pace of governmental bureaucracy. He craved tangible impact and efficiency, a desire that led him into the high-stakes world of management consulting. His ascent was meteoric. Fueled by an incisive intellect and a near-bottomless capacity for work, David made Partner by 38, specializing in organizational restructuring for Fortune 500 tech companies.\n\nHis sleek Mission Bay condo, with its panoramic views of the water, doubles as his global headquarters. The 0.0-mile commute is a symbol of his life\u2019s efficiency\u2014and its isolation. Days are a blur of video calls with clients in New York, London, and Shanghai. The relentless focus cost him a long-term relationship years ago, leaving a network of professional contacts but few deep friendships. His connection to San Francisco is more corporate than cultural; he appreciates its status as a global hub for innovation, enjoying high-end restaurants in SoMa and networking events, but rarely ventures into its quirkier neighborhoods.\n\nNow 40 and at the pinnacle of his profession, David feels an unfamiliar unease. The wealth and influence are secure, but the old ideals of public service have resurfaced. He has started quietly exploring pro-bono consulting for major non-profits and is fascinated by the potential of social impact investing. He dreams of a second act, one that leverages his formidable skills not just for profit, but for purpose. David Sharma seeks to build a new legacy, one that reconciles the quiet idealist from Ann Arbor with the formidable San Francisco power broker he became."
