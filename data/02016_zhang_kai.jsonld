Born in Nanjing, China, to two busy but loving physicians, his childhood was steeped in the language of healing. While his parents hoped he would follow them into medicine, Kai was more drawn to the systemic reasons people fell ill. After completing his undergraduate studies in China, he immigrated to the U.S. in the early 1990s, enrolling at UC Berkeley to pursue a Master's in Public Health. It was there, volunteering at a free clinic in Oakland, that he found his calling\u2014not in treating disease, but in preventing it by addressing the social and economic barriers to health.\n\nHis career began in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s public health system. He took a job at a clinic in Chinatown, working on outreach programs for isolated seniors and new immigrants. This formative experience, witnessing the community\u2019s resilience and its specific struggles, cemented his commitment. Over the decades, Kai built a reputation for being a thoughtful and effective leader, steadily moving from frontline work into management and, eventually, to his current role as Director of Community Health Programs.\n\nNow 51, Kai lives a settled life in the Inner Richmond with his partner of twenty years, a landscape architect named David. His commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his home office, a space filled with books and overlooking a small, meticulously tended garden. His days consist of a marathon of Zoom meetings, grant applications, and strategic planning, always aimed at bridging the city\u2019s glaring health disparities.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound. He sees its beauty on his morning walks through Golden Gate Park, but his work gives him a stark, unfiltered view of its challenges. He isn't disillusioned, but pragmatic. At this stage in his career, Kai\u2019s ambition is not for personal gain but for impact. He dreams of establishing a self-sustaining mental health initiative for elderly immigrants, a final, capstone project to leave a legacy of care in the city that became his home."
