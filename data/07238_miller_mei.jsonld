Born Mei Li in Guangzhou, China, she immigrated to the city at age nine with her parents. They settled in Chinatown, where the cacophony of Cantonese felt like a small piece of home amidst the overwhelming newness of America. Her parents poured their lives into a small laundromat, their days a testament to relentless work. For Mei, education was secondary to contributing to the family\u2019s survival; she finished high school but never considered college, instead taking on various jobs to help make ends meet.\n\nHer career path was practical, not passionate. She discovered a knack for typing and detail-oriented tasks, which led her to a stable position in data entry. The turning point in her life wasn't professional but personal. In her late twenties, she met David Miller, a kind, soft-spoken carpenter who frequented the bakery where she worked a second job. He was charmed by her gentle demeanor, and she was drawn to his steadiness. Their marriage was a quiet, happy union, and they bought a small house in the Outer Sunset, a world away from the bustle of her childhood. They had one son, Alex, who is now a software engineer\u2014a world she both admires and barely understands.\n\nDavid\u2019s sudden passing from a heart attack six years ago was a seismic shock that reshaped her world into a quieter, more solitary form. Her data entry job, long since transitioned to remote work, now suits her perfectly. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her bedroom to a small desk overlooking her garden. Her days follow a simple rhythm: the click-clack of her keyboard, a solitary lunch, and a mandatory late-afternoon walk to Ocean Beach, where the roar of the surf seems to wash away the silence of her house.\n\nNow at 49, Mei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not in its landmarks but in its atmosphere\u2014the way the fog mutes the city sounds, the familiar faces at her local grocery store. Her social life is small: weekly video calls with Alex and occasional chats with her next-door neighbor over the fence. Her dreams are modest. She hopes to one day visit Yosemite, a place David always wanted to take her, and perhaps take a class in watercolor painting. More than anything, Mei aspires to maintain the peaceful independence she has carefully reconstructed, finding contentment in the steady, quiet rhythm of her own life."
