His mother, a dental hygienist, remarried when he was six, and Liam took the name of his kind but reserved stepfather, a mechanic named Amir Hassan. While his friends were focused on cars and football, Liam was a pensive kid who filled sketchbooks with designs and characters, dreaming of a world with more texture and color than the Central Valley offered.\n\nAfter high school, he dutifully enrolled in community college for graphic design, but the structured curriculum felt disconnected from the creative pulse he craved. After a year and a half, he dropped out, a decision that created a silent rift with his practical-minded family. He worked retail for two years, saving every dollar, before making his escape. At 22, he packed a single duffel bag and took a bus to San Francisco, a city he\u2019d only ever seen in movies.\n\nHe landed on his feet, securing a stockroom job at a chic home goods boutique in Hayes Valley. Liam\u2019s keen eye for merchandising and his unassuming, reliable nature did not go unnoticed. He was promoted to the sales floor, and eventually to Assistant Store Manager. His life is now contained within a few vibrant city blocks; he lives in a small rent-controlled studio apartment directly above the shop, making his commute a simple flight of stairs.\n\nLiam\u2019s social circle is small and intimate, mostly coworkers and regulars from the corner coffee shop. He keeps in touch with his family through brief, weekly phone calls, though he rarely discusses his aspirations. His old sketchbooks are still on his shelf, and his dream has evolved. He no longer wants to design for others but hopes to one day open his own small, curated store\u2014a space filled with local pottery, vintage books, and independent art. For now, he finds contentment in the rhythm of his neighborhood, a self-contained village where he is slowly, thoughtfully, building a life of his own design."
