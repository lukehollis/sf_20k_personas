The only son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, perpetually busy dry-cleaning business, his childhood was a soundtrack of hissing presses and the sharp smell of chemicals. He saw his parents\u2019 exhaustion as a call to action, their sacrifice the fuel for a relentless ambition to escape their world of grueling labor. He buried himself in books, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate studies and later a Master's in Economics from Stanford, a degree he chose for its analytical purity.\n\nHis career was a calculated, swift ascent. He joined a cutthroat investment bank after graduation, working punishing hours and thriving on the pressure. The crucible of the 2008 financial crisis didn't break him; it made him invaluable. He saw patterns others missed, earning a reputation for calm, decisive leadership that led him to consulting. Now, as Managing Partner, his name carries weight in boardrooms across the country.\n\nThe key turning point wasn't a market crash, but a global pandemic. The mandated quiet forced him to confront the life he\u2019d built. His marriage had dissolved years prior, a casualty of 80-hour workweeks and transatlantic flights. His relationship with his daughter, Elena, now a student at NYU, was maintained through scheduled calls and generous tuition payments. The 0.0-mile commute became permanent by his choice. He sold his larger house for a minimalist, art-filled apartment in Russian Hill, transforming a spare bedroom into a state-of-the-art command center where he manages global portfolios.\n\nHis days are disciplined: up at 5 a.m. for the European markets, a strong espresso, and then a solitary run along the Embarcadero before a day of video calls. He is a man who knows every inch of his neighborhood but few of his neighbors. His connection to San Francisco is one of lived history\u2014from the Sunset of his youth to the elite perch he now occupies.\n\nAt 54, David\u2019s aspirations are shifting. The relentless drive for wealth has softened into a desire for legacy. He dreams of mending the distance with Elena, perhaps teaching a seminar at his alma mater, and finding a way to advise non-profits with the same rigor he gives his corporate clients. He mastered the language of finance; now, he hopes to become fluent in the language of connection."
