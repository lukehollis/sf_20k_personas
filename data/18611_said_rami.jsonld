A first-generation Lebanese-American, Rami grew up valuing tangible skill. While his friends were obsessed with video games, he was fascinated by the intricate systems that made his father\u2019s work possible. This practical curiosity led him to a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan, but the slow-moving automotive industry felt like a world away from the future he envisioned.\n\nThe turning point was a summer internship in the Bay Area. He was captivated not by software, but by the tangible innovation in hardware. He saw a place where his skills could build the physical future, not just maintain the past. After graduating, he made the permanent move, trading Michigan winters for San Francisco\u2019s fog. Starting as a junior engineer, he quickly distinguished himself with a knack for streamlining complex manufacturing processes. Now, as a Senior Hardware Engineer, he designs and refines the intricate machinery that brings consumer electronics to life.\n\nRami\u2019s life is a study in precise efficiency. He resides in a compact apartment in the Mission District, its vibrant murals and culinary chaos a welcome contrast to the orderly logic of his work. His day begins with strong coffee and a 3.5-mile commute through the city\u2019s arteries on his electric scooter, a silent, swift journey to his SoMa office. Evenings are often spent with his partner, Chloe, an architect, their conversations a blend of structural integrity and aesthetic design. On weekends, he unwinds by restoring vintage synthesizers, a hobby that perfectly merges his love for mechanics and clean, functional sound.\n\nDeeply connected to the Mission's energy, Rami feels at home in a city that values creators and builders. His aspiration isn't to become a tech billionaire, but to eventually launch his own venture: a small-scale, sustainable manufacturing consultancy that helps startups build their products locally. He wants to bring the pride of making things back to the community, echoing the lessons from his father\u2019s garage, but reimagined for a new century."

The satisfying click as it seated, the grunt of effort, the scent of motor oil\u2014it was a sensory symphony. In that moment, he didn't just see a car part; he saw a system of trust and function. This wasn't just fixing things; it was a language of creation. It cemented in him a deep, foundational respect for tangible work, a value that became his life's true north.\n\n2.\nDuring his college internship, he toured a hardware assembly line in Silicon Valley. He watched a robotic arm, a marvel of engineering, place a microscopic component onto a circuit board with silent, impossible precision. It was faster and more elegant than any system he had seen back home. He felt a jolt of recognition\u2014this was the future of his father's garage. Not maintaining the past, but building what was next. He knew then that Michigan was his history, and this coast was his destiny.\n\n3.\nSix months into his first junior engineering job in SF, the Gen-2 assembly line kept jamming. The veterans were stumped. Rami stayed late, sketching the robotic arm\u2019s path, seeing the inefficiency not in the code, but the mechanics. His simple recalibration worked. The quiet, appreciative nod from his manager the next morning felt more validating than his diploma. It was the moment he stopped feeling like an impostor from the Midwest and started feeling like a builder in his own right.\n\n4.\nHe was walking with Chloe through Clarion Alley, the aerosol paint fumes thick in the air. She stopped and traced the lines of a sprawling mural, not talking about its message, but its structural composition\u2014how the artist balanced the weight of color. She called it \u201cvisual engineering.\u201d In her perspective, he saw his own world of precise systems reflected in the vibrant chaos of the Mission. It was the moment he felt completely at home, understood by a person who saw the architecture in art.\n\n5.\nThe vintage Moog synthesizer had been silent for weeks, a puzzle of faulty capacitors and cold solder joints. One recent Saturday, after hours of methodical work, he flipped the switch. Instead of static, a pure, clean sine wave filled his apartment. It was a perfect, functional sound born from restored mechanics\u2014the intersection of his father\u2019s garage and his SoMa lab. In that pure tone, his aspiration crystallized: to help others build their own perfect, functional things from the ground up."
