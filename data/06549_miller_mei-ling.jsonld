            "value": "Mei-Ling Miller\u2019s story is woven into the very fabric of San Francisco\u2019s western neighborhoods. The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the fog-laced avenues of the Sunset District. Her parents ran a small, bustling grocery store on Irving Street, instilling in her a profound sense of community duty and a quiet observer\u2019s eye for the neighborhood\u2019s subtle dramas. While they hoped she would pursue medicine, Mei-Ling was more drawn to the unspoken struggles of her elderly neighbors and the quiet anxieties of families like her own.\n\nThis inclination led her not to medical school, but to UC Berkeley for a Master of Social Work. It was a choice that initially disappointed her parents but defined her life\u2019s purpose. She began her career in the chaotic environment of SF General Hospital, navigating crises and advocating for patients lost in the labyrinthine healthcare system. It was there she met her husband, David Miller, a kind, steady-handed artist volunteering to paint murals in the pediatric wing. Their union was a gentle blending of worlds.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when her own father was diagnosed with a long, debilitating illness. Mei-Ling became his primary caregiver, a role that tested her professional skills on a devastatingly personal level. The experience exhausted her but also solidified her expertise in palliative and end-of-life care. After his passing, she left the high-stress hospital environment.\n\nNow 52, Mei-Ling runs a private clinical practice from a dedicated office in her Cole Valley home, hence her zero-mile commute. Her days are structured and calm. She starts with a walk with David through the Panhandle or Golden Gate Park, coffee in hand, before beginning her telehealth sessions. She has become a vital, calming presence for clients grappling with chronic illness and grief. Her aspirations have shifted from career advancement to legacy; she dreams of mentoring young social workers from immigrant backgrounds and perhaps, one day, traveling with David without a laptop. For Mei-Ling, San Francisco isn\u2019t a city of disruptive tech, but a collection of villages where, from the quiet of her home, she still tends to the heart of her community."
