Raised in a small, working-class town outside Fresno, his world was one of practicality; his father a mechanic who smelled of grease and hard work, his mother a checker at the local grocery store. There was little talk of ambition beyond a steady job and a local family. The turning point came when David was seventeen. His grandmother\u2019s long battle with cancer ended in a small hospice facility, where David spent countless hours. He watched the nurses\u2014their impossible patience, their quiet competence in moments of crisis, and their profound compassion\u2014and felt a calling he couldn't ignore.\n\nRejecting the expected path, David enrolled in a nursing program at a community college, eventually transferring to San Francisco State University to complete his bachelor's degree. The city was a shock, a vibrant, chaotic world away from the valley's stillness. After graduating, he was hired as a Registered Nurse on a demanding Medical-Surgical unit at a major hospital near Parnassus. The work was a trial by fire. He learned to be an anchor in a sea of beeping monitors, patient anxieties, and the constant rhythm of life and death. The job forged him into a man who was calm under pressure, deeply empathetic, yet guarded.\n\nNow 33, David\u2019s life is dictated by his 12-hour shifts. He lives a deliberately simple existence in a small apartment in the Inner Sunset, a five-minute walk from the hospital. His commute is a short stroll, allowing him to decompress by watching the fog roll over Mount Sutro. His social life is small, consisting mainly of other nurses who understand the strange hours and emotional toll. A long-term relationship recently ended, a casualty of a schedule that left little room for anything but work and sleep.\n\nHis days off are for recovery\u2014long, quiet runs through Golden Gate Park, grabbing a burrito from his favorite spot on Irving Street, and reading. Though he feels the weight of his work, David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to escape it, but to deepen his practice. He's studying to become certified in palliative care, hoping to offer more profound comfort to patients at the end of their lives. He yearns for a partner who understands his vocation and, someday, for a trip to somewhere truly quiet, a place where no one needs him for a little while."
