The son of a methodical automotive engineer and a pragmatic high school math teacher, he was raised on a diet of diligence and high expectations. While his peers were content with midwestern comforts, David was drawn to the titans of industry he read about, devouring biographies and business journals. His ambition was a palpable force, propelling him to a finance degree at the University of Michigan and then to the prestigious Kellogg School of Management for his MBA.\n\nHis life\u2019s pivotal moment occurred not in a boardroom, but at a dreary corporate recruitment event in Chicago. There, he met Carlos Reyes, a sharp, charismatic artist moonlighting in graphic design for a marketing firm. Carlos\u2019s creative spirit and warm vitality offered a compelling counterpoint to David's structured ambition. Their connection was immediate and profound. When a premier consulting firm offered David a position in San Francisco, it was a decision they made together. Marrying a year later, they became the Reyes-Millers, a deliberate merging of their identities.\n\nNow a Senior Partner, David\u2019s life is a masterclass in scheduled success. His day begins at 5:30 AM with a run through his Hayes Valley neighborhood, followed by a quick espresso before he catches the Muni K-Ingleside for the short ride downtown. His workdays are a marathon of high-stakes meetings and complex problem-solving. Yet, he religiously protects his evenings, which are reserved for home-cooked dinners with Carlos, dissecting their respective days over a bottle of Russian River Pinot Noir.\n\nHaving reached the professional summit he\u2019d always envisioned, David finds his aspirations shifting. The relentless climb has been replaced by a desire for impact. He\u2019s begun mentoring first-generation college students entering the corporate world and serves on the board of a local arts non-profit, a nod to Carlos\u2019s influence. His dream is no longer about a higher title or a larger bonus, but about building a legacy of mentorship and community investment, proving that a life built on ambition can find its truest meaning in giving back."

Then he saw Carlos, who was there for a marketing client, radiating a warmth that felt like sunlight. David, usually so laser-focused on his talking points, found his carefully constructed five-year plan dissolving in the face of Carlos\u2019s easy laugh. It was the first time ambition felt secondary to pure connection. That night, in his late twenties, he didn't just meet his future husband; he met a truer version of himself.\n\n2.  They were on the small balcony of their first Hayes Valley apartment, planning the wedding. \"Reyes-Miller,\" Carlos had suggested, not as a question, but as a simple statement over a bottle of Pinot. David felt a profound click, a sense of rightness that quieted the methodical engineer in his head. It wasn't a compromise; it was the creation of something new. In that moment, he understood they weren't just merging lives, but building a shared identity from scratch, a legacy that belonged to them both.\n\n3.  About five years into his career in San Francisco, his phone buzzed with a summons from a key client\u2014an \"urgent\" late-night strategy session. But he was standing outside a small gallery in the Mission for Carlos's first solo show. He saw his reflection in the glass, the exhausted consultant. Then he saw Carlos inside, looking nervous and hopeful. David texted back: \"Apologies, I have a non-negotiable commitment.\" It was the easiest, most important executive decision he had ever made, solidifying a boundary around his life that he would never cross again.\n\n4.  On a regular Tuesday morning, with the K-Ingleside lurching through the Twin Peaks Tunnel, he looked around at the diverse faces of his fellow passengers. For years, the city was just the backdrop for his career climb. But in that mundane moment, surrounded by the quiet, shared journey of the city, a profound sense of belonging washed over him. He wasn't just working in San Francisco; he was *from* San Francisco. It was the moment the city he chose as a career move finally, irrevocably, felt like home.\n\n5.  He was having coffee last year with his first mentee, a brilliant young woman from the Bayview navigating her first corporate internship. As she spoke of her family\u2019s hopes and her own anxieties, he saw the immense pressure of being the first. Seeing the genuine relief in her eyes when he offered simple advice was more satisfying than closing any multi-million dollar deal. It was the moment his ambition found its true north: not in climbing higher, but in holding the ladder steady for those coming up behind him."
