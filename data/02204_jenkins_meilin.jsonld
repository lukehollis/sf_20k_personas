            "value": "Meilin Jenkins is a product of two Bay Areas. Born in Berkeley to a pragmatic immigrant mother from Guangzhou and an idealistic American father who taught East Asian history at Cal, her childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and West Coast intellectualism. She grew up watching the region transform, fascinated by the tension between the tract homes of her suburban friends and the vibrant, chaotic density of Oakland\u2019s Chinatown where her grandmother lived. This constant negotiation of space, culture, and community sparked her interest in the forces that shape a city.\n\nHer path seemed pre-written: UC Berkeley for undergrad, followed by a Master of Urban Planning from UCLA. She entered the professional world in the early 2000s, just as the first dot-com bubble burst. This became her crucible. Witnessing the sudden exodus of tech workers and the hollowed-out feeling of once-booming neighborhoods solidified her belief in planning for resilience, not just growth. She joined San Francisco\u2019s planning department, eschewing more lucrative private-sector work for a mission she felt was a direct extension of her upbringing: creating equitable, livable spaces for everyone.\n\nNow a Senior Urban Planner, Meilin\u2019s life is deeply embedded in the city she serves. Divorced for nearly a decade (she kept her ex-husband\u2019s name out of convenience), her primary relationship is with San Francisco itself. She lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood she loves for its walkable, human scale\u2014a testament to the kind of planning she champions. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a minimalist home office, where her monitors display zoning maps and environmental impact reports, her window framing a real-time view of the city she is digitally sculpting. Her social life is a small, tight circle of fellow \"city nerds\"\u2014architects, policy wonks, and non-profit leaders\u2014with whom she debates housing policy over dinner.\n\nMeilin\u2019s dream is no longer personal advancement but civic legacy. She aspires to see the city approve a new generation of truly affordable housing that integrates seamlessly into existing communities. Her deepest fear is that San Francisco will become a beautiful museum for the wealthy, losing the grit and diversity that defined her youth. Each approved parklet, protected bike lane, or middle-income housing project is a quiet, personal victory in her long, patient battle for the soul of her city."
