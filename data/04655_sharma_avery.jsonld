Raised in the meticulously planned suburbs of Fremont, he was the son of Indian immigrants who saw engineering and medicine as the only two paths to stability. Avery, however, was fascinated not by circuits or anatomy, but by the sprawling, chaotic system of the Bay Area itself. He\u2019d trace freeway interchanges on maps, wondering why one neighborhood thrived while another languished. This passion led him to UC Berkeley, where he defied his family\u2019s wishes and earned a Master's in Urban Planning.\n\nHis early career in municipal planning was a lesson in frustration. Bogged down by bureaucracy and glacial progress, he watched the dot-com boom reshape San Francisco from the sidelines. In a pivotal move, he pivoted, realizing that the logic, systems-thinking, and stakeholder management he\u2019d learned could be applied to the tech world. He framed his unique background as an asset, and a small startup took a chance on him. He survived the bust, learning a crucial lesson in resilience, and steadily built a career as a project manager, becoming an expert translator between idealistic engineers and demanding clients.\n\nNow 48, Avery lives a life of curated solitude in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice. His day is structured: a morning walk to Reverie Cafe for a cortado, hours of focused work managing complex software rollouts from his spare bedroom, and a strict 6 PM log-off. The transition from \u201cwork Avery\u201d to \u201chome Avery\u201d is marked by a walk through Golden Gate Park or a session at his neighborhood gym.\n\nHe is amicably divorced; his ex-wife\u2019s desire for a suburban life with a yard was a future he couldn\u2019t envision for himself. His social life now revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, connected through a shared love of film and hiking, not tech. His connection to San Francisco is intimate; he sees the Muni lines not just as transport, but as the city\u2019s circulatory system, and studies zoning proposals with the eye of his former self. His quiet aspiration is to eventually leave corporate tech and consult for a civic tech non-profit, finally merging his two careers to leave a tangible, positive mark on the city he\u2019s spent his life studying and loving."

His father\u2019s voice, a static-filled mix of concern and confusion from Fremont, asked why he was dropping his computer science prerequisites. \u201cFor Urban Planning,\u201d Avery said. Looking out at the sprawling, glittering grid of the East Bay, he felt a profound, terrifying calm. It was the first system he chose to build for himself, and the quiet click of the phone hanging up was the sound of its foundation setting.\n\n2.\nThe memory that spurred his pivot isn\u2019t of a single meeting, but of a feeling. In 1999, he\u2019d sit in a drab City Hall conference room, debating a curb-cut variance for hours. Through the window, he could see the glowing logos of dot-coms that had risen overnight. He felt a deep, professional loneliness, as though he were meticulously polishing a gear while a new engine roared to life just across the street. He wasn't just planning a city; he was being left behind by one. That realization was the push he needed to cross the street.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the cold dread of that walk through SoMa in 2002. The dot-com bust had hollowed out the neighborhood, and startups were shedding office furniture like dead skin. He saw a pyramid of Aeron chairs on a sidewalk, waiting for scavengers. His own small company had survived, but just barely. In that silence, seeing the ghost town of manic ambition, he didn\u2019t feel victorious. He felt a grim resolve harden inside him. It was a visceral lesson in resilience, teaching him that hype evaporates, but well-managed systems\u2014and people\u2014endure.\n\n4.\nThe divorce wasn't one fight, but a quiet conversation on a bench near the Conservatory of Flowers. \u201cI just want a yard, Avery,\u201d she\u2019d said. He looked past her, at the complex weave of jogging paths, the flow of traffic on JFK Drive, the Muni lines he could trace in his mind. He knew, with a deep and sad certainty, that he could never trade this chaotic, interwoven system for a manicured lawn in Orinda. The end of his marriage was the ultimate confirmation of his character: he was irrevocably a creature of the city.\n\n5.\nJust last month, waiting for the N-Judah, he watched the new digital arrival sign glitch, causing confusion among the crowd. The Avery of ten years ago would have felt a familiar surge of civic frustration. Instead, the project manager took over. He instinctively began wire-framing a better interface in his head, mapping the data flow, identifying the pain points. In that moment, his two selves\u2014the city planner and the tech strategist\u2014merged completely. It wasn't just a fantasy anymore; it was a project brief waiting to be written."
