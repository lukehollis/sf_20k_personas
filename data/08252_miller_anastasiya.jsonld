            "value": "Anastasiya Miller is a product of two worlds: her mother\u2019s rainy Lviv, Ukraine, and her father\u2019s sun-baked Central Valley. Raised in Sacramento, she was the family\u2019s little translator, bridging the gap between her mother\u2019s resilient, community-focused heritage and her father\u2019s practical, American-born perspective. From a young age, she witnessed her mother, a nurse, help newly arrived Ukrainian families navigate bewildering American systems. This early responsibility for others\u2019 well-being became the quiet, guiding force of her life.\n\nThis calling steered her away from more lucrative paths. After completing her undergraduate degree at UC Davis, a volunteer stint at a youth shelter solidified her mission. She saw kids grappling with crises she recognized in a different form from her own community\u2019s struggles: displacement, trauma, and the search for stability. She enrolled in the Master of Social Work (MSW) program at San Francisco State University, drawn to the city's history of activism and social services.\n\nNow 25, Anastasiya\u2019s life is wholly integrated with her work. She is a residential School Social Worker at a specialized academy for at-risk youth nestled within the Presidio. Her 0.0-mile commute is a two-minute walk from her small staff apartment to the main school building, past eucalyptus groves and historic barracks. Her days are a blur of crisis intervention, family counseling sessions, and mountains of paperwork, all aimed at giving her students the support she once helped her family find.\n\nHer social life is a small, tight-knit circle of grad school friends. Dating is challenging, given that her job is a 24/7 commitment. Evenings are for decompressing: a foggy run along Crissy Field with the Golden Gate Bridge as her backdrop, or losing herself in a novel. Her connection to San Francisco isn't through its nightlife or tech scene, but through its quiet green spaces and the resilient spirit of the kids she serves. She hopes to one day establish a non-profit that provides more holistic, wrap-around services for vulnerable families, a larger-scale version of the support she offers one child at a time."
