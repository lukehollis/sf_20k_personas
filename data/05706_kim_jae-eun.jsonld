The only child of Korean immigrants who settled in Cupertino, her upbringing was a quiet regimen of academic excellence and parental expectation. Her parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist, saw a clear path for her: a practical degree from a top UC school followed by a stable, high-income career. Jae-Eun complied, earning a Bachelor\u2019s in Economics from UC Berkeley, and for three years, she disappeared into the sterile hum of a downtown financial firm. It was a life of spreadsheets and sensible shoes, and it was slowly erasing her.\n\nThe turning point came during a lunch break, on a whim. She wandered into a small gallery in SoMa and was confronted by a massive, chaotic oil painting by a local artist. In its riot of color and form, she felt a sense of life that had been absent from her own. Within six months, she had quit her job, infuriating her parents and liquidating her modest savings to enroll in art history extension courses.\n\nHer re-entry into the professional world was a humbling one. She started by volunteering, then took a poorly paid internship before landing her current role as a Gallery Assistant in Dogpatch. Her life inverted; her income plummeted, but her spirit soared. Her 0.0-mile commute is a core feature of her existence\u2014she lives in a small studio apartment directly above the contemporary gallery where she works. Her days are a blur of handling delicate artworks, speaking with artists, updating the website, and patching nail holes in the white walls.\n\nJae-Eun\u2019s world is now a five-block radius. She knows the baristas, the other gallery staff, and the emerging artists who ached with the same passion she recognized in herself. Her relationship with her parents remains strained but loving; they send care packages filled with food and unspoken disappointment. Her dream is no longer an IPO but a curatorship. She spends her evenings studying, hoping to one day run her own space, championing the visceral, challenging art that saved her\u2014giving voice to other artists who chose passion over a predetermined path."
