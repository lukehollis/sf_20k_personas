The son of a pragmatic Filipino mother, a bookkeeper, and an idealistic Indian father, a university literature professor, Rohan grew up in the suburbs of Union City. His childhood was a gentle tug-of-war between his mother\u2019s practicality and his father's romanticism. He leaned towards the latter, filling sketchbooks with charcoal drawings and losing himself in museums. He pursued this passion at UC Santa Cruz, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History, imagining a future as a gallery curator.\n\nThe reality after graduation was a harsh awakening. The dot-com bust had chilled the Bay Area economy, and jobs curating art were nonexistent. At 25, while Rohan was working a dispiriting retail job, his father suffered a major stroke. The weeks spent in the hospital, watching the confident and compassionate nurses manage the crisis, struck him with profound force. He felt his art history knowledge was useless, a collection of abstract facts, while these nurses possessed skills that were tangible, vital, and life-altering.\n\nThis was his turning point. Rohan enrolled in an accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program, channeling his focus into anatomy and pharmacology with a convert's zeal. He excelled, discovering a new kind of art in the precise and empathetic practice of care. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted position as a Registered Nurse at a major medical center on Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco.\n\nNow 41, Rohan\u2019s life is defined by a deep-seated practicality his younger self would never have recognized. He lives in a small, modern condo in Cole Valley, a building directly opposite the hospital. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk across the street, a necessity for his grueling 12-hour shifts in the cardiac step-down unit. His days are a blur of monitoring vitals, administering medications, and offering a steady hand to anxious patients and their families. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of other nurses. They understand the dark humor and emotional toll of the job, often grabbing a late-night meal in the neighborhood after a long shift.\n\nRohan\u2019s dream is no longer of galleries, but of stability and peace. He hopes to eventually transition to a less physically demanding outpatient role, perhaps in cardiac rehab. On his rare days off, he still finds solace in art, but now as an observer. He\u2019ll walk through Golden Gate Park to the de Young Museum, not to critique, but to simply feel. He traded a life of abstract beauty for one of messy, human-centered purpose, and in the quiet moments, looking out his window at the hospital that is both his workplace and his calling, he knows he made the right choice."

His father\u2019s hand rested on his shoulder, smelling of old books. \u201cArt is life, Rohan,\u201d he\u2019d whispered. Rohan felt the powdery charcoal on his fingers and the smooth glide of lead on paper. In that moment, a future of grand halls and beautiful objects felt not just possible, but destined. It was the purest form of his father\u2019s romantic promise, a world he was certain he would one day curate and call his own.\n\n2.\nAn alarm blared from his father\u2019s cardiac monitor, a piercing shriek that paralyzed Rohan. He was 25, his head full of Renaissance painters, his hands utterly useless. A nurse appeared, her movements a blur of practiced calm. She adjusted a drip, spoke in low, reassuring tones, and silenced the chaos. In that moment, staring at her competent hands, Rohan felt a profound, burning shame. His knowledge was abstract and weightless; hers was tangible, vital, and real. It was the instant his old life ended.\n\n3.\nHe was 27, hunched over an anatomy textbook at 3 AM, surrounded by cold coffee and flashcards. He\u2019d been memorizing the heart\u2019s chambers, a brute-force task, until he suddenly saw it differently. It wasn\u2019t just a diagram; it was a sculpture of exquisite, life-sustaining design. The graceful arch of the aorta, the powerful logic of the ventricles. In that quiet apartment, he realized he hadn't abandoned art. He was simply learning its most fundamental, most human medium. The work suddenly felt sacred.\n\n4.\nHe was a new RN, barely a year in. A patient\u2019s wife stood clutching a purse in the hall, her face a mask of shock after her husband\u2019s surgery. Rohan\u2019s mind raced with protocols, but his gut remembered his mother\u2019s face in the hospital waiting room. He simply stopped, met her terrified gaze, and said, \u201cCan I get you some water?\u201d She crumbled, and he just stood with her while she wept. In that moment of shared, silent humanity, he wasn't just performing a job; he was fulfilling his purpose.\n\n5.\nOn a rare day off last spring, he walked through Golden Gate Park to the de Young. He stood before a vast, abstract painting, all chaotic color and motion. The younger Rohan would have tried to deconstruct it, to place it in a historical context. But Rohan the nurse simply saw the frantic energy of a code blue, the blur of faces in a family meeting, the wash of relief after a crisis. He no longer needed to analyze the art; he just let himself feel it. And for the first time, it felt like enough."
