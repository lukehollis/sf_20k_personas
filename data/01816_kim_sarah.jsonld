The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a meticulous, perpetually busy dry-cleaning business in the Outer Richmond, Sarah\u2019s childhood was defined by the scent of starch and the expectation of practicality. Art was a luxury, a field trip to the de Young Museum a rare and treasured escape.\n\nIt was at UC Berkeley, ostensibly studying economics, that she secretly double-majored in Art History. The disciplined world of her parents was replaced by the vibrant chaos of artistic theory and critique. This quiet rebellion culminated in a Master's degree in Curatorial Studies from the San Francisco Art Institute, a choice that baffled her family. She spent her twenties and early thirties cutting her teeth as an assistant curator at a prestigious, commercially-driven gallery in Union Square. While she learned the business, she chafed under its purely transactional nature, dreaming of a space with a soul.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. After a significant relationship ended\u2014her partner unable to compete with her devotion to her work\u2014she cashed out her savings and, with a small, reluctantly given loan from her father, bought the Dogpatch building. She spent a year renovating it herself, transforming the ground floor into \"Atelier 415,\" a gallery with exposed brick and stark white walls dedicated to challenging, emerging Bay Area artists.\n\nNow, at 41, her life is her work. Her commute is non-existent. Mornings are for coffee and quiet contemplation in the empty gallery, afternoons for liaising with artists and collectors, and evenings for hosting openings where she connects patrons with creators. Her social circle is a tight-knit web of the artists she champions and the few other gallerists she respects. Her parents, who once saw her career as a flight of fancy, now attend every opening, their pride palpable. Sarah\u2019s dream is not expansion, but legacy. She aspires to be the curator who discovers the next great San Francisco voice, ensuring the city\u2019s vibrant, defiant artistic heart continues to beat strong."
