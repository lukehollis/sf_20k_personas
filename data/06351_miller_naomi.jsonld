Born in California\u2019s Central Valley, she was the daughter of Elena, a first-generation immigrant from Oaxaca, and David Miller, an American engineer of stoic Midwestern stock. Her childhood was a blend of her mother\u2019s warm, communal traditions and her father\u2019s pragmatic belief in structure and relentless self-improvement. While she inherited her mother\u2019s features, she adopted her father\u2019s surname and his drive, a combination that often left her feeling slightly adrift between two worlds.\n\nDetermined to forge her own path, Naomi excelled academically, earning a scholarship to UCLA for her undergraduate studies. The ambition that simmered within her led her east for a Master of Business Administration from a prestigious Ivy League school. She was recruited straight into the cutthroat world of New York finance, where she spent a decade building a fearsome reputation as an analyst. The grueling hours and high-stakes pressure were a crucible, refining her skills but slowly eroding her sense of self.\n\nThe turning point came at age 35. After a major deal closed, she felt not triumph, but a profound emptiness. She realized she was chasing a version of success defined by others. She resigned, left Manhattan\u2019s gleaming towers, and moved to San Francisco, seeking a life with more intention. She joined a smaller, boutique investment firm that valued results over face time, a role that eventually allowed her to work entirely from her meticulously restored Victorian home in Noe Valley.\n\nToday, at 45, Naomi\u2019s life is anchored by a quiet routine. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to her sunlit home office overlooking a garden. Mornings are for jogs through the fog-laced neighborhood, and evenings are for either quiet reading or small dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends. Though financially secure, her aspirations have shifted from accumulation to impact. She focuses on sustainable and ethical investments and secretly dreams of starting a foundation to mentor young Latinas entering the finance world\u2014a way to finally weave the two threads of her heritage into a single, meaningful legacy."
