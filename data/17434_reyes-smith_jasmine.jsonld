Born to a Filipino nurse and a postal worker, her childhood was a disciplined rhythm of school, family obligations, and the quiet expectation that she would build upon the foundation her parents had sacrificed to create. While her peers were drawn to the speculative frenzy of the first dot-com boom, Jasmine chose a more pragmatic path at San Francisco State University, earning a degree in Business Administration.\n\nHer early career was shaped by the bust that followed. Witnessing the swift collapse of promising startups instilled in her a deep appreciation for structure and long-term strategy. Jasmine wasn\u2019t a founder; she was a builder. She found her calling in project management, methodically climbing the corporate ladder at a large professional services firm in the Financial District. She thrived on untangling complex projects and leading teams to deliver concrete results, a skill that eventually earned her the role of Director.\n\nA key turning point was meeting her husband, Mark Smith, an architect, at a friend\u2019s gallery opening in the Mission. Their union was a blending of worlds\u2014her structured corporate pragmatism and his creative, spatial vision. They chose the hyphenated name Reyes-Smith as a symbol of their partnership, a nod to both her heritage and their shared future. They settled in Cole Valley, raising their son, Leo, in a home that felt miles away from the downtown hustle.\n\nToday, Jasmine\u2019s routine is one of controlled efficiency. Her morning rideshare is a cherished liminal space, a 3.5-mile buffer where she shifts from parent to director, reviewing briefs and listening to leadership podcasts. Evenings are for family dinners and navigating the challenges of raising a high schooler. Weekends are for the farmers' market on Parnassus and hikes through the Presidio with a close-knit circle of friends. Having achieved financial security, her dreams are shifting. She aspires not to a higher corporate rung, but to a \"second act\" after Leo leaves for college\u2014perhaps consulting on her own terms or mentoring young women of color entering the corporate world, ensuring others have a clearer path to build upon."

It was 2 a.m. during finals at SF State, and her mother, exhausted from a nursing shift, silently placed a bowl of adobo on her desk. No words were exchanged, but the message was clear: *We work hard so you can build higher.* That simple act of care wasn't pressure, but fuel. It became the bedrock of her ambition\u2014to make their quiet sacrifices profoundly worthwhile.\n\n2.\nShe remembers standing at her office window in 2001, watching movers haul Aeron chairs out of the failed startup across the street. There was no joy, just a profound sense of validation. While her peers mourned the death of a speculative dream, Jasmine felt a quiet resolve harden within her. Hype was fleeting, but structure\u2014the kind she was learning to build\u2014was real. That moment cemented her path not as a founder, but as a finisher, a builder of things that last.\n\n3.\nAt a loud gallery opening in the Mission, she\u2019d felt utterly out of place until Mark started explaining a chaotic metal sculpture. He wasn\u2019t pretentious; he spoke of tension, balance, and flow\u2014the same principles she applied to her projects, but made beautiful. For the first time, someone saw the architect in her soul. In his world of creative vision, her structured mind wasn't rigid, but foundational. Her pragmatism suddenly felt like a different kind of art.\n\n4.\nShe sat in the audience for Leo's 10th-grade history presentation, watching him calmly click through his slides. It wasn\u2019t a multi-million dollar corporate launch, but the pride she felt was more profound. She saw the methodical confidence she nurtured in her teams reflected back at her, but softer, full of his own potential. This, she realized, was the ultimate deliverable. This was the project she had been building all along, a legacy of quiet competence and care.\n\n5.\nIn the sleek office kitchen, a young analyst, a woman of color like her, asked not about a project, but how to navigate a difficult meeting. As Jasmine gave her advice, she saw a flicker of her younger self in the woman\u2019s eyes\u2014determined, but uncertain. The brief conversation felt more meaningful than any Q4 report. In that moment, her vague \"second act\" took shape. The ladder wasn't the point anymore; holding it steady for others coming up was."
