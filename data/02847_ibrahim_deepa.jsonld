Raised in a home where success was measured in engineering patents and stable careers, Deepa\u2019s path felt like a quiet rebellion. She pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, not in computer science, but in English, much to her family\u2019s bewilderment. Her escape came with graduate school, where she earned a Master\u2019s in Comparative Literature from Columbia, immersing herself in global narratives while living in a tiny New York apartment.\n\nHer entry into film was unglamorous. She began by transcribing interviews for a documentary filmmaker, a job that taught her the architecture of a story from the ground up. She learned to hustle, to write grant proposals on her lunch breaks, and to navigate the egos and anxieties of creative teams. After a decade in New York, she returned to the Bay Area, drawn back by its unique blend of artistic grit and natural beauty. San Francisco felt like home in a way New York never had.\n\nHer turning point came with a searing documentary she produced about the displacement of artists from the Mission District. The film, shot on a shoestring budget, gained entry into Sundance, earning her critical acclaim and solidifying her reputation as a producer with a potent voice. Now, at 45, Deepa operates from a spacious live/work loft in Dogpatch. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of moving from her coffee machine to her desk overlooking the shipyards. Her days are a whirlwind of international calls to secure funding, poring over scripts, and mentoring younger filmmakers.\n\nDivorced five years ago, she finds solace in her tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, a chef, and a lone tech lawyer who keeps her grounded. She loves San Francisco for its stubborn, creative soul hiding beneath the tech gloss. Her great ambition is to produce a feature film, a nuanced drama about a family much like her own. It\u2019s a project that gnaws at her, a desire to create something that would have made her younger, bookish self feel finally, and completely, seen."
