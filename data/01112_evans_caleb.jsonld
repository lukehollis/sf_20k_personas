Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, Caleb was the quiet, artistic son of a pragmatic accountant and a high school history teacher. While his parents preached the value of a stable career path, Caleb spent his adolescence immersed in video editing and graphic design, teaching himself the Adobe Creative Suite with a devotion that baffled his family.\n\nForegoing a traditional university path, Caleb took a gamble. He spent his early twenties as a freelance designer, a difficult hustle that paid bills inconsistently but honed his skills. The turning point came at 24 when, feeling creatively stagnant, he packed two suitcases and moved to San Francisco for a junior-level role at a boutique creative agency he\u2019d long admired. He spent his first year in a cramped room in the Outer Richmond, humbled by the city\u2019s pace and the sheer talent surrounding him.\n\nIt was here Caleb discovered his true calling wasn't in being the lead artist, but in empowering other artists to do their best work. His innate organization and calm demeanor made him a natural liaison between chaotic creatives and demanding clients. His promotion to Project Coordinator two years ago felt like a validation of his entire journey.\n\nNow 28, Caleb lives in a small but bright apartment in the Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute consists of a shuffle from his bed to his desk, a routine punctuated by morning walks to a local panaderia for coffee. His life is a blend of digital calendars and neighborhood color. Following a recent, amicable breakup, his social life is currently centered on a close-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of designers and writers\u2014and weekly trivia nights at a nearby pub.\n\nCaleb\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of earned belonging. He feels the pressure of the city\u2019s expense but thrives on its relentless energy. His dream isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to finally direct and produce a short animated film\u2014a personal project that would bring his journey full circle, from a kid sketching in a suburban bedroom to a creator in his own right."
