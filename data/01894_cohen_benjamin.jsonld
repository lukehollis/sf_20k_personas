The son of a secular Jewish history professor from New York and a Japanese-American ceramicist from Hawaii, he grew up in Berkeley navigating Hanukkah alongside Obon ceremonies. This duality didn't confuse him; it fascinated him. From a young age, he was obsessed with how disparate points on a map\u2014and the people within them\u2014were connected. His childhood memories are threaded with the rhythmic clang of BART, a lifeline connecting his East Bay home to the cultural hubs of San Francisco his parents cherished.\n\nThis fascination led him to pursue a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning. While his peers were drawn to architecture or policy theory, Ben was captivated by the circulatory system of a city: its transportation networks. He saw bus routes and light rail lines not as infrastructure, but as instruments of equity, freedom, and community. After a formative stint working for Portland\u2019s transit authority, he achieved his goal of returning to the Bay Area, securing a position with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.\n\nNow, at 37, Ben is a Transportation Planning Manager. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his life\u2019s philosophy: he lives in a chic but functional Hayes Valley apartment, a short walk from his Civic Center office. His days are a hybrid of remote work analyzing ridership data and in-person meetings navigating the contentious politics of city planning. A key turning point was pushing through a controversial protected bike lane project; the vitriol he faced solidified his resolve but also chipped away at his idealism.\n\nSocially, Ben is more reserved, preferring deep conversations with his small circle of friends\u2014a mix of city colleagues and old university pals\u2014over loud nightlife. His last serious relationship ended a year ago, amicably but leaving a quiet void. His current life is his work. He spends weekends cycling new routes, observing traffic flows, and imagining a future San Francisco where a car is an afterthought. His dream isn't a promotion, but a city where mobility is seamless and equitable for all residents, a tangible legacy connecting the disparate points of the city he calls home."
