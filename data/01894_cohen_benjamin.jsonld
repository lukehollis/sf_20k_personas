The son of a secular Jewish history professor from New York and a Japanese-American ceramicist from Hawaii, he grew up in Berkeley navigating Hanukkah alongside Obon ceremonies. This duality didn't confuse him; it fascinated him. From a young age, he was obsessed with how disparate points on a map\u2014and the people within them\u2014were connected. His childhood memories are threaded with the rhythmic clang of BART, a lifeline connecting his East Bay home to the cultural hubs of San Francisco his parents cherished.\n\nThis fascination led him to pursue a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning. While his peers were drawn to architecture or policy theory, Ben was captivated by the circulatory system of a city: its transportation networks. He saw bus routes and light rail lines not as infrastructure, but as instruments of equity, freedom, and community. After a formative stint working for Portland\u2019s transit authority, he achieved his goal of returning to the Bay Area, securing a position with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.\n\nNow, at 37, Ben is a Transportation Planning Manager. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his life\u2019s philosophy: he lives in a chic but functional Hayes Valley apartment, a short walk from his Civic Center office. His days are a hybrid of remote work analyzing ridership data and in-person meetings navigating the contentious politics of city planning. A key turning point was pushing through a controversial protected bike lane project; the vitriol he faced solidified his resolve but also chipped away at his idealism.\n\nSocially, Ben is more reserved, preferring deep conversations with his small circle of friends\u2014a mix of city colleagues and old university pals\u2014over loud nightlife. His last serious relationship ended a year ago, amicably but leaving a quiet void. His current life is his work. He spends weekends cycling new routes, observing traffic flows, and imagining a future San Francisco where a car is an afterthought. His dream isn't a promotion, but a city where mobility is seamless and equitable for all residents, a tangible legacy connecting the disparate points of the city he calls home."

His mother, her hands smelling faintly of clay, pointed towards San Francisco as they emerged from the Transbay Tube. They were going to Japantown for manju. Ben saw a line on a map made real, a steel thread connecting his East Bay home to his mother's heritage. He realized then that the journey itself was the magic\u2014a physical link between the disparate, beautiful parts of his world. This was the moment his life's obsession began.\n\n2.\nHe was 27, working in Portland. An older woman approached him after a community meeting, her eyes tired but bright. She just wanted to say thank you. The new crosstown bus route he\u2019d helped design meant she could get from her cleaning job to her grandson\u2019s daycare without a transfer. In her simple gratitude, Ben\u2019s abstract data on equity became tearfully, beautifully real. His work wasn't about lines on a map, but about creating lifelines for people. This memory became his compass.\n\n3.\nHe was 35, standing on a street corner the morning his controversial bike lane project opened. After months of venomous emails and shouted threats at public meetings, the quiet was jarring. Then he saw it: a father and his small daughter, wobbling slightly but secure within the concrete barrier, laughing as they rode. The pure, simple safety of that moment was his victory. But the memory of the rage it took to create it left a permanent, cynical scar on his idealism, teaching him that progress is a fight.\n\n4.\nHe was 36, a week after his girlfriend had moved out. He chopped vegetables for one, the silence in his Hayes Valley apartment feeling louder than any traffic. He\u2019d designed his life for seamless efficiency, and now that efficiency felt like a flaw. He looked at the empty second chair at his small table and saw not just an object, but a disconnected node in his own personal network. It was the first time his perfectly planned life felt fundamentally incomplete, and the quiet void settled in.\n\n5.\nLast month, cycling up to Twin Peaks, the city sprawled below him like one of his own planning maps. The wind whipped at his face as he watched the arteries of the city pulse with buses and cars. From this height, the contentious politics and angry meetings dissolved, and all he could see were the connections, the flows, the possibilities. He felt a familiar ache of loneliness, but it was overwhelmed by a fierce, quiet sense of purpose. This view was his calling: to untangle the knots below."
