Adopted as an infant by a loving couple from suburban Ohio, he grew up as the only Asian face in a sea of white ones. His parents, a high school history teacher and a librarian, gave him a stable, intellectually curious upbringing, but could never fully bridge the quiet, unspoken gap of his identity. David found solace and control in the orderly world of numbers, excelling in math as a way to structure a life that began with a fundamental unknown.\n\nHe pursued this inclination, earning a Bachelor's and then a Master's degree in Economics from a solid Midwestern state university. Drawn by the dot-com boom\u2019s siren song of opportunity and the promise of a more diverse environment, he moved to San Francisco in his late twenties. He weathered the bust and the 2008 financial crisis, his cautious, analytical nature allowing him to navigate the turmoil and steadily climb the corporate ladder. Now, as a Senior Financial Analyst, his life is a testament to the stability he always craved.\n\nDavid\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of his current life. He resides in a sleek SoMa high-rise, his home office a fortress of methodical calm with a view of the Bay Bridge. His days are disciplined: a 6 AM run along the Embarcadero, market analysis by 7:30, and a structured workday that blends seamlessly into a quiet evening. His social circle is small and curated, consisting of a few long-time colleagues and a weekly dinner at a trusted sushi restaurant in Hayes Valley.\n\nLately, however, a new aspiration has taken root. At 47, the questions of his youth have returned not as anxieties, but as a gentle curiosity. He has started taking beginner Korean language classes online and makes weekend pilgrimages to the Richmond District to explore the markets, tentatively connecting with the culture he was separated from. His ultimate dream is no longer a bigger title or a larger portfolio, but to one day visit Busan\u2014not to search for his birth family, but simply to walk the streets and feel the texture of the place where his story began."
