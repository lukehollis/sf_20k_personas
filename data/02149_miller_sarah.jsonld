Raised in Sacramento, the daughter of a state water board engineer and a high school history teacher, she inherited a belief in the steady, essential work of public service. The glamour of San Francisco was a distant concept; good governance was a dinner table topic.\n\nHer educational journey began at UC Berkeley, where she studied political science, but it was a Master's in Public Administration from SF State that truly set her course. While her peers chased tech fortunes, Sarah was drawn to the complex, frustrating, and vital machinery of city government. She started as a policy analyst in her late twenties, slowly climbing the ladder through competence and an unflappable demeanor. Now, as a Program Manager for City Services, she oversees neighborhood improvement grants, a role that perfectly marries her bureaucratic skill with a genuine desire to see communities thrive.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 41. The dissolution of her 15-year marriage, a quiet drifting apart rather than a dramatic rupture, forced her to rebuild her identity. With no children and her ex-husband moving to Portland, Sarah poured her energy into her work and her home. She bought her small two-bedroom condo in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its village-like feel.\n\nHer life now operates within a small, contented radius. The 0.0-mile commute means her day starts not with a bus ride, but with a walk to a local cafe on Irving Street for a latte before retreating to her home office for a day of Zoom meetings and budget spreadsheets. Her social life is a small, stable circle of friends\u2014a mix of city hall colleagues and a couple she\u2019s known since her Berkeley days. Evenings often involve cooking a simple meal, reading historical fiction, or a glass of wine on her small balcony overlooking the fog rolling in.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to change the world, but to leave her corner of it better. She aspires to see the projects she manages come to full fruition\u2014a new mini-park, a thriving corridor of small businesses she helped support. She looks forward to a retirement filled with volunteering at the SF Botanical Garden and perhaps, finally, taking that long-dreamed-of trip along the coast of Croatia."
