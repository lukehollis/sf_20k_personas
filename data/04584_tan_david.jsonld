Born in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District to parents who had emigrated from Hong Kong, his childhood was steeped in the scent of his mother's cooking and the weight of unspoken expectations. They ran a small neighborhood grocery, and their dream for David was a linear path to a prestige profession\u2014doctor, lawyer\u2014a life of security they had never known.\n\nHe was a dutiful son, but his quiet rebellion began at UC Berkeley. Instead of pre-law or business, he fell in love with history and art, eventually earning a Master's in East Asian Studies. He imagined a life in academia or curation, surrounded by scrolls and artifacts. But reality intervened with the force of an earthquake. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s shook the Bay Area, and David watched friends with idealistic dreams lose everything. Fear, a feeling he\u2019d been raised to avoid, became his primary motivator. He saw safety in numbers, in the cold, hard logic of the market.\n\nLeveraging his sharp analytical mind, David pivoted, taking an entry-level job at a downtown investment firm. The next two decades were a methodical, relentless climb. He traded his passion for pragmatism, becoming the Senior Financial Analyst his parents could finally boast about.\n\nNow, at 49, David\u2019s life is one of controlled precision. He lives alone in a minimalist SoMa condo with floor-to-ceiling windows that look out on a city he analyzes more than he experiences. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his Tempur-Pedic bed to a standing desk in his living room. His days are a rhythm of market-opening coffee, complex spreadsheets, and a solitary evening walk along the Embarcadero. His social life is small\u2014a monthly dinner with a couple of old college friends, weekly calls with his aging parents.\n\nWhile financially secure, a quiet longing persists. He sometimes finds himself scrolling through digital archives of the Asian Art Museum, the ghost of his former self lingering. His true aspiration isn't a larger portfolio, but the courage to finally book a long-postponed research trip to rural China, to trade the security of his spreadsheets for the thrilling uncertainty of the history he left behind."

Instead of doing his math homework, he was sketching a fierce, winding dragon on the back of a brown paper bag with a leaky pen. He heard his father\u2019s approaching footsteps and shoved the drawing under a crate of winter melons. The brief thrill of creation was instantly replaced by the familiar, cold fear of being misunderstood. It was the first secret he kept, the first time his art felt like a transgression against the life they wanted for him.\n\n2.\nIn the hushed quiet of Berkeley's East Asian Library, a professor let him handle a replica of a Song Dynasty silk scroll. As he unrolled it, the vast, misty landscape emerged, a world in ink. He felt a profound sense of connection, a rightness that silenced all other ambitions. It wasn't just history; it felt like his future. For years, that feeling of the smooth, weighted silk in his hands was the compass point for the man he was supposed to become. The memory is his purest, and most painful.\n\n3.\nThe day his dream died was over lukewarm coffee in 2001. His friend, a brilliant graphic designer from his art history classes, explained how his startup had evaporated overnight. David saw the raw panic in his eyes\u2014the kind he saw in his parents' after a bad week at the store. In that moment, the beauty of a thousand-year-old scroll felt flimsy and foolish. Fear was a stronger currency than passion. He applied for his first financial internship the next day, choosing a fortress over a museum.\n\n4.\nAt 35, he closed a deal that netted him a bonus larger than his parents' annual income. His colleagues celebrated with champagne; he took a taxi back to his new SoMa condo. He stood at the floor-to-ceiling window, watching the traffic flow like data points on a screen. He felt the weight of his success, the impressive number in his bank account, but there was no joy. There was only a quiet, echoing emptiness. The security he had purchased had cost him his sense of self.\n\n5.\nLast winter, awake at 2 a.m., he found himself on the Asian Art Museum's website. He clicked through the digital archive until he found it: a landscape by Shitao he\u2019d written a passionate 20-page paper on. He zoomed in, tracing the calligraphic brushstrokes on his laptop screen with his finger. A deep, aching longing filled his chest. The ghost of the young man who loved that painting was still there, quietly asking him when he was finally coming home."
