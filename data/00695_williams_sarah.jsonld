Raised in the Pacific Northwest by itinerant academics, her childhood was a blur of rental houses and temporary friendships. This rootless upbringing instilled in her a deep yearning for community, which eventually guided her professional calling. She moved to California for her undergraduate degree and fell in love with San Francisco\u2019s vibrant, eclectic energy, staying to earn her Master of Science in School Counseling from SF State.\n\nHer early career was spent in the chaotic trenches of an underfunded public middle school. While she cared deeply, she felt like she was only ever patching holes in a sinking ship. The turning point came a decade ago when she accepted a position at a prestigious boarding school nestled near the Presidio. This role came with faculty housing, reducing her commute to the few dozen steps from her apartment door to her office.\n\nNow 47, Sarah\u2019s life and work are inextricably linked. Her days are a structured rhythm of one-on-one sessions helping students navigate everything from academic pressure to their first heartbreak. She eats most of her meals in the grand, noisy dining hall, a benevolent and constant presence in the lives of the teenagers she mentors. The line between counselor, neighbor, and surrogate aunt is beautifully blurred. A long-term relationship ended years ago, unable to compete with the all-consuming nature of her on-campus life, a sacrifice she quietly accepts.\n\nHer social life primarily consists of dinners with fellow faculty members who have become her de facto family. On weekends, she reclaims her anonymity, taking long walks through the Presidio, losing herself in the aisles of the Ferry Building marketplace, or simply reading in her quiet apartment, the distant sounds of student life a comforting backdrop. Her dream isn't to travel the world or change careers; it is the profound, simple hope of seeing her students launch successfully into the world, knowing she provided the anchor they needed. For Sarah, home isn't just an address in San Francisco; it's the community she has dedicated her life to building."
