Born to a Filipino mother who worked as a seamstress and a Mexican-American father who drove a delivery truck, Rico\u2019s childhood was a rich tapestry of cultures, filled with the sounds of cumbia from car stereos and the smell of sizzling lumpia from neighborhood parties. School was never his calling; he was a tinkerer, more interested in the guts of a broken radio than in textbooks. He scraped by and earned his GED, already pouring his energy into the city\u2019s burgeoning punk and alternative music scene.\n\nHis twenties were a blur of late nights, spent DJing in dimly lit clubs and working as a roadie for local bands. This was his real education. He learned to coil cables perfectly, diagnose a faulty soundboard in minutes, and understand the physics of a room\u2019s acoustics. His turning point came in the late \u201890s when a friend, who had just landed a job at a fledgling dot-com, needed someone to set up their chaotic conference room A/V. Rico\u2019s practical, self-taught expertise outshone anyone with a formal degree. That gig turned into a full-time job.\n\nNow, as a Senior Audio Technician for a major information services company, Rico is a ghost in the machine, the unseen expert ensuring that global video conferences and all-hands meetings run without a single pop or hiss. He is divorced, a quiet casualty of long hours and divergent paths, but maintains a close circle of friends from his music days. They meet for beers at old-school pubs in the Haight, lamenting the changing city while acknowledging they are, in their own ways, part of its new machinery.\n\nRico lives in a modest apartment in the Outer Richmond. His daily 6.5-mile commute on the Muni bus is a cherished ritual, a time to listen to obscure podcasts or simply watch the city\u2019s diverse neighborhoods blur past his window. His dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder, but to save enough to eventually open a small, affordable recording studio for emerging local artists\u2014a way to give back to the world that first gave him a place and a purpose."

While his mom\u2019s sewing machine hummed, Rico painstakingly opened it up, guided by a feeling, not a manual. The instant static crackled into a clear cumbia station, the look of quiet pride on his father\u2019s face was everything. It happened when he was nine, and it wasn\u2019t about defiance; it was about connection. He learned then that his hands could mend broken things and bring joy from silence.\n\n2.\nThe I-Beam was packed, sweat dripping from the ceiling. Mid-set, the main PA went dead silent. The band froze as a wave of anger rose from the crowd. Rico, just a roadie in his early twenties, ignored the chaos and dove under the soundboard. In the flashing strobes, he saw it: a single, fried capacitor. A quick bypass with his Leatherman and the wall of sound erupted back to life. In that moment of roaring approval, he wasn't a helper; he was the heart of the machine.\n\n3.\nHe walked into the dot-com office in the late \u201890s feeling like a fraud in his band t-shirt. The new hires in khakis were stumped by their high-tech A/V system. Rico took one look at the rat's nest of cables and just started untangling. An hour later, the video conference was crystal clear. Seeing their baffled relief, he realized for the first time that his street-taught, practical knowledge had immense value in this polished new world. His world, and his worth, got bigger that day.\n\n4.\nOne evening a few years ago, on the 38 Geary, he was watching the fog swallow the avenues. His phone buzzed with a perfunctory text from his wife. Looking at his tired reflection in the window, he felt no anger, just a deep, hollowing quiet. He saw two parallel lives that would never merge again. He was the reliable ghost at work and, he realized with a pang of profound sadness, was becoming one at home, too. It was the moment he knew the marriage was over.\n\n5.\nHe was at a scruffy bar in the Haight a few months back when the opening band took the stage. They had raw talent, but their sound was lost in a disaster of feedback and muffled vocals. Rico flinched with every pop, his fingers instinctively twitching to fix the mix. Watching their passion get lost in the noise, his purpose solidified. He wasn't just a corporate tech saving executive meetings. He was the guy who could give a band like this a real chance. His dream of a studio became a plan."
