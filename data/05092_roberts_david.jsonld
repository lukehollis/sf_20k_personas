            "value": "David Roberts\u2019 life has been a study in pragmatism over passion. The son of a Korean immigrant mother who ran a small dry-cleaning business and a free-spirited Caucasian father who worked as a carpenter, David grew up in the fog-drenched streets of Daly City. He was a bridge between his parents' worlds\u2014fluent in the sharp discipline of his mother's expectations and the gentle, artistic encouragement of his father. This duality fostered in him a quiet, observant nature.\n\nHis path seemed set when he enrolled at San Francisco State University to study graphic design, a field that married his artistic sensibilities with a viable career. However, tragedy struck during his sophomore year when his father died suddenly from a heart attack. The emotional and financial fallout was immediate. David, feeling the immense weight of responsibility for his grieving mother, dropped out of college to find stable work. He fell into a temp-to-hire position at a mortgage company, and the temporary gig solidified into a career.\n\nNow 31, David is a Loan Officer Assistant. He has traded Adobe Illustrator for Excel spreadsheets, his days governed by interest rates and underwriting guidelines. His 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse; his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond is both his sanctuary and his office. The line between work and life is perpetually blurred. His daily routine is structured: a pre-work walk through the misty edge of Golden Gate Park, eight hours of processing files, and an evening spent either cooking simple Korean dishes learned from his mother or losing himself in video games.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate yet distant. He loves the city's energy but often observes it from his window. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of high school friends and weekly dim sum with his mother, who still lives in their Daly City home. Deep down, David dreams of reclaiming his old life. He meticulously saves money, not for a down payment on a condo, but with the hope of one day returning to SFSU to finish his degree\u2014not for a career change, but for himself, to prove that the pragmatic man he had to become hasn't completely extinguished the artist he once was."

He was fourteen, sitting in their dusty Daly City garage as his dad guided his hand, etching a dragon onto a scrap of plywood. His father\u2019s calloused, patient hands over his own felt like a promise. It wasn't just about art; it was about being seen. In that moment, he felt the full, unconditional warmth of his father\u2019s world, a validation that creating things with his hands was a worthy and wonderful pursuit.\n\n2.\nThe phone call came while he was in the SFSU library, surrounded by typography books. The world went silent except for the librarian\u2019s voice on the other end saying, \"There\u2019s been an accident with your father.\" He remembers dropping the phone, the clatter echoing in the hushed space. Later, seeing his mother's shattered expression, the weight of her grief and a future of uncertainty crashed down on him. At just nineteen, his own future felt like a luxury he could no longer afford. Pragmatism was no longer a choice; it was a necessity.\n\n3.\nThe mortgage company manager slid a form across the particleboard desk. \"We'd like to make this permanent,\" she said, her smile business-like. David, then twenty, felt a cold knot of relief in his stomach. It meant a steady paycheck and health insurance for his mother. But as he signed the papers under the sterile fluorescent lights, he felt the ghost of his sketchbook grow heavier in his backpack. He wasn't accepting a job; he was accepting a different life, trading the vibrant ink of his passion for the black-and-white certainty of a spreadsheet.\n\n4.\nDuring a foggy walk in Golden Gate Park last year, he stopped to watch a young art student sketching the Conservatory of Flowers. She was completely absorbed, her charcoal-smudged fingers flying across the page. David felt a sharp, profound ache\u2014 a mix of kinship and envy. He saw a reflection of a version of himself he'd locked away. That quiet moment of observation wasn't just a walk; it solidified his resolve. He wasn't just saving money anymore; he was saving to reclaim that feeling of being completely, utterly absorbed in creation.\n\n5.\nLate one night a few years ago, after a grueling day of processing loans, he logged into his personal banking app. He stared at the growing balance in his savings account, labeled simply \"MAIN.\" With a quiet defiance, he clicked \"rename\" and typed \"SFSU Fund.\" It was a small, secret act, invisible to everyone else. But in the blue light of the monitor, those seven characters felt like a promise to his younger self and a tribute to his father. It was proof that the artist was still in there, waiting."
