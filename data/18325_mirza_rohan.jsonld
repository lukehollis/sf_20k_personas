The son of a pragmatic Iranian engineer and an idealistic Indian textile artist, he was raised in the verdant, rain-soaked suburbs of Eugene, Oregon. His childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s methodical approach to problem-solving and his mother\u2019s deep appreciation for natural beauty. A formative teenage trip to visit family in Mumbai, where he witnessed the stark contrast between sprawling slums and resource-intensive high-rises, cemented his future path. He saw that human ingenuity could create both profound inequity and breathtaking beauty, and he was determined to steer it toward the latter.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, finding a home among the redwoods, before earning his Master's in Urban and Environmental Planning from UC Berkeley. Rohan began his career in Oakland\u2019s city planning department, cutting his teeth on zoning regulations and community outreach. While he valued the public service, he grew frustrated with the slow pace of governmental change. This led him to the private sector, where he believed he could effect more immediate, tangible results. He quickly rose through the ranks at a leading San Francisco architecture firm, eventually becoming their Director of Sustainability.\n\nNow, Rohan lives in a restored Victorian flat in the Mission District with his partner, Lena, a data scientist. His day begins at dawn with the familiar click of his cleats locking into his bicycle pedals. The 3.4-mile commute is a daily meditation, a ground-level survey of the city he works to improve\u2014its vibrant murals, its homeless encampments, its nascent green infrastructure. At work, he champions everything from reclaimed materials to net-zero energy systems, persuading clients that ecological responsibility is also smart design.\n\nWeekends are for hiking in Marin or cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge with a tight-knit group of friends. Though proud to be shaping San Francisco\u2019s skyline, Rohan remains a pragmatic idealist. He dreams of a future where his work is no longer a specialty but the standard, a city where sustainability is so deeply integrated into its fabric that his job becomes obsolete."

Below, a city of blue tarps and makeshift homes pressed against the gleaming glass of a new high-rise. He felt a knot of guilt and awe tighten in his stomach\u2014the sheer ingenuity of both constructions was staggering. It wasn\u2019t a choice between them, he realized, but a problem of connection. That single image, a stark line between two worlds, became the blueprint for his life\u2019s work.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe remembers the fluorescent hum of the Oakland community center basement. He was twenty-five, presenting a bike lane proposal, and a woman with tired eyes stood up and yelled about gentrification, about being erased. Her anger was a physical force in the room. He felt a profound sense of impotence, realizing the zoning code was a feeble tool against decades of systemic harm. That night, Rohan decided he couldn't just follow the rules; he had to get inside the rooms where the projects were designed in the first place.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe client, a titan of Silicon Valley, was skeptical about the cost of the reclaimed redwood. In the sterile boardroom, Rohan set aside the charts. He spoke of the old-growth forests and the history held within the salvaged timber, connecting it to the legacy the man wanted to build. He watched the client\u2019s gaze shift from the spreadsheet to the window, to the city beyond. The eventual \u201cyes\u201d felt less like a business win and more like a quiet, electric thrill\u2014the moment he knew he could successfully translate idealism into practice.\n\n***\n\n4.\nMoving into the Mission flat with Lena. Dust motes danced in the late-afternoon light as they peeled back layers of old wallpaper in the living room. Underneath, they found a faded union stamp on the original plaster. He ran his hand over the rough surface, feeling the echo of another builder from another century. In that moment, surrounded by takeout boxes and the smell of paint, San Francisco stopped being a city he worked on and became a home he was a part of, a history he shared.\n\n***\n\n5.\nIt was a Tuesday morning, just after a rare San Francisco downpour. Cycling down Valencia, the air smelled of wet asphalt and eucalyptus. He saw a new bioswale he\u2019d championed, its native grasses glistening, channeling rainwater away from the drain exactly as designed. A few feet away, the sun caught the brilliant colors of a fresh mural. It was a fleeting, unremarkable scene, but it hit him with a jolt of pragmatic hope. This was it\u2014the slow, beautiful, imperfect work of a city healing itself."
