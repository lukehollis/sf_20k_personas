Growing up in a pragmatic, middle-class family in suburban Ohio, her world was one of sensible choices and predictable paths. A school trip to a regional art museum at age twelve was a seismic event, offering a language for feelings she couldn't otherwise name. Art became her private rebellion, a world she explored in library books while her parents championed more practical pursuits.\n\nThis passion propelled her to pursue a B.A. and then a Master's in Art History. She saw her degrees not as academic trophies, but as keys to a world she desperately wanted to inhabit. In her late twenties, she left the Midwest behind, drawn to San Francisco's bohemian promise and vibrant cultural landscape. After a few years working in sterile commercial galleries that felt more about sales than soul, she found her true calling as a Museum Educator. For over fifteen years, she has thrived on bridging the gap between art and the public, her greatest joy being the moment a visitor\u2019s eyes light up with new understanding.\n\nA significant, decade-long relationship with an architect defined her thirties. They shared a love for form and beauty, but their visions for the future diverged. When the relationship fractured, she poured her emotional energy not into dating, but into the permanence of art and community. She intentionally chose a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, just steps from Golden Gate Park and her museum, making her commute nonexistent.\n\nNow 49, Sarah\u2019s life is a curated experience. Her mornings begin with a walk through the park, watching the fog drift through the cypress trees before she enters the quiet, echoing halls of the museum before it opens to the public. Her social life is an intimate tapestry of museum colleagues, regulars from her local coffee shop, and the owner of the neighborhood bookstore. She doesn't dream of becoming a director or famous curator. Instead, her quiet ambition is to develop a new outreach program using art to connect with seniors experiencing memory loss. For Sarah, it\u2019s no longer about escaping her past, but about using her passion to build a meaningful legacy in the city she calls home."
