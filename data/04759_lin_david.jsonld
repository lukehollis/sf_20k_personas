The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who settled in Cupertino in the 1970s, he was raised in the shadow of the nascent Silicon Valley. His father, a disciplined hardware engineer, and his mother, a meticulous lab technician, envisioned a similar path for him. To satisfy them, David initially enrolled in electrical engineering at UC Berkeley, but he found the world of circuits and code profoundly empty. A required humanities course opened a door to a different world, one of human complexity and struggle. In a quiet act of rebellion, he switched his major to sociology, a decision that created a lasting, unspoken rift with his family.\n\nThis new path led him to a Master of Social Work (MSW) and eventually to his calling as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. For over two decades, David has worked within the city's labyrinthine healthcare system, specializing in crisis intervention and palliative care counseling. He has sat with families grappling with sudden loss and guided patients through the emotional turmoil of chronic illness. The work is demanding, an endless absorption of others\u2019 pain, which contributed to the amicable end of a fifteen-year relationship a decade ago.\n\nNow 51, David\u2019s life is contained within his rent-controlled Inner Sunset apartment, where his commute is a few steps from his kitchen to his home office. His days are a structured rhythm of back-to-back telehealth sessions, his calm voice a lifeline through a computer screen. Before work, he walks through the early morning fog in Golden Gate Park, a ritual to brace himself for the day. In the evenings, he unwinds by cooking simple, flavorful meals, listening to jazz records, and reading history. He has few close friends but maintains deep connections with a handful of former colleagues.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-specific; he feels more a resident of the Inner Sunset than the city at large. David\u2019s aspirations are no longer grand. He dreams of finding a way to reconnect with his aging parents on his own terms and hopes to one day travel without a schedule. Mostly, he just hopes to maintain the delicate balance he\u2019s built: offering profound empathy by day while fiercely protecting his own peace by night."

A single sentence about the intersection of personal troubles and public issues felt like a key turning in a lock he didn\u2019t know existed. In that quiet moment, surrounded by sleeping engineering students, he felt a profound, terrifying liberation. He knew he couldn't go back. This decision shaped his entire adult life, a quiet pivot from his parents' world to his own.\n\n2.\nHe was 28, a new social worker at SF General. An elderly Cantonese woman, riddled with cancer, had stopped speaking to her family. David was called in. He didn't use a translator. He sat, poured her a cup of hot water, and just watched the afternoon light move across her bed. After an hour of silence, she whispered in Toisanese, \"They are afraid of my dying.\" He simply nodded. It was the first time he understood his true work: not to fix, but to witness. That lesson became his professional cornerstone.\n\n3.\nThe conversation with Mark had the gentle finality of a closing door. They were in the kitchen of their apartment, the scent of garlic and olive oil in the air. \"You absorb so much all day, David,\" Mark had said, his voice soft with sorrow, not anger. \"When you come home, there's nothing left for us.\" David knew it was true. The end of their fifteen years wasn't a failure of love, but the harsh price of his empathy. It taught him the necessity of fiercely guarding his own quiet.\n\n4.\nTelling his father he was switching to sociology was the quietest argument of his life. At the dinner table in their Cupertino home, his father didn't raise his voice. He just looked at his bowl of rice and said, \"There is no clear path there.\" The words were not a command, but a statement of deep, irreparable disappointment. David felt the chasm open between them in that moment. It cemented a sense of otherness from his family that he would carry for decades, a foundational ache beneath his independence.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking through Golden Gate Park as the fog drifted through the cypress trees, he felt a moment of perfect equilibrium. The damp air was cold on his face, a clean slate before a day of absorbing trauma through a screen. He felt no grand ambition, no lingering regret, just the solid ground beneath his feet and the quiet strength he\u2019d built for himself. This small, contained peace was not a consolation prize; it was the entire victory."
