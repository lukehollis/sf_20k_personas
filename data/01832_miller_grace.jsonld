            "value": "Grace Miller is a San Francisco native of the fog-and-salt-air variety, raised in a small, perpetually chilly house in the Outer Richmond. Her father was a Muni driver and her mother a homemaker with a passion for gardening. Grace\u2019s childhood was defined by walks along Ocean Beach and a sense of being part of a city that felt more like a collection of quiet neighborhoods than a bustling metropolis. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, dreaming of a future surrounded by beauty as an art history major.\n\nHer path veered sharply in her junior year. Her mother\u2019s early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis pulled her from the lecture hall and into the role of a full-time caregiver. The vibrant woman who taught her to identify neighborhood flowers slowly faded, and Grace\u2019s world shrank to the confines of their small home. After her mother passed away, the facility where she had spent her final months, Laurel Heights Senior Residence, offered Grace a job. They had seen her unwavering patience and gentle nature. She accepted, needing the stability.\n\nNow, at 42, Grace\u2019s life is uniquely intertwined with her work. She lives in a small, subsidized studio apartment on the facility's ground floor, making her commute a simple walk down a hallway. Her days are a gentle rhythm of leading chair yoga, calling out bingo numbers, and sitting with residents, listening to their life stories. These residents have become her surrogate family; she is the keeper of their fading memories, a role she understands intimately. She feels a profound disconnect from the auras of tech wealth and frenetic energy that define modern San Francisco, living instead in a quiet pocket of the past.\n\nHer social life is small, consisting of a few colleagues and one old friend from high school. While she sometimes feels a pang of loneliness, she finds deep meaning in her work. Her old dream, however, hasn't entirely vanished. On quiet evenings, she pores over art books from the library. Her quiet aspiration is not to leave her residents, but to save enough money to finally see the Renaissance art she once studied\u2014to stand in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, a trip just for herself."
