Born in San Francisco to parents who had immigrated from Guangzhou in the late 1960s, her upbringing was a quiet tapestry woven within the four walls of \"Pages & Lanterns,\" their family bookstore in the Richmond District. While her friends played outside, Mei spent her childhood perched on a stool behind the counter, lost in worlds of English literature and the Chinese folktales her father kept in a special section. The store was not just a business; it was the family's living room, sanctuary, and connection to both their new home and the one they\u2019d left behind.\n\nHer own story was meant to be written elsewhere. Mei enrolled at San Francisco State University, fascinated by library science, dreaming of curating collections in a grand, quiet municipal library. But in her second year, her father suffered a major heart attack. Her mother, whose English was limited, couldn't manage the store alone. Mei left her studies to help, initially thinking it was temporary. But \"temporary\" stretched into a year, then five. After her father\u2019s passing, the responsibility became permanently hers. The dream of the library faded, replaced by the immediate, tangible need of the bookstore.\n\nNow, at 54, Mei lives in the small apartment directly above Pages & Lanterns. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days are a comforting ritual: brewing oolong tea at dawn, dusting the shelves, curating the window display, and greeting regulars by name. She never married, a brief, serious relationship in her late twenties having withered under the demands of the store. Her connections are forged over book recommendations and shared literary loves; her customers are her extended family, her social life played out in brief, meaningful conversations across the counter.\n\nMei\u2019s hope is simple yet profound: to keep the lanterns lit. In an era of algorithms and e-readers, she sees her store as an anchor of community and tangible knowledge. Her greatest aspiration is no longer for herself, but for the legacy her parents built\u2014to ensure that for years to come, someone can still walk down Clement Street, open a door, and get wonderfully, irrevocably lost in a story."
