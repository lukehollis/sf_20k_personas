The son of hardworking Taiwanese immigrants, he grew up amidst the fog and stucco houses of the Sunset District. His parents ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store, their lives dictated by inventory, long hours, and the dream of providing their son with a life of stability they never had.\n\nJoshua, however, was drawn to abstract thought. To his parents\u2019 gentle confusion, he chose to study Philosophy at UC Berkeley. He loved wrestling with Kant and Camus, but the practical pressures of his upbringing were a constant whisper. Upon graduating, he made a hard pivot. Seeing a direct path to the security his parents craved, he leveraged his sharp analytical skills and landed a coveted job at a top-tier management consulting firm.\n\nFor five years, his life was a blur of airports, client sites, and hotel rooms. He was a high performer, solving complex business problems in cities he only saw from an Uber window. But the relentless travel ground him down. The turning point came during a lonely layover in Dallas, where he realized he hadn't had a home-cooked meal in months and had missed his mother\u2019s birthday. He felt like a ghost in his own life.\n\nBurnt out but valuable to his firm, he negotiated a rare, fully remote role. Now, his 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to his standing desk. The financial rewards are significant, but the isolation is palpable. His days are a disciplined cycle of Zoom calls, data analysis, and solo lunches.\n\nTo combat the sterility of his work, Joshua forces himself to reconnect with the city of his youth. He spends his evenings on long walks, rediscovering the gritty charm of the Mission or the quiet grandeur of Golden Gate Park. He fosters a small circle of friends from college, meeting for craft beer or climbing at Dogpatch Boulders. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He aspires to save enough to one day leave consulting and open something small and meaningful\u2014perhaps a bookstore caf\u00e9, a modern version of the community hub his parents built, but one that nourishes the soul as well as the body."
