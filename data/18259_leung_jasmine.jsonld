Raised in the Sunset District by pragmatic second-generation Chinese-American parents who ran a small grocery, her childhood was filled with the expectation of a stable, predictable career. For them, success was measured in practicality, not passion. The turning point came during a high school field trip to SFMOMA. Standing before a complex, woven wire sculpture by Ruth Asawa, Jasmine felt a profound connection\u2014to the art, to the artist\u2019s heritage, and to the power of a creative voice. It was a silent act of rebellion.\n\nIgnoring her parents' pleas for her to study business, she enrolled in Art History at San Francisco State University. Her path was one of tenacity. She began with a college internship at a small community gallery in the Mission, steadily climbing from gallery assistant to program coordinator. Now, as the Director of Programs for a prominent arts non-profit, she champions the very artists her younger self needed to see, focusing on amplifying underrepresented voices in the Bay Area.\n\nAt 36, Jasmine lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that feels like a comfortable bridge between her Sunset roots and the city\u2019s vibrant core. Her 3.5-mile commute on the 38 Geary MUNI bus is her time to decompress, either reading or sketching ideas in her notebook. Her life is a curated balance: late nights coordinating gallery openings, quiet evenings with a book and a glass of wine, and weekends spent at farmers' markets or hiking with a close-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow art advocates and college holdovers.\n\nThough she finds deep fulfillment in her work, a quiet yearning persists. She dreams of one day curating a major traveling exhibition that brings national attention to Bay Area artists of color. On a personal level, she hopes to find a partner who understands that her career is not just a job, but the very heart of her connection to the city she has always called home."

She still remembers the exact sound of her father\u2019s chopsticks hitting the rice bowl when she announced her Art History major. \"Art is not a life,\" he\u2019d said, his voice flat. \"It is a hobby.\" It wasn\u2019t an argument; it was a verdict. In that cold silence, Jasmine felt not defiance, but a quiet, clarifying resolve. She understood then that building her own life meant she might have to build it without their map.\n\n2.\nAt 21, during her unpaid internship, she was tasked with hanging a small, vibrant abstract by a local Mission artist. The gallery was empty, the air thick with the smell of paint and dust. As she centered the canvas on the blank wall, she felt a profound sense of rightness, a quiet click into place. This was more real than any business lecture. She was putting a voice on the wall for others to hear, and in doing so, finally hearing her own.\n\n3.\nOne rainy Tuesday morning around age 32, the 38 Geary shuddered to a stop in traffic. Jasmine looked out the fog-streaked window at the mix of people huddled under awnings. She wasn\u2019t just commuting to a job; she was moving through the city\u2019s artery. She sketched a face in her notebook and realized her work wasn't just *in* San Francisco, it *was* San Francisco\u2014a messy, beautiful, resilient collection of stories she was privileged to help tell.\n\n4.\nLast year, at the opening for a young Filipina sculptor she\u2019d championed, Jasmine stepped back from the crowd. She saw a teenage girl standing transfixed before a brass and bamboo installation, her expression a mirror of what Jasmine had felt before that Asawa sculpture. In that moment, the years of parental disappointment and budget spreadsheets vanished. She hadn't just built a career; she had built a doorway for someone else to walk through.\n\n5.\nJust last Saturday, at the Clement Street Farmer\u2019s Market, she bought orchids and a single perfect artichoke. Surrounded by the joyful chaos of families and couples, a quiet pang echoed in the space beside her. She felt deeply rooted in her life, proud of its curated solitude. Yet, she found herself imagining explaining to someone why this particular artichoke was a small work of art, and hoping, for just a moment, that they would understand completely."
