The only child of a Jewish-American literature professor from SF State and a first-generation immigrant acupuncturist from Shanghai, Li Wei grew up in a Richmond District home filled with the aromas of both brisket and herbal decoctions. She navigated two rich cultural worlds, never feeling fully a part of either, an experience that fostered a deep empathy for those living on the margins. This hybrid identity became her strength, teaching her to see the world through multiple lenses.\n\nHer educational journey was shaped by a desire for tangible impact. While pursuing a sociology degree at UC Berkeley, she began volunteering at a free clinic in the Tenderloin. Witnessing the city's stark health disparities firsthand was a turning point. It wasn't academic anymore; it was urgent and human. This solidified her path, leading her to earn a Master of Public Health from UCSF, focusing on urban community health. She began her career as a case manager, working directly with unhoused populations, and methodically rose through the ranks, her dedication and sharp administrative skills earning her the role of Director of Community Health Programs at a Mission-based non-profit.\n\nNow 47, Li Wei\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her light-filled apartment to her office, a daily journey through the vibrant, mural-adorned streets she works to serve. A brief, intense marriage in her late twenties taught her about her own resilience, and she now shares her life with a partner, Elena, an architect whose creative pragmatism balances her own passionate idealism.\n\nHer days are a whirlwind of grant writing, staff management, and advocating for city funding. Her greatest dream is to secure the capital for a permanent, holistic wellness center that integrates mental health services, nutritional support, and preventative care under one roof. For Li Wei, San Francisco is not just a beautiful, complicated city; it is her life\u2019s work, a community she has belonged to since birth and one she is determined to leave healthier and more equitable than she found it."
