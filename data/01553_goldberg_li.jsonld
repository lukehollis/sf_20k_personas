The only child of a Jewish-American literature professor from SF State and a first-generation immigrant acupuncturist from Shanghai, Li Wei grew up in a Richmond District home filled with the aromas of both brisket and herbal decoctions. She navigated two rich cultural worlds, never feeling fully a part of either, an experience that fostered a deep empathy for those living on the margins. This hybrid identity became her strength, teaching her to see the world through multiple lenses.\n\nHer educational journey was shaped by a desire for tangible impact. While pursuing a sociology degree at UC Berkeley, she began volunteering at a free clinic in the Tenderloin. Witnessing the city's stark health disparities firsthand was a turning point. It wasn't academic anymore; it was urgent and human. This solidified her path, leading her to earn a Master of Public Health from UCSF, focusing on urban community health. She began her career as a case manager, working directly with unhoused populations, and methodically rose through the ranks, her dedication and sharp administrative skills earning her the role of Director of Community Health Programs at a Mission-based non-profit.\n\nNow 47, Li Wei\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her light-filled apartment to her office, a daily journey through the vibrant, mural-adorned streets she works to serve. A brief, intense marriage in her late twenties taught her about her own resilience, and she now shares her life with a partner, Elena, an architect whose creative pragmatism balances her own passionate idealism.\n\nHer days are a whirlwind of grant writing, staff management, and advocating for city funding. Her greatest dream is to secure the capital for a permanent, holistic wellness center that integrates mental health services, nutritional support, and preventative care under one roof. For Li Wei, San Francisco is not just a beautiful, complicated city; it is her life\u2019s work, a community she has belonged to since birth and one she is determined to leave healthier and more equitable than she found it."

            "value": "1.\nAt age ten, during a loud Passover Seder, she watched her father read from the Haggadah while her mother quietly refilled bowls of rice beside the matzo. The scent of brisket warred with the ginger steaming on the stove. Tucked between these two loving worlds, she felt a profound sense of not-quite-belonging\u2014not of loneliness, but of observation. This was the moment she first understood what it meant to live in the margins, planting the seed of empathy that would define her life.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-one, while volunteering at the Tenderloin free clinic, she held the shaking hand of an elderly man with untreated pneumonia. He whispered his fears not of dying, but of his dog being left alone in his SRO. In that moment, the city's health crisis ceased to be a statistic. It became a face, a story of profound vulnerability, and a crushing, human urgency. The experience transformed her academic interest into an unbreakable, personal commitment to community health.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after her divorce, at age thirty-one, Li Wei stood alone in her suddenly vast apartment. Instead of despair, a quiet resolve settled in her chest. She put on an old soul record, made a cup of her mother\u2019s strongest green tea, and began to meticulously rearrange the furniture. It wasn't about decoration; it was a physical act of reclaiming her space and her spirit, a silent declaration that she was, and always would be, enough on her own.\n\n4.\nOne bleak evening around age forty, she was despairing over a rejected grant for her dream wellness center. She paced, ranting about systemic injustice. Elena, her architect partner, simply slid a sketchbook across the table. On it was a quick, beautiful rendering of the center\u2019s entryway, with a caption: \"Phase One: The Welcome Mat.\" It cut through Li Wei's abstract anger with tangible hope, teaching her that her idealism needed a blueprint to become real.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking the three blocks to her Mission office, she saw a man she\u2019d helped into housing six months prior. He was laughing with a friend outside a panaderia, looking healthy. He caught her eye and gave a small, grateful nod. There was no grand speech, just a quiet acknowledgment on a sun-drenched street. This was the work\u2014not in the grants or meetings, but in that fleeting, powerful moment of restored dignity that fueled her fight."
