Born to first-generation Hong Kong immigrants, her childhood unfolded in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset. Her parents ran a small neighborhood grocery, and Sarah\u2019s world was defined by the rhythm of inventory shipments and the chatter of regulars. Her earliest memories are of watching the N Judah streetcar rattle past, a lifeline connecting her quiet, family-oriented neighborhood to the city's bustling core.\n\nThe pivotal moment in her life came at age twelve, during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Huddled with her family, she felt the city groan and shake. In the aftermath, witnessing the collapse of the Embarcadero Freeway and the city\u2019s collective effort to rebuild sparked a profound curiosity. She saw how infrastructure wasn't just concrete and steel, but the skeleton that dictates how a community lives, works, and connects. This realization propelled her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master of Urban Planning, determined to shape the city that had so profoundly shaped her.\n\nNow, at 47, Sarah is a senior planner for the city, a career she sees as a public service. She lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, strategically chosen for its proximity to City Hall, rendering her commute a short walk. Her life is a quiet, deliberate one. She never married, having poured her nurturing energy into her career and a close-knit circle of friends from college and her profession. Her days are a mix of virtual meetings from her sunlit living room and in-person site visits, analyzing zoning codes and mediating contentious community meetings.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She walks the same streets she helps design, seeing both the successes of projects like the Hayes Valley revitalization\u2014built on the ghost of a felled freeway\u2014and the persistent challenges of homelessness and housing affordability. Her dream isn't for a grand, legacy-defining project, but for a more equitable city. She hopes to help create policies that allow for the kind of stable, community-focused upbringing she had, ensuring that the next generation of San Franciscans can also call this complicated, beautiful city home."
