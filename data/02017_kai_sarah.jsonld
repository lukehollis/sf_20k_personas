Born to first-generation Hong Kong immigrants, her childhood unfolded in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset. Her parents ran a small neighborhood grocery, and Sarah\u2019s world was defined by the rhythm of inventory shipments and the chatter of regulars. Her earliest memories are of watching the N Judah streetcar rattle past, a lifeline connecting her quiet, family-oriented neighborhood to the city's bustling core.\n\nThe pivotal moment in her life came at age twelve, during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Huddled with her family, she felt the city groan and shake. In the aftermath, witnessing the collapse of the Embarcadero Freeway and the city\u2019s collective effort to rebuild sparked a profound curiosity. She saw how infrastructure wasn't just concrete and steel, but the skeleton that dictates how a community lives, works, and connects. This realization propelled her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master of Urban Planning, determined to shape the city that had so profoundly shaped her.\n\nNow, at 47, Sarah is a senior planner for the city, a career she sees as a public service. She lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, strategically chosen for its proximity to City Hall, rendering her commute a short walk. Her life is a quiet, deliberate one. She never married, having poured her nurturing energy into her career and a close-knit circle of friends from college and her profession. Her days are a mix of virtual meetings from her sunlit living room and in-person site visits, analyzing zoning codes and mediating contentious community meetings.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She walks the same streets she helps design, seeing both the successes of projects like the Hayes Valley revitalization\u2014built on the ghost of a felled freeway\u2014and the persistent challenges of homelessness and housing affordability. Her dream isn't for a grand, legacy-defining project, but for a more equitable city. She hopes to help create policies that allow for the kind of stable, community-focused upbringing she had, ensuring that the next generation of San Franciscans can also call this complicated, beautiful city home."

The scent of citrus mixed with the damp, salty fog as she waited for the low groan and then the metallic rattle of the approaching N Judah. It wasn't just a streetcar; it was the city's pulse, a silver ribbon connecting her small, quiet world to everything else. That rhythmic sound became the baseline of her childhood, embedding a deep, comforting sense that everything, and everyone, was connected.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDays after the 1989 earthquake stopped, her father drove them near the waterfront. She stared not at the damage, but at the exposed rebar and fractured concrete of the Embarcadero Freeway. It looked like a broken bone, the city\u2019s skeleton laid bare for all to see. In that moment of profound municipal vulnerability, twelve-year-old Sarah didn\u2019t just feel fear; she felt a nascent, urgent curiosity. A need to understand how cities are put together, and how they can be mended.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIn Berkeley\u2019s Wurster Hall library, she found a 1950s planning map of the Outer Sunset. Surrounded by the scent of old paper, she traced the grid of streets until she found the empty parcel where her parents' store would one day stand. Her personal history wasn't just a story; it was data, a layer in the city's living document. She felt a quiet, thrilling sense of purpose settle over her, realizing she could learn the language needed to help write its next chapter.\n\n***\n\n4.\nAt a contentious meeting in a Sunset church basement, an elderly woman\u2019s sharp Cantonese cut through the angry debate. \"You're the Kais\u2019 girl.\" Sarah, clipboard in hand, felt the decades collapse. She was no longer just a city planner; she was the grocer\u2019s daughter, explaining zoning to the faces of her past. It was a humbling, painful reminder that every line she drew on a map, every policy she wrote, landed on a real person in a real home.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, walking home, she paused at Patricia\u2019s Green. Children were playing where the Central Freeway once cast its long, ugly shadow\u2014the very scar that had set her life\u2019s course. She saw both the triumph and the irony: she now lived peacefully on the ghost of the structure that had first inspired her. It was a bittersweet feeling; a testament to the city\u2019s capacity for renewal, and a constant, personal reminder of how much was left to heal."
