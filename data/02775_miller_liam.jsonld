The only child of a high school history teacher and an accountant, Liam grew up in a home filled with books and fiscal responsibility. He was a thoughtful, observant child who preferred the grand narratives of the past to the messy uncertainties of the present. This passion led him to UC Santa Cruz, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in History, diving deep into European studies while his peers pursued more \"practical\" STEM fields.\n\nThe turning point came after graduation. Feeling adrift with a degree that offered few direct career paths, Liam felt the pull of San Francisco\u2014not for a specific job, but for the promise of a life entirely his own. He landed an administrative assistant position at a tech consulting firm in the Financial District, a role he secured through sheer organization and a calm demeanor. It was a foothold, a way to pay the bills.\n\nNow, at 25, Liam\u2019s life is defined by the four walls of his small apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a journey from his bed to the desk tucked into a corner of his living room. His days are a digital hum of scheduling meetings, formatting reports, and managing calendars for people he\u2019s never met in person. His connection to the city is intensely local; he knows every coffee shop on Clement Street and considers Golden Gate Park his backyard, often taking long, meandering walks to clear his head after a day of staring at a screen.\n\nHis social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of a few college friends and a weekly trivia team he joined at a local pub. He feels a gentle, persistent ache of being adjacent to the city's vibrant energy rather than a part of it. Liam\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to find a way to reconnect with his passion. He spends his evenings browsing job postings for museums and historical archives, aspiring to a future where his work is not just about efficiency, but about meaning. He is gracefully treading water, grateful for the stability his job provides but eagerly scanning the horizon for a shore worth swimming to."
