Born in Fremont to Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business, her childhood was defined by the Bay Area\u2019s sprawling suburbs. She saw firsthand how a city\u2019s design dictated life\u2019s possibilities. Her parents, who worked grueling hours, dreamed of her becoming a doctor or lawyer, but Olivia was more fascinated by the BART system that connected her world and the frustrating traffic that often isolated it.\n\nThis fascination led her to pursue a Master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA. A key turning point came during an internship where she analyzed transit data. She saw her mother not as a statistic, but as a real person, recalling the decades her mother spent taking three different buses to get to their shop. That memory cemented her purpose: to create transportation systems that were equitable, efficient, and dignified. She wanted to give people back their time.\n\nNow 37, Olivia is a senior transportation planner for the city. She lives in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood she chose for its walkability and central location. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her professional philosophy; she either works from her bay window overlooking the street or walks the few blocks to her City Hall office.\n\nHer days are a mix of data analysis, community outreach meetings, and designing the future of San Francisco's streets. She\u2019s known for her calm demeanor and her ability to find common ground between frustrated drivers and militant cyclists. Her personal life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Mornings start with a cortado from a local caf\u00e9, evenings are for jogs through Golden Gate Park or dinner with a close-knit group of friends\u2014her chosen family in the city.\n\nOlivia doesn't dream of wealth, but of legacy. Her greatest aspiration is to one day ride a new, seamless light-rail line or bike down a fully protected corridor that she helped bring to life. For Olivia, improving the city's circulatory system is more than a job; it\u2019s an act of love for the community she serves and a quiet tribute to the parents who sacrificed so much to get here."
