Raised in Sacramento, she was the daughter of a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a passionate Mexican-American muralist. Her childhood was a blend of her mother\u2019s structured care and her father\u2019s chaotic, colorful creativity. From a young age, Kaia became a natural observer, trying to make sense of the stories, flavors, and languages that coexisted in her home. This innate desire to understand and organize the narratives around her unknowingly set her on her future path.\n\nDrawn to the coast and a more progressive environment, she pursued Media Studies at UC Santa Cruz. There, she fell in love with deconstructing how information shapes culture. A pivotal internship during her junior year at a San Francisco digital archive changed everything. For the first time, her academic interest felt tangible and urgent. She discovered a passion for preserving the fleeting digital footprints of communities, ensuring their stories weren't lost to outdated platforms or systemic neglect. Upon graduating, she leveraged that experience into a full-time position as a Digital Content Curator for a non-profit focused on Bay Area cultural history.\n\nNow, at 24, Kaia\u2019s life is rooted in her Panhandle apartment, a bright, plant-filled space she shares with two friends. Her daily routine begins with a 2.5-mile bicycle commute, a therapeutic ride that cuts through the morning fog and connects her to the city\u2019s rhythm. She thrives on the neighborhood's energy, spending weekends at the Clement Street Farmer's Market or finding quiet corners of Golden Gate Park to read. Her social life is a close-knit circle of college friends, bonded by shared ambitions and the challenge of building a life in an expensive city.\n\nKaia feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2019s layered history, a city constantly reinventing itself yet haunted by its past\u2014much like herself. Her dream is to eventually lead her own large-scale digital humanities project, creating an interactive \"digital mural\" that tells the stories of the Bay Area's multiracial communities. For Kaia, this isn't just a career; it's a way to honor her parents' legacies\u2014blending art and information to build something lasting."

Instead of filling it with carnitas, he'd dip it into her mom's sour sinigang broth, a fusion that belonged only to them. Her mom would just smile, a quiet acceptance of his loving chaos. It wasn't two worlds colliding, but one world being built in their Sacramento kitchen. That memory became her compass, proving that the most beautiful stories exist in the spaces between\u2014the ones she felt destined to find and preserve.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during her SF internship, she stumbled upon a ghost. It was a defunct Geocities page for a 90s Mission District Filipino social club, full of pixelated photos and broken links. A surge of panic and purpose hit her. These were her mother's people, their digital lives one server wipe away from oblivion. In that stuffy archive room, her abstract studies on culture became a tangible, urgent mission. She wasn\u2019t just an observer anymore; she had to be a protector.\n\n3.\nIt was a Tuesday morning, age 22, just months after moving into her Panhandle flat. She was biking through the park, chilled by the dense fog, when the sun pierced through right as she passed the Conservatory of Flowers. The whole landscape was suddenly golden and sharp. It felt like the city was showing her a secret, a private moment of beauty just for her. On that ride, the exhaustion of San Francisco living finally felt less like a struggle and more like a promise.\n\n4.\nLast year, when her roommate lost her tech job, the three of them sat on their living room floor. They pooled their remaining cash\u2014not for rent, but for cheap dumplings from Clement Street and a six-pack. Huddled under a blanket, they talked not about resumes, but about their fears and ridiculous hopes. That night, amidst the shared anxiety, Kaia felt a profound sense of wealth. Their small, fierce community was the most valuable thing they were building in this expensive city.\n\n5.\nJust a few weeks ago at the Clement Street Farmer's Market, she saw an elderly Chinese man showing his granddaughter a photo on his phone. The girl laughed, tapping the screen. Surrounded by the chatter of Russian, Cantonese, and English, Kaia saw it all click into place. Her \u201cdigital mural\u201d wasn't just about archiving the past; it was about creating a canvas for these tiny, living moments of connection. It was her father\u2019s art and her mother\u2019s care, finally made whole."
