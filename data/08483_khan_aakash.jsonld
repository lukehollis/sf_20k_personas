The son of pragmatic Hyderabadi immigrants who settled in Fremont, he grew up in a home that valued engineering and medicine above all else. While his parents built stable lives in Silicon Valley, Aakash was a quiet, observant child, more fascinated by the faded photograph albums detailing their life in India than the coding manuals on their shelves. He saw stories in the creases and silent gazes, a tangible history he felt compelled to preserve.\n\nThis inclination created a gentle friction with his family\u2019s ambitions for him. He dutifully enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, initially undeclared but feeling the pressure to pursue computer science. A work-study job in the university\u2019s special collections library became his turning point. The scent of aging paper and the meticulous process of organizing someone\u2019s life into labeled, acid-free boxes felt like a calling. He switched his major to history and, to his parents\u2019 quiet dismay, pursued a Master of Library and Information Science with a focus on Digital Curation.\n\nHis career began with a unique opportunity: a fellowship at the Larkspur Foundation for Ephemeral Art, a small, private institution housed in a converted Pacific Heights mansion. The position came with a small apartment on the building's top floor, reducing his commute to a flight of stairs. Now 26, Aakash lives a life of profound focus. His days are spent digitizing the works of forgotten 20th-century Bay Area artists\u2014performance art flyers, letters, undeveloped film negatives. He is a custodian of fragile legacies.\n\nHis social life is small and intentional, consisting of a few grad school friends and occasional, polite phone calls with his sister, who acts as a diplomat to their parents. He finds San Francisco not in its bustling nightlife but in the historical architecture he sees on his evening walks and the cultural ghosts he communes with daily. Aakash\u2019s deepest aspiration is to curate a groundbreaking digital exhibition that makes one of his archived artists posthumously famous. It\u2019s a quiet dream, one he hopes will not only bring a forgotten story to light but also finally demonstrate to his family that preserving the past is its own form of building a future."
