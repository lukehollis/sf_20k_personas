Born in Fresno to immigrant parents from Oaxaca, Mexico, she spent her childhood navigating the sun-baked realities of the Central Valley. Her parents, who worked tirelessly in agricultural fields, instilled in her a profound sense of community, but she also witnessed firsthand the healthcare disparities that plagued it. She recalls her grandmother struggling to communicate with doctors, her father delaying care for a work injury due to cost, and the community\u2019s reliance on informal, often inadequate, health advice.\n\nThis early exposure became her calling. While her parents hoped she would become a doctor, Sofia realized her passion was not in treating individuals, but in fixing the systemic barriers they faced. This led her to pursue a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley, a move that brought her to the Bay Area and cemented her career path.\n\nNow 34, Sofia is a Program Manager for Community Health at a large San Francisco healthcare system. Her 0.0-mile commute means her office is the second bedroom of her vibrant Mission District apartment. Her days are a mix of Zoom calls with community partners, analyzing data on health outcomes in underserved populations, and writing grant proposals to fund bilingual health navigator programs.\n\nHer connection to the Mission is both professional and deeply personal. She starts her mornings with a cortado from a local panaderia and ends her evenings sharing pupusas with a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom she met in grad school. She is acutely aware of the gentrification reshaping her neighborhood, a tension she lives with daily. She champions the very clinics and cultural centers that are fighting to survive.\n\nSofia\u2019s dream is to secure a multi-year federal grant that would allow her to scale her programs across the Bay Area, creating a replicable model for culturally competent healthcare. Personally, she hopes to one day buy a small condo in the Mission, solidifying her roots in the community she has dedicated her life to serving. She is driven by the memory of her family\u2019s struggles, determined to build a healthier, more equitable future for the city she now calls home."
