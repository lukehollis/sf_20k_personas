The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Clement Street, David grew up stocking shelves and translating for his parents. He was the quiet, observant child who absorbed the anxieties and hopes of his community, promising himself he would find a more stable path.\n\nHe fulfilled his parents' academic dreams, earning a Political Science degree from UC Berkeley. The obvious next step was a lucrative corporate law track, but a summer internship at a nonprofit providing legal aid to immigrants changed his trajectory. The faces he helped reminded him of his own family. He pivoted, earning his Juris Doctor from UC Hastings College of the Law with a newfound purpose.\n\nAfter a few grueling years at a larger immigration law firm, David experienced his major turning point. The impersonal, high-volume nature of the work felt disconnected from the reason he started. He and a like-minded colleague took a leap of faith, pooling their resources to launch their own small firm. It was a risky, exhausting endeavor, but it gave him autonomy.\n\nNow, at 44, David is a partner in that successful firm, which operates almost entirely remotely. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his meticulously organized home office in a classic Edwardian flat, just blocks from his childhood home. His days have a practiced rhythm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park as the fog burns off, long hours on video calls with clients from around the world, and evenings spent cooking simple, nourishing meals. A short-lived marriage in his thirties left him more introspective and dedicated to his work. His social circle is small but loyal, consisting of a few old friends from law school.\n\nDavid\u2019s ambition is no longer about wealth, but impact and peace. He dreams of creating a fellowship program at his firm for young lawyers passionate about immigrant rights. He finds contentment in the familiar\u2014the scent of bakeries on Clement, the distant sound of a foghorn\u2014a man who built his life\u2019s work on honoring where he came from, right in the heart of the neighborhood that raised him."
