Born in the East Bay to a pragmatic Chinese-American software engineer from San Francisco and an expressive literature professor from Mumbai, India, his childhood was a loving negotiation of cultures. He became the family\u2019s resident diplomat, learning to read the subtle emotional cues between his stoic father\u2019s family and his boisterous maternal relatives. This constant act of bridging communication gaps wasn't a burden but a fascination, planting the seed for his future career.\n\nInitially considering a path in tech like his father, a pivotal volunteer experience at a youth crisis hotline during his undergrad at SF State changed his trajectory. He saw how many young people, especially from immigrant and mixed-race families, struggled without language for their emotional turmoil. He realized his \"translation\" skills had a higher calling. He pursued a Master's in Counseling Psychology, focusing on cross-cultural communication and family systems.\n\nNow 30, Rohan is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist at a community health clinic in the Mission District, serving a diverse, often low-income, clientele. His days are a marathon of empathy, helping families navigate trauma, acculturation stress, and generational conflict. His commute on the N Judah from his Inner Richmond apartment is a sacred buffer, a time for podcasts and quiet reflection before and after the emotional intensity of his work.\n\nHe lives a life of intentional balance. Mornings often start with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears his head. He finds solace in cooking, creating dishes that fuse the Szechuan flavors of his father\u2019s youth with the aromatic spices of his mother\u2019s kitchen. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow therapists and old college friends who share his values. Though dedicated to his work, Rohan dreams of opening a small group practice with colleagues, one specializing in mental health for the Bay Area's uniquely diverse population. His deepest aspiration is to build a life\u2014and a family\u2014founded on the same open, honest communication he now teaches others, finally mastering the language of the heart he began learning as a boy."

His mother's family filled the room with boisterous laughter, while his father's relatives communicated in quiet, deliberate nods. He saw his mother offer his paternal grandfather a sweet, her gesture effusive and warm. The old man simply smiled, a rare and subtle thing. In that quiet exchange, Rohan saw the same love, spoken in two different languages. It wasn't a conflict to solve, but a beautiful puzzle he was privileged to understand.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent lights of the crisis hotline office hummed. It was 2 AM during his junior year at SF State. On the line, a boy whispered about his parents not understanding his \"sadness,\" how they saw it as a failure. Rohan heard the coded language of immigrant expectations and unspoken pressures. In that moment, the abstract idea of a tech career dissolved. This boy\u2019s pain was a signal he could read fluently, a code he was born to help decipher. He knew, with sudden, absolute clarity, what his life\u2019s work would be.\n\n3.\nJust last year, in his small office in the Mission, a father and his teenage daughter sat in stony silence for the fourth session. Rohan gently prodded, reframing the daughter\u2019s anger as fear. Suddenly, the father\u2019s composure broke. In halting Spanish, he admitted he wasn't angry, just terrified of losing her in this vast, new country. The girl\u2019s clenched fists finally uncurled as she began to weep. The profound, fragile relief in that room felt more validating than any diploma; it was the sacred purpose of his work made real.\n\n4.\nOne recent foggy Sunday, Rohan stood in his Inner Richmond kitchen. He wasn\u2019t following a recipe. He heated chili oil in a wok, the Szechuan peppercorns numbing the air, then tossed in a spoonful of his mother\u2019s garam masala. The aromas, once from separate worlds, fused into something entirely new. It wasn't just fusion cooking; it was a moment of pure integration. He was creating a dish that tasted only like home\u2014*his* home. That feeling of peace, of creating a cohesive whole, was the solace he sought.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, sitting on the floor of a friend\u2019s apartment with two other therapists, the exhaustion of the week was a shared blanket. They weren't just venting; they were sketching out their dream practice on a napkin\u2014a clinic for families like theirs, for kids caught between worlds. In their easy shorthand and shared vision, Rohan felt a profound sense of belonging. This was his found family, the people who spoke his native tongue of empathy. The dream felt less like an aspiration and more like an inevitability."
