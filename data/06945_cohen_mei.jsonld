Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District, she is the daughter of a pragmatic Shanghai-born pharmacist mother and an intellectual Jewish-American history professor father from Brooklyn. Her childhood was a fusion of cultures: Shabbat dinners followed by weekends helping at her mother\u2019s pharmacy, learning the value of both ancient traditions and meticulous, practical work. She grew up feeling like a native observer of the city\u2019s constant evolution.\n\nHer educational path was driven by a desire for tangible results. She earned a B.A. in Economics from UC Berkeley, graduating just in time to witness the tail end of the dot-com bubble. Her first job as a junior analyst at a startup that spectacularly imploded was a formative experience. It taught her that vision without process was chaos. This realization spurred her to pursue an MBA in Organizational Behavior from UCLA, determined to be the person who built the strong, scalable systems that brilliant but chaotic founders often lacked. Her career has been a steady, deliberate climb through the ranks of project management to her current role as a Director of Operations for a successful enterprise software company.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 38. The amicable but painful separation from her college sweetheart led to a period of intense self-reflection. She sold their shared condo in the Mission and bought a meticulously restored Victorian flat in Noe Valley, creating a sanctuary that was entirely her own. Since her company went fully remote, her commute is a ten-step walk to a sunlit home office overlooking her small, curated garden. Her days are a disciplined mix of back-to-back Zoom calls and intense focus blocks, broken up by a mandatory late-afternoon run through the Panhandle.\n\nWhile professionally fulfilled, Mei aspires for a different kind of impact. She quietly mentors young women in tech, helping them navigate corporate structures she knows all too well. Her dream is to eventually transition into angel investing, specifically funding female-founded companies focused on sustainable community solutions\u2014a way to reconcile the tech-driven wealth of the new San Francisco with the community-oriented city she remembers. For Mei, SF is not just a backdrop for her career; it is the complex, ever-changing, and deeply loved protagonist of her own life story."
