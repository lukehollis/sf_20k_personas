The son of a high school history teacher and an accountant, he was raised on practicality and pursued a Bachelor's in History from Ohio State, imagining a life surrounded by dusty archives.\n\nThe academic world, however, proved elusive. Needing a job, David found a surprising home managing a large bookstore. He discovered a talent for orchestrating the retail dance\u2014managing inventory, staff, and the quiet satisfaction of putting the right book in a customer's hands. In his late twenties, love pulled him west. He followed a partner to San Francisco, a city that buzzed with an energy entirely foreign to him. The relationship eventually faded, a common casualty of changing priorities, but David\u2019s connection to the city had taken root.\n\nA key turning point came when his bookstore chain shuttered. Forced to pivot, David leveraged his management skills to land a job at a sleek new technology store. He translated his ability to manage people and process from paper to pixels, becoming a calm, respected anchor amid a sea of ever-changing gadgets and young, ambitious staff. Over the next decade, he rose to become the Store Manager.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is a study in curated efficiency. He lives in a modern Hayes Valley condo, just a two-minute walk from his store. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a defense against the city\u2019s chaotic transit. His days are structured: an morning espresso from the cafe downstairs, the predictable rhythm of his store, and evenings spent either decompressing with a historical documentary or meeting a few old friends for a drink\u2014fellow veterans of a city in constant flux.\n\nHe feels like a permanent resident in a transient town, an observer of the tech-fueled booms and busts he helps facilitate from his shop floor. While content, David nurses a quiet dream: to open a small, specialized hobby shop, perhaps for model trains or high-end board games. It\u2019s a longing for something tangible and lasting, a final chapter written on his own terms, away from the relentless upgrade cycle of his profession."
