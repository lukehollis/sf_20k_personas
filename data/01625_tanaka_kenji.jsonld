The only son of a stoic, second-generation Japanese American software engineer and a warm, supportive librarian, Kenji\u2019s childhood was a quiet landscape of academic expectation. He was groomed for a future in Silicon Valley, a path paved with logic and code. He obediently enrolled in computer science at UC Davis, but found himself suffocated by the binary nature of it all. He was more interested in the unspoken tensions between his project partners than in the code they were writing.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. A visit home revealed a deep, unspoken rift between his parents, a chasm of misunderstood intentions and years of emotional disconnect. Witnessing their pain, Kenji realized his true calling wasn't in debugging systems, but in helping people debug their own lives. He abruptly changed his major to psychology and transferred to San Francisco State University, a decision that initially strained his relationship with his father.\n\nAt SFSU, Kenji thrived. He felt an immediate connection to the city's vibrant, complex humanity. He pursued his Master\u2019s in Counseling, focusing on the unique pressures faced by young professionals and couples. Now 29, Kenji is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). His office is a calming, minimalist corner of his Hayes Valley apartment, where he runs a private telehealth practice. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his desk.\n\nHis days are structured yet flexible. Morning sessions with clients\u2014often tech workers grappling with burnout and relational stress\u2014are followed by a walk to a local cafe for an oat latte. He finds peace watching the city\u2019s rhythm from a bench in Patricia\u2019s Green. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends from his graduate program who understand the weight of their work.\n\nKenji\u2019s greatest aspiration is to destigmatize therapy within communities like the one he grew up in. He dreams of expanding his practice to offer workshops for families, hoping to give others the tools his own family lacked. While he has mended the bond with his father, he hopes to one day forge the deep, emotionally articulate connection that first set him on this path."
