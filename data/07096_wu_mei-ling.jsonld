            "value": "Mei-ling Wu\u2019s world is contained within two square blocks of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. Born in a small village in Guangdong, China, her childhood was defined by communal farm work and the dream of a more prosperous life abroad. She completed her secondary education, a significant achievement for a girl in her village at the time, but her real-world schooling began when she was 22. She followed her husband, Li-wei, who had immigrated to San Francisco a year prior, arriving with little more than a small suitcase and his address scrawled on a piece of paper.\n\nHer first years were a blur of language classes and odd jobs. Li-wei worked as a handyman, and Mei-ling found her footing in the demanding, scalding-hot environment of a restaurant kitchen, starting as a dishwasher. She was a quiet observer, watching the cooks with intense focus. Her quick hands and natural understanding of flavor balance didn't go unnoticed. Within a few years, she was promoted to prep, then finally to the line, her station becoming the heart of the dinner rush.\n\nThe major turning point in her life came fifteen years ago when Li-wei died suddenly of a heart attack. The grief was immense, but the restaurant became her sanctuary. The sizzle of the wok and the rhythmic chop of her cleaver were a constant, grounding force. She never remarried; the kitchen staff became her surrogate family.\n\nToday, Mei-ling is the Senior Line Cook at the Golden Dragon Restaurant. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down two flights of stairs from her small SRO unit to the kitchen below. Her days are long and physically taxing, beginning before dawn with prep and ending late after cleanup. She is the respected elder of the kitchen, mentoring younger immigrant cooks with a firm but fair hand. Her social life is woven into her routine: morning greetings with the grocer on Stockton Street, a shared cigarette with the sous chef during their break, and occasional weekend mahjong games with other women in her building.\n\nHer dreams are modest. She hopes her aching joints will allow her to work for another decade. She sends money home to her sister in China and hopes to one day see her grand-nieces, if only on a smartphone screen. Mei-ling\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t the Golden Gate Bridge or cable cars; it\u2019s the worn handle of her wok, the familiar faces in her neighborhood, and the pride of knowing that thousands of people have been nourished by the work of her hands."
