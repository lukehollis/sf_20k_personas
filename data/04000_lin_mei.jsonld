Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she is the daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store with tireless dedication. Growing up, Mei absorbed their work ethic but dreamt of a more creative life, enrolling at San Francisco State University to study graphic design, her sketchbooks filled with vibrant cityscapes.\n\nHer path dramatically shifted during her sophomore year when her father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Mei dropped out of college to help her mother run the struggling store, trading her art classes for inventory logs and long hours behind the counter. After her father\u2019s death and the eventual sale of the family business, Mei and her mother needed stability. A quiet pact was made when the long-time manager of their apartment building offered Mei an assistant position in exchange for reduced rent. It was a practical solution that has since defined her life.\n\nNow, at 35, Mei\u2019s commute is a walk down one flight of stairs. Her days are a cycle of responding to maintenance requests, showing vacant units, and mediating minor tenant disputes. She is the building's quiet nerve center, the keeper of spare keys and whispered histories. Her social life is woven into this ecosystem; her closest connections are with the elderly woman in 2A who shares her gossip and the young couple in 4B she occasionally babysits for. Her mother still lives with her, their shared apartment a sanctuary of familiar Cantonese dishes and evening television.\n\nThough her life feels contained, Mei\u2019s artistic dreams persist. Late at night, after the building has settled, she still sketches. Her hope isn't for fame, but for a small, tangible piece of her old dream: to one day save enough to open a small stationery shop, a space where she can curate beautiful paper and pens and, perhaps, sell a few of her own prints of the city that hums just beyond her window."

Her father, smelling of cardboard and ginger, paused his stocking of shelves. He didn\u2019t say much, just a soft, \"H\u00f3u leng,\"\u2014very beautiful\u2014before taping her drawing near the register. It was a rare, quiet acknowledgment that her world of lines and color had value in his world of numbers and work. That moment of shared, unspoken pride still fuels her.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the charcoal dust on her fingers when she took the call in the hallway of the SF State Fine Arts building. Her mother\u2019s voice was thin, fragile, saying the doctor's name. In that instant, the vibrant, boundless future she was sketching felt like an impossible luxury. Closing her heavy portfolio at the end of class felt like closing a door on a version of herself she would never get back. It was her first true lesson in duty over desire, a lesson that shaped her path completely.\n\n3.\nAfter the sale of the grocery store was final, she and her mother stood on the sidewalk, the familiar jingle of the shop's front door silenced forever. She held the keys, worn smooth from her father\u2019s pocket. It wasn't just a store; it was the entire architecture of her family's American dream. Handing the keys to the new owner, she felt a profound, directionless quiet settle over her, the end of an era leaving her untethered in the city of her birth.\n\n4.\nMr. Henderson, the old manager, offered her the assistant job by the mailboxes in the lobby. The deal\u2014work for him, keep her apartment\u2014was a lifeline. She felt a staggering sense of relief, the fear of rent and instability vanishing. But as she said yes, she saw her reflection in the brass door handle, a small, still figure contained within the building\u2019s ornate frame. It was a premonition of the quiet, circumscribed life she was accepting in that single, grateful breath.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, she was returning a book to the young mother in 4B, and a small sketch of the Sutro Tower she\u2019d used as a bookmark fell out. \"Did you draw this, Mei?\" the woman asked, her voice full of genuine admiration. \"You should sell these.\" It was a simple comment, but for Mei, it was a tiny window opening in a room she\u2019d long kept shut. That night, she didn\u2019t just sketch; she started researching the cost of a business license."
