Born in Daly City to first-generation Indian immigrants, she was the dutiful eldest daughter, expected to bridge her parents' world of tradition with the promise of American opportunity. Her father worked two jobs, and her mother infused their home with the aromas of cardamom and cumin, and the silent expectation that Samantha would achieve the stability they never had.\n\nHer dream was to study art history at SF State. For two vibrant years, she was immersed in Impressionism and the lives of artists who broke from convention. That dream was cut short when her mother was diagnosed with a debilitating illness. Samantha left school without a second thought, taking on a series of administrative jobs to help with medical bills. It was a practical pivot, a sacrifice she never regretted but which quietly reshaped the arc of her life. She became an expert in organization and support, the invisible scaffolding that allowed others to succeed.\n\nOver the decades, Samantha drifted into the tech sector, not out of passion for innovation, but for the solid paycheck and benefits. She has worked for four different startups, watching young founders become millionaires while she remained the constant, dependable force managing their calendars and organizing their chaotic workflows.\n\nNow 52, Samantha lives alone in the same rent-controlled apartment she moved into thirty years ago. The pandemic shifted her role to be fully remote, and her commute became a ten-foot walk from her bedroom to a small desk overlooking a patch of fuchsia bougainvillea. Her days are structured by Slack notifications and video calls. For human connection, she relies on weekly calls with her younger brother, a successful lawyer in Marin, and occasional dinners with a small circle of friends from a previous job.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. It's not the bustling downtown or the chic Mission hotspots, but the sound of the foghorns at night and the feeling of the cold sand of Ocean Beach under her feet during her lunch-break walks. Her deepest aspiration is no longer a degree, but a future a little less defined by the needs of others. She is diligently saving for a trip to India, to see the Rajasthan her father described, and has recently bought a set of watercolors, considering, for the first time in decades, painting a world entirely of her own making."
