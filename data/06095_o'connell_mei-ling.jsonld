Born in the Sunset District to an Irish-American history professor and a first-generation immigrant librarian from Taiwan, her childhood was a fusion of cultures. She navigated foggy avenues and the intricacies of two distinct heritages, her name a testament to the blend. This upbringing instilled in her a deep-seated curiosity about how people connect, which led her to pursue an undergraduate degree in East Asian Studies at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer academic path, however, took a sharp turn in the mid-90s. Caught up in the electricity of the nascent internet boom, Mei-ling saw a future not in dusty library archives but in the vibrant, chaotic world of digital creation. Realizing her humanities background gave her a unique lens on user behavior, she pivoted, earning an MBA from Stanford with a focus on technology management. Her career began at a flashy dot-com that imploded spectacularly in 2001. That failure became a pivotal lesson in resilience and the importance of substance over hype. Instead of chasing unicorn startups, she dedicated herself to building a steady, impactful career at established tech firms, methodically climbing the ranks.\n\nNow 51 and a Senior Product Development Manager, Mei-ling lives a life of disciplined calm in her Noe Valley condo. The O'Connell name is a remnant of a long-ago, amicable divorce; she kept it because, after two decades, it felt as much a part of her as Mei-ling. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are rooted in her neighborhood. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe, followed by hours of video calls from a home office overlooking the city. She manages teams across time zones, her job being to translate human needs into functional, elegant software.\n\nHer social circle is small and cherished, composed of a few friends from her Berkeley days and a trusted work confidante. Though her career is demanding, her aspirations are shifting. She dreams less of the next promotion and more of legacy\u2014mentoring young women entering the tech field. In the back of her mind, a plan is forming: to step back in a few years, consult part-time, and finally use her freedom to travel, not for work, but for the pure joy of seeing the world she once only studied in books."
