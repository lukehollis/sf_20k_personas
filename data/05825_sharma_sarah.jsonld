Born in Daly City to immigrants from Mumbai, her childhood was filled with the familiar pressures of academic excellence. Her parents, a diligent accountant and a loving homemaker, envisioned a life for her in engineering or law\u2014stable, prestigious, and a world away from their own struggles.\n\nRespecting their wishes, Sarah initially pursued a path of practicality, earning a Bachelor's degree in Communications from San Francisco State University. This led to a brief, unfulfilling career in corporate marketing downtown. The work felt hollow, a daily performance of enthusiasm for products she didn\u2019t care about. The true turning point came with the birth of her first child, Maya. Leaving her job to be a full-time mother, Sarah discovered her true calling not in boardrooms, but on the floor surrounded by picture books and wooden blocks. She found immense joy in witnessing the world anew through a child\u2019s eyes.\n\nThis realization prompted a career pivot. She returned to SF State to earn a certificate in Early Childhood Education. Shortly after, she and her supportive husband, an urban planner named Raj, bought the ground-floor unit of a classic Edwardian duplex in the Inner Richmond. The space was perfect. In 2005, Sarah opened \"Clement Street Sprouts,\" a small, play-based preschool she runs from her home.\n\nNow at 50, Sarah\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her commute is a walk across the hall. Her days are a vibrant chaos of finger painting, story time in her foggy backyard, and walks to Mountain Lake Park. Her own two children are now in college, but her home is never quiet. Her social circle is a tight-knit community of the families she serves. Her biggest dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder, but simple: to continue offering a sanctuary of creativity and kindness for the city\u2019s youngest residents. She hopes one day to write a children\u2019s book inspired by the unique magic of growing up in San Francisco."
