The first was the one his immigrant parents, owners of a small grocery store in the Sunset District, had dreamed of. Matthew, a diligent son, followed the prescribed path: a business degree from Berkeley, followed by an MBA from Stanford. He spent his late twenties and early thirties as a rising star in a Bay Area venture capital firm, his days a blur of pitch decks, market analysis, and the relentless pressure of financial growth. He had the high-rise apartment, the six-figure salary, and a profound sense of hollowness.\n\nThe turning point came at 32. After closing a multi-million-dollar deal, he felt nothing but exhaustion. He realized he was building someone else\u2019s dream. That weekend, he volunteered to tutor at a local community center, and in explaining a historical concept to a teenager, he felt a spark of purpose he hadn't experienced in a decade. Within a year, he had quit his job, cashed out a portion of his stock options, and enrolled in a graduate program to earn his Master\u2019s in History and a teaching credential.\n\nNow, at 44, Matthew lives his second act. He is a history teacher at a prestigious private school with faculty housing, hence his zero-mile commute. His small, book-filled apartment overlooks the campus green, a world away from his former view of the Transamerica Pyramid. His daily routine is grounded and intentional: a foggy morning run through the Presidio, animated classroom discussions about the fall of Rome, and afternoon sessions coaching the school\u2019s debate team.\n\nHis social life is a close-knit circle of fellow educators, with whom he shares potlucks and conversations that value ideas over IPOs. He maintains a respectful but somewhat distant relationship with his parents, who still don\u2019t fully understand his choice but are proud of the respect he commands as an educator. Matthew\u2019s dream is no longer a corner office but a quiet one: to write a popular history book that makes the past feel as urgent and alive for others as it does for him. He found his wealth not in a portfolio, but in the echoes of the past and the potential of the future he sees in his students\u2019 faces every day."
