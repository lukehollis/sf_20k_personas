The daughter of a determined Mexican father and a graceful Peruvian-Japanese (Nikkei) mother, her childhood home was a vibrant fusion of flavors and languages. The scent of simmering adobo often mingled with fresh miso, and conversations shifted seamlessly between Spanish, Japanese, and English. Her parents, who ran a small but beloved grocery specializing in both Latin American and Japanese goods, instilled in her a meticulous work ethic and an appreciation for bridging disparate worlds.\n\nHer educational journey led her to UC Santa Barbara, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Communications. The degree felt broad enough to be practical, a tool for understanding how people and systems connect. After graduating, she followed a long-term partner to San Francisco, moving for his tech job and the promise of a shared future. However, the relationship fractured under the city\u2019s demanding pace, leaving Renata at a crossroads. Alone, in a city she had adopted for someone else, she made the pivotal decision to stay and build a life entirely her own.\n\nThis turning point catalyzed her career. Starting as an executive assistant at a mid-size tech firm, her innate ability to organize chaos and manage personalities did not go unnoticed. She was promoted to Project Coordinator, a role where she thrived, translating the abstract goals of engineers and designers into concrete timelines and deliverables.\n\nNow, at 32, Renata\u2019s life is centered in her sun-drenched apartment in the Mission District, which also serves as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet start to her day, usually with a coffee from a local panaderia before logging into a world of spreadsheets and video calls. She has cultivated a close-knit \"found family\" of friends, meeting for impromptu picnics in Dolores Park or exploring the city's endless culinary scene. Having proven her resilience, Renata now dreams of leading her own projects, not just coordinating them. She aspires to save enough for a down payment on a small condo, planting permanent roots in the city that once almost broke her, but ultimately, made her."
