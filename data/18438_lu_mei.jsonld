            "value": "Mei Lu is a San Franciscan in her bones, a product of the city\u2019s hardworking, pre-tech boom grit. The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small import shop in the Richmond District, her childhood was a sensory education in texture, form, and function. She spent afternoons surrounded by porcelain tea sets, carved wooden boxes, and silk tapestries, developing an innate understanding of well-made objects. This upbringing led her directly to the California College of the Arts, where she earned a degree in Industrial Design.\n\nHer career was forged in partnership. At CCA, she met Javier, a classmate who shared her frustration with the growing trend of disposable goods. In the wake of the first dot-com bust, they saw an opportunity. In 2002, they pooled their meager savings and took out a daunting loan to found \u201cForm & Function MFG,\u201d a small manufacturing firm dedicated to creating durable, sustainable, and beautifully designed housewares. The first decade was a blur of 16-hour days in their Dogpatch workshop, a period that cemented their business but contributed to the amicable end of her marriage.\n\nNow, at 54, Mei has found a hard-won equilibrium. Her son is grown and living in Portland, and her friendship with Javier remains the steadiest relationship in her life. Her daily routine is a testament to intention. She lives in a modest but comfortable row house in the Inner Sunset. Mornings begin with a walk in Golden Gate Park before she drives her Volvo across town, a 6.5-mile commute that serves as her quiet time for podcasts on metallurgy and supply chains. As Principal Designer, she still spends more time sketching and reviewing prototypes than in boardrooms.\n\nHer San Francisco is not one of cable cars and tourist vistas, but of the city's maker-spaces and industrial arteries. She feels most at home amidst the scent of sawdust and machine oil. Looking forward, Mei dreams not of expansion, but of legacy. She hopes to transition their company to be employee-owned within the next decade, ensuring its ethos endures. Her personal aspirations are simpler: to travel to Scandinavia to study furniture design and, finally, to master the art of the perfect ceramic glaze."

Instead of sadness, she felt a profound curiosity. She saw the thickness of the glaze, the pale, dense porcelain beneath. Her father explained how it was fired, how its strength was also its weakness. It wasn\u2019t a broken thing; it was a lesson in material integrity. That moment planted the seed of wanting to understand an object from the inside out, beyond its surface beauty.\n\n2.\nThe air in the bank office felt sterile in 2002, a sharp contrast to the dot-com wreckage outside. As Mei\u2019s pen hovered over the loan papers, her hand trembled. It was a terrifying sum. She looked at Javier, his own face pale but set with determination. They exchanged a brief, silent nod. In that instant, fear gave way to resolve. This wasn't just a business loan; it was a pact they made with each other against a world of things designed to be thrown away.\n\n3.\nIt was nearly midnight in the Dogpatch workshop, around 2005. The smell of metal dust hung in the air. The fax machine, a relic even then, whirred and spat out a purchase order from an esteemed design store in Hayes Valley. It was for 50 of their brushed steel utensil holders. Javier let out a whoop, but Mei just stood there, holding the flimsy paper. It felt heavier than steel. It was the first real proof that their belief in enduring objects wasn\u2019t just their own.\n\n4.\nShe remembers sitting with her husband at their Inner Sunset kitchen table, the silence punctuated by the distant hum of the N-Judah. No anger was left, only a shared, weary sadness. \u201cYour first love is the workshop,\u201d he\u2019d said, not as an accusation, but as a statement of fact. She knew he was right. The amicable end of their marriage wasn\u2019t a failure, but a quiet, painful acknowledgment of her own nature. She was built to create things, a singular focus that had left too little room.\n\n5.\nJust last year, she walked into the workshop to find a young machinist arguing passionately with a designer over the bevel of a new product. He was citing material stress and longevity. Mei didn\u2019t intervene. She just watched, feeling a wave of deep satisfaction. The ethos wasn\u2019t just hers and Javier\u2019s anymore; it had taken root in the next generation. In that young man's earnest face, she saw not an employee, but the future, and her dream of a lasting legacy began to feel possible."
