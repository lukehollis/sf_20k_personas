The son of an architect and a high school teacher, Scott grew up with a deep appreciation for both structured design and the value of hard work. His upbringing was comfortable but not lavish, instilling in him a drive to build a life beyond the familiar Rocky Mountain horizon. He attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where a practical Business degree with a Finance concentration seemed like the most direct path to that goal.\n\nHis first job in investment banking was a brutal, but formative, trial by fire. The purely abstract nature of financial markets left him unfulfilled until the 2008 housing crisis hit. Seeing the tangible, devastating impact of finance on the physical world, he had an epiphany. Real estate was an industry built on centuries of tradition, yet it was technologically archaic and ripe for disruption. This realization became his North Star. Scott left banking, moved to San Francisco for a ground-floor role at a burgeoning real estate tech startup, and never looked back. After six years of learning the industry from the inside, his unique blend of finance and operational tech experience made him a prime candidate for the venture capital world.\n\nNow a Principal at a leading Proptech VC firm, Scott\u2019s daily routine is a calibrated mix of ambition and discipline. His mornings begin with a run along the Embarcadero before a rideshare takes him the 3.5 miles from his sleek Hayes Valley condo to his SoMa office. Work is an intense churn of pitch meetings, due diligence, and portfolio management. Socially, his circle is tight, comprised of former colleagues and industry peers who share his relentless focus. The recent, amicable end of a long-term relationship with a corporate lawyer\u2014a casualty of two demanding careers\u2014has left a quiet void, prompting him to reassess his work-life balance.\n\nScott loves San Francisco for its relentless forward momentum. He sees his work as actively shaping the future of how people live in cities like this one. Professionally, his goal is clear: make Partner. Personally, he harbors a growing hope for a connection that transcends pitch decks and term sheets, dreaming of a future where his success is measured not just by returns, but by a shared life built with purpose."

Not the spreadsheets, but the televised image of a family carrying cardboard boxes from a house that looked just like the ones in his Denver neighborhood. The abstract percentages on his screen suddenly had a physical weight. It wasn't just disgust that hit him, but a profound, gut-wrenching clarity. This\u2014the physical space of a home\u2014was real. And it was broken. In that moment, his entire career trajectory shifted from abstract returns to the tangible foundations of real estate. (Late 2008)\n\n2.\nHis first night in San Francisco, he stood by the window of his sparse, temporary apartment in the Mission. The fog was rolling in, muffling the city sounds into a low hum. A wave of profound loneliness washed over him, followed by a thrilling pulse of pure potential. He had left everything familiar behind for an idea, an industry he was just beginning to understand. Looking out at the strange city lights, he felt a powerful sense that he was finally, truly building a life of his own unique design. (Summer 2010)\n\n3.\nIt wasn't the first press release or the seed funding celebration he remembered most. It was a single user-support email he was CC'd on by chance at the startup. A young nurse, new to the city, wrote that their app had helped her find an apartment near the hospital in under a week. She called it a \"lifesaver.\" Scott read the email three times. This was the tangible impact he\u2019d craved. The feeling was more personally satisfying than any multi-million dollar deal he had ever closed in banking. (Circa 2014)\n\n4.\nOn a recent, cold morning, his breath plumed as he ran his usual route along the Embarcadero. The rising sun caught the steel of the Bay Bridge, turning it a brilliant orange as a ferry cut across the water. He felt a deep, quiet satisfaction\u2014a sense of being exactly where he was meant to be. This view, this blend of relentless human ambition and natural beauty, was what he worked for. It was the physical manifestation of the future he was investing in every single day, and it grounded him completely. (Within the last year)\n\n5.\nThe first Tuesday after his ex moved her things out, Scott came home to his perfectly ordered condo. The silence was architectural, a structured void where the sound of her day used to be. He looked at the empty space on the bookshelf, his own reflection staring back from the glass of a distant office tower. He had built this life with such precision, yet in that quiet moment, he felt a sharp, unfamiliar ache for an unscripted connection\u2014a shared purpose beyond his own singular ambition.
