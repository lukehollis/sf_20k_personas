Born in Fresno to hardworking Mexican-American parents\u2014a landscaper father and a cannery worker mother\u2014Malachi was the first in his family to attend a four-year university. They celebrated his acceptance into San Francisco State, picturing a stable, white-collar future for him. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications, a practical choice meant to open corporate doors.\n\nHis first job, writing press releases for a SoMa tech startup, was a soul-crushing experience. The work felt sterile, disconnected from the human element he craved. The turning point came during a particularly grueling week when he walked past a hotel and saw the front desk agent expertly handle a chaotic check-in. It was a moment of clarity. He quit his tech job the following Monday and took an entry-level position at a downtown hotel, the same one where he\u2019d worked part-time in college. His parents were worried he was throwing his education away, but Malachi felt he had finally come home.\n\nHis ascent was steady, fueled by an innate understanding of people and an unflappable demeanor. Front Desk Agent, Supervisor, Front Office Manager, and now, at 34, Operations Manager. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a residential suite within the hotel itself. His daily routine is the hotel\u2019s rhythm: a 6 AM walk-through of the lobby, coordinating with housekeeping, placating VIPs, and solving the endless stream of unpredictable problems that arise when hundreds of lives intersect under one roof.\n\nThis all-consuming career leaves little room for a personal life. Relationships tend to fizzle out, unable to compete with a late-night call about a plumbing emergency. His social circle consists mainly of colleagues and a few old college friends he tries to see on his rare, uninterrupted days off. On those days, he escapes Nob Hill\u2019s polished grandeur for the Mission District, finding comfort in the familiar flavors and sounds of his youth. Malachi\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate yet filtered; he sees the city from penthouse windows but truly feels it in a Mission taqueria. His dream is to one day leverage his experience to open a small, boutique hotel in Sonoma\u2014a place where the hospitality is just as meticulous, but the pace is finally his own."
