The son of a Nisei mechanic and a seamstress, Kenji grew up in the Sunset District, his childhood steeped in the quiet diligence of post-war Japanese American families. He was supposed to be the one to break the mold. With a natural talent for illustration, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, dreaming of a career in graphic design, a world away from his father\u2019s grease-stained garage.\n\nHis dream, however, was deferred by a single phone call. During his sophomore year, his father suffered a debilitating stroke, forcing Kenji to drop out and find immediate work to support his mother. A \u201ctemporary\u201d job stocking shelves at a curated home goods and gift shop in a then-gritty Hayes Valley became his lifeline. He had a knack for it\u2014an artist\u2019s eye for display and a calm demeanor that soothed difficult customers. The temporary job stretched into years, and years into a career. When the original owner retired, Kenji, by then the indispensable manager, was the only logical successor.\n\nNow 47, Kenji\u2019s life is defined by the 0.0-mile commute from his small, rent-controlled apartment above the shop. His daily routine is a ritual: coffee from the cafe on the corner where they know his order, unlocking the store\u2019s gate, the scent of scented candles and imported paper. His relationships are forged over the counter\u2014the young tech couple buying a wedding gift, the elderly woman who comes in weekly just to chat. He\u2019s a neighborhood fixture, more observer than participant.\n\nLoneliness is a quiet tenant in his life; a long-term relationship ended a decade ago, unable to compete with his devotion to the store. Yet, hope persists. Tucked under his bed is a portfolio of unfinished sketches and a newer Moleskine notebook filled with character studies of his customers. He dreams of one day selling the business, buying a small cottage in a quieter part of the Bay, and finally, just painting. Not for a gallery or for acclaim, but to finish the conversation with the 19-year-old artist he once was."
