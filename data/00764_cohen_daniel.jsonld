            "value": "Daniel Cohen\u2019s path to becoming a clinical social worker began not in a classroom, but in the quiet, tense hallways of his family's Palo Alto home. The second child of two busy attorneys, Daniel\u2019s upbringing was comfortable but emotionally sterile. His world fractured when his younger sister, Maya, developed a severe anxiety disorder in her mid-teens. He watched, helpless, as his well-meaning parents tried to solve the problem with logic and resources, failing to grasp the emotional support she desperately needed. It was a compassionate, insightful social worker who finally connected with Maya, giving Daniel a tangible example of the person he wanted to become.\n\nThis newfound purpose drove his educational journey at UC Berkeley, first through an undergraduate psychology degree and then directly into a Master of Social Work (MSW) program. He specialized in clinical practice within healthcare settings, drawn to the intersection of physical and mental well-being. Upon graduating and completing the rigorous hours for his licensure (LCSW), he accepted a position with a major San Francisco hospital system.\n\nNow 28, Daniel\u2019s life is defined by a unique paradox. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to a desk in the corner of his Inner Richmond apartment. From there, he spends eight hours a day conducting telehealth therapy sessions, diving deep into the trauma, grief, and anxiety of patients navigating complex medical diagnoses. He is a digital anchor for people in their most vulnerable moments.\n\nTo counteract the screen-bound intensity of his work, Daniel\u2019s life is intentionally analog. His evenings and weekends are for long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park, letting the cool fog wash over him. He\u2019s a regular at a small cafe on Clement Street, where the owner knows his name and order. His social circle is small but tight\u2014a handful of grad school friends and a weekly D&D group that offers structured escapism.\n\nThough fulfilled by his work, Daniel aspires to one day open a small private practice focused on adolescents and young adults, inspired by his sister, who is now thriving. He is quietly searching for a partnership that transcends the therapeutic dynamics he navigates daily. For Daniel, San Francisco isn't about the bustling tech scene or vibrant nightlife; it\u2019s about the quiet corners, the misty park trails, and the profound, healing connections he forges, one video call at a time."
