Born to industrious Chinese immigrants, his childhood was a symphony of the clang of the streetcar, the murmur of Cantonese from the kitchen, and the scent of sawdust from his parents\u2019 hardware store on the ground floor. He grew up in the two-bedroom apartment directly above the shop, a space he still calls home. For David, the commute has always been a flight of stairs.\n\nHis path was meant to lead away from the family business. In his late teens, he enrolled at San Francisco State, losing himself in the dense prose of English literature. It was an act of rebellion and self-discovery, a world away from nuts and bolts. But two years into his degree, a sudden stroke incapacitated his father, pulling David from his studies and back behind the counter. He told himself it was temporary, a duty to his stoic, overworked mother. The years, however, simply accumulated.\n\nNow 44, David is the store manager, owner, and sole full-time employee. His father passed away a decade ago, and his mother is retired, living a few neighborhoods over. The store, \u201cMiller & Son Hardware,\u201d remains a neighborhood institution. David knows his customers by name, from the elderly Mrs. Chen who needs a specific lightbulb to the new young couple fumbling through their first DIY project. His life is a routine of unlocking the gate at 8 AM, advising on plumbing tape, and locking up at 6 PM.\n\nHis personal relationships are woven into this fabric; friendships are forged over paint-matching charts and conversations with regulars. He never married, a past relationship having withered under the demands of the store. Yet, a quiet dream persists. Behind the counter, tucked beside the register, is always a worn paperback novel. He aspires to finish that English degree, not for a new career, but for the younger version of himself he left behind. His ultimate hope is to modernize the store just enough to survive, preserving his parents\u2019 legacy while finally carving out a small piece of his life that is entirely his own."

He remembers the heaviness of the gallon can and the chemical smell that mingled with the familiar scent of sawdust. His father\u2019s calloused hand guided his as they clamped it into the shaker. The violent, rattling roar was terrifying and thrilling. When it stopped, his father smiled, a rare and full expression of pride. It was the first time David felt the store wasn't just his parents' world, but a kingdom he might one day inherit.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, he sat on the great lawn at SF State, the spine of *Ulysses* cracking in his hands. The dense prose felt like freedom, a secret language far from price guns and inventory sheets. A cool breeze blew in from the ocean, and for the first time, his life felt limitless, a shelf of unread books waiting to be opened. This memory became a painful, cherished monument to the man he was supposed to become, a ghost he still tries to honor with the paperbacks he keeps behind the counter.\n\n3.\nThe call came while he was in the university library, surrounded by a sacred hush. He saw his mother\u2019s number and felt a strange chill. Her voice, usually a sturdy bastion, was thin and sharp with panic. \u201cIt\u2019s your father,\u201d she\u2019d said. In that instant, the quiet world of words and theory dissolved, replaced by the clang of a closing gate. He walked out of the library knowing his two-year rebellion was over. Duty had found him, and his future was once again a flight of stairs away.\n\n4.\nHe remembers Sarah, leaning against the rows of paint swatches, her face illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights long after closing. He was on the phone, patiently talking a panicked customer through a leaking pipe. When he finally hung up, she just shook her head. \u201cThe store always wins, David.\u201d There was no anger in her voice, only a deep, weary sadness. It wasn\u2019t a breakup; it was an acknowledgment. The store was the third person in their relationship, and it demanded everything. He let her walk out, the bell above the door chiming goodbye.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young couple, new to the neighborhood, stood lost in the plumbing aisle. He saw the same hopeful, terrified look his own parents must have had. He spent twenty minutes explaining a P-trap, sketching it on a paper bag. Their relief was palpable. Watching them leave, he felt a sudden, profound connection to his father\u2019s legacy\u2014a quiet chain of expertise and kindness. It was then he realized preserving the store didn't have to mean sacrificing himself. He just needed to build a new shelf to fit them both."
