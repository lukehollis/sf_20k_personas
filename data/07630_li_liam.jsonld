The only child of pragmatic Chinese immigrants\u2014an engineer father and an accountant mother\u2014his upbringing was one of high expectations and a clear, stable path. Success was defined by financial security, and Liam was groomed for a career in finance or tech. He followed the script dutifully, earning an Economics degree from UC Berkeley, his future seemingly set.\n\nHis turning point came during a summer internship at a prestigious firm in the Financial District. Each day, Liam would step out of the Montgomery Street BART station, walk past people experiencing profound poverty and mental health crises, and enter a gleaming skyscraper where millions were moved with a keystroke. The dissonance was jarring and planted a seed of deep dissatisfaction. He realized he didn't want to manage capital; he wanted to mend the social fabric it so often bypassed.\n\nRejecting a lucrative career path, much to his parents' initial dismay, Liam enrolled in a graduate program, earning a Master's in Public Policy. He believed he could change the system from within. However, after a few years writing policy briefs for a city agency, he felt detached and ineffective. The real change, he discovered, was happening on the ground. He transitioned to direct service, becoming a social worker for a non-profit in SOMA.\n\nNow 42, Liam\u2019s life is woven into his work. To solve his 0.0-mile commute, he lives on-site as a case manager in the supportive housing complex he helps run. His apartment is modest, its windows overlooking the courtyard where residents gather. His daily routine is a fluid mix of crisis intervention, resource navigation, and simply sharing a cup of coffee with a resident who needs to talk. His past relationship ended years ago, strained by the emotional weight of his profession, and he now finds his strongest connections with his colleagues and the resilient individuals he serves.\n\nLiam\u2019s dreams are not of wealth or prestige, but of small, tangible victories: seeing a resident secure a steady job, helping another reconnect with estranged family. He hopes to one day see the city adopt more humane, systemic solutions to homelessness. He is a quiet anchor in the chaotic heart of San Francisco, his life a testament to the path he chose\u2014not one of financial capital, but of human connection."
