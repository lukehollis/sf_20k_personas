He was raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a pragmatic engineer and a high school literature teacher. From his father, he inherited a methodical mind; from his mother, a deep appreciation for the arts. This duality defined him. While his peers pursued business or law, David found his calling at the intersection of creativity and logistics. He earned a Master's degree in Urban Planning, focusing his thesis on the integration of public art in community revitalization.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by its romantic bohemian reputation and progressive spirit. He started at a small arts non-profit, learning the granular details of grant writing and city permitting. Over two decades, he built a reputation as the man who could get things done. His turning point came when he managed a complex, controversial mural project in the Mission District, navigating fierce community debate and the artist's volatile temperament. The project\u2019s success cemented his career but left him with a quiet understanding of the city's deep cultural fractures.\n\nNow 49, David lives alone in a meticulously organized Hayes Valley condo that doubles as his office. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a calm morning routine: pour-over coffee, the New York Times, and a walk to his favorite bakery before the first Zoom call. His days are a digital flurry of budgets, timelines, and stakeholder meetings, coordinating large-scale installations across the Bay Area.\n\nHis marriage to a tech executive ended amicably five years ago, a casualty of divergent life paths. His social life now is smaller, more intentional\u2014dinners with a close-knit circle of curators and artists, monthly gallery walks, and quiet evenings with a good book. He is a fixture in his neighborhood, but more as a respectful observer than a central player. David\u2019s deepest aspiration isn\u2019t promotion, but legacy. He dreams of overseeing one final, iconic piece of public art for San Francisco\u2014a landmark that will anchor a part of the city and outlast the endless cycles of boom and bust, a permanent mark of beauty he helped make possible."
