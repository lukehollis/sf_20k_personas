She was born in Fresno, the daughter of immigrants from Oaxaca, Mexico, who spent their lives tending to the fertile but demanding soil of the Central Valley. Growing up, Sofia saw firsthand the delicate balance between agriculture and the environment. Her parents\u2019 reverence for the land, born from generations of subsistence farming, was a stark contrast to the large-scale industrial agriculture surrounding them. This duality planted the seed for her future.\n\nHer academic journey was her escape route and her calling. Excelling in school, she pursued an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science at UC Davis, followed by a Master's in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. Her turning point came during an internship where she analyzed the water usage of a major food conglomerate. She realized she could effect more change by advising corporations from the outside than by working within a single system. This led her to a career in sustainability consulting, where she helps companies develop and implement greener strategies.\n\nNow 29, Sofia lives a deliberately curated life in a cozy Inner Sunset apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday is a disciplined series of video calls and data analysis, fueled by coffee from the local cafe on 9th Avenue. Her home is her sanctuary and office, filled with thriving plants that remind her of her roots. Evenings and weekends are for unplugging. She finds solace in long trail runs through Golden Gate Park or drives across the bridge to hike in the Marin Headlands with a tight-knit circle of friends from her master\u2019s program.\n\nSofia feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s ethos of innovation and environmental consciousness. It\u2019s a city that speaks her language. Her ultimate dream is to leverage her corporate expertise to launch her own B-Corp, one that creates a direct, tech-enabled pipeline between small, sustainable farms like the ones she grew up around and urban consumers. For Sofia, success isn't just about profit margins; it's about building a future where the values her parents taught her can scale, creating a more sustainable world, one balanced ecosystem at a time."
