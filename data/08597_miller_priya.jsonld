The daughter of an Indian immigrant mother, a pragmatic nurse, and a Caucasian-American father, a literature professor at SF State, Priya grew up in a Sunset District home filled with the scent of both curry and old books. She inherited her mother\u2019s practicality and her father\u2019s analytical mind, but rejected their bohemian disregard for financial security. From a young age, watching the first tech boom reshape the city, she equated wealth with freedom and influence.\n\nAfter graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in economics, Priya took a junior analyst position just as the dot-com bubble was about to burst. Surviving the ensuing carnage was her crucible. She saw brilliant people lose everything and learned that talent alone wasn't enough; one needed a network and impenetrable credentials. This realization propelled her to the East Coast for an MBA at Wharton. She returned to San Francisco with a formidable new toolkit and began her relentless ascent in investment banking, a field with few women, let alone women of color, in its upper echelons. A brief, amicable marriage in her late 30s ended under the weight of 100-hour work weeks, a sacrifice she accepted as necessary for her goals.\n\nNow, at 53, Priya is a Managing Director. Her life is contained within the sleek, glass walls of her Rincon Hill high-rise, which serves as both her home and, since the pandemic, her office\u2014hence the zero-mile commute. Her days are monastic in their routine: up at 5 a.m. for market analysis, a punishing Peloton workout, and then a cascade of video calls managing deals across continents. Her social life is curated and efficient, consisting of board meetings for the SF Symphony, discreet dinners with a tight circle of fellow executives, and mentoring a select few young women in finance.\n\nFrom her floor-to-ceiling windows, Priya watches the ships glide across the bay. She helped finance the construction of some of the very buildings that now define the skyline. Having achieved financial success beyond her parents\u2019 wildest imaginings, her aspirations have shifted. She\u2019s no longer climbing, but looking for a new vantage point. Her dream is to leverage her capital and influence to launch a venture fund focused on sustainable technology and female founders, transforming her legacy from one of pure profit to one of purpose. San Francisco is no longer just a city to conquer, but a community she finally feels ready to build."
