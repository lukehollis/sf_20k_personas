The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a small grocery in the Outer Sunset, James grew up surrounded by the fog-laced pragmatism of working-class San Francisco. His parents, hoping for an engineer or a doctor, were baffled when he chose to study History at San Francisco State University. He was fascinated not by dates and battles, but by the evolution of systems\u2014how cities, philosophies, and societies were built and maintained over time.\n\nHis degree didn't lead to a clear career path. After graduating, James took a temp job as an office assistant at a burgeoning SoMa startup to pay off his loans. He was quiet but observant, and soon became the unofficial go-to person for everything from a flickering light to a malfunctioning coffee machine. When the company rapidly expanded into a new, multi-floor campus, the overwhelmed COO realized they needed a proper Facilities Manager. James, who already knew every inch of the building's infrastructure, was the obvious, if unconventional, choice.\n\nNow, at 32, James\u2019s life is his work, quite literally. His 0.0-mile commute is the walk from his subsidized apartment on the top floor of the tech campus down to the building\u2019s gleaming nerve center. He is the first one awake, checking HVAC and security systems before the coders arrive, and the last one on-call, handling late-night plumbing emergencies. His world is a controlled ecosystem of glass, steel, and kombucha on tap, a stark contrast to the aging, stucco homes of his childhood.\n\nThis insular life makes personal connections difficult; it\u2019s hard to explain to a date that you can\u2019t fully relax because you can hear the hum of the servers through the floor. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of college friends who meet for dim sum in the Richmond, a brief escape back to his roots. James\u2019s secret dream is to one day leverage his practical skills for himself: to buy and meticulously restore a decaying Victorian in the Haight, trading the sterile perfection of his current life for the authentic, flawed history he\u2019s always loved."
