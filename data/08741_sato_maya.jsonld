A third-generation Japanese-American, she was raised in the Inner Richmond on stories of her grandparents\u2019 resilience after their internment and her parents\u2019 quiet, determined pursuit of stability. Her father, a civil engineer, taught her about systems, while her mother, a public school teacher, instilled in her a deep sense of social responsibility. Growing up, Golden Gate Park was her backyard, the place where a childhood fascination with coastal ecosystems first took hold.\n\nHer educational journey was a direct line from this passion. After an undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, she sought a more pragmatic toolkit to enact change, earning a Master of Science in Environmental Management from Stanford. Maya began her career at a Bay Area environmental non-profit, full of idealism. However, a key turning point came after years of fighting for incremental gains. She realized that the biggest polluters\u2014large corporations\u2014also had the power to make the most significant positive impact. Disillusioned with grassroots inertia, she pivoted to consulting, believing she could change the system more effectively from within.\n\nNow at 37, Maya\u2019s life is a study in contained efficiency. Her commute is a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her standing desk in her sunny Cole Valley apartment. Her days are a series of global video calls, data analysis, and crafting sustainability strategies for tech giants and retail brands. It\u2019s challenging work that often feels like a compromise, a constant balancing act between corporate profit motives and genuine ecological progress. Her social life is intentional; a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and a weekly yoga class provide a necessary anchor after her recent, amicable split from a long-term partner.\n\nMaya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. She knows the baristas at her corner cafe by name and times her morning runs to avoid the thickest fog rolling over Sutro Tower. While she finds fulfillment in her work, she dreams of starting her own boutique consultancy, one that refuses to compromise and focuses solely on regenerative, circular economies. She aspires to a future where her impact is undeniable, as tangible and enduring as the cypress trees she has loved since childhood."
