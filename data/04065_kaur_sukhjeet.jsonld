Her commute is zero miles; her world, and the world of her patients, is filtered through the secure video connection on her laptop. Born in a small village in Punjab, India, Sukhjeet arrived in Yuba City, California, at age six. Her childhood was a blend of two worlds: the scent of ripe peaches from the surrounding orchards and the sacred hymns from the local Gurdwara; the pressure to excel in American schools and the duty to uphold family honor.\n\nHer parents, hardworking and deeply faithful, envisioned a life for her in medicine or engineering. But Sukhjeet was drawn to the unspoken stories, the quiet suffering she witnessed in her community, where mental health was a taboo subject. After completing her undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, a pivotal moment defined her career. Her father suffered a major heart attack, and navigating the alien, impersonal hospital system was terrifying for her family. It was a compassionate hospital social worker\u2014a woman who spoke to them with patience and helped them find resources\u2014who became their lifeline. In that moment of crisis, Sukhjeet found her calling. She enrolled at San Francisco State, earning her Master of Social Work.\n\nShe spent two decades working within the frantic walls of UCSF Health, counseling patients and families through devastating diagnoses and life-altering trauma. A marriage, a divorce, and raising a son, now a software engineer in Austin, filled those years. When the pandemic normalized telehealth, Sukhjeet, then 51, saw an opportunity. She transitioned to a fully remote practice, leaving the institutional grind for the calm of her own home.\n\nHer days now follow a gentle rhythm. A morning walk through Golden Gate Park, a strong cup of chai, and then hours of sessions, holding space for the anxiety and grief of others. In the evenings, she finds solace in cooking the complex Punjabi dishes of her youth, the sizzle of spices a connection to her roots. Though her life is quiet, her dreams are not. She hopes to start a pro-bono support group for South Asian elders navigating the healthcare system, honoring the woman who inspired her all those years ago. And she dreams of taking her son to India, not as a tourist, but to walk the dusty lanes of the village she left behind, finally bridging the two halves of her world."

Her father sat beside her, eyes closed, humming with the kirtan. All the pressure of her American school day dissolved. In that warmth, she felt a profound, uncomplicated peace\u2014a sense of belonging she now strives to offer her own patients. It was the first time she understood that quiet and community could be a sanctuary, a lesson that became the foundation of her character. (Age 8)\n\n2.\nThe hospital corridor felt cold, the air thick with antiseptic and a language of acronyms she couldn't parse. Her father was behind a closed door, and her mother\u2019s prayers were frantic whispers. Sukhjeet felt completely powerless. Then, the social worker arrived\u2014not with charts, but with a cup of tea and simple, kind words. In that moment of profound relief, seeing her mother\u2019s fear finally ease, Sukhjeet\u2019s own future was forged. She wouldn't just fight disease; she would fight despair. (Age 22)\n\n3.\nShe recalls a young mother at UCSF, reeling from her child's diagnosis, who could only speak of her daughter's favorite color: yellow. For an hour, Sukhjeet didn't talk about treatment plans or support services. They just talked about yellow. Sunflowers, raincoats, a beloved rubber duck. It was a tiny island of normalcy in a sea of trauma. That day taught her that the most vital work wasn't fixing, but simply sitting with someone in their wreckage, holding a single, brightly colored piece of their world. (Age 38)\n\n4.\nHer son, then a lanky teenager more interested in code than culture, came into the kitchen as she was tempering spices for daal. He didn\u2019t complain about the pungent smell as he once did. Instead, he watched her hands, then asked, \"Can you show me how? The sizzling part.\" A wave of warmth washed over her, deeper than any spice. In that small question, she felt the tenuous thread connecting her Punjabi past to his American future pull lovingly taut, a private victory against assimilation. (Age 45)\n\n5.\nAfter twenty years of beeping machines and echoing announcements, the silence of her first remote workday was profound. She sat at her desk, a mug of homemade chai steaming beside her, watching the fog drift past her Inner Sunset window. No frantic sprints down hallways, no borrowed, sterile offices. When her first patient appeared on screen, she felt a sense of rightness. She was finally counseling from a place of peace, holding space for others from a space she had finally built for herself.
