Adopted as an infant by a kind, hardworking Chinese-American couple in the Sunset District, Robert grew up a white kid in a deeply Asian-American household. His childhood was a loving fusion of cultures: English and Cantonese spoken at the dinner table, Thanksgiving turkey followed by Lunar New Year traditions, and a profound respect for family and education instilled by his parents, who ran a small neighborhood grocery.\n\nWhile he embraced his family\u2019s heritage, Robert found his own calling not in their community but in the predictable world of systems and logic. He pursued Industrial Engineering at Cal Poly, drawn to the challenge of making complex processes efficient and elegant. His career began on the factory floors of the East Bay, learning the grit and mechanics of manufacturing from the ground up. He wasn't a manager in an office tower; he was a problem-solver who knew the names of the machinists and the hum of a well-oiled production line.\n\nA key turning point came with the passing of his adoptive father. Going through his father\u2019s meticulously kept business ledgers, Robert saw the same principles of order and integrity he applied to engineering. It solidified his professional purpose: to create well-made things and foster a workplace built on mutual respect. He eventually moved to his current role as Director of Operations for a high-end sustainable furniture manufacturer in the Dogpatch.\n\nNow 54 and amicably divorced, Robert lives a life of disciplined routine in his Potrero Hill condo. His day starts at dawn with coffee overlooking the bay, followed by his 3.8-mile bike commute\u2014a daily ritual that clears his mind and connects him to the city's physical form. He is a man of quiet connections, maintaining a small circle of old friends and mentoring younger engineers at his company.\n\nRobert is a true San Franciscan, a witness to its seismic shifts. He misses the old, scrappier city but finds his peace in its enduring geography. His aspirations are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder but about legacy: he dreams of seeing his company thrive as a beacon of local manufacturing and hopes to one day take a long, rambling bicycle tour across the country, a final, elegant system of his own design."

His mother gently squeezed his hand and stood, her grip a warm, powerful anchor. \"That's us,\" she said, her voice full of a simple, unshakeable pride. In that moment, he felt the confusing space between his name and his face, but he felt the fierce certainty of his mother's love even more. It taught him that family was a bond, not a reflection.\n\n2.\nHe was 25, fresh from Cal Poly, on a dirty factory floor in Oakland. A critical press seized up, and the veteran machinist, Sal, eyed him with deep skepticism. Instead of issuing orders from a clipboard, Robert grabbed a wrench, knelt in the grease, and simply asked Sal to describe the machine\u2019s rhythm. An hour later, it was humming again. The quiet, grudging nod of respect Sal gave him felt more valuable than his diploma. It cemented his core belief: respect is earned with dirty hands and open ears.\n\n3.\nAt 38, a week after his father\u2019s funeral, he sat at the old kitchen table with the grocery store\u2019s ledgers. The columns were perfect, the descriptions written in his father\u2019s careful hand. He saw more than debits and credits; he saw a system of honor and promises kept. In that meticulous handwriting, he finally recognized his own engineering mind. His life\u2019s work wasn\u2019t a departure from his father's world, he realized, but a direct inheritance of its most important principle: integrity.\n\n4.\nAround his 50th birthday, cresting the top of Potrero Hill on his daily bike commute, he paused. The dawn light hit the shipyard cranes and illuminated the roof of his own factory in the Dogpatch below. A profound, quiet sense of peace washed over him. He wasn't just looking at a view; he was looking at his life's work, his people. The daily ride wasn't just exercise; it was his ritual for tracing his place on the city\u2019s permanent, physical map, grounding him against its constant change.\n\n5.\nHe remembers the day his divorce was finalized. He\u2019d felt adrift, his personal life a failed system. That weekend, instead of staying in, he drove to the Marin Headlands and watched the container ships glide with immense, elegant logic under the Golden Gate Bridge. He saw them as self-contained worlds on a long, purposeful journey. The idea for a cross-country bike tour formed then\u2014not as an escape, but as a challenge to design one last, perfect system for himself, a quiet journey of his own making."
