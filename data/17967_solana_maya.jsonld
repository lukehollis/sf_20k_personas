Her dad, an early immigrant engineer, filled their home with logic and schematics, while her mom, a ceramicist, filled it with clay and color. Maya grew up navigating these two worlds, learning to appreciate both the elegant structure of a system and the unpredictable beauty of human expression.\n\nThis duality guided her to UC Santa Cruz, where she studied cognitive science, fascinated by the intersection of human psychology and technology. A pivotal internship revealed the power of user experience (UX) research\u2014a field where she could use empathy as a tool for logical design. This realization led her to UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious School of Information, where she earned her master's degree, solidifying her path. Her early career was a rapid ascent through promising startups, but she grew disillusioned by the \"move fast and break things\" ethos that often ignored the human cost. A turning point came when she resigned from a high-paying job after her research, which highlighted significant ethical concerns, was deliberately buried.\n\nNow, at 37, Maya is a Lead UX Researcher at a more established tech firm with a strong ethical charter. She lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in NOPA, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its vibrant mix of old SF charm and new energy. Her daily routine is rhythmic: a morning run through the Panhandle, then the N-Judah train to her downtown office, where she spends her days translating user needs into tangible product improvements.\n\nAs a Bay Area native, Maya feels a deep, often complicated, love for San Francisco. She cherishes its diversity and progressive spirit but laments the affordability crisis that pushes out so many. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of fellow natives and transplants\u2014and a weekly pottery class, a nod to her mother. Her greatest aspiration is to lead a research division focused on technology for social good, mentoring a new generation of diverse, empathetic researchers. She dreams of one day finding a way to own a small piece of the city that, for all its flaws, remains unequivocally home."

Her mom gave her a block of gray clay, its shapelessness promising possibility. Maya held one in each hand, feeling the stark contrast. It wasn\u2019t a conflict, but a question. She realized then that her life\u2019s work would be to build the bridge between the two\u2014to find the humanity in the system and the structure in the art. This was her first true design problem.\n\n2.\nDuring her pivotal UCSC internship, she interviewed an elderly man named Arthur about a new banking app. He struggled, his shoulders slumping in defeat as he whispered, \u201cI just feel stupid.\u201d In that moment, the project stopped being about user flows and became about preserving Arthur\u2019s dignity. She saw how a poorly designed interface could be a quiet cruelty. It was the first time she understood empathy not as a feeling, but as a critical, actionable tool for building a more humane world.\n\n3.\nShe can still feel the glass-walled conference room growing cold. The VP had waved away her research on the product's harmful impact, calling it an \"edge case.\" Standing up, she saw her six-figure salary and career path laid out before her, a road paved with willful ignorance. She simply said, \u201cThen I can\u2019t work here,\u201d and walked out. The elevator's descent felt like both a terrifying fall and the first moment of true flight. That day, at 29, she chose her conscience over her career.\n\n4.\nLast winter, on a run through the Panhandle, the eucalyptus-scented fog was perfect. She passed a group of students, an elderly woman practicing Tai Chi, and a young family laughing. A feeling of profound belonging washed over her\u2014this was *her* city. Then she saw an eviction notice taped to the door of a classic Victorian. The moment crystallized her love for San Francisco: a fierce, protective ache for a home that was simultaneously the most beautiful and the most heartbreaking place she knew.\n\n5.\nAt her weekly pottery class last month, after a draining week of battling for ethical design, her mind was a mess. But as she slapped the clay onto the wheel, the familiar, earthy smell filled her senses. The act of centering the spinning lump, feeling it wobble and then find its still point under her steady hands, was a physical prayer. It wasn't just clay; it was her mother\u2019s legacy and her own quiet ritual of transforming chaos into something balanced and whole."
