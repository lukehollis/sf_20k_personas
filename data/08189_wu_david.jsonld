The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small but beloved neighborhood grocery store, David grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of diligence and high expectations. His parents championed a traditional path to success: a business degree from SF State, followed by a stable, lucrative career. David dutifully complied, earning his Bachelor's in Business Administration and landing a promising junior analyst role at a downtown financial firm.\n\nThe turning point was his grandmother\u2019s long illness. David, fluent in both English and Mandarin, became her primary advocate, navigating a labyrinth of appointments, insurance paperwork, and culturally unaware medical staff. He witnessed firsthand the gaps in a system that failed to properly serve non-English speaking seniors. He saw the relief on his grandmother's face when a volunteer from a community health clinic simply sat and talked with her in her native tongue. The experience was a profound awakening.\n\nHaunted by the disparity he had witnessed, and feeling utterly disconnected from his work crunching numbers, David quit his corporate job at 27. It was a move that baffled his parents. He took a significant pay cut to start as an administrative assistant at the very non-profit that had helped his grandmother.\n\nNow, at 30, David is a Program Coordinator. He designs and manages outreach initiatives providing bilingual health navigation for elderly Asian residents. His business degree, once a symbol of a life he rejected, is now used to secure grants and optimize program logistics. His life is hyper-local; he lives in a small apartment in SoMa, a short walk from his organization's office, hence his zero-mile commute. His days are a blur of phone calls, community center visits, and volunteer scheduling. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends and his partner, a public school teacher who shares his commitment to community service.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is no longer a corner office but a city where no one\u2019s grandmother has to feel lost or alone in a hospital. He aspires to move into a policy-making role, using his frontline experience to advocate for systemic change. For David, San Francisco is not just a backdrop; it is the community he is dedicated to healing, one person at a time."
