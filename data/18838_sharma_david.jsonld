Born in Concord to a single, white mother, he took the surname of the kind, Indian software engineer who married his mother when David was six. Growing up as a white kid named Sharma in the 1970s East Bay lent him a permanent sense of being a gentle observer, never quite fitting any mold. This outsider perspective fueled a passion for visual arts, a world where he could create his own rules.\n\nHe escaped to San Francisco in the late 1980s, enrolling in the San Francisco Art Institute. The city was a revelation of freedom and acceptance, but also a crucible of loss. The AIDS crisis devastated his found-family, and the pressure to create gallery-worthy art felt increasingly hollow. After two years, he dropped out, trading his canvases for a series of jobs\u2014bookstore clerk, caterer, bike messenger\u2014that kept him in the city he now considered home.\n\nThe turning point came in his early thirties when he volunteered at a community center, using art projects to connect with at-risk youth. He discovered his true calling wasn't in *making* art, but in using art to *heal*. He pursued certifications and training, becoming an Expressive Arts Facilitator. For two decades, he has worked with diverse groups\u2014seniors with dementia, children in the foster care system, and adults in recovery\u2014helping them process trauma and find their voice through paint, clay, and collage.\n\nToday, David lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Duboce Triangle with his partner of 15 years, Ken. His life is a gentle, well-worn rhythm. Mornings begin with a 3.5-mile bike ride to the non-profit where he works. His days are spent in emotionally demanding but profoundly rewarding sessions. Evenings are for quiet dinners, tending to their small balcony garden, or catching up with a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom are fellow survivors of a different San Francisco. His dream is no longer of gallery openings, but of securing stable, long-term funding for his arts program, ensuring that the healing power he discovered can continue to serve the city that saved him."

In that silence, he didn't feel anger, but a peculiar sense of separation, like watching a scene about someone else. It was the first time he consciously understood he was a story other people were trying to figure out, a realization that taught him to watch quietly from the edges. This happened around 1975.\n\n2.\nThe memory is hazy, filtered through grief: holding a paintbrush for his friend Javier, whose own hands shook too much. They were trying to paint a small, vibrant bird on Javier's hospice room wall in the early 90s. The futility was crushing; no amount of color could stop the inevitable. The experience hollowed out his ambition for gallery art, planting a seed that art wasn't for showing, but for *doing*\u2014for holding on, for bearing witness, for making a final, beautiful mark against the dark.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a bike messenger run in the mid-90s, bombing down the Wiggle in the pouring rain, a package sealed in plastic against his back. He wasn\u2019t an artist or a student, just a kinetic part of the city\u2019s circulatory system. There was an exhilarating freedom in that anonymity, a feeling of belonging not to a scene, but to the very streets that held him. It confirmed that his love was for San Francisco itself, a home he was willing to work any job to keep.\n\n4.\nThe turning point came in his early thirties. He remembers a quiet girl in foster care, who for weeks refused to speak. He gave her a lump of red clay. Silently, she worked it, finally holding up a small, misshapen bird with a broken wing. She whispered, \"It can't fly.\" His world tilted. He saw with absolute clarity that art\u2019s true power wasn\u2019t in creating beauty, but in creating a safe space for an unbearable truth to finally be spoken aloud.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, he remembers standing on the balcony with Ken at dusk, the fog rolling in to muffle the city. Ken was patiently coaxing a tomato vine up a trellis. There was no grand drama, just the smell of damp earth and the quiet presence of the man he loved. He felt a profound gratitude, not for a life of artistic fame, but for this gentle rhythm. It was the quiet, sturdy survival he and his friends had fought so hard for."
