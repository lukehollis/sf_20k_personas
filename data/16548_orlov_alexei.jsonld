When the union fractured, so did his future. With a basic high school education and few prospects, he followed a distant aunt\u2019s sponsorship to San Francisco in the mid-90s, arriving with a thin wallet and an even thinner grasp of English.\n\nThe city\u2019s chaotic freedom was both intoxicating and terrifying. Alexei found work in construction and restaurant kitchens, his strong back his only real asset. The cultural chasm and profound loneliness, however, took their toll. He found a false friend in vodka, a ghost from his homeland that slowly consumed his new life. For over a decade, he drifted through a haze of lost jobs, strained relationships, and the constant threat of homelessness, a man invisible in a bustling city.\n\nThe turning point came not as a single event, but as a slow, painful crawl from rock bottom. A health crisis landed him in a public clinic in the Tenderloin, where a compassionate social worker saw past the broken man to the survivor within. It was there he was introduced to recovery programs. The process was grueling, but in the shared stories of others, Alexei finally felt understood. He realized his deepest shame\u2014his experience with addiction\u2014was also his greatest strength.\n\nHe earned his certification as a Peer Recovery Coach, dedicating his life to the work that saved him. Now, at 53, Alexei\u2019s days are structured and purposeful. He lives in a small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that reminds him of the old world with its fog and tight-knit community feel. Each morning, he takes the 38-Geary bus 6.5 miles downtown to the nonprofit where he works. There, he offers guidance, empathy, and the hard-won wisdom of his own journey to people struggling with the same demons he once faced. His income is modest, but his life is rich with meaning. His dream is no longer about personal gain, but about witnessing one more person find their footing. San Francisco, the city that nearly broke him, has become the city he helps heal, one person at a time."

Back in Leningrad, the world was gray but known. Here, the sheer scale of the freedom was suffocating. He felt a profound smallness, a ghost arriving in a future he hadn't chosen. That moment planted the seed of a loneliness that would haunt him for years, a void he would later try to fill with vodka.\n\n2.\nHe recalls sitting on a wet bench near Civic Center in 2006, the lukewarm vodka in his paper bag failing to warm him. He\u2019d just been fired from another kitchen. Watching people stride past, their lives sealed and purposeful, he felt utterly invisible. He wasn\u2019t a man, just a phantom, a stain on the concrete. The memory isn\u2019t of anger, but of a hollowed-out shame\u2014the absolute zero of his self-worth, the moment the bottle\u2019s comfort finally became a lie.\n\n3.\nThe turning point wasn\u2019t a lightning bolt, but a quiet question in a Tenderloin clinic in 2008. His hands were shaking uncontrollably. A social worker, a woman with tired eyes, ignored the chart and asked, \u201cAlexei, what was your dream when you first came here?\u201d The question shattered his defenses. No one had acknowledged his past in a decade. To be seen not as an addict, but as a man with a history, was the first unsteady step out of the abyss.\n\n4.\nHe can still smell the stale coffee in the church basement at his first recovery meeting. He expected judgment but found reflection. A man spoke of his shame, his loneliness, his lost jobs. It was Alexei\u2019s own story, his own secret agony, spoken aloud by a stranger. The crushing weight of his unique failure lifted. In that moment of shared humanity, he understood he wasn't uniquely broken; he was just a man. And for the first time in America, he wasn't alone.\n\n5.\nA memory from two years ago: a 2 AM phone call. A young man he was coaching, his voice tight with panic, about to relapse. Alexei didn\u2019t preach; he just listened, speaking quietly of cold park benches and the feeling of invisibility. After an hour, the kid promised to wait for morning. Hanging up, Alexei looked out at the foggy Richmond streets and felt a profound, quiet rightness. His deepest pain had finally become a lighthouse for someone else lost in the storm."
