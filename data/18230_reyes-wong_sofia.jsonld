Raised in the Outer Richmond, she is the daughter of a Filipina immigrant nurse and a second-generation Chinese-American whose family ran a beloved neighborhood grocery store for forty years. Sofia grew up in a world of overlapping cultures, bilingual family gatherings, and the constant hum of her parents\u2019 hard work. She learned early on that in San Francisco, survival depended on community and relentless hustle.\n\nWhile her friends charted paths to universities, Sofia felt a different calling. The abstract world of academia felt disconnected from the tangible crisis she saw around her: families like hers being priced out of the city they built. The turning point came when the owner of their family's longtime apartment building sold it to a developer, forcing them into a stressful and expensive move. That eviction notice was a formative lesson in the city\u2019s brutal economics. Forgoing a traditional degree, Sofia enrolled in a real estate licensing course at 21, determined to understand the system from the inside.\n\nNow 25, Sofia works for a mid-sized firm downtown. Her daily 3.2-mile MUNI commute from her shared Inner Sunset apartment is a rolling diorama of the city she serves\u2014from legacy families to new tech arrivals. She navigates a world of contradictions, earning a respectable $75,000 while showing multi-million-dollar properties she could never afford. Her social life is tethered to her roots; she spends weekends with childhood friends and her steady boyfriend, a local plumber who shares her complex love for their hometown.\n\nSofia\u2019s ambition isn't just about closing deals. Her primary dream is to buy a permanent home for her parents, offering them the security they never had. Deep down, she hopes to one day run her own brokerage focused on helping working-class families secure a foothold in the city. She loves San Francisco with the fierce, protective loyalty of a native, even as she participates in the very industry that transforms it, one \"For Sale\" sign at a time."

Gung Gung would slip her a White Rabbit candy, the rice paper melting on her tongue while the store hummed with the comforting scent of cardboard and dried ginger. It was the neighborhood's living room, a place of casual care and absolute belonging. That memory is the blueprint for her definition of 'home,' a place where you are not just a tenant, but a known and valued part of the community.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, she found her mother, a nurse who faced emergencies without flinching, crying silently over the eviction notice taped to their apartment door. The sight of her mother\u2019s strength cracking under the weight of that impersonal, legal paper felt like a physical blow. In that moment, the city\u2019s housing crisis stopped being a headline and became a personal, burning injustice. The anger that ignited in her then wasn\u2019t abstract; it was a promise to understand and fight the system that made her mother feel so powerless.\n\n3.\nHer first big sale, at twenty-two, wasn't to an investor but to a family of teachers buying a small condo in the Excelsior. When she handed them the keys, the wife hugged her, tears in her eyes, and whispered, \"We never thought this was possible for us.\" Sofia saw her own parents\u2019 deferred dream in their faces. The commission check felt secondary. That moment was a profound act of restorative justice, a small but tangible victory against the forces that had displaced her own family.\n\n4.\nLast year, she stood alone in a sterile, $4 million Pacific Heights penthouse she was showing. The sweeping, panoramic view of the Golden Gate Bridge felt fraudulent from this height, a postcard sold to the highest bidder. The foreign buyer, who she\u2019d only met on Zoom, saw it as an asset. For Sofia, acutely aware of her worn-out shoes on the imported marble, it was a moment of profound alienation. The silence in that vast, empty space was a stark reminder of who the city is being built for.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, she and her boyfriend sat on the bleachers at a local park, sharing garlic fries after his plumbing league softball game. He was complaining about a difficult pipe installation in a Bernal Heights cottage, and she was mapping out her dream of a brokerage in her head. Looking at the fog roll in over the familiar houses, she felt a surge of defiant love. This\u2014the grit, the fog, the shared struggle\u2014was her San Francisco. It anchored her, reminding her that her fight wasn't just for her parents, but for a future here, with him."
