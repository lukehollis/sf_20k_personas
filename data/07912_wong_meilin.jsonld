            "value": "Meilin Wong is a child of the San Francisco fog, born and raised in the quiet, gridded streets of the Sunset District. The daughter of first-generation immigrants who ran a small, bustling bakery, her childhood was filled with the scent of pineapple buns and the expectation of practicality. Her parents, who had sacrificed everything for stability, hoped she would pursue a career in medicine or law. Meilin, introverted and observant, spent her youth sketching the city\u2019s unique Victorian rooflines in the margins of her notebooks, a quiet rebellion they didn't quite understand.\n\nHer educational journey began at UC Davis, where she dutifully enrolled as a Communications major to appease her family. However, a summer internship at a small San Francisco architectural firm was a profound turning point. She saw how thoughtfully designed spaces could shape community and evoke emotion. Against her parents\u2019 gentle protests, she transferred to the California College of the Arts, immersing herself in the demanding world of architectural design. It was there she found her voice, blending the rigid principles of structure with a fluid, artistic sensibility.\n\nNow 24, Meilin works as a Junior Architectural Designer for a boutique firm specializing in public art installations and cultural spaces. Her 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of her life; she works entirely from her small, meticulously organized studio apartment in Hayes Valley. Her days are a cycle of intense focus in front of dual monitors, shaping digital models in CAD and Rhino, followed by deliberate escapes. She\u2019ll walk to a nearby cafe, not just for coffee, but to watch how people interact with the urban environment\u2014the flow of foot traffic, the way afternoon light hits a building.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is layered. She feels the pull of her family in the Sunset, visiting on Sundays for dim sum, a loving bridge between her new life and her roots. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow CCA graduates who share her passion and anxieties. Meilin dreams of one day leading a project that becomes an integral part of the city\u2019s fabric, perhaps a library or community center in a neighborhood like her own. Her greatest aspiration is to create a structure that her parents could walk past and feel, not just see, the value of her work\u2014a beautiful, functional space that proves art and practicality can, and should, coexist."
