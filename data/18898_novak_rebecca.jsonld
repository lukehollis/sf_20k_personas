The daughter of a union machinist and a school secretary, she saw early on how infrastructure\u2014or the lack of it\u2014dictated the boundaries of one's life. The infrequent bus service was a lifeline for some and an invisible barrier for others, a reality that ignited her interest in creating equitable access.\n\nAfter earning a political science degree from Ohio State, she set her sights west, drawn to the progressive policy laboratories of California. She enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Public Policy program, where her academic focus crystallized around urban transit. The Bay Area, with its complex web of buses, trains, and ferries, was the ultimate case study. Upon graduating, she joined the SFMTA as a junior planner, driven by a conviction that mobility is a fundamental human right. Over two decades, her sharp intellect and unwavering dedication saw her rise through the ranks.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 38. The split was amicable but draining, sharpening her focus on her career, which became both her refuge and her purpose. She poured her energy into her work, leading the initial planning for the Central Subway and championing bus rapid transit corridors. Now, as Director of Strategic Initiatives, she is one of the architects of the city\u2019s transportation future.\n\nRebecca lives in a restored Edwardian apartment in Hayes Valley, a 3.7-mile commute she makes daily on the 21-Hayes bus or the N-Judah. Her daily ride is a form of fieldwork, where she observes passenger flow and service gaps firsthand. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow policy wonks and neighborhood friends she meets for drinks at Anina or dinner in the Mission. Her deepest aspiration is to see a truly integrated, world-class public transit system in San Francisco, one that erases the barriers she witnessed as a child. For Rebecca, fixing the city\u2019s commute isn\u2019t just a job; it's the fulfillment of a lifelong mission."

She was nine, waiting with her mom for the infrequent crosstown bus in Cleveland. Her father was on his shift at the plant. The bus was twenty minutes late, the world outside gray and slushy. It wasn't just an inconvenience; it felt like a judgment. In that moment, watching her mother\u2019s tired sigh, a quiet, fierce conviction was born: a person\u2019s life shouldn\u2019t be dictated by the failings of a timetable.\n\n2.\nHer first solo ride on BART as a Berkeley grad student was a revelation. Descending into the SFO station felt like entering a new world, but the true magic was emerging from the Transbay Tube. The train burst into the West Oakland sunlight, the city\u2019s skyline retreating behind her as the train accelerated. The sheer speed and scale of it all\u2014the interconnectedness\u2014was intoxicating. It wasn\u2019t a problem to be solved, like Cleveland\u2019s buses; it was a promise of what was possible, and she knew she had to be a part of it.\n\n3.\nThe first week after the divorce was the quietest. Alone in her new Hayes Valley apartment, the silence felt louder than any argument. At 38, her personal map had been completely redrawn. One night, unable to sleep, she spread the SFMTA system map across her floor. The clear, colored lines of the N-Judah and the 21-Hayes were logical, dependable. They had a purpose. In the wreckage of her marriage, her work became her true north\u2014a complex problem she knew, with certainty, how to navigate.\n\n4.\nIt wasn't the public ribbon-cutting, but a pre-dawn test run years earlier. She stood on a deserted 4th Street, holding a lukewarm coffee, and watched the first Central Subway train car glide out of the portal near Brannan. The quiet rumble vibrated through the soles of her shoes. After years of budget fights, community meetings, and endless blueprints, it was real. Her lines on a page were now tracks of steel, carrying a promise through the heart of the city. A profound, bone-deep satisfaction settled over her. We did it.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, riding the 21-Hayes home in the rain, she saw it. A young woman in hospital scrubs got off at one stop, a cook in a stained apron at the next, a student with headphones at another. Each person disembarked and disappeared into their life, their journey enabled by this bus, on this route, on this night. There was no fanfare, just the quiet, essential rhythm of a city at work. It was in these small, anonymous moments that she saw the fulfillment of her mission, one passenger at a time."
