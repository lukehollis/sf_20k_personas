Raised in San Jose, he was the only child of an immigrant mother from Oaxaca, Mexico, and a third-generation white American father from Ohio. His mother filled their home with the smells of mole and the sounds of Spanish, while his father introduced him to classic rock and Midwestern pragmatism. This dual heritage left Kai with a quiet, observant nature and a deep appreciation for things made with history and soul.\n\nFeeling adrift after earning a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from San Francisco State University, Kai saw his degree as more of a lens for understanding the world than a direct career path. He took a part-time job at a curated menswear and lifestyle boutique in Hayes Valley simply to cover the rent on his tiny apartment. To his surprise, he thrived. He had a natural eye for merchandising and a calm demeanor that could de-escalate any customer issue. The store became his canvas.\n\nA key turning point came three years ago when the original owner offered him the Store Manager position, which included the option to rent the newly renovated apartment directly above the shop. This solidified his place in the city. Now, with a zero-mile commute, Kai\u2019s life is intimately tied to the rhythm of his neighborhood. His day starts with a coffee from a local roaster before he heads downstairs to open the store. He knows the regulars by name and enjoys helping people find pieces that tell a story.\n\nSocially, Kai maintains a close-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow creatives and service industry veterans he meets in the neighborhood bars after closing. Though he enjoys his independence, he hopes to find a lasting partnership one day. His ultimate dream is to leverage his experience and savings to open his own small shop, perhaps one focusing on artisanal goods from Latin America, a perfect fusion of his heritage and his passion. For now, he is content building his life, one curated piece at a time, in the heart of the city he chose to call home."
