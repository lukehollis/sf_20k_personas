He was raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of a pragmatic civil engineer and a detail-oriented librarian. While his parents appreciated structure, Owen was drawn to its soul. He spent his youth sketching the Gothic arches on the University of Michigan campus, fascinated not by their load-bearing capacity, but by the way sunlight filtered through their stained glass. This led him to pursue a Master of Architecture from Columbia University, where he focused on the phenomenological experience of space\u2014how a building makes you *feel*.\n\nHis move to San Francisco two decades ago was a turning point. Recruited by a prestigious firm, his first major project was contributing to the design of a new wing for a prominent local art museum. This project solidified his reputation as a designer who understood art as well as architecture, and he quickly advanced. Now a Senior Architectural Designer, Owen specializes in cultural spaces: galleries, theaters, and public art installations that are as much sculpture as they are structure.\n\nOwen\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated within his Dogpatch live-work loft, explaining his zero-mile commute. The sprawling, open-plan space with its exposed brick and steel beams is his home, his studio, and his sanctuary. His days begin with pour-over coffee as he reviews blueprints at his vast drafting table, the city\u2019s industrial waterfront visible from his oversized windows. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a quiet casualty of his consuming passion for his work. Since then, his social life has centered on a tight-knit circle of fellow artists, chefs, and designers who gather for dinners in his loft.\n\nHe feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2019s spirit of reinvention and creative expression. Owen\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to break away and launch his own boutique firm. He dreams of designing a small, iconic public space\u2014a park pavilion or a community theater\u2014that becomes an indelible part of the city\u2019s fabric, a lasting testament to his belief that good design can quietly elevate daily life."

He watched a woman stop in the exact spot he\u2019d designed for contemplation. She wasn\u2019t looking at the art, but at the western wall, where the late afternoon sun slanted through the clerestory window, striping the concrete in liquid gold. In her quiet awe, he felt a profound, private sense of purpose. It was the moment he knew his work was not about buildings, but about feelings. This was nearly eighteen years ago.\n\n2.\nThe Ferry Building on his first Saturday in the city. He stood overwhelmed in the nave, not by the crowds, but by the sheer life of the space. The soaring steel trusses held the noise of the market, the smell of fresh bread, and the chatter of a hundred conversations. Light poured in from the bay, animating everything. It wasn't just a transit hub or a market; it was the city's living room. The memory became his touchstone, the seed of his dream to create a public space with that much soul. This was twenty years ago.\n\n3.\nThe silence after the door closed for the last time was deafening. His partner was gone. The loft, his masterpiece of open-plan living, suddenly felt cavernous and hostile. He looked at the single, perfect place setting left on the long dining table, a stark reminder of a shared life now halved. It was a hollow, architectural ache\u2014the pain of a space designed for two, now occupied by one. The cost of his ambition had never felt so tangible or so lonely. That was five years ago.\n\n4.\nHe was sixteen, hiding from a summer storm under a Gothic arch in Ann Arbor. His father would have seen the load-bearing strength, but Owen saw the way rain darkened the limestone and how the weak light cast shifting patterns on the flagstones. He ignored the structure and sketched the transient geometry of the light itself. It felt like a secret discovery, a language only he understood. It was the first conscious choice to capture the experience of a space over its mechanics, a choice that would define his entire career.\n\n5.\nA year after the breakup, he finally hosted a dinner. His chef friend took over the kitchen, an artist hung a piece on his wall, and the loft filled with laughter. Looking at his friends gathered around his drafting table, which was now covered in wine bottles and shared plates, he felt the hollow ache in his home begin to mend. He had built a sanctuary for himself, but it took filling it with his chosen family to make it a home again. It was the moment he reclaimed the space."
