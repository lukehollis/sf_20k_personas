Born to first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the quiet rows of the Outer Sunset. Her world was the scent of steam from her parents\u2019 small dry-cleaning business on Noriega Street and the hushed reverence of the local library, her sanctuary. A studious, dutiful daughter, she spent her youth balancing homework with helping at the shop, finding escape in the ordered worlds of fiction and history.\n\nWhile her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a more lucrative career, Jennifer followed her passion to UC Berkeley, majoring in History. It was an internship at the Bancroft Library that crystallized her future; she was captivated not just by the stories of the past, but by the art of preserving them. This led her to a Master\u2019s in Library and Information Science, where she specialized in the nascent field of digital archives.\n\nJennifer\u2019s career began at the San Francisco Public Library, where she met her husband, David, a software engineer who understood her passion for creating order out of digital chaos. They built a life together in a cozy Edwardian flat in the Inner Richmond, deciding early on that their legacy would be their work and their community, not children. A key turning point was the passing of her parents in her late thirties. As the keeper of their photographs and papers, her professional mission became deeply personal. She rose through the ranks, spearheading the library's transition to a digital-first institution and eventually becoming the Director of Digital Archives.\n\nNow at 50, Jennifer\u2019s life is a comfortable rhythm. Her 1.7-mile MUNI commute is her dedicated reading time. Evenings are for walks in Golden Gate Park with David or perfecting a new recipe. She remains deeply connected to the city, knowing the Clement Street shopkeepers by name and cherishing the fog rolling in over the avenues. Her dream is to secure funding for a massive project: digitizing the oral histories of San Francisco\u2019s diverse immigrant communities. She sees herself as a guardian of memories, ensuring that stories like her parents'\u2014and countless others\u2014are never lost in the city's relentless forward march."

The air was thick with the chemical scent of perchloroethylene and the hiss of the steam press was a constant lullaby. From this hiding place, she watched her parents\u2019 tired hands expertly fold and bag clothing. The deep love she felt for them was mixed with a pang of longing for the quiet, ordered world of the library down the street. That contrast forged her life\u2019s purpose: to honor the world of silent labor by giving it a permanent place in history.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during her internship at the Bancroft Library, she was tasked with cataloging 19th-century business ledgers. Her gloved fingers paused on one from an 1880s Chinatown laundry. Tracing the meticulous, handwritten characters detailing shirts and collars felt like a jolt of electricity through time. It was the anonymous, essential work of people just like her grandparents. In that dusty, hushed moment, her abstract love of history became a visceral, focused mission. She wasn't just studying the past; she was finding her own family in its pages.\n\n***\n\n3.\nTheir third date, in her early thirties, was a server crash. She had called David in a quiet panic when a new digital photo collection she was building went offline. He arrived at the library after hours, calm and focused. As he typed lines of code, he didn't just fix the problem; he asked her about the people in the photos he was saving. She fell in love not just with his brilliance, but with his innate understanding that her archives weren't just data. They were souls.\n\n***\n\n4.\nShe was 38, sitting on the dusty floral carpet of her parents\u2019 bedroom after they had passed. She found a shoebox under their bed filled with photographs. The most powerful one was of them as newlyweds, squinting in the bright Hong Kong sun, full of a future she now knew completely. Holding their entire journey in her hands, she was overwhelmed by a crushing sense of responsibility. Her work was no longer a career. It was a memorial, a promise to them that their story would never be erased.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, a few months before her 50th birthday, she was chatting with Mr. Chen at his Clement Street herb shop. He sighed, mentioning his children had no interest in taking over the business. \u201cSoon, just a memory,\u201d he said wistfully. The casual remark struck her with the force of an alarm. She realized her dream of an oral history project wasn't just important; it was an emergency. These voices, the living soul of her San Francisco, were fading with every retirement and closing sign."
