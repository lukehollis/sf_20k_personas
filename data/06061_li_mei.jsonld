Her parents, pragmatic and hardworking, equated success with stability\u2014a respectable job as a doctor or an engineer. Mei, however, was drawn to the stories held within objects. She spent her youth in libraries and the de Young Museum, captivated by how a single brushstroke or piece of pottery could contain a lifetime of human experience.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Art History, a choice that quietly disappointed her parents. She dreamed of becoming a curator, spending her life preserving and interpreting beauty. The turning point came during her senior year. Needing a volunteer credit, she took a shift at a food pantry in the Tenderloin. The curated, historical suffering she studied in textbooks paled in comparison to the raw, immediate need she witnessed in one afternoon. The stories weren't on gallery walls; they were in the tired eyes of a single mother, the trembling hands of an elderly man.\n\nAfter graduation, Mei abandoned her museum aspirations. She took an entry-level position at a non-profit focused on housing insecurity. Her art history degree, surprisingly, proved invaluable. She had been trained to see the narrative behind the surface, to piece together fragmented histories, and to argue passionately for the value of something\u2014or someone\u2014others might overlook.\n\nNow 34, Mei is a seasoned Case Manager. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a modest apartment in the same South of Market (SOMA) building where her non-profit is headquartered. Her daily routine is a seamless blend of personal and professional. Her walk to the corner store is a chance to check in on a client; her evenings are often spent finishing paperwork. Her social circle is small but fierce, mostly fellow social workers who understand the emotional toll of the job. Her relationship with her parents has softened into a quiet respect for her unwavering dedication.\n\nMei\u2019s dreams have transformed. She no longer aspires to unveil a lost masterpiece, but to see a family she\u2019s worked with get the keys to their first stable apartment. Her greatest hope is to one day secure funding for an art therapy program for at-risk youth, a way to finally merge her two worlds and show others how to find the beauty and tell the story of their own survival."
