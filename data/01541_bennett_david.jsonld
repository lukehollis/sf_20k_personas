The son of an accountant and a librarian, David was instilled with a practical mindset that led him to UC Davis and a computer science degree. He followed the well-trodden path to a lucrative programmer job in Silicon Valley, and for a few years, he lived the life he was supposed to want: company perks, a high salary, and complex coding challenges.\n\nThe turning point came during a mandated \"volunteer day.\" He was sent to a struggling middle school to help set up their new computer lab. What was meant to be a simple tech support task became a day of impromptu teaching. He found more satisfaction in explaining how a router worked to a group of curious kids than he had in months of optimizing an algorithm. The six-figure salary felt hollow; the flicker of understanding in a teenager's eyes felt profound.\n\nAt 28, David quit his tech job, a move his parents called brave and his colleagues called insane. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, using his savings to get his teaching credential in mathematics. He landed a job at a public high school in the Outer Sunset, the neighborhood he had specifically chosen for its quiet, residential feel, a world away from the city's frantic tech core.\n\nNow 36, David\u2019s life is a study in hyperlocal living. His rent-controlled apartment is a three-block walk from the school, rendering his commute nonexistent. His mornings begin with a coffee and a scone at a local cafe where the baristas know his order. His days are a whirlwind of pre-calculus, student council meetings, and the quiet satisfaction of seeing a student finally grasp a difficult concept. Afternoons are often spent grading papers at that same cafe or decompressing with a long run along Ocean Beach.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow teachers and neighbors\u2014people grounded in the community, not the stock market. While he\u2019s dated, his focus remains on his students. His dream isn't a startup exit, but to launch a free coding summer camp at his school, using his old skills to show kids that math is a gateway to creativity, not just a subject to be endured. In a city obsessed with disruption and wealth, David found his fortune in a simple equation: purpose over profit."
