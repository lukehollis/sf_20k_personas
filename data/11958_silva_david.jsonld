Raised in a working-class Portuguese-American family in Hayward, his father was an auto mechanic who preached the value of tangible skills, forever skeptical of the burgeoning digital world across the bay. David, however, was drawn to its promise. He put himself through San Jose State University, earning a practical Business Administration degree just in time to ride the first wave of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s.\n\nHis early career was a whirlwind of stock options, lavish launch parties, and boundless optimism. He believed he was building the future. The crash of 2001 was his true education. While others lost everything, David learned a brutal lesson in the difference between hype and sustainable strategy. This crucible forged his professional identity. He pivoted from sales to consulting, leveraging his firsthand knowledge of corporate failure to help other companies build resilience. His calm, measured approach made him invaluable, and he steadily climbed the ladder to his current role as a Director of Strategy Consulting.\n\nThe professional ascent came at a personal cost. His marriage frayed under the pressure of 80-hour workweeks, ending in an amicable but lonely divorce a decade ago. Now, his primary connection is his daughter, a 22-year-old art history major at UCLA, whose creative pursuits he finances but doesn't fully understand, though he deeply admires her passion.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are structured and predictable. He rises before dawn in his quiet Noe Valley condo, reads the news, and then summons an Uber for the 4.5-mile trip to his Financial District office, using the commute to clear his morning emails. He loves San Francisco for its beauty\u2014the fog rolling over Twin Peaks, the stunning bay views\u2014but feels increasingly disconnected from its frantic energy. Having achieved the financial security his father never had, David now dreams of a different kind of wealth: time. He fantasizes about leaving the corporate grind, maybe mentoring a few select startups or even buying a small plot of land in Sonoma to try his hand at winemaking\u2014a tangible, patient craft that feels like a fitting tribute to his roots."

His dad, wiping grease from a wrench, gestures with it toward the faint lights of San Francisco across the bay. \u201cThat\u2019s all smoke and mirrors, Davi. This,\u201d he says, tapping the engine block, \u201cthis is real.\u201d David feels a pang of guilt, knowing his heart is already over there, in the city of smoke. That moment created a lifelong drive to prove the intangible was real, a debt he feels he still owes.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt\u2019s 1999, on the rooftop of the W Hotel during a launch party. The city is a carpet of diamonds below. A colleague, eyes wild with optimism, clinks his champagne flute against David\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re printing money! We\u2019re making the future!\u201d David believes it. He feels an intoxicating, god-like certainty that everything is possible. The memory is now a bittersweet reminder of a naive faith he can never get back, the high before the fall that taught him that belief, alone, is never enough.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe day the company folded in 2001, he walked through the silent office. The foosball table sat under a ghostly film of dust, and a whiteboard still held the hockey-stick growth projections from last quarter\u2019s all-hands. The silence was heavier than any sound he\u2019d ever heard. It wasn\u2019t just financial loss; it was the death of a shared religion. That quiet humility became the foundation of his new career, the calm, measured voice that could see past the hype to the structural flaws beneath.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe remembers coming home near midnight to find his wife asleep on the couch, the TV on mute. He stood in the doorway for a full minute, watching her, knowing he should wake her but feeling like a stranger. The space between them felt vast and quiet. He went upstairs without a word. That silent, uncrossed threshold was the true end of his marriage, a quiet acknowledgment that the price for his professional ascent had been his presence in his own life.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, at his daughter\u2019s student art show at UCLA, he watched her speak about an artist\u2019s use of negative space. He didn\u2019t grasp the theory, but he saw the unshakeable passion in her eyes\u2014the same fire he\u2019d once had for stock options and IPOs. He felt a surge of pure, uncomplicated pride. It was a world he couldn\u2019t enter but was honored to fund. That moment clarified his new ambition: to build something for himself that felt as real and passionate as her art."
