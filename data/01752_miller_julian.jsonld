Raised in a placid Sacramento suburb, he was the younger son of a dentist and a real estate agent\u2014parents who provided everything but a vocabulary for emotional distress. His older sister\u2019s years-long battle with an undiagnosed anxiety disorder was the central, unspoken tragedy of their family life. Julian watched, a helpless observer, as she withdrew and the family unit fractured under the strain of what they couldn't name. This experience planted a seed in him: a profound need to understand the mechanics of the mind and offer the help his own family never knew how to seek.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct response to this need. After completing his undergraduate degree in psychology at UC Davis, he felt the pull of the Bay Area's progressive culture and enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work (MSW). His early career was a trial by fire in San Francisco\u2019s demanding public health sector, working with transient populations and in crisis intervention. The burnout was immense, but it solidified his clinical skills and deepened his empathy. The pandemic-driven shift to telehealth was an unexpected blessing, allowing him to transition to a private practice role within a larger healthcare network, working entirely from his apartment.\n\nNow, Julian lives a life of structured calm in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are a cycle of intense, virtual therapy sessions conducted from a meticulously organized corner of his one-bedroom flat, followed by deliberate, decompressing rituals. He finds solace in long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park, the fog a comforting blanket against the emotional weight of his work. He\u2019s a regular at a small cafe on Clement Street, where the baristas know his order\u2014a simple black coffee\u2014and offer a moment of familiar, low-stakes connection.\n\nThough dedicated to his clients, Julian dreams of a life beyond the screen. He hopes to one day open a small group practice with a few trusted colleagues, specializing in supporting families navigating mental health crises. Personally, he longs for a partnership built on the open, vulnerable communication he champions professionally. For Julian, San Francisco is not a city of hustle and ambition, but a sanctuary\u2014a place where he can help others find their footing while quietly, deliberately, searching for his own."
