Raised by a schoolteacher and a union machinist, her upbringing was grounded in practicality and the value of a well-defined system. This love for order led her to pursue a Master's in Library and Information Science, believing her future was in carefully cataloging the world's knowledge.\n\nLured by the siren song of the late-90s dot-com boom, she moved to San Francisco on a whim. The city was electric, and companies were desperate for people who could organize the sprawling, messy information of the early internet. Her librarian skills were rebranded as \"information architecture,\" and she found herself in tech. She rode the wave, learning the language of engineers and marketers, and discovered a talent for translating between them. The 2001 crash was her crucible; while others fled, she hunkered down, taking a less glamorous job at a stable company and honing her skills. This resilience earned her a reputation for being unflappable, the person you called when a project was on fire.\n\nHer personal life mirrored her career's trajectory\u2014a brief, intense \"tech marriage\" in her thirties that burned out from long hours and misaligned goals. Now, her connections are deeper and more deliberate: a tight-knit circle of friends from her early SF days, a weekly yoga class, and a standing Saturday morning coffee date.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Noe Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step journey from her kitchen to her standing desk, where she wrangles international teams and multimillion-dollar budgets via Slack and Zoom. The discipline of her youth remains; her days are structured, but she makes a point to leave her apartment for a walk through the neighborhood each afternoon, a small ritual to separate work from life. Having seen San Francisco morph and gentrify, she feels a protective fondness for its enduring quirks.\n\nHer ambition has shifted. The corporate ladder no longer calls to her. Instead, Sarah dreams of finding a way to fuse her two lives\u2014the librarian and the project manager. She envisions a future where she consults for public libraries or non-profits, helping them navigate the digital world she helped build, finally bringing her story full circle."
