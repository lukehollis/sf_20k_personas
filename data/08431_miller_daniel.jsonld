The only child of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, he was raised in the small apartment above his parents\u2019 corner grocery store. His childhood was a bilingual soundscape of English cartoons and the rapid-fire Cantonese of his parents haggling with suppliers. Instead of playing sports, Daniel spent his afternoons stocking shelves and doing his homework behind the counter, observing the community\u2019s daily rhythm and his parents\u2019 quiet struggle against rising rents and byzantine city regulations.\n\nHe excelled academically, driven by his parents\u2019 dream of a life for him beyond the confines of their store. He attended UC Berkeley, initially undeclared, but a pivotal moment came during his sophomore year when a zoning change threatened his family\u2019s business. Watching his father navigate the impenetrable bureaucracy of City Hall ignited a fire in him. He realized his calling wasn't to make money, but to understand and reform the systems that governed people's lives. This led him to pursue a Master of Public Policy at Georgetown.\n\nAfter graduation, the lure of Washington D.C. couldn\u2019t compete with his pull towards home. He felt the most pressing urban issues were unfolding in his own backyard. Daniel now works as a Policy Analyst for a non-profit think tank focused on Bay Area housing insecurity. From his small, tidy apartment in Hayes Valley, he has a 0.0-mile commute to the desk where he pores over zoning maps and affordability data.\n\nHis days are structured and solitary: a morning run through the Panhandle, hours of deep-focus work analyzing data, and evenings spent either unwinding with a complex sci-fi novel or meeting a few close friends for craft beer. He is deeply connected to San Francisco not as a playground, but as a complex puzzle he is determined to help solve. Daniel\u2019s quiet dream is that his research will one day inform a policy that prevents another family from facing the same uncertainty his once did, creating a more equitable foundation for the city that shaped him."
