The son of Filipino immigrants who settled in Daly City in the 1980s, he grew up watching his father work double shifts as a hotel banquet server and his mother care for others as a nurse\u2019s aide. He absorbed their ethos of service, but as a teenager, he drifted, more interested in punk shows at Gilman Street than his grades.\n\nThe turning point came at nineteen, during a mandatory volunteer placement for a community college class. He was assigned to a youth shelter in the Tenderloin. For the first time, he saw structural inequity not as a textbook concept but as the lived reality of kids his own age. The experience ignited a purpose within him. He transferred to San Francisco State, then earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, determined to be a force for stability in chaotic lives.\n\nHis first job in county child protective services was a trial by fire, leaving him emotionally scarred but with an unshakeable resolve. Seeking to intervene earlier, Paolo transitioned to educational services. For the past decade, he\u2019s been a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a public high school in the Mission District. His days are a whirlwind of counseling sessions with students navigating everything from family pressures to identity crises, and advocating for resources they desperately need.\n\nAt 41, his life is anchored by routine and purpose. He lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission, just a 2.5-mile bike ride from his school. This daily commute through the vibrant, mural-lined streets is his meditation. His social life isn't flashy; it consists of a tight-knit group of friends, weekend bike rides to Marin, and bouldering at Mission Cliffs. He is close with his sister and her family, who still live in Daly City.\n\nPaolo\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. He aspires to launch a district-wide mentorship program connecting students with professionals in their desired fields. He wants to see the teenagers he counsels break generational cycles and build fulfilling lives. While open to a new relationship, he is content, his life rich with connection to his community\u2014a quiet pillar in the city he calls home."

The apartment door would open long after midnight, and the smell of a hotel banquet\u2014prime rib and warm bread rolls\u2014would fill their small Daly City home. He\u2019d see his father\u2019s exhausted posture but also the deep satisfaction in his eyes. In those quiet moments, Paolo learned that the most important work is often the least visible. That quiet, steadfast pride became the foundation for his own definition of a successful life, long before he knew what his life would be.\n\n2.\nHe was nineteen, at the Tenderloin youth shelter. A girl, no older than sixteen, told him her biggest worry was finding a safe place to charge her phone to finish homework for a class she was somehow still attending. The brutal, simple practicality of her struggle hit him like a physical blow. The abstract anger from his punk rock days suddenly had a face. That night, the chaotic music in his head went quiet, replaced by a singular, focused purpose that led him directly to social work.\n\n3.\nHis second year in county child protective services. He stood in a small, empty bedroom after two children had been removed, the stale scent of cigarette smoke clinging to his jacket. On the floor was a single, worn-out sneaker. The profound emptiness of that room, the ghost of a life already broken, felt like a personal failure. He wasn\u2019t just scarred by the trauma; he was transformed by the conviction that he had to get there before everything shattered. It was the moment he chose prevention over intervention.\n\n4.\nFour years ago, a student he\u2019d worked with since freshman year\u2014a quiet, withdrawn boy who rarely spoke\u2014stopped by his office on graduation day. He handed Paolo a worn copy of a book they\u2019d once talked about, inscribed with a simple message: \"Thanks for seeing me.\" In that moment, the weight of the bureaucracy and the seemingly lost causes vanished. He wasn't just a counselor; he was a witness to someone becoming themself. It was the quietest, most profound victory of his professional life.\n\n5.\nLast spring, biking home from school. A sudden downpour washed the vibrant colors of the Balmy Alley murals, making them gleam. Instead of rushing, he slowed, feeling the rain on his face and listening to the hum of his tires on wet pavement. He passed the panaderia, the sounds of the school day fading. In that simple, drenched ride, he felt a profound sense of place. This was his life\u2014not grand, but textured and real. For the first time in a while, he felt completely, peacefully content."
