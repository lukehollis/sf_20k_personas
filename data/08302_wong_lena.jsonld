A third-generation San Franciscan, she grew up in the quiet fog of the Outer Richmond, a world away from the Chinatown her grandparents had settled in. Her parents, a pragmatic engineer and a methodical librarian, envisioned a stable future for her in law or medicine. But a single art history elective at UC Berkeley irrevocably shifted her perspective, revealing a language she hadn't known she spoke.\n\nThis became her turning point. Defying her family\u2019s quiet expectations, she pursued a Master's in Curatorial Studies at Bard College, immersing herself in the demanding New York art scene. After a formative stint in Berlin, the pull of the Bay Area\u2019s unique cultural landscape brought her home. She started as a curatorial assistant, her sharp eye and tireless work ethic earning her a reputation. Now, at 42, she is a respected Curator of Contemporary Art, her life and work seamlessly integrated.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; Lena lives in a minimalist SoMa loft two blocks from the museum. Her day begins with pour-over coffee and a review of art journals before she walks to work, the city's cacophony a familiar score. Her life revolves around the museum\u2019s ecosystem: intense research, grant writing, studio visits with emerging artists, and planning installations that challenge perception. Her social circle is a tight weave of artists, gallerists, and thinkers. A painful breakup in her early thirties with a fellow curator solidified her resolve to pour her energy into her career, leaving her fiercely independent yet open to connection.\n\nLena\u2019s connection to San Francisco is aesthetic and intellectual. She sees the city not just as home, but as a living exhibition of innovation and conflict. Her dream is to curate a landmark retrospective that re-contextualizes a forgotten female artist of the 20th century. While her career is her anchor, she quietly hopes for a partnership that understands her dedication, a future where her personal and professional collections can finally merge."
