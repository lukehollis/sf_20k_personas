Born and raised in a practical, working-class family in suburban Sacramento, Sarah always viewed San Francisco as the place where real life happened. In 1995, at age 20, she moved to the city, sharing a cramped apartment and fueled by a vague ambition for a more interesting life. To ground her dreams in reality, she enrolled at City College of San Francisco and earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Business Administration, a choice more about stable employment than passion.\n\nFor over a decade, Sarah worked a series of competent but unfulfilling administrative jobs in downtown offices. She was the person who kept things running, managing calendars and ordering supplies, her creative spirit slowly dimming under fluorescent lights. The turning point came with the birth of her son, Leo. As a new mother, she found herself captivated by the world of early childhood development. Volunteering at Leo\u2019s cooperative preschool, she felt a sense of purpose that her office job had never provided. The chaotic, joyful energy of a room full of four-year-olds felt more authentic than any corporate memo.\n\nAt 38, she made a life-altering decision. She left her stable office job, took a few essential early childhood education courses, and accepted a position as a teacher\u2019s aide at a small, play-based preschool just three blocks from her apartment. The pay cut was significant, but the emotional reward was immeasurable.\n\nNow 48, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply rooted in her neighborhood. That rent-controlled apartment she moved into in the late 90s is her anchor, the key to affording her meaningful but low-paying career. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of a short walk past the local bakery and bookstore. She co-parents Leo amicably with her ex-partner, who lives nearby. Her social life revolves around other school parents and neighbors she\u2019s known for decades. Her dreams are no longer grand; she hopes to save enough to visit national parks with Leo and perhaps, one day, get her lead teacher certification. Sarah Miller is a testament to a different kind of San Francisco success story\u2014not one of tech IPOs, but of finding a small, sustainable, and deeply fulfilling life in the heart of a community she loves."
