Raised in the shadow of Mount Diablo in Concord, he was the son of a high school math teacher and a dental hygienist. His childhood was one of suburban stability, marked by predictability and the gentle pressure to find a secure path. David, however, was drawn to the narratives of the past. He devoured history books, fascinated by the grand, messy epics of empires and revolutions, a stark contrast to his orderly upbringing.\n\nHe attended San Francisco State University, choosing to major in History, and fell in love with a city that felt like a living museum. He envisioned a life in academia or curation, surrounded by artifacts and archives. But upon graduating in the late 90s, the reality of student loans and the city\u2019s burgeoning cost of living set in. A pragmatic nudge from an uncle led him to an entry-level position at a large insurance firm. He was good at it; his methodical mind, honed by historical analysis, was perfectly suited to assessing claims and calculating risk. One year turned into five, and five into a career.\n\nThe key turning point was meeting his wife, Sarah, a landscape architect, in his late twenties. She grounded him. Together, they scraped enough to buy a modest two-bedroom condo in the Inner Richmond in 2003, a move that now feels like winning the lottery. His career as an adjuster provided the stability for Sarah to start her own small firm.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is contained within the fog-kissed blocks of his neighborhood. The 0.0-mile commute means his workday unfolds in a spare bedroom overlooking a neighbor's carefully tended garden. His mornings start with strong coffee and the digital tide of claims\u2014car accidents, water damage, personal liability\u2014a litany of minor disasters he calmly translates into figures. His connection to San Francisco is intimate but placid: weekend walks with Sarah through Golden Gate Park, picking up dumplings on Clement Street, and observing the city's frantic energy from a comfortable distance.\n\nHis dream is not a grand escape but a quiet course correction. The history degree, framed on his office wall, is a constant, gentle rebuke. He aspires to volunteer at the California Academy of Sciences or begin writing a detailed history of his own neighborhood. It\u2019s a longing to reconnect with the young man who once saw stories everywhere, before he learned the business of putting a price on them."
