Born in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District to hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, he grew up understanding the city as a place of relentless effort and quiet ambition. His father, a restaurant cook, and his mother, a seamstress, instilled in him a profound respect for stability and public service\u2014a stark contrast to the city\u2019s more bohemian narrative.\n\nHe charted a practical, determined course through the city\u2019s institutions: Lowell High School, then a civil engineering degree, and finally a Master\u2019s in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. Wei was never interested in the ephemeral world of tech startups; he was drawn to the tangible, the permanent. He wanted to work with concrete and steel. His career began at the Department of Public Works, but he soon realized his true calling was in the symphony of logistics behind the city\u2019s transit. He joined the SFMTA, finding a home in the meticulous, often thankless world of Muni Capital Projects.\n\nA key turning point came early in his career during a contentious bus rapid transit project. Facing a room of angry residents, he learned that infrastructure wasn't just about efficiency\u2014it was about people. This lesson transformed him from a pure engineer into a patient, diplomatic project manager. Now, at 50, he's a veteran of bureaucratic battles and construction delays, finding deep satisfaction in projects that will outlive him, like the Central Subway.\n\nWei lives a quiet, ordered life in a Hayes Valley condo, a stone's throw from his Civic Center office, rendering his commute nonexistent. His brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably, leaving him single and childless but not lonely. His life is anchored by routine: early morning walks, long hours managing timelines, and non-negotiable Sunday dim sum with his aging parents in the Richmond. His social circle is small, comprised of colleagues who understand his world. Wei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he doesn\u2019t just live in it, he works to ensure its heart\u2014its public transit\u2014keeps beating. His dream is to one day see the Caltrain downtown extension break ground, a final, monumental contribution to the city that made him."

It was a specific hydraulic sigh followed by a rumble that meant his father was home from the restaurant. That sound wasn't noise; it was a promise, the closing of a circuit that made their family whole each night. It was the first system he ever trusted, a tangible rhythm of stability in the fog. He didn't know it then, but he would spend his life chasing that feeling of reliable arrival.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, from a classroom window at Lowell, he recalls looking down at the city grid. His classmates saw landmarks, but Wei saw a schematic. He mentally traced the paths of the N-Judah and the L-Taraval, imagining the immense, hidden infrastructure\u2014the pipes, conduits, and tunnels\u2014that held it all together. It was a moment of profound clarity. The city wasn't just a home; it was a magnificent, complex machine. He knew then he didn't want to write code for it; he wanted to service its very bones.\n\n3.\nHe was 28, confidently presenting his first bus rapid transit plan to a hostile community meeting. He remembers one woman, her voice trembling with anger, talking about the parking spot he planned to eliminate. It was where her son picked her up for her weekly chemotherapy. His efficient, logical design crumbled against her fragile, human need. He felt a hot flush of shame, realizing infrastructure wasn't about lines on a map but about lives. That evening transformed him, tempering his engineering mind with a necessary, patient heart.\n\n4.\nThe divorce, in his mid-thirties, is a memory of quiet logistics. He remembers watching his ex-wife pack a box of books, the atmosphere not of anger but of a project being methodically dismantled. There was a profound sadness in seeing a structure they built together fail. He accepted, then, that some things aren't permanent. This quiet loss didn't break him; it galvanized his devotion to his work\u2014to building the things that *would* last, that could anchor a city even when a single life came undone.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, he stood alone on the newly constructed Central Subway platform at Yerba Buena, weeks before it opened. The air was cool and smelled of curing concrete. In the immense, echoing silence, he ran his hand along the smooth platform edge. This was the culmination of a decade of bureaucratic fights and logistical nightmares. It was real. It was permanent. The feeling wasn't triumph, but a deep, quiet peace\u2014the satisfaction of having built something that would outlive him, a gift to the city that made him."
