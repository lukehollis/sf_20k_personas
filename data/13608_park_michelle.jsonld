The daughter of hardworking Korean immigrants, she was taught the values of precision and persistence from a young age. Her father, a perpetually curious man, could fix any machine in their shop, and Misha inherited his fascination with how things worked, spending hours disassembling and reassembling old electronics.\n\nThis innate drive led her to a BS from UCLA and a Master\u2019s in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford, where she fell in love with the tangible, problem-solving world of robotics. An early-career failure\u2014a robotic arm she'd programmed miscalibrating and damaging an entire production line\u2014became her defining professional moment. Far from breaking her, the incident instilled a relentless meticulousness and a deeper understanding of systems integration that propelled her to a senior role by age 30.\n\nHer days are bookended by a ritualistic 18.5-mile commute. The brisk pre-dawn bicycle ride to the 22nd Street station is her meditation, a physical counterpoint to her cerebral work. On the Caltrain, she sketches new end-effector designs in her notebook. She chose to live in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial-chic vibe and community of makers resonates with her own spirit. She sacrifices suburban convenience for the city's vibrant culture and diverse social connections.\n\nWeekends are for rock climbing at Mission Cliffs with a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of tech professionals and artists\u2014or volunteering at a youth STEM workshop. Though financially secure, Misha feels a pull towards greater purpose. Her ultimate dream is to pivot from manufacturing to assistive robotics, designing sophisticated prosthetics or mobility aids. She envisions creating technology that could have eased the physical burdens she watched her parents endure, bringing her life\u2019s work full circle."

Misha pointed to a small, forgotten valve half-hidden by a tangle of tubes. He paused, looked, and a slow grin spread across his face. The look he gave her\u2014a mix of surprise and profound pride\u2014felt more valuable than any grade. It was the moment she understood that seeing the problem clearly was the most important part of any solution.\n\n2.\nStanford, 2 AM. The robotics lab was silent except for the hum of her laptop. She executed the code, and for the first time, the three-fingered gripper on the bench perfectly mirrored the clench and release of her own hand. It was a jolt, pure electricity. In that instant, the lines of code weren't abstract anymore; they were muscle, tendon, and intention. Her fascination with how things worked had just found its true purpose: making things *act*.\n\n3.\nShe can still hear the sound: a horrifying screech of metal, then a series of sickening crunches. The production line froze. In the echoing silence, every eye was on her. The shame was a physical weight, cold and heavy in her gut. But as she stood there, a quiet resolve washed over the heat in her face. This would never happen again. The failure didn't break her; it forged her, turning her youthful persistence into a diamond-hard meticulousness.\n\n4.\nHalfway up a familiar route at Mission Cliffs, her fingers screaming, she was stuck. She couldn't see the next move. Then came Leo\u2019s voice from below\u2014not an engineer\u2019s analysis, but a painter\u2019s simple encouragement: \"Just breathe, Misha. Trust your feet.\" Looking down at her friends, a mix of artists and coders, she felt a profound sense of belonging. This was why she had chosen the city over the suburbs. This balance was her anchor.\n\n5.\nOn a recent visit home, she watched her mother folding warm clothes, her knuckles swollen from decades of work at the cleaners. Her mother flexed her hands, a small, unconscious grimace of pain. In that quiet moment, Misha\u2019s ambition crystallized. The sketches of assistive devices in her notebook were no longer just complex engineering problems. They were a promise\u2014to create for others the physical ease and dignity her parents had so often gone without."
