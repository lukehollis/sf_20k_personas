The only child of first-generation Korean immigrants, he grew up behind the counter of his parents' small dry-cleaning business in Richmond. He watched them work tirelessly, their conversations revolving around survival and securing a better, more financially stable future for him. Their dream was for David to become an engineer or a doctor\u2014a path of clear prestige and security. But from a young age, David was more attuned to the quiet struggles of the families in his neighborhood, seeing firsthand the systemic barriers that thwarted their ambitions.\n\nHis turning point came while volunteering at a community center in high school. He mentored a younger student, helping them navigate the bewildering college application process. Seeing the spark of hope ignite in that student\u2019s eyes felt more fulfilling than any equation he could solve. Against his parents' wishes, he enrolled at San Francisco State University to study Social Work. It was a difficult, silent rebellion, driven not by anger, but by a deep-seated conviction.\n\nNow 30, David is a Case Manager for a non-profit that guides first-generation high school students toward higher education. His $78,000 salary makes life in the city a constant balancing act, but his work provides a different kind of wealth. He lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood that feels like a comfortable echo of his upbringing. His daily 2.5-mile bike ride to his office near Civic Center is a cherished ritual\u2014a moment of peace before a day spent untangling bureaucracy and advocating for his students.\n\nHis social life is a close-knit circle of friends from college and work, people who share his values. Weekends are for hiking in the Marin Headlands, potlucks, and pickup basketball at Golden Gate Park. While he hopes to one day find a long-term partner, his primary focus is on his career. He dreams of eventually moving into a policy role, shaping the very systems he now helps his students navigate. For David, San Francisco isn't a city of tech booms and extravagance; it\u2019s a community of immense need and profound resilience, and he has found his place right in the heart of it."

His mother paused, carefully folding a doctor\u2019s white coat. She looked at him, her smile tired but full of hope, and said in Korean, \u201cOne day, you will wear the coat, not just clean it.\u201d He felt a profound swell of love for her sacrifice, mixed with the first, quiet stirring of a different calling\u2014a sense that his duty might lie not in the coat, but with the people who could never afford one.\n\n2.\nThe moment is seared into his memory: age seventeen, in the noisy computer lab at the community center. He was with his mentee, Elena, staring at the San Francisco State admissions portal. When the page loaded with a burst of color and the word \u201cCONGRATULATIONS!\u201d Elena\u2019s gasp was followed by a tearful, disbelieving laugh. In that instant, David felt a click of purpose so clean and powerful it eclipsed every equation he\u2019d ever learned. He knew, with absolute certainty, this was the work he was meant to do.\n\n3.\nIt was the quiet that hurt the most. He was eighteen, sitting at the small kitchen table with his parents, the SF State acceptance letter lying next to his bowl. When he said, \u201cI declared Social Work,\u201d his father didn\u2019t look up from his newspaper, and his mother simply stirred her soup, her face a mask of disappointment. There was no yelling, just a heavy, sorrowful silence. In that quiet, he felt the true weight of his choice and found the lonely resolve to see it through on his own terms.\n\n4.\nHis first big win as a case manager. He was twenty-five, advocating for a student named Marcus whose residency status for in-state tuition was unjustly denied. After weeks of calls, emails, and navigating bureaucratic dead-ends, he finally got the decision overturned. When he called Marcus to tell him, the student was speechless, but Marcus\u2019s mom got on the phone, her voice thick with emotion as she simply said, \u201cThank you for fighting for my son.\u201d David realized he wasn't just fighting systems; he was restoring families' faith.\n\n5.\nA foggy Tuesday morning just last year. Biking through the Panhandle, the cool mist on his face, the damp smell of eucalyptus in the air. The city was just waking up, its usual roar softened to a hum. He wasn\u2019t rushing or stressed; he was just moving through the neighborhood that raised him towards the work that defined him. A profound sense of peace washed over him\u2014a feeling not of arrival, but of being exactly, perfectly in place, pedaling between his past and his purpose."
