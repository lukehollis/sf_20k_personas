            "value": "Sarah Sharma lives and breathes art, quite literally. Her home is a spacious, light-filled live/work loft above the contemporary art gallery she curates in Dogpatch. The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Cupertino, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the pragmatic expectations of Silicon Valley. Her father, a software engineer, envisioned a similar path for her. She dutifully enrolled at UC Berkeley as an economics major, but a single elective in Art History ignited a passion that rerouted her entire life.\n\nThis pivot was her first quiet act of rebellion. She switched her major, weathering her family\u2019s concern, and found her calling. After Berkeley, she moved to New York for a Master's in Art History, immersing herself in the city\u2019s formidable museum and gallery scene. She interned, wrote, and worked her way up, but the Bay Area\u2019s unique blend of technological innovation and creative spirit eventually called her back. She returned to San Francisco for a junior curator position, driven by a desire to explore the intersection of art and technology that defined her home region.\n\nA key turning point was her first solo-curated show, \u201cDigital Diaspora,\u201d which featured emerging South Asian artists using new media. The exhibit was a critical success, earning her professional acclaim and, finally, her father's profound respect. It cemented her identity as a curator with a distinct, forward-thinking vision.\n\nNow at 46, Sarah's life is a seamless blend of personal and professional. Her days begin with chai tea overlooking the bay from her window, followed by a walk downstairs to her gallery. Her routine involves studio visits with local artists, grant writing, and designing the intricate narratives of her next exhibition. Her social circle is a tight-knit community of artists, writers, and thinkers. While she is single, her life is full, defined by deep friendships and a devotion to her work. Her hope is to one day guest-curate for a major international biennial, bringing the innovative spirit of San Francisco's art scene to the world stage. She is not just a resident of the city; she is one of its cultural architects."
