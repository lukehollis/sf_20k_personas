The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store, her childhood was a quiet tapestry of homework, helping stock shelves, and the unspoken pressures of first-generation ambition. Her parents envisioned her becoming a medical doctor, a stable, respected profession. However, Jasmine was more drawn to the unspoken anxieties she saw in her community\u2014the silent struggles masked by stoicism. This led her to pursue psychology, a choice her parents initially met with concerned confusion.\n\nShe stayed local for her education, earning a B.A. from UC Berkeley before committing to a demanding Psy.D. program. It was there she found her calling: adolescent psychology. Her early career was spent in the trenches of community health, working with overworked school counselors and treating teens navigating everything from academic pressure to profound trauma. While fulfilling, the caseloads and bureaucracy led to burnout. This became her critical turning point. The pandemic normalized telehealth, giving her the courage to leave her agency job and launch a private practice from her Noe Valley apartment.\n\nToday, Jasmine\u2019s commute is the ten steps from her kitchen to her home office. Her days are structured around virtual sessions with young clients, offering a space for them to unpack their lives. Life is intentionally hyper-local. Mornings start with a walk to a Philz Coffee, and afternoons often include a run through Glen Canyon Park to decompress. She lives with her partner, Alex, a software engineer whose world of code provides a grounding contrast to her world of human emotion.\n\nAs a native, Jasmine\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and protective. She sees the city not as a tech playground, but as a complex ecosystem of families and neighborhoods. Her dream is to develop workshops for immigrant parents, helping them build the vocabulary to discuss mental health with their children\u2014a resource she wishes her own parents had. For Jasmine, success isn't about climbing a corporate ladder, but about fostering resilience, one patient at a time, from the quiet heart of her chosen city."
