Raised in the sprawling, manicured suburbs of Fremont, she was the first-generation American daughter of engineers who had traded the bustling energy of Mumbai for the quiet promise of Silicon Valley. Her childhood was filled with stories of a city alive at all hours, a stark contrast to her own world of cul-de-sacs and strip malls. This disconnect sparked a curiosity that defined her academic path, leading her from a sociology degree at UC Davis to a transformative study-abroad semester in Copenhagen. There, surrounded by bike lanes, public squares, and human-scaled architecture, her future crystallized. She returned to the States and enrolled in UCLA\u2019s Master of Urban and Regional Planning program.\n\nNow 28, Maya has realized her professional dream. As a planner for the City of San Francisco, she works to shape the urban fabric she was once so removed from. Her life is hyper-local, a direct consequence of her 0.0-mile commute. She lives and works from a bright, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its unpretentious, diverse community. Her days consist of Zoom meetings about zoning variances and digital modeling, punctuated by long runs through the park or walks to her favorite bakery on Clement Street.\n\nWhile deeply fulfilled by her work, Maya grapples with the city\u2019s paradoxes. She\u2019s acutely aware of the housing crisis and social inequities she analyzes daily. Her relationships are a mix of close-knit friends from her field and the often-transient connections made through dating apps. Her parents, though proud, still gently nudge her toward a more stable, suburban existence. But Maya remains steadfast. Her greatest aspiration is to lead a project that creates significant new green space and affordable housing in a neighborhood like the Bayview or Tenderloin. For her, San Francisco is not just a home; it is a complex, flawed, and beautiful organism she is dedicated to helping evolve, one public park and community plan at a time."
