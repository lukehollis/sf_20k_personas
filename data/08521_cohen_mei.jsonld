The daughter of a Jewish-American history professor and a first-generation Chinese immigrant from Guangzhou, Mei grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District. Her childhood was a unique blend of cultures: Hebrew lessons and stories of the old country from her father, and the scent of her mother's cooking wafting from the kitchen of the family\u2019s small dumpling shop in Chinatown. She was a quiet, observant child, absorbing the pragmatic resilience of her mother and the intellectual curiosity of her father.\n\nHer path was irrevocably altered when her father passed away from a sudden heart attack during her senior year of high school. The dream of a four-year university education evaporated overnight. Grounded by a new sense of responsibility, Mei enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration. She entered the workforce at 20, taking an entry-level data processing job at a large financial firm downtown. She was not a natural-born financier, but she was meticulous, reliable, and possessed an unyielding work ethic. Over two decades, she slowly, steadily climbed the ladder, not through aggressive networking, but through sheer competence. She became the person who knew how the systems *actually* worked, earning her current role as a Production Supervisor.\n\nNow 41, Mei\u2019s life is a study in disciplined routine. The pandemic shifted her role to be permanently remote, erasing her commute and tethering her life to her tidy, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. Her day begins at 6:00 a.m. with green tea, followed by an eight-hour stretch of managing deadlines and overseeing digital workflows from her standing desk. Lunch is a solitary walk through the neighborhood, where she knows the local baristas and bakers by name. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from her youth and her aging mother, whom she visits in the Richmond every Sunday without fail.\n\nSan Francisco is not a playground for Mei; it is the entire landscape of her memory and identity. It is the city that forged her hybrid identity, tested her resolve, and ultimately provided her a stable, if quiet, life. Her current dream is not a promotion, but a passport full of stamps. She longs to travel, to finally see the village her mother left behind and to walk the historic streets her father once lectured about. After a lifetime of ensuring the productions of others ran smoothly, Mei is quietly planning a production of her own: a second act centered not on responsibility, but on discovery."
