The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who settled in the Sunset District, David grew up under the heavy expectation of tangible success. His parents, a pragmatic accountant and a meticulous pharmacist, dreamed of their son becoming a doctor or an engineer. David, however, was drawn to the abstract. He devoured books, finding more comfort in philosophical quandaries than in calculus equations.\n\nHis rebellion was a quiet one. He attended SF State, but instead of pre-med, he pursued a Master's degree in Modern Philosophy. He imagined a life of the mind, teaching and writing in the hallowed halls of academia. But the reality was a brutal job market of adjunct positions and fierce competition. The dream slowly faded, leaving him with a brilliant, analytical mind and no clear path forward.\n\nThe turning point came at 32. After a string of unfulfilling temp jobs, a friend helped him secure a position as a research assistant at a UCSF medical research group. It wasn't the life he\u2019d envisioned, but his philosophical training had made him an expert at identifying patterns, structuring arguments, and meticulously editing complex texts. He excelled at compiling patient data, writing literature reviews, and ensuring ethical protocols were followed. The work was stable, intellectually adjacent to his passions, and allowed him to work from his small, rent-controlled apartment.\n\nNow 46, David\u2019s world is contained within a few square miles. His commute is a ten-foot walk from his bed to his desk. His days are a disciplined routine of coffee, data analysis, and virtual meetings. He is respected for his precision but is a peripheral figure in the breakthroughs he helps facilitate. His social life is sparse\u2014a weekly visit to his widowed mother in the Sunset, and occasional drinks with a couple of friends from his grad school days.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and sensory. He doesn't see the city as a ladder for ambition but as a landscape for contemplation. He finds solace in long, winding walks through Golden Gate Park and loses hours browsing the shelves at Green Apple Books. David\u2019s grand dreams have been replaced by smaller, more personal aspirations: to find the perfect turn of phrase in a research summary, to finish the dense novel on his nightstand, and to quietly forge a meaningful connection between the human data on his screen and the philosophical questions that still occupy his mind."
