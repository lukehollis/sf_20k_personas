            "value": "Sarah Miller was raised in a home of loving, intellectual chaos in the Sacramento suburbs. Her parents, both philosophy professors, filled their house with teetering stacks of books, unfinished arguments, and a general disregard for physical order. From a young age, Sarah was the counter-force. She found profound satisfaction in organizing the family photo albums into chronological, thematic binders and alphabetizing the spice rack. This innate desire to create structure from entropy became her quiet calling.\n\nShe pursued an English Literature degree at UC Davis, but found herself more fascinated by the library\u2019s architecture of information than by any single narrative. The turning point was a part-time job shelving books, where she realized her passion wasn't just for stories, but for the systems that made them discoverable. This led her to a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) from San Jose State University, where she specialized in digital asset management.\n\nUpon graduating, Sarah secured a remote position as a Metadata Librarian for a major university consortium. The move to San Francisco wasn't for the job, but for herself. She craved the city's cultural energy, wanting to be near its world-class museums and independent bookstores, even if she experienced them mostly as a quiet observer.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a small but immaculately organized one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her pour-over coffee station to a sunlit desk overlooking a neighbor's flourishing garden. Her days are a meditative rhythm of tagging digital archives, creating taxonomies, and ensuring the sprawling chaos of information can be elegantly navigated by future researchers. She finds deep purpose in her work, seeing beauty in a perfectly constructed metadata schema.\n\nHer social life is as carefully curated as her apartment. She has a small circle of close friends from her graduate program and a weekly trivia night at a local pub. Her true sanctuary is Golden Gate Park, where she takes long walks to clear her head. Sarah\u2019s dream isn't fame or fortune, but a more profound ambition: to one day lead a project digitizing and organizing a lost or forgotten archive, bringing its hidden stories into the light through the quiet, essential power of order."
