The daughter of hardworking Chinese immigrants, she grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District. Her childhood was filled with the rhythmic clatter of mahjong tiles from the apartment next door and the scent of her mother\u2019s cooking mingling with the salt air. Her parents, who ran a small laundromat, preached the gospel of education as the only true escape from a life of unrelenting labor. Meilin absorbed this lesson, viewing the city\u2019s health and social inequities not just as abstract problems, but as the daily reality for families like her own.\n\nThis firsthand understanding propelled her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree and then to Johns Hopkins for a Master of Public Health. It was there she met David Miller, a kind, idealistic urban planning student who shared her vision for more compassionate cities. They married and returned to San Francisco, eager to apply their ideals. Meilin quickly found her calling at the Department of Public Health, using data as a form of advocacy to fight for the communities she grew up in.\n\nThe turning point of her life was both sudden and cruel. David was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive cancer and passed away within a year, just five years ago. The loss hollowed her out, but it also solidified her professional resolve into a solemn mission. Her work became her anchor in a sea of grief.\n\nNow, at 44, Meilin lives a quiet, contained life in a bright NoPa apartment overlooking the Panhandle. Her 0.0-mile commute means her home is a fortress of solitude and productivity. Her days follow a strict routine: a pre-dawn walk among the eucalyptus trees, followed by hours immersed in datasets and policy drafts that could reshape healthcare access. Her social circle is small but fiercely loyal, consisting of a few friends from her Berkeley days and her younger brother, an architect.\n\nHer hope is that the policies she champions\u2014improving mental health services in immigrant communities, ensuring equitable pandemic responses\u2014will leave a tangible legacy. Personally, she dreams of finding the quiet joy she once shared with David, not in another person, but within herself. She\u2019s slowly contemplating a solo trip to trace her family\u2019s roots in Guangdong, a journey to connect her past to a future she is just beginning to imagine for herself."
