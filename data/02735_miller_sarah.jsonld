Raised in a placid Cleveland suburb by a pragmatic accountant father and a librarian mother, her choice to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History was a gentle rebellion. She dreamed of curating exhibitions, of a life surrounded by beauty and history, a stark contrast to the predictable rhythms of her Ohio upbringing. In 1997, lured by the promise of a vibrant gallery scene, she packed two suitcases and moved into a shared apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Lower Haight.\n\nShe found a job as a gallery assistant, but the dot-com bubble's collapse in 2001 decimated the city's smaller arts institutions, including hers. Facing unemployment, Sarah took a temporary secretarial job at a fledgling software company to pay the rent. It was meant to be a stopgap. Instead, she discovered an unexpected aptitude for navigating the chaotic world of tech founders. Her calm demeanor and meticulous organizational skills\u2014honed by cataloging art slides\u2014made her an indispensable anchor in the storm. The stopgap became a career. She rose through the ranks over two decades, becoming the trusted Executive Assistant to a well-known tech CEO.\n\nHer personal life mirrored the city's boom-and-bust cycles. A marriage to a graphic designer in the early 2000s ended amicably after ten years, a casualty of diverging career paths and the city\u2019s relentless pace. Her greatest victory was purchasing her Hayes Valley condominium in 2012, a tangible piece of the city she could finally call her own.\n\nNow 54, Sarah\u2019s life is contained within her immaculately organized one-bedroom condo, which doubles as her office. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her bed to her desk, where she seamlessly manages her boss\u2019s chaotic global schedule. Her days are a blur of encrypted messages and calendar Tetris, but her evenings are hers. She walks to the local market for fresh pasta, enjoys a glass of wine on her small balcony overlooking the neighborhood, and maintains a close-knit circle of friends, mostly women her age who have also weathered SF\u2019s many transformations. Her dream is no longer to curate for a gallery, but to one day retire, volunteer as a docent at SFMOMA, and finally travel to see the European masterpieces she only ever studied in books."
