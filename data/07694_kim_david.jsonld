The son of hardworking Korean grocers in Daly City, David\u2019s childhood was defined by the scent of fresh produce and the relentless pressure to transcend his parents' sacrifices. He was a focused, numbers-driven boy who saw patterns everywhere, a trait that led him to UC Berkeley for both his undergraduate studies and a Master's in Economics.\n\nHis career was a swift, calculated ascent. David joined a boutique investment firm in the 90s, distinguishing himself not with flamboyant risks, but with rigorous, data-backed analysis. The 2008 financial crisis was his crucible. While others panicked, David\u2019s stoic methodology allowed his clients to weather the storm with minimal losses, cementing his reputation and paving the way for his current role as a Senior Portfolio Manager. He now manages a discreet, high-value fund entirely from his home office, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to the autonomy he\u2019s earned.\n\nDavid\u2019s personal life bears the scars of his professional devotion. A decade-old divorce left him with this house and a somewhat distant relationship with his daughter, Elena, now a sophomore at NYU. His daily routine is spartan: up at 5:00 AM for the East Coast market open, a mid-morning run through the steep neighborhood streets, and hours of silent concentration in front of his multi-screen setup.\n\nThough he has lived in San Francisco for over two decades, he feels more like an observer than a participant. He appreciates the city\u2019s beauty through the lens of his new hobby, photography, capturing the fog rolling over Twin Peaks or the precise geometry of downtown skyscrapers. At 54, his aspirations have shifted from accumulating wealth to mending connections. He hopes to convince Elena to intern in the Bay Area next summer, dreaming of quiet dinners and bridging the years of financial reports and missed school plays. David Kim, a master of predicting market trajectories, now faces his most complex variable: finding personal fulfillment in the quiet third act of a life built on calculated success."
