The son of first-generation Korean immigrants, his childhood was a quiet study in sacrifice and expectation. His path was deviation-proof: excel in school, attend a top university, and secure a profession that promised prestige and stability. He delivered flawlessly, earning a degree from UC Berkeley before heading east for a prestigious JD/MBA dual degree.\n\nHis career began as a relentless climb up the corporate ladder of a New York financial law firm. He was brilliant, ruthless with his time, and wholly dedicated to his work. This dedication, however, cost him a serious long-term relationship and left him with a network of colleagues but few real friends. At 35, feeling the first pangs of burnout, he accepted a Managing Counsel position at a San Francisco-based fintech firm, moving into a sleek high-rise in Rincon Hill. It was a homecoming, but not to the city he remembered.\n\nThe pandemic cemented his new reality. His commute shrank from a BART ride to the ten steps between his bedroom and his ergonomic desk chair. Now, at 43, his life operates within the glass walls of his condominium. His days are a marathon of international Zoom calls, contract reviews, and risk analyses, often stretching late into the night. The lines between his office and his home have completely dissolved. Work is a constant, low-grade hum in the background of his life.\n\nThough he has achieved a level of success his parents could only dream of, David feels adrift. His connection to San Francisco is transactional\u2014the stunning Bay Bridge view from his window, the high-end takeout from Michelin-starred restaurants, the anonymity of a morning run along the Embarcadero. He nurses a quiet, almost embarrassing fantasy of leaving it all behind to open a small, independent bookstore in a quieter neighborhood like the Inner Richmond. It is a dream of a life measured not in stock performance or billable hours, but in quiet conversations and the simple weight of a book in hand."

The chemical bite of perchloroethylene clings to his clothes as he finishes his math homework. He glances up to see his mother\u2019s chapped hands expertly folding a shirt, her face a mask of tired determination. In that moment, he felt the immense weight of her sacrifice and vowed his own hands would only ever touch books and contracts. This silent promise became the unwavering blueprint for his life.\n\n2.\nThe last box was by the door of their Manhattan apartment. \"You don't have a life, David,\" she had said, her voice devoid of its usual warmth, \"you have a ledger. And I'm no longer an entry in it.\" He didn't fight her; he had a closing to prepare for. Watching the elevator doors shut on their relationship, he understood for the first time that his ruthless ambition had a price. It was a transaction that made him professionally invincible but personally bankrupt, a trade he still quietly regrets.\n\n3.\nIt was his first night in the Rincon Hill high-rise, age thirty-five. He stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, the perfect, cold geometry of the Bay Bridge lights sprawling before him. This was the view he had earned, the prize for his burnout. Yet, the overwhelming feeling wasn't triumph, but a profound and silent emptiness. The city wasn\u2019t a home welcoming him back; it was a stunning, distant landscape he had purchased. It marked the beginning of his life as a spectator in his own city.\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday night during the pandemic, around 2 AM, he finally shut his laptop. The dark screen reflected his own exhausted face superimposed over a risk-assessment matrix. Framed in the reflection was his entire world: the ergonomic chair, the corner of his unmade bed, the sleek kitchen island. The glass walls of his condo suddenly felt less like a luxury and more like a terrarium. It was the moment he realized he no longer worked from home; he lived, permanently, at the office.\n\n5.\nRestless at forty-one, he drove aimlessly until he found himself in the Inner Richmond. The fog-dampened air felt real, ancient. He parked and watched a small, cluttered bookstore, its windows warm and inviting. Through the glass, he saw the owner speak quietly with a customer, their heads bent over a paperback. It was a simple, human transaction\u2014a world away from his high-stakes deals. The fantasy of that life, a quiet existence measured in conversations, took root in him then, a secret, desperate seed."
