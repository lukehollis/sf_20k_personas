Early aptitude tests pointed towards law, but a summer internship with a local city councilman during his undergraduate years ignited a passion for public policy. This led him to pursue a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, a move that brought him to the West Coast and forever altered his trajectory.\n\nPost-graduation, Saul began his career in Oakland's city government, gaining valuable experience in urban planning and affordable housing initiatives. A pivotal moment came during a contentious debate over a proposed development project \u2013 witnessing the direct impact of policy decisions on real lives solidified his commitment to his chosen field. After a decade in Oakland, he transitioned to his current role as a Senior Policy Analyst in San Francisco's public administration, drawn by the city's unique challenges and vibrant political landscape.\n\nSaul is a creature of habit, his mornings beginning with strong coffee and the day's news before his BART commute from his Outer Sunset duplex. His work involves analyzing legislation, drafting policy recommendations, and navigating the complex bureaucracy of city hall. Weekends often involve exploring San Francisco's parks, visiting his sister and her family in the East Bay, or attending political talks and events. He retains close ties with a group of fellow Berkeley alumni and enjoys intellectual debates and lively discussions over craft beer in the Mission. While he briefly considered returning to the East Coast, the allure of San Francisco \u2013 its blend of natural beauty, progressive politics, and diverse communities \u2013 held him captive. He dreams of leading a major policy initiative that significantly impacts the quality of life for San Franciscans, perhaps tackling housing affordability or climate resilience. His hope is to leave a lasting, positive mark on the city he has come to call home."

The sheer visual beauty hit him with a force he hadn't expected, a pang of wonder that made Brooklyn feel a world away.  It was a moment of realizing this new city held its own magic, a promise of possibility. (Early in his time on the West Coast, after moving for Berkeley)\n\n2.  Sitting in a packed room at City Hall during that heated Oakland development meeting, the raw anger and fear from residents palpable, was a turning point. Witnessing the real human cost of policy decisions solidified his purpose, hardening his resolve to advocate for the vulnerable. (During his career in Oakland city government)\n\n3.  He recalled a moment on a chilly Saturday morning in Golden Gate Park, watching his niece chase seagulls near the Dutch Windmill. The simple joy on her face, against the backdrop of the ocean mist, was a quiet affirmation of the life he was building here, a sense of belonging he hadn't anticipated. (Regularly, on weekend visits to his sister's family)\n\n4.  That evening in a dimly lit Mission bar, debating housing policy with his Berkeley friends, the arguments flowing as easily as the beer. This felt like home \u2013 surrounded by sharp minds, passionate about making things better, a reminder of the intellectual camaraderie that drew him to this city and its challenges. (Occasionally, during weekend evenings)\n\n5.  Standing on Ocean Beach one evening at sunset, the vastness of the Pacific stretching before him. In that quiet moment, the anxieties of city hall faded, replaced by a sense of perspective and renewal. It was a recurring experience that grounded him, fueling his desire to create meaningful change in the city he now deeply loved. (Periodically, often after a challenging work week)"
