Raised in Scarsdale, New York, the son of a law professor and a psychiatrist, David was primed for East Coast intellectual rigor. His family envisioned a future in diplomacy or public policy. He obliged, earning a Master's in International Relations from Georgetown, his thesis a dense analysis of post-Soviet economic transitions. But the slow, bureaucratic pace of Washington D.C. grated on his impatient, analytical mind. A recruiting event on campus introduced him to the world of management consulting, and he saw a different path: faster, more lucrative, and intellectually just as demanding.\n\nHis career at a top-tier firm was a relentless two-decade grind of red-eyes and boardrooms. He became the go-to expert for legacy companies struggling to adapt to the digital age. He met his ex-wife, an art curator named Sarah, on a flight to London. They built a life together, had a daughter, and then slowly drifted apart under the strain of his 200,000-mile-a-year travel schedule. Their divorce, five years ago, was amicable but marked a profound turning point. David, now a Partner, negotiated a new role: he would keep his high-value clients but manage them entirely from a home base. He chose San Francisco, the epicenter of the industry he advised.\n\nToday, David lives in a minimalist Russian Hill condo with a commanding view of the Bay. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his espresso machine to a sound-proofed home office. His days are a disciplined sequence of Zoom calls with executives in Seoul, London, and Seattle. Evenings are quiet; he reads history, not business books, and has a weekly video call with his daughter, a sophomore at Stanford. He\u2019s a familiar face at his local coffee shop, known for his quiet demeanor and generous tips.\n\nWhile professionally fulfilled, a sense of restlessness is setting in. The view from his window feels less like a trophy and more like a gilded cage. David hopes to transition his skills away from maximizing shareholder value. He dreams of joining a non-profit board or mentoring young, mission-driven startup founders, aspiring to build a legacy that feels more tangible than a slide deck."
