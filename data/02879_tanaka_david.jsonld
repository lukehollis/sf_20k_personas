A fourth-generation Japanese American (Yonsei), he was born not in the city\u2019s fog but across the bay in Berkeley, raised by a meticulous pharmacist father and a patient teacher mother. His upbringing was a blend of Japanese diligence and Californian optimism. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable profession, David was drawn to abstract systems, graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Philosophy. This seemingly impractical choice became his secret weapon when he later pursued a Master\u2019s in Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford, allowing him to build technology that understood people, not just code.\n\nHis career began in the exhilarating chaos of the first dot-com boom. He co-founded a promising startup that, like many of its contemporaries, burned bright and then spectacularly flamed out in the 2001 crash. This failure was his most crucial lesson. Humbled, he spent the next decade working for larger, more established tech firms, honing his skills not just as an engineer, but as a leader. He learned patience, strategic foresight, and the art of building resilient teams, qualities that eventually led him to his current role as CTO for a successful mid-size AI ethics company.\n\nToday, David lives a life of curated calm in Noe Valley. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from the kitchen to his home office, a sunlit room overlooking a garden meticulously designed by his wife, Sarah, a landscape architect. He\u2019s married with two pre-teen children, and his days are structured around their rhythms\u2014a morning walk to a local caf\u00e9 for an oat latte, school drop-offs, deep work, and protected family dinners. He is deeply connected to his neighborhood, knowing the baristas and shop owners by name.\n\nHis ambition is no longer about valuation or stock options. Having seen the corrosive effects of unchecked technology, David dreams of pioneering \u201cslow tech\u201d\u2014tools that genuinely serve humanity without demanding its soul. He aspires to use his influence to mentor a new generation of engineers who prioritize ethics over engagement metrics, hoping to leave the digital world a little more thoughtful than he found it."

He watches the small, precise movements as his father counts pills, each one a tiny promise of wellness. It wasn't just an act of counting; it was a ritual of care. His father would pause, look at a name on a bottle, and his expression would soften with recognition. David learned then that behind every perfect system, every line of code, there had to be a person. It was his first, unspoken lesson in human-centered design.\n\n2.\nIt was in a sun-drenched carrel at Doe Library, deep in a text on phenomenology. A sentence about how tools shape perception clicked into place with the force of a tectonic shift. He suddenly understood: the interface *is* the experience. Years later, staring at lines of code, the memory would surface. He wasn't just building software; he was crafting a world with rules that would shape a user\u2019s reality. That Berkeley afternoon taught him that philosophy wasn't impractical; it was the ultimate user manual for building humane technology.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the smell of stale pizza and ozone from the dying servers. His co-founder sat on the floor, head in his hands. It was 2001, and their dot-com startup had evaporated. The investors' calls had stopped, the Aeron chairs repossessed. It wasn't the loss of potential millions that stung; it was the hollow shame of leading his brilliant, loyal team off a cliff. He packed his one small box, the weight of failure a physical ache. That day, humility became a permanent part of his personal source code.\n\n4.\nAround 2015, at a quarterly review for a big tech firm, he saw the engagement chart for a feature he\u2019d championed. The line went up and to the right. His boss was thrilled. But David felt a knot of dread, watching the data on how many hours users were lost in a digital loop he designed. He wasn't connecting people; he was harvesting their attention. The pride he felt curdled into responsibility. It was the moment the idea of \u201cslow tech\u201d was born\u2014not from failure, but from a hollow success.\n\n5.\nJust last summer, he stepped away from his monitor and looked into the garden. In the dappled light of the Japanese maple Sarah had planted, his daughter was showing his son a ladybug on a salvia stem. The sound of their quiet chatter was the only metric that mattered. In that moment, the frantic ambition of his past fell away, replaced by a profound sense of calm. This small, perfect ecosystem of family and nature was the true success. It was everything he was now working to protect."
