Born in San Jose to a Syrian father and a Tunisian mother, her home was a vibrant intersection of Middle Eastern and North African cultures. Her father, an engineer by trade but a metalwork artist by soul, filled their garage with delicate, hammered creations. This constant exposure to handmade beauty nurtured in Layla an innate appreciation for art not as a luxury, but as a language.\n\nShe pursued this language at UC Davis, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. While her peers chased corporate internships, Layla spent a transformative semester in Paris. Wandering the small, artist-run galleries of Le Marais, she realized her calling wasn't in sterile, monumental museums, but in the intimate spaces where new voices could be heard.\n\nUpon graduating, San Francisco\u2019s independent art scene beckoned. She landed a coveted gallery assistant position in Hayes Valley, a role that came with a rare city miracle: a small, rent-stabilized studio apartment directly above the gallery. This explains her 0.0-mile commute; her life and work occupy the same building, separated only by a flight of stairs.\n\nLayla\u2019s days are a whirlwind of tactile duties: carefully handling paintings, corresponding with temperamental artists, and helping install new exhibits. Her evenings are spent either at gallery openings, fostering connections within her tight-knit circle of fellow creatives, or sketching in her small apartment, the sounds of the city filtering through her window. Her connection to Hayes Valley is profound; she knows the baristas, the boutique owners, and the other artists who call the neighborhood home. It feels less like a city block and more like a sprawling, collaborative campus.\n\nHer ultimate dream is to one day curate her own exhibitions. She aspires to champion emerging artists from the MENA diaspora, creating a bridge between the art that adorns gallery walls and the rich, complex heritage that first taught her how to see the world. For Layla, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it\u2019s the canvas on which she is slowly, carefully, painting her future."
