Born in San Jose to a Syrian father and a Tunisian mother, her home was a vibrant intersection of Middle Eastern and North African cultures. Her father, an engineer by trade but a metalwork artist by soul, filled their garage with delicate, hammered creations. This constant exposure to handmade beauty nurtured in Layla an innate appreciation for art not as a luxury, but as a language.\n\nShe pursued this language at UC Davis, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. While her peers chased corporate internships, Layla spent a transformative semester in Paris. Wandering the small, artist-run galleries of Le Marais, she realized her calling wasn't in sterile, monumental museums, but in the intimate spaces where new voices could be heard.\n\nUpon graduating, San Francisco\u2019s independent art scene beckoned. She landed a coveted gallery assistant position in Hayes Valley, a role that came with a rare city miracle: a small, rent-stabilized studio apartment directly above the gallery. This explains her 0.0-mile commute; her life and work occupy the same building, separated only by a flight of stairs.\n\nLayla\u2019s days are a whirlwind of tactile duties: carefully handling paintings, corresponding with temperamental artists, and helping install new exhibits. Her evenings are spent either at gallery openings, fostering connections within her tight-knit circle of fellow creatives, or sketching in her small apartment, the sounds of the city filtering through her window. Her connection to Hayes Valley is profound; she knows the baristas, the boutique owners, and the other artists who call the neighborhood home. It feels less like a city block and more like a sprawling, collaborative campus.\n\nHer ultimate dream is to one day curate her own exhibitions. She aspires to champion emerging artists from the MENA diaspora, creating a bridge between the art that adorns gallery walls and the rich, complex heritage that first taught her how to see the world. For Layla, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it\u2019s the canvas on which she is slowly, carefully, painting her future."

He stopped hammering a sheet of copper and handed her a small, flawed disc he\u2019d been practicing on. The weight of it in her palm felt like a secret. It wasn't perfect, but it held the echo of his hands, his focus. In that moment, she understood that art wasn't just a thing to be looked at; it was a story you could hold.\n\n2.\nThe rain had pushed her into a hole-in-the-wall gallery in Le Marais during her semester abroad. Inside, a young painter was explaining the brushstrokes on an unstretched canvas to two viewers. The space was no bigger than her dorm room, but the conversation felt immense, vital. It was a lightning strike of clarity. She didn\u2019t want to be a historian of geniuses in cavernous museums; she wanted to be here, in the small, breathing rooms where art was still being born. This memory crystallized her professional purpose.\n\n3.\nAfter her final interview, the gallery owner jingled a second key. \u201cThe upstairs unit is rent-stabilized. It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s yours if you want it.\u201d Layla remembers the sudden, sharp intake of breath, the feeling of the city unlocking itself just for her. Standing in the empty studio for the first time, hearing the faint murmur of the gallery below, she felt an immense sense of peace. San Francisco wasn't just a city she was visiting; it was a place that was making room for her.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, a new, nervous painter was struggling with his artist statement before his first show. He kept saying the words felt hollow. Layla gently asked him about the texture of his canvases, what he felt when he mixed the colors. Seeing the relief on his face as the right words finally came, she felt a profound surge of purpose. This was more than just hanging paintings; it was helping an artist translate their language. It was the first time she truly felt like a partner in the work.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, while uncrating a piece from a new Libyan-American artist, she froze. Woven into the abstract painting was a geometric pattern that mirrored the Tunisian textiles her mother kept in a cedar chest. The scent of cardamom and home rushed back so intensely it made her dizzy. In that instant, her ambition became sharp and clear. It wasn't just about showing emerging artists; it was about creating a space where the patterns of her childhood could be celebrated on these San Francisco walls."
