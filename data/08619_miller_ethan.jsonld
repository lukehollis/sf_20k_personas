Raised in the Sacramento suburbs by a high school accounting teacher and a dental hygienist, his upbringing was stable, comfortable, and rooted in the practical. The expectation was never to chase a wild dream but to find a reliable career path. For Ethan, that path was a two-year Associate's degree in Paralegal Studies from a local community college\u2014the most efficient route he saw to a steady paycheck.\n\nHe spent four years working for a small family law firm in Sacramento, a job he found emotionally draining. The opportunity to move to San Francisco came via a recruiter for a large firm specializing in commercial real estate. The pay was better, the work was impersonal and detail-oriented\u2014a welcome change. He moved into a small one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, chosen for its proximity to Golden Gate Park over any vibrant nightlife.\n\nThe key turning point in Ethan\u2019s life was not the move itself, but the company\u2019s shift to permanent remote work in 2021. His 0.0-mile commute transformed his apartment from a home into a self-contained universe. His daily routine is now one of quiet discipline. He wakes at 7:00 AM, makes coffee, and is logged into the firm\u2019s server by 8:30, reviewing complex lease agreements and zoning documents until dusk. The city exists mostly through his window.\n\nHis social life is contained. He has a couple of friends from the old office days he meets for trivia or a hike, but dating has proven difficult; his routine-bound life doesn't lend itself to spontaneity. His connection to San Francisco is observant rather than participatory. He\u2019s the man on the park bench, not the one playing spikeball.\n\nLately, however, a quiet dissatisfaction has taken root. At 29, he wonders if this is all there is. He recently bought a used film camera and has been teaching himself photography, using his weekend walks through the Richmond and Presidio to capture foggy landscapes and architectural details. His dream is vague but growing: to one day have a life where his work feels as tangible and real as the printed photographs now filling a box under his bed. He saves his money diligently, unsure if it\u2019s for a down payment or an escape hatch."
