Growing up, he was the emotional interpreter for his family, decoding the silences of his stoic engineer father and navigating the unpredictable currents of his mother's long-undiagnosed anxiety disorder. He learned to listen for what wasn\u2019t being said, a skill that led him to a psychology degree at UC Davis and then to a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, pulling him permanently into the Bay Area's orbit.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire in the emergency department of a bustling San Francisco public hospital. There, he confronted the raw, unfiltered crises of the city: psychotic breaks, overdoses, and the quiet despair of families receiving devastating news. The work was vital but corrosive. The turning point came during the pandemic. Overwhelmed and teetering on burnout, he saw the sudden, system-wide shift to telehealth not as a temporary fix, but as a lifeline.\n\nHe transitioned to a group practice that is fully remote. Now, David\u2019s commute is the ten steps from his kitchen to the spare bedroom of his Inner Richmond apartment, which he has converted into a calm, minimalist office. His days are a meticulously scheduled series of video calls with patients from across the city. His work is still intense, but the screen provides a necessary boundary, allowing him to be fully present for his clients without being consumed by the chaotic energy of a hospital.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is now twofold. Professionally, he serves its residents struggling with trauma and mental illness. Personally, he finds solace in its geography. His mornings begin with a run through Golden Gate Park, the fog-drenched cypress trees a balm for his mind. Evenings are for quiet dinners with his partner, Clara, a landscape architect whose work creating beautiful spaces offers a welcome contrast to his own work navigating internal chaos. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s sustainable. He hopes to one day open a small, specialized private practice and, more importantly, to master the art of leaving his work behind him at the end of the day, fully embracing the peace he has so carefully constructed for himself."

David sat in the ringing silence, his fork hovering over his potatoes. He felt an invisible weight settle on his small shoulders\u2014the urgent, unspoken need to translate the quiet between them. He learned then that listening wasn\u2019t about hearing words, but about decoding the vast, lonely spaces that surrounded them. It was a skill that would become his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nThe memory is fluorescent-lit and smells of antiseptic. A teenager, barely seventeen, was being admitted after an overdose, and David had to speak with the parents. He used all his training, but the mother\u2019s raw, keening grief shattered his professional composure. Driving home over the Bay Bridge that night, he felt the city's pain clinging to him like a second skin. It was the first time he truly wondered how long he could absorb the trauma of others before he drowned in it himself. This was two years before the pandemic.\n\n3.\nIt was April 2020. He sat in his spare room, staring at a patient's face on his laptop. The conversation was raw, centered on isolation. But when he clicked \"End Meeting,\" there were no pagers, no frantic nurses\u2014only the quiet of his apartment and the soft afternoon light. He felt a profound boundary click into place. He had been fully present for his patient\u2019s pain, but now it was gone. For the first time, he saw a future where he could help without being completely consumed.\n\n4.\nOne Sunday afternoon, he watched Clara at their dining table, completely absorbed in her work. She was sketching a public garden, her pencil carving paths and planting beds onto the paper with quiet confidence. She was building a place of deliberate peace, a sanctuary. Watching her, David felt a wave of calm. Her work was the physical world's answer to his own; both were attempts to cultivate beauty amidst life's inherent chaos. He felt anchored, and deeply understood, in her presence.\n\n5.\nHe was running through Golden Gate Park just after sunrise last fall. The fog was a thick, soft blanket, muting the world to the sound of his own breathing and footfalls. As he neared Spreckels Lake, the mist parted for a single, brilliant shaft of sunlight to cut through the cypress trees, illuminating the path ahead. It felt like a benediction, a physical manifestation of clarity. In that moment, he wasn't a therapist, just a man moving through a quiet, beautiful world. It was pure peace."
