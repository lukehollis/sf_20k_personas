The only son of hardworking Cantonese immigrants, his childhood was a predictable rhythm of school, helping at his family\u2019s small grocery store, and the immense pressure to achieve a stability his parents never had. They envisioned a doctor or an engineer; David, lost in books, fell in love with the past.\n\nHe pursued this passion at UC Santa Cruz, earning a Bachelor's degree in History. Surrounded by redwoods and intellectual curiosity, he felt alive, analyzing ancient civilizations and political shifts. But graduation brought a harsh reality. A history degree, his parents fretted, wouldn\u2019t pay a San Francisco rent. Bowing to this pragmatism, David made a pivotal choice. He suppressed his passion, studied for financial certifications, and leveraged his sharp analytical skills to land a job as a financial analyst. His parents were immensely proud; David felt like he had put on a well-fitting but uncomfortable costume.\n\nNow 29, David lives a life of calculated efficiency in a modern Hayes Valley studio. The 0.0-mile commute means his bedroom corner is also his office. His days are a blur of market data, Excel models, and Zoom calls, the frenetic energy of the city merely a backdrop outside his window. He is successful, but solitary. His social life consists of occasional drinks with a few old college friends and fruitless swiping on dating apps, where \u201cFinancial Analyst\u201d feels both like a badge of honor and a misrepresentation of his soul.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is layered. He feels the pull of his family in the Sunset, the taste of home in his mother\u2019s cooking. Yet, he inhabits a different city now, one of tech wealth and transient ambition. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to escape it. He fantasizes about long, unhurried trips to Rome or Kyoto\u2014places he\u2019s only studied on a page. He hopes to one day reconcile the historian he was with the analyst he has become, perhaps finding a future where his life is guided less by market trends and more by his own heart."
