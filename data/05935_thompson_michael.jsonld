The only child of a librarian and a civil engineer, his upbringing was stable but shadowed by his mother\u2019s long battle with multiple sclerosis. From a young age, Michael became a primary emotional support, learning to navigate the complex interplay of hope, frustration, and grief that permeates a family living with chronic illness. This experience became the crucible for his future career.\n\nSeeking a world beyond the suburbs, he pursued his undergraduate degree at UC Davis before being drawn to the Bay Area\u2019s vibrant intellectual energy. He enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program, where he specialized in medical social work, feeling an undeniable pull to the hospital environments he knew so well. After graduating, he began his career at a large San Francisco hospital, providing counseling to patients and families grappling with life-altering diagnoses. The work was demanding but deeply fulfilling. The turning point came five years ago with his mother's passing, an event that, while heartbreaking, solidified his expertise in end-of-life care and bereavement counseling.\n\nToday, Michael works from the quiet of his second-floor apartment in the Inner Sunset. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a shift to telehealth that allows him to support patients across the Bay Area. His days are a sequence of video calls, his calm voice a lifeline through a screen. He lives alone, a long-term relationship having ended amicably a few years prior. To counteract the digital confinement of his work, he\u2019s become fiercely dedicated to his analog life. Mornings start with a run through Golden Gate Park, misty and cool, and weekends are for long, strenuous hikes with a small group of close friends. He is a fixture at his neighborhood coffee shop and the local bookstore.\n\nMichael\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic landmarks and more about its quiet corners. He is an anchor in the lives of others, both professionally and personally. His aspirations are not grand; he dreams of finding a better work-life balance, perhaps opening a small private practice one day, and traveling to see the fjords of Norway. He is a man who provides stability, a vital, compassionate presence in a city constantly in motion."
