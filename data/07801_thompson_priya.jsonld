Born in Berkeley to a pragmatic botanist mother from Kerala, India, and an American literature professor from Ohio, Priya grew up navigating two distinct cultural worlds. Her childhood was filled with the scent of cardamom from her mother\u2019s kitchen and the weight of classic novels from her father\u2019s study.\n\nThis blend of the practical and the poetic led her to UC Santa Cruz, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature in the mid-90s, dreaming of a life in publishing. Her early career was a string of low-paying jobs at small presses and literary magazines, a path she shared with her then-husband, a fellow idealist. They married young, fueled by shared dreams and cheap rent in a rapidly gentrifying Mission District.\n\nThe key turning point came in her late thirties. The dot-com bust, followed by a slow-burn recovery, strained their finances and their relationship, culminating in a difficult divorce. Facing single life in one of the world's most expensive cities, Priya made a pragmatic choice. She leveraged her organizational skills from publishing, earned a project management certificate, and pivoted into the tech industry. It wasn\u2019t a passion, but a means of survival that unexpectedly suited her.\n\nNow, at 49, Priya lives a life of cultivated stability in the Inner Sunset. Her commute is a 10-step walk from her kitchen to the small desk in her living room, where she coordinates software releases for a downtown tech firm. Her days are structured by Slack notifications and Zoom calls, but her solace is found in the neighborhood's foggy tranquility. She knows the baristas at the local coffee shop by name and spends weekends tending to a surprisingly ambitious container garden on her small patio.\n\nHer social circle is tight-knit: a monthly book club with friends from her pre-tech life and weekly calls with her daughter, who is now in college on the East Coast. Priya\u2019s dreams are no longer grand, but deeply personal. She harbors a quiet ambition to finally write a collection of short stories, inspired by the dualities of her own upbringing. She has found a hard-won contentment, a peace built not on youthful ideals, but on the sturdy foundation of a life she rebuilt for herself, one project timeline at a time."
