The second of two children, she became the primary emotional caretaker for her family as they navigated her mother's chronic autoimmune disease. While her father, a pragmatic accountant, managed the finances and logistics, it was Sarah who learned to decipher the complex language of pain, fear, and resilience. This early, profound experience planted the seed for her future career.\n\nDrawn to the energy and social consciousness of the city, she pursued her BA and later her Master of Social Work (MSW) at UC Berkeley. Her graduate focus was, unsurprisingly, on medical social work. Upon licensure, she landed a demanding job at UCSF\u2019s Parnassus campus, working with patients and families facing catastrophic diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. For over a decade, she thrived in the high-stakes environment, her empathy a vital tool. However, the constant exposure to trauma led to significant burnout.\n\nThe turning point came with the pandemic. The sudden shift to telehealth was a revelation. Freed from the relentless pace of the hospital and the emotional weight of its hallways, Sarah discovered a more sustainable way to practice. In 2021, she took a leap of faith, leaving the hospital to start her own private telehealth practice from the Cole Valley condo she shares with her partner, Alex, a tech product manager.\n\nNow, at 40, Sarah\u2019s 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her kitchen to her home office. Her days are structured around virtual sessions with clients, many of whom are caregivers or individuals with chronic illnesses. She finds deep satisfaction in her work, balanced by morning walks to Reverie Coffee and afternoons in Golden Gate Park with their rescue dog, Gus. Her connection to San Francisco has deepened; it's no longer just a place of work, but a community she nurtures and is nurtured by. Her dream is to launch a series of online support groups for caregivers, bringing her life's work full circle."
