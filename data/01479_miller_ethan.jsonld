Born in a homogenous Sacramento suburb to a pragmatic, white American father and a warm, community-focused Filipino mother, Ethan spent his childhood feeling like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit any picture. He was never just \"Ethan\"; he was always explained in relation to his parents' disparate backgrounds, leaving him with a persistent sense of being an outsider.\n\nThis feeling shaped his educational journey. Traditional high school felt prescriptive and slow, so he found his real education online. In the burgeoning world of early 2000s forums and coding tutorials, he discovered a meritocracy where the quality of your code mattered more than your name or face. Forsaking a university degree, he dove headfirst into the world of data, teaching himself SQL, Python, and statistical modeling. His career began with small freelance gigs, building a portfolio that showcased a raw, intuitive talent for finding narratives within numbers. This led to a junior role at a startup that valued skill over credentials, and his ascent was swift.\n\nThe move to San Francisco was a turning point. He sought the city not for its glamour, but for its anonymity. Here, his ambiguous ethnicity was the norm, not a novelty. He settled into a compact apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of grit and style mirrored his own journey. His 0.0-mile commute as a fully remote Senior Data Analyst for a FinTech firm offers a comfortable, controlled existence. His days are a disciplined cycle of coffee, code, and virtual meetings, broken up by long runs through the Panhandle or quiet afternoons working from a local cafe.\n\nNow 34, Ethan has achieved the stability he craved, but a new yearning has surfaced. His social circle is small and tight-knit, a chosen family that understands his need for both connection and solitude. He dreams of applying his skills to something with tangible impact, perhaps analyzing climate data for a nonprofit or working on urban planning projects. Ethan wants to build a life where the clear, elegant patterns he finds in data can be translated into the messier, more meaningful connections of the human world."
