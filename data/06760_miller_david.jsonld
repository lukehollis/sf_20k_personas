            "value": "David Miller\u2019s life has been a study in precision, a trait instilled in him long before he became an engineer. Born Dev Miller to immigrants from Bangalore, he was raised in Fremont amidst the hum of the first Silicon Valley boom. His parents, both software engineers, gave him the name \u201cDavid\u201d for an easier path, but he spent his youth quietly dismantling electronics, more fascinated by the tangible world of hardware and mechanics than the abstract code his parents wrote.\n\nHe pursued this passion at UC Berkeley, earning a degree in Mechanical Engineering. While his peers were swept up in the dot-com frenzy, David remained grounded, taking a job with a semiconductor company. The subsequent bust was a key turning point; it validated his belief in tangible products over speculative software. He returned to school for a Master's in Industrial Engineering, focusing on process optimization\u2014the art of making things better, faster, and more reliable. Now, as a senior manufacturing engineer for a major consumer electronics company, he designs the intricate assembly lines that bring flagship products to life.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the life he\u2019s built. David works from a meticulously organized home office in his Outer Richmond apartment. His days are disciplined: a pre-dawn walk in the fog near Sutro Heights, focused work from 8 AM to 5 PM, and evenings spent either cooking complex recipes or on video calls with his small, tight-knit circle of friends from college. A serious long-term relationship ended five years ago, a quiet casualty of two partners whose ambitions slowly diverged, leaving David even more dedicated to his structured life.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t in the city\u2019s chaotic, vibrant core, but in its quiet, foggy edges. He finds peace in the predictable roar of the ocean and the muted colors of the western neighborhoods. His dream isn't to found a startup, but to achieve a different kind of perfection: to one day design and build a complex mechanical chronograph from scratch, a purely personal project of logic and beauty. For David, mastery of the process has always been the ultimate goal."
