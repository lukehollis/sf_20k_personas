Born in San Jose to Nisei parents who carried the silent weight of their family\u2019s internment, Aiko grew up in a home where love was expressed through action, not words. The unspoken grief that permeated her childhood became the driving force of her life\u2019s work: to give voice to the experiences people couldn't name. This led her to pursue a Master of Social Work (MSW) at San Francisco State University after completing her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career was forged in the emotionally charged environment of UCSF Medical Center, where she worked with patients and families navigating catastrophic illness and loss. For two decades, she was on the front lines, helping people through their darkest moments. However, the relentless pace and the secondary trauma took a toll. The turning point came a decade ago, after a particularly grueling year. Seeking a more sustainable and profound connection with her clients, Aiko left the hospital system to open her own private practice.\n\nNow fifty, Aiko lives and works from her quiet Edwardian flat in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her kitchen to a sun-drenched back room converted into a serene office, where she conducts telehealth sessions. Divorced amicably years ago, her life is grounded in a small, tight circle of friends and her weekly pottery class. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: a foggy morning walk in Golden Gate Park with her scruffy terrier, a schedule of clients grappling with anxiety and trauma, and quiet evenings spent reading and tending to her collection of bonsai trees\u2014a hobby connecting her to the patience and care her father taught her.\n\nAiko\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of deep, layered history. She sees the city\u2019s resilience mirrored in her own family\u2019s story and in the strength of her clients. Her future aspirations are not about expansion, but depth. She dreams of mentoring young therapists of color and starting a support group for adult children of immigrants, helping a new generation find the language for their own unspoken histories."

Her father, face a mask of concentration, methodically snipped at a juniper bonsai. \"Why do you do that?\" she'd asked. He didn\u2019t answer, but paused and gently guided her small finger along a newly exposed branch. In that silent touch, she felt the weight of generations\u2014a lesson in patience, care, and shaping life around old wounds. It was the first time she understood that the most important things are often left unsaid.\n\n2.  In her first year at UCSF, she sat with a teenager who\u2019d received a devastating diagnosis. For an hour, the girl stared at the wall, a fortress of silence. Aiko just sat, breathing with her. Finally, the girl whispered, \"My mom won't look at me anymore.\" In that one cracked-open sentence, Aiko felt the immense privilege of her work: not to fix, but to witness. The hospital\u2019s chaos faded, and her purpose sharpened into a single, quiet point of connection. It anchored her for the next twenty years.\n\n3.  She remembers the cold stillness of the UCSF parking garage at 10 PM. A beloved patient, one she\u2019d worked with for years, had died that afternoon. Aiko sat in her car, keys in her hand, unable to turn the ignition. The accumulated grief of two decades felt like a physical weight pressing on her chest, a phantom limb of others\u2019 losses. It wasn't just exhaustion; it was a profound hollowing out. In that moment, at forty, she knew she had to leave to build a different kind of vessel.\n\n4.  The day they divided their library was the day her marriage truly ended. There was no shouting, only the soft sound of books being placed into separate boxes. She held a worn copy of a favorite novel, and he met her eyes with a small, sad smile of shared history. It wasn't a failure, but a gentle closing. The quiet respect in that room taught her that an ending didn't have to be a rupture; it could be a quiet acknowledgment that their stories were now meant for different shelves.\n\n5.  Just last Tuesday, at her pottery class, the vase she was throwing collapsed into a lump of wet clay. A flicker of frustration, then calm. She scraped it off the wheel, the slick earth cool against her hands. After a day spent holding space for trauma through a screen, the simple, tangible act of starting over felt like a prayer. In that small studio, with the smell of wet clay in the air, she wasn't a therapist or a daughter of history\u2014she was just Aiko, centering herself."
