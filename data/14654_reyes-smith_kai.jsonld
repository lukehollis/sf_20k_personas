The son of a Native Hawaiian father who worked as a Muni mechanic and a second-generation Filipina-American mother who was a nurse, Kai grew up steeped in the values of *ohana* (family) and community service. His hyphenated name was a map of his heritage, a blend he navigated daily. The family home was a lively hub of cousins, aunties, and uncles, filled with the scent of adobo and the sound of his father\u2019s ukulele.\n\nA key turning point came when Kai was 16: his father died suddenly from a heart attack. The loss was immense, but observing how his community rallied around his family planted a seed. He saw the power of collective support in the face of trauma and decided to dedicate his life to providing that same scaffold for others.\n\nHe attended San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree, staying close to home, before earning his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Kai works at a community health clinic in the Mission District that partners with local high schools. He specializes in adolescent mental health, guiding teens through the turbulent waters of anxiety, depression, and identity formation, seeing echoes of his younger self in many of their struggles.\n\nKai\u2019s daily routine is a portrait of grounded city life. He leaves his cozy Inner Sunset apartment, which he shares with his partner of ten years, Jordan, a landscape architect, and catches the N Judah streetcar for his 3.8-mile commute. The ride is his time to decompress, listening to podcasts before diving into a day of intense emotional labor. Evenings often involve cooking with Jordan, long walks through Golden Gate Park, or quiet nights in.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and nuanced. He\u2019s not a transplant chasing a dream; he\u2019s part of the city\u2019s foundational fabric. He mourns the loss of old businesses but finds hope in the resilience of its communities. Kai\u2019s ultimate dream is to one day open a small, culturally-competent private practice with a few colleagues, creating a dedicated space for AAPI youth to find healing. For now, he finds fulfillment in his daily work, a quiet but powerful force of compassion in the city that raised him."

Inside, it was warm with the smell of his mother\u2019s adobo and the sound of his father\u2019s calloused, grease-stained fingers plucking a cheerful tune on his ukulele. In that moment, surrounded by family, the world felt perfectly safe and whole. It cemented his understanding of *ohana* not as an idea, but as a tangible warmth that could hold back the cold, a feeling he would spend his life trying to recreate for others.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, in the quiet, surreal week after his father\u2019s funeral, he remembers watching his Tio Manny wordlessly fix the leaky faucet his dad was supposed to get to. The kitchen counter was covered in food brought by neighbors and aunties. No one asked what was needed; they just showed up. In his grief, he felt a powerful, invisible net being woven around his family by their community. That silent act of care planted the seed: he knew then his life's work would be helping to weave those nets.\n\n***\n\n3.\nDuring his undergrad at SF State, he saw a mechanic get on the N Judah, his uniform bearing the same Muni patch his dad used to wear. The breath caught in his throat, a familiar pang of loss. But it was followed by a wave of intense pride and connection. His father helped keep this city moving; he was part of its mechanical heart. The daily commute became a ritual, a quiet acknowledgment of his roots and the enduring legacy of his father\u2019s labor etched into the city's very tracks.\n\n***\n\n4.\nA few years ago at the Mission clinic, a withdrawn 15-year-old boy, after weeks of heavy silence, finally looked at his own hands and whispered, \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m disappointing everyone.\u201d Kai saw his own teenage self so clearly in that room. He didn\u2019t offer a solution; he just nodded and held the space, letting the confession breathe. That fragile moment of trust, of being allowed to witness that pain without judgment, felt more real and validating than any diploma. It was the entire reason he was there.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a recent Tuesday evening, after a draining day, he and Jordan were walking through Golden Gate Park. The light was golden through the cypress trees, and Jordan's hand was a warm, solid presence in his. They walked in comfortable silence, a shared language they had built over a decade. In that quiet moment, Kai felt the perfect balance\u2014the intense empathy his work demanded and the restorative peace of the life he had built. This simple, grounded joy was the foundation that made everything else possible."
