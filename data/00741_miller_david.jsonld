Raised in a stable, middle-class suburb of Columbus, Ohio, David was the son of a practical engineer and a reserved librarian. They instilled in him a strong work ethic but were baffled when he chose to major in Philosophy at the University of Michigan. For four years, he was alive with intellectual curiosity, debating ethics and metaphysics, convinced he could build a life of the mind.\n\nThe reality of post-graduate life was a harsh awakening. With student loans looming and few prospects, David's innate pragmatism waged a war with his idealism, and pragmatism won. In a key turning point, he took night classes to earn a financial certification and leveraged his analytical mind to land an entry-level job during the dot-com boom. He moved to San Francisco in 2005, chasing opportunity after the first bubble burst, and methodically built a successful career as a financial analyst in the burgeoning tech sector. The demanding career cost him a long-term relationship in his early thirties, a loss that solidified his retreat into his work.\n\nNow, at 44, David\u2019s days are marked by a disciplined solitude. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to his standing desk. The stock market\u2019s opening bell is his alarm clock, and his social interactions are largely confined to Slack channels and Zoom calls. He breaks up the day with a solitary walk to a local caf\u00e9 for a cortado or a weekend hike in the Marin Headlands, observing the city\u2019s vibrant energy from a comfortable distance.\n\nThough he has achieved the financial security his parents prized, a familiar restlessness has returned. The philosophical questions from his youth echo in the quiet of his apartment. David dreams of eventually leaving the relentless churn of finance, perhaps to mentor young entrepreneurs or even write a book exploring the intersection of technology and ethics. He has mastered the language of numbers and risk, but he now aspires to rediscover the language of meaning he left behind in Michigan decades ago."
