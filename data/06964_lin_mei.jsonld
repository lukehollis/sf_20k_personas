The only child of immigrants from Guangdong, she grew up behind the counter of her parents' small corner grocery store. It was there she received her first education in human struggle, quietly observing the neighborhood families who wrestled with unspoken anxieties, financial stress, and the invisible weight of starting over in a new country. She was a dutiful daughter, expected to pursue a stable, lucrative career, but the silent dramas of the corner store shaped a different path.\n\nA key turning point came in her late teens when a neighboring family, friends of her parents, faced a mental health crisis that the community had no language or resources for. Feeling utterly helpless, Mei realized her calling was not in business or tech, but in bridging these gaps. She pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and went on to earn a Master of Social Work, focusing on clinical practice in healthcare settings.\n\nToday, at 38, Mei is a Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital system. The pandemic shifted her role entirely to telehealth, transforming her modest Inner Sunset apartment into both a sanctuary and an office, hence her 0.0-mile commute. Her days are a structured rotation of intense, confidential video calls where she supports patients and their families navigating devastating diagnoses, end-of-life decisions, and the disorienting maze of the medical system.\n\nHer life is intentionally quiet. Mornings begin with a walk in the misty expanse of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to ground herself before absorbing the day's trauma. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting mainly of a few trusted friends who understand the emotional demands of her work. Her connection to San Francisco is rooted not in its trendy restaurants or nightlife, but in the muted palette of the fog, the resilience of its diverse communities, and the simple comfort of knowing she can find authentic dim sum just a few blocks away. Her deepest aspiration is to eventually open a small, private practice in her neighborhood, offering culturally competent, sliding-scale therapy\u2014a dream not of wealth, but of sustainable healing for her community and for herself."
