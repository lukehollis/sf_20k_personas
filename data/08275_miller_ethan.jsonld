Born in Fremont, he was the embodiment of his parents\u2019 union: a pragmatic, second-generation white American father from Ohio, and a first-generation Chinese-American mother who instilled in him a deep respect for both tradition and ambition. His childhood was a blend of Midwestern practicality and the vibrant, unspoken expectations of an immigrant community. While his father taught him to build things and solve problems logically, his mother ensured he excelled academically and never forgot the language and culture of her heritage.\n\nThis duality defined his educational path. Instead of diving headfirst into computer science like many of his Bay Area peers, Ethan pursued a Bachelor's in Economics at UC Davis. He was drawn to the stories hidden within systems and human behavior, not just the code that powered them. The turning point came during a junior year internship at a small marketing firm. Tasked with analyzing customer engagement data, he discovered a passion for unearthing narratives from raw numbers. Data became his language\u2014a way to translate messy, unpredictable human choices into elegant, actionable insights. Upon graduating, he secured a remote position as a Data Analyst for a San Francisco-based fintech company.\n\nNow, Ethan\u2019s world is contained within the walls of his Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bed to his desk. His days are a disciplined routine of coffee from a local cafe, focused work sprints analyzing financial trends, and a late afternoon run through the Panhandle to clear his head. He chose Hayes Valley specifically to combat the isolation of remote work; the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant energy, with its boutiques, beer gardens, and proximity to the symphony, serves as a constant invitation back into the physical world.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight-knit circle of college friends and a few work colleagues he\u2019s met at quarterly in-person events. While professionally successful, Ethan aspires to more than just optimizing algorithms. He dreams of eventually leading a data ethics team, ensuring that the models shaping financial futures are built on principles of fairness and transparency\u2014a perfect fusion of his father\u2019s pragmatism and the human-centric values instilled by his mother. He seeks connection, both in the patterns he finds at work and in the city he intentionally chose to call home."
