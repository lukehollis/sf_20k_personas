            "value": "Meera Wong has never ticked a single box for 'Race/Ethnicity' on a form. To her, the labels felt like ill-fitting garments. Born to a pragmatic, second-generation Chinese-American father from the Sunset District and a vibrant, artistic mother who immigrated from Mumbai, Meera grew up in a home filled with the scent of both congee and cardamom. She was a child of San Francisco\u2019s cultural confluence, feeling fully a part of everything and beholden to nothing. This refusal to be categorized would become a quiet theme in her life.\n\nWhile her peers obsessed over college applications, Meera felt a growing anxiety about the prescribed path of lectures, dorms, and debt. The pressure felt disconnected from an authentic life. In a pivotal act of self-determination, she opted out, instead earning a financial services certificate from City College. It was a practical choice, influenced by her father, that landed her a stable job. Now, she works as a financial assistant for a small, old-fashioned wealth management firm, a place so un-tech it feels like a relic. Her commute is nonexistent; her office is a tidy desk in the corner of her Nob Hill studio apartment.\n\nMeera\u2019s days are a study in solitary routine. She wakes, logs into a world of spreadsheets and client accounts, and breaks for a walk to a familiar cafe. The 0.0-mile commute offers freedom but fosters a deep isolation. Her social life consists of a tight-knit group of high school friends, and she often feels like an observer of the city\u2019s bustling energy rather than a participant. She sees the vibrant nightlife from her window but rarely feels compelled to join.\n\nHer quiet life, however, fuels a powerful dream. Every dollar she meticulously saves is a step toward a different future. The finance job isn't a career; it's a launchpad. Meera dreams of buying a one-way ticket and traveling for a year, to explore India and China on her own terms, to find the pieces of her heritage that exist outside her parents' stories. She wants to trade financial security for genuine experience, hoping to finally connect the disparate parts of herself and discover a new box to tick: her own."
