Born in Seoul and adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish couple from Marin County, his upbringing was a comfortable blend of suburban American life and cultural traditions that were lovingly shared but never quite his own. He was the Asian kid with the Jewish last name, a hyphenated identity that fostered a profound sense of empathy for anyone who felt like an outsider.\n\nThis feeling guided him to San Francisco State University. While his parents hoped for a more lucrative path, a volunteer position at a youth shelter became his turning point. He saw his own quiet search for belonging mirrored in the faces of teens navigating the foster care system. It was there he found his purpose, switching his major to Social Work and dedicating himself to understanding the systems that both fail and save people. Upon graduating, he landed a demanding role as a case manager at a community health clinic.\n\nNow 25, Adam\u2019s life is defined by service and sacrifice. His $68,000 salary makes life in the city a constant negotiation, but the work is his anchor. His days are a blur of client meetings, navigating bureaucratic red tape for people facing homelessness, addiction, and mental health crises. The 3.1-mile Muni ride from his shared Inner Richmond apartment is a time for mental preparation in the morning and decompression in the evening, watching the city\u2019s diverse population move around him.\n\nLife outside of work is simple: cheap, delicious meals with a tight-knit group of friends on Clement Street, foggy morning runs in Golden Gate Park, and weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands, a nod to his childhood home. His personal relationships are deep but few; the emotional toll of his job leaves little energy for casual dating. San Francisco, with its chaotic energy and acceptance of myriad identities, feels like the only place he could truly be himself.\n\nAdam's ambitions are not financial. He is diligently saving for a Master of Social Work (MSW) program, hoping to eventually influence policy. Deeper still is a quiet dream to one day visit South Korea, not to search for his birth family, but to connect with the first chapter of his own story."

A friend\u2019s father knelt down, smiling. \u201cSo, where are you *really* from?\u201d Adam said, \u201cHere,\u201d but the man just laughed. \u201cNo, I mean your family.\u201d In that moment, the world tilted. He saw the invisible line between himself and everyone else. It wasn't malice, just a casual othering that planted a seed of quiet observation in him, a protective empathy for anyone else who stood on the outside of a circle, looking in.\n\n2.\nIt was his sophomore year at SF State, volunteering at the youth shelter. A 16-year-old girl, recently aged out of her foster home, asked him blankly about his parents. When Adam mentioned being adopted, her tough exterior cracked. \u201cSo you get it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot knowing.\u201d The shared vulnerability felt more real than any lecture. He saw his own quiet search reflected in her eyes. The next day, he walked straight to the registrar's office and officially changed his major to Social Work.\n\n3.\nTwo months ago, he finally secured a housing voucher for a client he'd worked with for a year. They\u2019d celebrated with vending machine coffee. A week later, he saw her on the 38 Geary, her belongings in a trash bag, the light gone from her eyes. A paperwork error had disqualified her. The failure felt like a physical blow, a cold fury rising in his chest. It was then his ambition crystallized: helping one person wasn't enough. He had to learn how to fight the system itself.\n\n4.\nLast Sunday, on a run through Golden Gate Park, the fog was so thick it swallowed sound. He was just a pair of lungs, a heartbeat, a shape moving through the grey. No name, no history, no questions to answer. For a few miles, he wasn't a social worker or an adoptee. He was simply part of the city\u2019s quiet, breathing organism. This feeling of anonymous belonging was the anchor that made the financial struggle of living here worth it; a peace he couldn't find anywhere else.\n\n5.\nHe was 24, sharing a steaming pot of budae-jjigae with friends on Clement Street. Laughter filled their booth, but his gaze drifted to a nearby family\u2014three generations speaking Korean. He felt a phantom ache, a connection to a language he didn't know and a culture he only knew through food. It wasn\u2019t sadness, but a sudden, clear resolve. The vague idea of visiting Seoul became a concrete need, not to find anyone, but to stand in the place where his story began, just to feel its air."
