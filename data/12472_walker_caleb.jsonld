Raised in Modesto by a mechanic father and a school administrative assistant mother, life was defined by the necessity of a car. Their family\u2019s single, often-repaired sedan was a lifeline, and Caleb witnessed firsthand how transportation dictated opportunity. A high school field trip to San Francisco was a revelation; the sight of streetcars, buses, and BART trains weaving a web of connection through the city planted a seed. He saw a system, however imperfect, that offered freedom from the tyranny of car ownership.\n\nThis newfound passion guided him to a local community college, where he earned an Associate's degree in Public Administration. It was a practical, affordable choice that felt more authentic to him than a traditional four-year university experience. Armed with his degree, he moved to San Francisco, finding a room in a crowded but lively apartment in the Mission District. He started as an intern at the SFMTA, his enthusiasm for public works making up for his lack of a prestigious degree. Within two years, his diligence and practical knowledge earned him a promotion to Program Aide.\n\nNow, Caleb\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric he works to maintain. His day begins not with a frustrating search for parking, but with a short walk to the J-Church line. The 1.7-mile commute to his office near City Hall is a daily field study where he observes passenger flow and system efficiency. Evenings are often spent with his girlfriend, Maya, a landscape architecture student he met at a volunteer park cleanup day. They explore the city on foot, debating the merits of protected bike lanes and frequenting the taquerias on Valencia Street.\n\nCaleb\u2019s dreams are as pragmatic as he is. He\u2019s taking night classes online to complete his Bachelor's degree, hoping to eventually become a transit planner. He doesn\u2019t aspire to a corner office but to a desk where he can help design a more equitable and efficient bus route for a neighborhood like the one he grew up in. For Caleb, improving San Francisco\u2019s public transit isn\u2019t just a job; it\u2019s a tangible way to build the kind of city he once dreamed of from afar."

He was 16, on a high school field trip, watching the gripmen muscle the car around on its wooden plate. In Modesto, movement meant hunting for keys and praying the engine would start. Here, the city itself felt like a living machine, a network of shared pathways carrying everyone forward. It wasn't just transit; it was a promise of a different kind of life. That day, his future clicked into place on that track.\n\n2.\nHis first morning as an SFMTA intern, he stood at the 20th and Church J-Church stop, clutching his messenger bag. The air was cool, smelling of mist and roasting coffee. When the rattling streetcar appeared, his heart hammered not with anxiety, but with a profound sense of arrival. This wasn't a tourist ride; it was his commute. Every lurch and stop on the way to City Hall felt like a handshake with the city, sealing the deal he'd made with his teenage self years ago.\n\n3.\nTwo years into his internship, his supervisor called him in. He expected another assignment, but instead she offered him the Program Aide position. \"Your name comes up, Caleb. You see things other people don't.\" He felt a hot rush of pride that quieted the persistent fear that his community college degree wasn't enough. In that small, cluttered office, he wasn't just an intern anymore. He was a part of the engine, and he had earned his place through sheer diligence.\n\n4.\nHe met Maya while yanking invasive ivy in Golden Gate Park. They were both volunteers, hands dirty with soil. He made a clumsy joke about the park's pedestrian circulation, and she laughed, launching into a passionate defense of meandering paths versus direct routes. He saw in her the same love for the city\u2019s bones that he felt for its veins and arteries. It was a simple, sun-drenched Saturday, but it was the moment his personal and professional passions fused into a shared, joyful future.\n\n5.\nLast fall, he saw an elderly woman sitting on a new bench at a bus shelter in the Excelsior, a project he\u2019d helped push through. She was out of the wind, her grocery bags resting beside her. No one knew he\u2019d spent weeks on the paperwork for that simple addition. But watching her rest, seeing the relief on her face, felt more rewarding than any promotion. It was the quiet, tangible proof that his work wasn't about schedules or maps, but about dignity."
