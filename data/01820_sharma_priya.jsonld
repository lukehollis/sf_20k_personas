Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents who sacrificed everything for stability, her childhood was a roadmap to a lucrative career in tech or medicine. The pressure was immense, a constant undercurrent in their loving but demanding home. Priya, however, was always more drawn to people's hidden struggles than to code or chemical formulas. The turning point came during her undergraduate years at UC Davis, where she volunteered for a teen crisis hotline. Hearing the raw vulnerability in young voices, she knew she couldn\u2019t pursue a life insulated from the messy, urgent needs of others.\n\nDefying her family\u2019s hopes, she pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. The city, with its vibrant, chaotic energy and stark contrasts of wealth and poverty, felt more like home than the manicured suburbs ever did. Upon graduating, she took a position as a school social worker at a public middle school in the Mission District. That was nine years ago.\n\nNow 37, Priya\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric of her neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her rent-controlled apartment to the school two blocks away. Her days are a whirlwind of mediating conflicts, connecting families with resources, and being a steadfast presence for students navigating everything from academic pressure to housing instability. She knows the names of the baristas at her local coffee shop, the family who runs the corner market, and which of her students need an extra snack without having to ask.\n\nHer social life is small but deep, centered around a few close friends\u2014a teacher, a nurse, and a legal aid lawyer\u2014who share her dedication and understand the emotional toll of their work. Her relationship with her parents has softened into a respectful understanding; they see her happiness, even if they still worry about her finances. Priya dreams not of wealth, but of impact. Her current aspiration is to secure grant funding for a full-time, bilingual therapist at her school. She hopes to one day feel she has built something lasting for her community, a legacy of support that remains long after she\u2019s gone. Priya's connection to San Francisco isn't about its landmarks; it's about the kids she champions every single day, right in the heart of the neighborhood she calls home."
