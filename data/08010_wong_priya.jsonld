The daughter of a second-generation Chinese-American father from the Sunset District and a mother who immigrated from Mumbai, Priya grew up in a home filled with the aromas of both soy sauce and cardamom. She was the quiet observer, the bridge between her father\u2019s stoic family histories and her mother\u2019s vibrant, lyrical tales of India. This duality instilled in her a deep fascination with the underlying patterns of human behavior.\n\nThis curiosity led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Cognitive Science, a perfect blend of psychology, data, and linguistics. She was drawn not just to the what, but the *why*. Upon graduating, she seamlessly entered San Francisco\u2019s tech industry as a data analyst. She found a strange comfort in spreadsheets and databases, seeing them not as cold numbers, but as a mosaic of human desires, choices, and stories waiting to be told.\n\nHer life is now centered in her small, light-filled apartment in the Mission District. With a 0.0-mile commute, her living room doubles as her office, the line between work and life perpetually blurred. A key turning point was a post-college trip to Mumbai to visit her maternal family, an experience that profoundly deepened her connection to her Indian heritage. It was a stark, beautiful contrast to the fog-laced avenues of her father\u2019s San Francisco.\n\nPriya\u2019s routine is a modern SF clich\u00e9 she has fully embraced: pour-over coffee in the morning, a lunchtime walk for a burrito on Valencia Street, and evenings spent either at a climbing gym or sharing a bottle of wine with her tight-knit circle of college friends. She navigates the city by bike, feeling its pulse in the steep hills and diverse neighborhoods.\n\nHer dream is to eventually pivot from pure data analysis to user experience research, where she can more directly engage with the human stories behind the metrics. She aspires to use her unique bicultural perspective to build more empathetic technology, ensuring the products she works on reflect a world as complex and multifaceted as her own name."
