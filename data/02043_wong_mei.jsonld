The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the apartment above her parents\u2019 small, bustling grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American aspiration, defined by the constant hum of the store, the weight of parental expectation, and the responsibility of being the family\u2019s primary English speaker from a young age.\n\nThe turning point that shaped her career came not in a classroom, but in a sterile hospital waiting room. When her grandmother fell ill, Mei Lin, then a teenager, witnessed her family\u2019s struggle to navigate the intimidating healthcare system. It was a compassionate, bilingual social worker who finally bridged the cultural and linguistic gap, offering comfort and advocacy. In that moment, Mei Lin saw her future. Forsaking her parents\u2019 dreams of her becoming a doctor or lawyer, she pursued a path of service, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, Mei Lin\u2019s commute has been zero miles. She lives on-site as the lead clinical social worker at a supportive housing facility for low-income seniors in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood. Her work is her life, and her residents are her extended family. Her days are a demanding cycle of crisis intervention, benefits navigation, and simply listening to the stories of lives lived.\n\nHer own social life is small but deeply valued: a weekly dim sum lunch with her now-widowed father in the Richmond, and a monthly book club with two other social workers who understand the emotional toll of their profession. As she enters her fifties, Mei Lin doesn't dream of retirement or travel. Her aspiration is more immediate: securing a grant to build a rooftop garden for her residents, a small patch of green and calm amid the city\u2019s concrete. Her connection to San Francisco is no longer just her childhood home; it is in the lives she touches daily, a quiet, profound commitment to the city\u2019s most vulnerable souls."
