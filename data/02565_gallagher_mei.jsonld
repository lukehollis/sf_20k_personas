            "value": "Mei Gallagher is a product of San Francisco\u2019s unique cultural fusion. Born in the Inner Richmond to a fiercely proud Irish-American poet father and a pragmatic first-generation Chinese-American mother who worked in finance, her childhood was a vibrant, often contradictory, blend of worlds. Her father filled their foggy row house with books, music, and the smell of oil paints, teaching her that beauty was life\u2019s highest purpose. Her mother instilled in her a formidable work ethic, emphasizing structure, planning, and the quiet power of a well-managed ledger.\n\nThis duality defined Mei\u2019s path. While she inherited her father\u2019s artistic soul, she possessed her mother\u2019s organizational mind. She pursued Art History at UC Berkeley but found herself more fascinated by the logistics of art than its theory. A pivotal moment came during an internship at a small gallery where a brilliant exhibition was nearly derailed by poor planning. She realized her true calling wasn't to create art, but to build the vessel that carries it to the world. This led her to a Master\u2019s in Museum Studies from New York University, a practical degree that finally synthesized the two halves of her heritage.\n\nShe returned to San Francisco and began her career, working her way up from a junior coordinator to her current role as Senior Exhibition Manager. Her life is deeply entwined with her work, a fact evidenced by her SoMa apartment which sits just across the plaza from the museum. Her days are a whirlwind of budgets, lighting designs, artist negotiations, and the controlled chaos of installation week. Her social life revolves around this world\u2014gallery openings, donor dinners, and late-night drinks with fellow curators and artists.\n\nAt 39, Mei is at the peak of her profession, respected for her sharp eye and unflappable demeanor. Her deepest aspiration is to curate a groundbreaking retrospective for a forgotten 20th-century female artist, giving a powerful voice the platform it was denied. She still sees the city through her father\u2019s romantic eyes but navigates it with her mother\u2019s strategic precision. For Mei, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's the grand, evolving exhibition she manages every day."
