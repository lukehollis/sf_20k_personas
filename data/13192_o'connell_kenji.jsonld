Raised in Berkeley by his Irish-American father, a history professor, and his Japanese mother, a masterful ikebana artist, his childhood home was a unique fusion of Western intellectualism and Eastern aesthetics. Books on Celtic mythology shared shelves with scrolls of haikus, creating a household where narrative and visual harmony were equally valued. This environment cultivated Kenji's keen eye for storytelling through objects and space.\n\nInitially pursuing a business degree, Kenji felt a profound disconnect. A turning point came during a visit to the de Young Museum, where an immersive installation on textile art sparked an epiphany. He realized his passion lay not in spreadsheets, but in crafting compelling environments that guide human experience. He pivoted, pursuing an MFA in Museum & Exhibition Design, where he learned to orchestrate emotion and information within a physical space.\n\nUpon graduating, Kenji found the corporate world surprisingly receptive. He saw modern retail not as a store, but as a gallery\u2014a space to curate a brand\u2019s story. He began as a junior designer, and his unique talent for transforming soulless commercial floors into engaging, narrative-driven destinations led to his rapid ascent. Now, as a Director of Brand Experience, he shapes how thousands of people interact with a major retail brand daily.\n\nKenji lives in a meticulously curated apartment in Hayes Valley. His 3.8-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa office is a cherished daily ritual, a mental buffer between his serene home and his demanding job. He maintains a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other creative professionals, meeting for drinks at Anina or catching shows at SFJAZZ. Though professionally fulfilled and financially secure, he yearns to apply his skills to a project with deeper personal meaning. His ultimate dream is to one day design a museum exhibit himself\u2014perhaps one exploring the Japanese-American experience in California, a tribute to the quiet, artistic world his mother gave him."

She said nothing, her focus absolute as she trimmed a camellia branch. With a quiet snip, she placed it in the kenzan, creating a perfect, asymmetrical line against the wall. It wasn't just flower arranging; it was a silent lesson in telling a story with space and absence. It was the first time he understood that beauty was an argument, and he wanted to learn its language.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, adrift in his business major, he walked into a Ruth Asawa exhibit at the de Young. He stood mesmerized beneath her complex, woven wire sculptures. It wasn't the objects themselves that struck him, but the way they interacted with the light, casting intricate, secondary-weavings of shadow on the gallery walls. He felt a visceral click of understanding\u2014that this, orchestrating a viewer's path and perception, was a real job. He changed his major the following week, feeling like he\u2019d finally come home.\n\n3.\nHis first big solo project as a junior designer, around age twenty-seven. He\u2019d argued for a radically minimalist layout for a new store, stripping away fixtures to create a central, gallery-like space. His director was skeptical. On opening night, Kenji watched not the sales, but the shoppers. He saw them pause, walk the perimeter, touch the textures of the walls, and truly *look*. They were interacting with the environment, not just the product. It was quiet vindication that proved his core belief: a space could tell a more compelling story than any price tag.\n\n4.\nBiking home last fall, the day a massive project launched. The frantic energy of his SoMa office was still buzzing in his veins. As he pedaled down Page Street\u2019s \u201cWiggle,\u201d the evening air cooled his face. He passed the painted ladies, the neighborhood gardens, the quiet hum of Hayes Valley life taking over. It was a physical shedding of a corporate skin. He realized the 3.8-mile ride wasn\u2019t just a commute; it was a vital, meditative airlock protecting his carefully curated peace from his demanding professional world.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, on a solo trip to the Japanese American National Museum in L.A. He stood before a recreated barrack from Manzanar. It was stark, cramped, and painfully silent. He was an expert at creating evocative brand worlds, yet here was the most important story of his heritage, told with crushing simplicity. A profound ache settled in his chest\u2014a feeling of both immense pride and personal responsibility. His ambition, once a vague dream, sharpened into a clear, urgent need to apply his skills to a story that truly mattered."
