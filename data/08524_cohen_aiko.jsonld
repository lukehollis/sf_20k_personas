Born in Daly City to a Japanese immigrant mother, a meticulous Ikebana artist, and a Jewish-American father, a charismatic history professor at SF State, Aiko\u2019s childhood was a quiet blend of Shinto shrines and Shabbat dinners. She was a contemplative child, more comfortable observing than participating, a trait that would define much of her life.\n\nHer educational journey was practical rather than passionate. She enrolled at SF State, vaguely pursuing a degree in liberal arts, but her path was cut short. When her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, Aiko left school without a second thought to become her primary caregiver. To make ends meet, she took a temp job as a receptionist at a downtown financial firm. The temporary role, however, became permanent. Over two decades, she proved herself indispensable, her quiet competence and organizational skills making her the bedrock of her department. She never finished her degree, but she built a career.\n\nA brief, ill-fated marriage in her late twenties was a key turning point, reinforcing her innate self-reliance. Without children, her life became a curated space of her own making. The pandemic was another pivot; her firm went fully remote, erasing her commute and anchoring her life entirely within her Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nNow, at fifty, Aiko\u2019s days follow a gentle rhythm. She starts with green tea, logs into work from a small desk overlooking a foggy street, and breaks for lunch with a walk to a bakery on Clement Street or a stroll through Golden Gate Park. Her social circle is small but deep: a bi-weekly book club with other women her age and dinners with a colleague who became her closest friend. She is a fixture in her neighborhood, known by the local grocers and librarians.\n\nAiko\u2019s dream is not grand but deeply personal. In her spare time, she practices Kintsugi, the art of mending broken pottery with gold-dusted lacquer. She sees a metaphor for her own life in it\u2014the breaks and interruptions not as flaws, but as part of a history that creates a more resilient, unique beauty. Her quiet aspiration is to one day have a small studio, to spend her days mending what is broken for others, finding wholeness in the fractures."
