Born in Daly City to a second-generation Japanese American father and a Punjabi immigrant mother, her childhood home was a vibrant fusion of traditions. The scent of her father's dashi often mingled with the aroma of her mother\u2019s roasting spices, creating a unique culinary language that would later define her career. Food was how her family communicated love, and Meiko became a fluent and passionate speaker.\n\nHer path wasn't linear. After high school, she enrolled in Hospitality Management at City College of San Francisco, but found the classroom less compelling than the real world. A turning point came when she was offered an assistant manager position with a prestigious catering company that serviced the city's art galleries. Seeing a chance to learn by doing, she left her studies, a decision she has never regretted. With relentless drive and an innate talent for event logistics and menu design, Meiko worked her way up. Today, she is the Catering Director for a major museum, orchestrating everything from intimate donor dinners to grand opening galas.\n\nNow 48, Meiko lives a life of disciplined creativity. Her workday is a storm of coordination, but her personal life is a quiet haven. She resides in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and the authentic eateries on Clement Street. Her 3.8-mile commute on the N-Judah is a cherished ritual, a time to people-watch and mentally prepare for the day. Though she enjoys a wide circle of industry acquaintances, her core social group is a small, tight-knit collection of friends\u2014an artist, a chef, and a bookseller\u2014with whom she shares dim sum on Sundays.\n\nMeiko's dream is to distill her experience into her own venture: a bespoke catering firm specializing in culturally-infused culinary events. She envisions \"Ito-Kaur Cuisine,\" a tribute to her parents and a final, creative expression of her identity. San Francisco is not just her home; it's the only place she feels her unique story could have unfolded, and the only place she can imagine writing its next chapter."

The salty, oceanic scent of her father\u2019s dashi was a gentle wave, met by the earthy warmth of her mother\u2019s cumin and coriander toasting in a pan. In that shared air, she didn't just smell dinner; she felt the quiet, steady harmony of her parents' love. This wasn't just fusion, it was a language. It was the moment she understood that a meal could tell a story, a realization that would become the compass of her life.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, she wasn\u2019t in a CCSF classroom but in a SoMa gallery, buzzing with artists and patrons. Her boss pulled her aside mid-chaos, offering her the assistant manager role. Looking at the kinetic art of the event\u2014the perfectly timed canap\u00e9s, the clinking glasses, the flow of the crowd\u2014she felt a clarity lectures never gave her. It was a terrifying, exhilarating bet on herself. She accepted on the spot, trading the safety of a degree for the thrill of a calling.\n\n3.\nIt was her first opening gala as Director. After the last VIP departed, she stood alone on the museum\u2019s marble rotunda. Below, the remnants of a perfect evening\u2014empty glasses, scattered napkins\u2014were a beautiful mess. She could still feel the hum of 500 conversations, the symphony of service she had conducted. In that quiet, exhausted moment, she felt a profound sense of arrival. This controlled, creative chaos was what she was built for, the culmination of every risk she had ever taken.\n\n4.\nOne particularly stressful week, she went for an early run. The fog in Golden Gate Park was so thick the cypress trees appeared like gentle ghosts. The only sounds were her footsteps on the damp path and the distant fog horns. The city's ambition and noise dissolved, leaving only this quiet peace. It wasn't an escape; it was a reconnection. This is why she lived in the Inner Richmond, for these moments of sanctuary that refilled the well, allowing her to face the storm again.\n\n5.\nOver har gow at their usual Clement Street spot last year, she confessed her abstract dream of \"Ito-Kaur Cuisine.\" Her bookseller friend started brainstorming branding, and the chef began sketching fusion menus on a napkin. It wasn't idle chatter; it was genuine belief. In their excitement, her vague, private wish became a tangible possibility. That Sunday dim sum wasn\u2019t just a meal with friends; it was the moment her future found its first investors\u2014not of money, but of faith."
