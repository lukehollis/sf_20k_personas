The daughter of industrious immigrants who ran a small neighborhood laundromat, Sarah grew up understanding the language of hard work and filial duty. She was a bright, artistic child who filled notebooks with intricate drawings, dreaming of a life in graphic design far removed from the hum of washing machines.\n\nAfter high school, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, her portfolio promising a creative career. However, during her sophomore year, her life pivoted sharply. Her father suffered a debilitating stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed and in need of constant care. The family\u2019s modest savings were no match for the cost of professional healthcare. Feeling the immense weight of responsibility, Sarah made the difficult decision to leave college and become her father's full-time caregiver. The \"unknown\" on her college transcript marks the moment her path diverged.\n\nNow, at 29, Sarah\u2019s world is the familiar four-block radius around her family\u2019s small home. Her 0.0-mile commute is the walk from her bedroom to her father\u2019s. Her days are a structured routine of medication schedules, physical therapy exercises, meal preparations, and managing a web of doctor's appointments. Her social life consists of brief chats with neighbors at the local market and late-night texts with a few high school friends who have since moved away.\n\nThough she rarely leaves the neighborhood, her connection to San Francisco is profound. It\u2019s in the taste of the egg tarts from the bakery on Irving Street and the comforting chill of the evening fog rolling in. While the dream of being a graphic designer has faded, a new one has quietly taken its place. Inspired by her experience, Sarah hopes to one day return to school to become a certified occupational therapist. She wants to use her hard-won skills to help other families navigate similar crises, aspiring to build a future that honors her sacrifice while finally allowing her to claim a life of her own."
