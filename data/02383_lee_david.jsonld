The only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up amidst the clatter and scent of his parents\u2019 small grocery store in Oakland\u2019s Chinatown. His childhood was a practical education in inventory, customer service, and the relentless rhythm of a small business. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable profession like medicine or law, David was drawn to the grand narratives of the past, eventually earning a Bachelor\u2019s in History from UC Berkeley.\n\nHe graduated in the late 1990s, just as the first dot-com boom was cresting. With few prospects for a history major, he took a temp job doing quality assurance for a now-forgotten startup in SoMa. He discovered he had no passion for coding but possessed an innate talent for organization and mediating between the eccentric engineers and the demanding business leads. This became his niche. When the bubble burst, he survived the layoffs, his pragmatism making him indispensable. Over two decades, he built a steady career as a project coordinator, the calm center in the storm of product launches and software updates.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when a long-term relationship ended. Seeking a clean break, David found a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. The fog-laced streets and proximity to Golden Gate Park offered a sense of peaceful solitude he didn\u2019t know he needed. His 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a pandemic-era shift to remote work that he has fully embraced.\n\nHis days follow a comfortable routine. He starts with a walk through the park, coffee from a favorite cafe on Clement Street, and then settles into a world of Slack channels and Zoom meetings. He knows the local butcher and the produce market owners by name, a comforting echo of his childhood. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends from his early tech days, with whom he shares dinners and occasional hikes.\n\nNow 45, David is less concerned with climbing the corporate ladder. His aspirations are more personal. He dreams of finally using his history degree, perhaps by starting a blog or small passion project documenting the architectural history of San Francisco\u2019s neighborhoods. He seeks a deeper connection to the city that has become his true home, hoping to find a narrative for his own life that is as rich and layered as the ones he once studied in books."
