Her 0.0-mile commute is a simple, creaky walk down a flight of stairs from her flat to the front door of \u201cArtifact,\u201d the home goods and artisan craft store she manages. She\u2019s the first to arrive, the last to leave, her life inextricably woven into the fabric of the small business.\n\nOriginally from a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, Sarah arrived in San Francisco two decades ago with a freshly minted Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History from a small liberal arts college. She had romantic visions of becoming a museum curator, spending her days among masterworks. But the reality of unpaid internships and fierce competition quickly set in. Needing to pay rent, she took a part-time job at Artifact, then run by its charismatic original owner, a woman named Eleanor.\n\nSarah\u2019s Art History background, which she thought was becoming useless, gave her an uncanny eye for display and composition. She could tell a story with a collection of ceramic mugs and hand-woven throws. Eleanor noticed. The part-time job became full-time, then assistant manager. The turning point came a decade ago when Eleanor decided to retire. She couldn\u2019t offer Sarah the business outright, but she trusted her to manage it as if it were her own. Sarah, by then feeling disconnected from the academic world and deeply rooted in the shop, accepted. It felt less like a compromise and more like a homecoming.\n\nHer social life is a mosaic of regulars: the barista from the caf\u00e9 next door, the tech worker who buys a new candle every Friday, and the other local shop owners. A long-term relationship ended around the time she took over the store, and she poured her energy into Artifact as a sanctuary. Now, her life is measured and peaceful. Her dream is no longer to curate for a museum, but to one day have the capital to buy Artifact from Eleanor\u2019s family. She imagines sourcing trips to Japan and Scandinavia, not as a tourist, but to meet the artisans whose work she so lovingly displays, finally curating a world entirely of her own making."
