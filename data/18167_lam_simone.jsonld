Raised in Oakland by a union carpenter father and a Chinese-American graphic designer mother, her childhood was a blend of sawdust and Pantone swatches. She grew up understanding both the structural integrity of a well-made joint and the emotional pull of a perfect curve. This unique upbringing naturally led her to pursue Industrial Design at the California College of the Arts, where she honed her talent for creating objects that were both beautiful and intuitive to use.\n\nHer first job was at a boutique furniture startup in Berkeley, where she designed minimalist chairs and lighting fixtures. While she loved the creative process, Simone discovered a deeper satisfaction in translating her designs from digital models into physical products. She had a knack for streamlining workflows and communicating with manufacturers, a skill her colleagues lacked. This became her turning point. Recognizing her talent for logistics, her boss promoted her to a new role managing the production pipeline. She found she thrived on the challenge of process more than pure design.\n\nNow 35, Simone lives in a modest but sunny apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. Her 3.1-mile bicycle commute to the manufacturing facility where she works as a Production Manager is a cherished daily ritual, a moment of kinetic peace before diving into schedules and supply chains. Her days are structured and demanding, but she unwinds by taking ceramics classes at a local studio, a tactile connection to the craft she still loves. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from college and former jobs, preferring deep conversations at a local brewery over loud clubs.\n\nDeep down, Simone dreams of bridging her two professional lives. Her ultimate goal is to launch her own small company producing sustainable, locally-made home goods. It would be the perfect synthesis of her parents\u2019 influence: her mother\u2019s design elegance and her father\u2019s practical, hands-on craftsmanship, all brought to life in the city she has made her own."

Her mom came in, holding two paint swatches against the pale wood\u2014\"Oceanic Teal\" or \"Forest Floor\"? Her dad scoffed, but Simone saw it instantly: the perfect, sturdy joint he was making would only truly sing with the right color. It wasn't form *or* function; it was the alchemy of \"and.\" That day cemented her understanding that beauty and structure were two sides of the same essential truth.\n\n2.\nAt 26, staring at a 3D model of a chair leg at her first Berkeley startup job, she was stuck. The manufacturer had called, frustrated. Instead of tweaking the design again, she opened a spreadsheet and began mapping out a new production workflow. An hour later, a clean, logical process chart glowed on her screen. A wave of satisfaction washed over her, deeper than any design approval. She wasn't just a designer; she was a builder of systems. It was the moment she found her true vocation.\n\n3.\nShe was taking a ceramics class, about two years ago, and the clay kept collapsing. Then, one Tuesday night, it happened. The lump centered, and with steady pressure, a cylinder rose beneath her hands\u2014imperfect but whole. She wasn't managing a timeline or a budget; she was simply feeling the material respond. The raw, tactile joy of it was overwhelming. It reconnected her to the physical act of creation that her logistics-heavy job lacked, reminding her why she fell in love with making things in the first place.\n\n4.\nBiking home last winter, she paused at the crest of the 22nd Street overpass. The setting sun lit up the cranes and warehouses of the Dogpatch waterfront in a warm, industrial glow. For a moment, the world was just the hum of her tires, the cool air, and the beautiful, functional geometry of her city. It was a quiet feeling of profound rightness\u2014a kinetic peace that confirmed she was exactly where she needed to be. That specific view became her anchor, her proof that this was home.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, at a brewery in the Mission, she finally said the words out loud to her two closest friends. \u201cI want to start my own company. Sustainable home goods, made here.\u201d The confession hung in the air, tasting of hops and fear. But they leaned in, not with doubt, but with questions about logos and materials. In that moment, surrounded by their immediate belief, her private dream shifted into a tangible plan. The fear didn't vanish, but for the first time, hope was stronger."
