Raised by a librarian mother and an architect father, her childhood was a quiet tapestry of books, blueprints, and hikes in the Columbia River Gorge. This instilled in her a love for both structured narratives and open-ended exploration, leading her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature, where she fell in love with deconstructing meaning.\n\nPost-graduation, the romantic notion of becoming a novelist quickly collided with the reality of rent. Sarah took a freelance gig writing website copy for a small Portland tech startup, intending it to be a temporary stopgap. However, she discovered a surprising talent for translating complex code and abstract product goals into compelling human stories. This was her turning point. The work was a perfect, unforeseen marriage of her analytical and creative skills.\n\nFour years ago, lured by a senior role and the industry\u2019s gravitational pull, she moved to San Francisco. Today, her life is contained within the vibrant, chaotic blocks of the Mission District. Her commute is a ten-step journey from her bed to her desk, a reality that makes her disciplined daily routine essential. Mornings begin with a walk to a local coffee shop for a cortado, a small ritual to separate home from work. Her days are a digital flurry of Slack messages, Zoom meetings, and deep-focus work shaping brand voices and content ecosystems.\n\nTo combat the isolation of remote work, Sarah is intentional about her social life. Her friends are a tight-knit group of fellow transplants met through rock climbing at Mission Cliffs and a monthly book club. While professionally fulfilled, Sarah dreams of reconnecting with her own creative voice. She aspires to lead a content team, but also harbors a quiet ambition to finally write that collection of personal essays about finding your place in a city that is always reinventing itself\u2014much like she has."
