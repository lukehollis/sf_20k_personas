Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from her minimalist apartment to her state-of-the-art conservation studio, a space fragrant with the scents of solvents and aging paper.\n\nAs a third-generation Japanese American, Anya\u2019s life has been subtly shaped by the preservation of history. She grew up in San Jose, the daughter of a quiet, precise architect and a university librarian. Her fascination with conservation began with her grandparents' *by\u014dbu*, a painted folding screen that had been damaged during their family\u2019s hasty relocation to an internment camp during WWII. The cracked lacquer and faded silk were not just flaws to her; they were wounds in her family\u2019s story. This early resolve to heal the past set her on a singular path.\n\nShe pursued a challenging double major in Chemistry and Art History at UCLA, followed by a prestigious Master's degree in Art Conservation from New York University. After a demanding fellowship at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the pull of California brought her home. She accepted a position at a major San Francisco museum but grew to prefer the autonomy and focus of private practice. At 35, she invested everything into her SoMa loft, creating a sanctuary for damaged masterpieces.\n\nNow 42, Anya is a sought-after Senior Conservator, trusted with everything from 17th-century European oil paintings to contemporary multimedia installations. Her days are disciplined: a morning walk to a local cafe, followed by long, uninterrupted hours under magnification lamps, her hands steady as she performs microscopic repairs. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends\u2014a curator, a gallery owner, and a chef\u2014with whom she shares quiet dinners. A long-term relationship ended amicably years ago, a casualty of divergent life goals; she chose her work, her city, and her independence without regret.\n\nAnya\u2019s dream is to one day work on a major Japanese national treasure. But her most personal aspiration remains untouched in a custom-built, climate-controlled case: her family\u2019s *by\u014dbu*. She is waiting for the moment when her skills are perfect enough to finally mend the delicate wounds of her own history."
