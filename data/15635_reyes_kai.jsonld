Born in Daly City to a Filipino-American father who worked as a Muni mechanic and a second-generation Irish-American mother, a nurse's aide, Kai grew up straddling cultures and expectations. His world, however, was primarily shaped by his younger brother, Leo, who was diagnosed with nonverbal autism at a young age. While his friends were focused on grades and parties, Kai\u2019s teenage years were spent learning a different language: one of patience, visual cues, and understanding the unspoken needs of his brother.\n\nThis deep-seated empathy became his compass. College never felt like a serious option; the family needed his support, both financially and emotionally. After graduating high school, he worked various retail jobs before discovering a path that felt like a calling. He earned his certification as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT), channeling his firsthand experience with Leo into a profession. Now, he works with elementary school-aged children with developmental disabilities in a San Francisco public school, helping them navigate a world that often misunderstands them.\n\nAt 28, Kai has finally carved out a small piece of the city for himself. He shares a cramped but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond with two roommates, a sanctuary just blocks from Golden Gate Park. His daily routine is a familiar rhythm: a 3.5-mile ride on the 5-Fulton bus to work, a day of demanding but rewarding sessions with his students, and an evening spent either decompressing with a run through the park, cooking adobo from his father\u2019s recipe, or studying.\n\nHe remains the anchor for his family, visiting them in Daly City every weekend. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends who appreciate his quiet dependability. While he\u2019s content, a gentle ambition simmers beneath the surface. Kai is slowly taking online classes toward a bachelor's degree in psychology. His dream isn't wealth, but to one day become a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), designing the very programs he now implements. He hopes to build a future in San Francisco, a city that feels like home, proving that a life of profound impact doesn\u2019t require a grand stage, but a steady, compassionate heart."

His brother, usually lost in his own world, took a red Lego brick from Kai\u2019s hand and carefully placed it atop a blue one. He then looked directly into Kai\u2019s eyes and smiled. It wasn\u2019t a word, but it was a conversation. In that silent exchange, Kai felt a profound connection, a shared language built of color and shape. It was the moment he stopped trying to pull Leo into his world and began learning to enter Leo\u2019s.\n\n2.\nHe remembers observing a session with Leo's new behavior technician. The woman was calm and methodical, using a picture board to help Leo communicate a choice. There was no frustration, only a gentle, structured empathy. Kai, then twenty and stocking shelves at a Target, felt a jolt of recognition. This was the work he'd been doing instinctively for years, but with a name and a system. The vague obligation he felt toward his brother finally sharpened into a clear, professional calling. He saw a future.\n\n3.\nIt was his first month in the Inner Richmond, during a solo run at dusk. The fog was rolling over the tops of the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park, muffling the city sounds. He was tired from work, his lungs burning, but a deep sense of ownership settled over him. This park, this fog, this quiet moment of exertion\u2014it was all his. Not his family's, not his roommates', but his alone. For the first time, San Francisco felt less like a destination for work and more like the foundation of his own life.\n\n4.\nHe recalls his father finally showing him how to make the adobo, not from a written recipe, but by feel. It was on a Sunday visit to Daly City. \"More vinegar, *anak*,\" his dad said gruffly, guiding Kai\u2019s hand. The gesture was full of unspoken affection. In that small kitchen, surrounded by the smell of soy sauce and garlic, Kai realized he wasn't just learning to cook a dish. He was being handed a piece of his father\u2019s history, a tangible way to feel at home in his own apartment.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a breakthrough with a young student who had been struggling with transitions. Using a visual schedule Kai had adapted, the girl moved between activities without a tantrum for the first time. The gratitude in her mother\u2019s eyes was immense, but Kai felt the ceiling of his role as an RBT. He had implemented the plan well, but he wanted to be the one to design it. That quiet evening, watching the 5-Fulton pass his window, he decisively enrolled in his first online psychology course."
