At 47, her commute is nonexistent, as she is a live-in Certified Nursing Assistant at \"Serenity House,\" a residential care facility for the elderly tucked away in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond.\n\nHer journey began far from the city\u2019s fog-laced avenues. Born in El Salvador, Aisha and her family fled the burgeoning civil war when she was a small child, settling in the vibrant, chaotic warmth of the Mission District in the early 1980s. She grew up surrounded by the sounds of Spanish, the smell of pupusas, and the constant hustle of families trying to build new lives. After high school, she earned an Associate's degree in business administration from City College, hoping to manage a small local shop one day.\n\nThe pivotal turn in her life was not a career move, but a family crisis. When her mother was diagnosed with a degenerative illness, Aisha became her primary caregiver. For three years, she navigated the labyrinth of healthcare, learning to administer medication, provide comfort, and advocate for a loved one. The experience was exhausting but transformative. After her mother passed, the path forward was clear. The business world felt hollow; caring for others felt like her true calling. She returned to CCSF and earned her CNA certification.\n\nToday, Aisha\u2019s life is one of routine and profound purpose. She rises before the sun, helping residents with their morning rituals, her gentle presence a constant source of reassurance. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of her fellow caregivers and the residents, who have become her extended family. She has a son, Marco, who is grown and works in tech in the East Bay. Their weekly video calls are her anchor to a world outside Serenity House.\n\nOn her days off, she walks through Golden Gate Park or explores the bakeries on Clement Street, savoring her anonymity. Her dream isn't grand; it's a small, quiet condo of her own, perhaps in Daly City or Pacifica, where she can see the ocean. More than anything, she hopes Marco finds lasting happiness and that one day, when she needs it, she will be given the same dignified, compassionate care she has spent her life providing."
