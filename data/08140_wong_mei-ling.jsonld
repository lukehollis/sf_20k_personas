Born and raised in the Inner Sunset, she is the child of Cantonese immigrants who poured their life savings and boundless energy into a small neighborhood grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home, the clang of the N-Judah streetcar, and the constant, quiet pressure to achieve a stability her parents never had. While they hoped she would pursue a practical career like accounting, Mei-Ling was drawn to people and stories, earning a Bachelor's in Communications from San Francisco State University.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was almost accidental. In the late 90s, she took a job as an office manager for a chaotic, ambitious dot-com startup. While the engineers and coders built the product, Mei-Ling built the company\u2019s internal structure. She discovered a unique talent for translating the abstract goals of executives into concrete, actionable steps for creative and technical teams. She was unflappable, organized, and empathetic\u2014the perfect Production Manager. Over two decades, she navigated the industry's booms and busts, moving from scrappy startups to her current stable role at a major tech firm.\n\nA key turning point was the company\u2019s permanent shift to remote work. The elimination of her commute was a revelation. Mei-Ling\u2019s world, once spanning the Bay, contracted to her meticulously organized Noe Valley apartment and the surrounding blocks. Her days are now structured by her own rhythm: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, hours of focused work managing global production schedules via Slack and Zoom, and an evening yoga class or a quiet dinner with her tight-knit group of friends\u2014her chosen family.\n\nAt 44, Mei-Ling feels a deep, sometimes complicated, love for her native city. She has witnessed its dramatic transformations and laments the loss of its unpolished charm, yet she is a beneficiary of its new economy. Her aspirations are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. Instead, she dreams of finding a way to use her project management skills to support local artists or legacy businesses, like the one her parents once owned. She hopes to mentor young women, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, who are trying to find their place in the demanding world of tech, proving that the most valuable code is the one that connects people."
