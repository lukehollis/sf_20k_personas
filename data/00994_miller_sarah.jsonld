Raised in a series of rented homes across California's Central Valley by a single mother working two jobs, stability was a luxury she never knew. Formal education was often interrupted by moves and the need to contribute to the household, and she left high school with a GED and a practiced resilience. For years, she drifted through low-wage service jobs, feeling the pull of a bigger world but lacking the resources to reach it.\n\nThe turning point came at 28. An acquaintance mentioned an urgent, unconventional job: a live-in caregiver for an elderly, medically complex man in San Francisco. It wasn't a formal medical position, but it offered a room, a steady wage, and a door out of her stagnant life. She took it. For the past eight years, Sarah\u2019s world has been contained within a meticulously restored Victorian in Pacific Heights. Her 0.0-mile commute is the walk from her small bedroom in the back to the main quarters of her patient, Mr. Henderson.\n\nHer title of \"Medical Assistant\" is one she earned through experience, not schooling. She manages a complex regimen of medications, monitors vitals, coordinates with visiting nurses, and provides constant companionship. Her days are a structured routine of meals, appointments, and quiet hours reading aloud. Her connection to San Francisco is primarily visual\u2014the stunning view of the Bay from Mr. Henderson\u2019s window, the scent of jasmine on her short walks to the corner market. She feels more like a keeper of a beautiful museum than a resident of the vibrant city outside.\n\nHer social life is minimal, consisting of long phone calls with her sister and brief, friendly exchanges with the pharmacy tech. Sarah\u2019s dream is not extravagant. She is diligently saving money and studying online to earn an official Medical Assistant certification. Her ultimate goal is a small, simple apartment of her own, perhaps in the foggy quiet of the Outer Richmond. She longs for a life where her commute is longer than zero miles, and where she can finally be a participant in the city she has observed from a distance for so long."
