A Northern California native from the quieter suburbs of Walnut Creek, Liam was raised by a pragmatic engineer father and a compassionate elementary school teacher mother. His mixed-heritage background was a simple fact of life, never a central identity, leaving him feeling like a quintessential product of modern California\u2014a blend of everything.\n\nHis path to San Francisco was paved with youthful ambition and a touch of impatience. He enrolled at San Francisco State University to study communications, but the theoretical nature of his classes felt sluggish compared to the fast-paced world he saw exploding around him. The true turning point came during a sophomore-year internship at a small, chaotic tech startup. In six months of writing ad copy and managing social media accounts, he learned more than he had in two years of lectures. Believing the real education was on the job, he made the risky decision to drop out, a choice that still fuels both his drive and a lingering sense of imposter syndrome.\n\nNow, at 25, Liam is a Marketing Coordinator for a mid-size software company. His commute is a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to the living room he shares with two other roommates. His daily routine is dictated by a rhythm of Slack notifications and local rituals. Mornings start with an oat milk latte from a corner caf\u00e9, followed by hours spent in front of his laptop, the sounds of 24th Street filtering through his window. Lunch is often a burrito grabbed from a nearby taqueria and eaten on a bench in Dolores Park, a brief escape into the city's vibrant energy.\n\nHis social life is deeply intertwined with his living situation; his roommates are his closest confidantes. Weekends are for exploring other neighborhoods, catching indie bands at The Independent, or navigating the city's notoriously tricky dating scene. Liam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and intense. He doesn\u2019t just work in the city; he inhabits his small corner of it completely. He dreams of eventually leading a creative team, of having his strategic vision shape a brand he respects. But for now, his more immediate aspiration is a common one in this expensive city: to one day afford an apartment with just one roommate, or maybe, miraculously, none at all."
