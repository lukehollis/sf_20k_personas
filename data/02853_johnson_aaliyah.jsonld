The daughter of a longshoreman and a high school administrator, she was raised on the principles of hard work and the transformative power of education. While her friends were drawn to the immediate pulse of the streets, Aaliyah was captivated by the complex dance of ships and cranes at the Port of Oakland, an early sign of her innate understanding of systems and logistics.\n\nHer academic brilliance earned her a scholarship to UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. She initially felt out of place among her more privileged peers but quickly distinguished herself with a sharp, analytical mind. After graduating, she bypassed the flashy dot-com startups of the late 90s for a gritty logistics role at a traditional Bay Area manufacturing company, learning the unglamorous, essential mechanics of the supply chain. This foundational knowledge became her secret weapon. Her turning point was earning an MBA from Stanford, a catalyst that catapulted her into the executive track of the burgeoning tech hardware sector.\n\nNow 49, Aaliyah is the Director of Supply Chain Operations for a major Silicon Valley company. Her commute is a walk from her bedroom to her home office in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. The 20-year marriage that saw her through her early career ended amicably five years ago, a mutual decision to pursue different paths to happiness. Her life is now a curated balance of professional intensity and personal peace.\n\nHer days begin at dawn with her rescue greyhound, Miles, on a quiet walk through Patricia\u2019s Green before the city fully wakes. Her work is a demanding series of global video calls, managing crises from factory shutdowns to international shipping delays. Evenings are her own: a glass of wine at a local bar, a performance at the SFJAZZ Center, or hosting a small dinner party for a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other professional women. Aaliyah feels deeply connected to the sophisticated, artistic energy of her neighborhood. Her dream is no longer about the next promotion; instead, she aspires to leverage her capital and experience to become an angel investor, specifically funding startups founded by women of color, ensuring the path she forged is wider and easier for the next generation to follow."
