He lives directly above the small fortune cookie factory his parents founded in a narrow Chinatown alley after emigrating from Toisan, China. David arrived at age 15, a quiet boy overwhelmed by a new language and a bustling city. He never formally finished American high school, instead earning his education on the factory floor, learning the moods of the aging baking wheels and the precise fold-and-tuck of a warm cookie from his father.\n\nThe business, Golden Dragon Fortunes, became his entire world. It was a path chosen for him, but one he accepted with a sense of duty. His life\u2019s key turning point came not when he took over the machines from his retiring parents, but when he met Mei, a fellow immigrant who worked at the bakery down the street. They married and ran the factory together, their shared dream baked into every sweet, vanilla-scented batch. Their daughter, Emily, was their greatest creation. But their partnership was cut short a decade ago when Mei lost her battle with cancer, leaving David to run the factory and raise their daughter alone.\n\nNow, at 53, his days are a rhythmic loop. He wakes before dawn to the hum of the machines warming up, works until the afternoon sun slants through the dusty windows, and spends his evenings reading or talking on the phone with Emily, now a student at UC Davis. His social life consists of nods to neighborhood grocers and brief chats with the elderly men playing cards in Portsmouth Square.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tethered to these few blocks of Chinatown. He has witnessed the neighborhood\u2019s slow transformation, the creep of gentrification at its edges, yet his world remains constant. His greatest hope is for Emily to build a life far from the factory\u2019s heat and noise. Yet, a quiet part of him fears that when the machines finally fall silent, his family's legacy\u2014and his life's purpose\u2014will simply crumble like a misfolded cookie."
