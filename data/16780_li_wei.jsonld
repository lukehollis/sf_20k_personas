Born in San Francisco, his identity was forged in a Richmond District home filled with the aromas of both his Cantonese father\u2019s cooking and his Peranakan Singaporean mother\u2019s Nyonya specialties. Tagged as \"Other\" on forms that failed to capture his layered heritage, Wei grew up feeling like a living archive of intersecting cultures. He spent his childhood listening to stories of his father\u2019s journey from Guangzhou and his mother's vibrant life in a Singapore that no longer existed, planting the seed for his life's work.\n\nInitially, Wei drifted into a computer science degree at SF State, believing it a practical path. The turning point came not in a classroom, but in his parents\u2019 dusty garage. He discovered a trunk of his mother\u2019s possessions: faded photographs, brittle letters in Malay and English, and intricate beaded slippers. In these tangible objects, he felt the weight and beauty of a story that could easily be lost. He abandoned coding for a Master's in Library and Information Science, finding his true calling in the quiet, vital work of preservation.\n\nNow the Lead Archivist at the Asian American Center in Information, Wei\u2019s work is his passion. His 1.1-mile MUNI ride from his quiet Nob Hill apartment to the Center near Chinatown is a daily pilgrimage. He spends his days handling fragile documents\u2014the ledgers of long-gone laundromats, the diaries of Angel Island detainees, the photo albums of families like his own. The death of his father ten years ago transformed his job into a near-sacred duty, a way to honor the silent histories of countless immigrants.\n\nWei\u2019s life is one of deliberate routine and quiet joy. He shares his apartment with his partner of eight years, Javier, a landscape architect whose work with living things provides a gentle counterpoint to Wei's focus on the past. Evenings are for shared meals, reading, and walks through their neighborhood, admiring the city's layered architecture. Wei\u2019s dream is not for himself, but for the stories he protects: to secure funding for a massive digitization project, ensuring the diverse narratives of the Asian diaspora are accessible to all, forever preserved from the erosion of time."

The savory steam from his father\u2019s Cantonese clay pot rice mingles with the sweet, coconut-laced fragrance of his mother\u2019s Nyonya *kueh* cooling on the counter. His father speaks in Cantonese, his mother answers in a mix of Malay and English. Wei doesn\u2019t have a word for it then, but he knows this specific confluence of smells and sounds is *home*. It is the first archive he ever knows, teaching him that his identity is not \"Other,\" but layered and whole.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the snap of the corroded latches on his mother's trunk in the garage. The air, thick with dust and camphor, carried the scent of a Singapore he\u2019d only heard about. He lifted out a pair of beaded slippers, the tiny stitches forming a perfect phoenix. It wasn't just an object; it was a story he could hold. The abstract logic of his computer science homework felt hollow and distant. In that moment, he knew his life\u2019s work would not be building the future, but preserving the past.\n\n3.\nAfter his father\u2019s death ten years ago, Wei found a small, worn ledger. It wasn\u2019t a diary, just columns of numbers recording humble earnings from a side-job long abandoned. But in his father\u2019s careful, disciplined script, Wei saw the entire unspoken story: the sacrifice, the quiet diligence, the dream for a son who wouldn't need such a ledger. His archival work, once a passion, became a solemn promise\u2014a sacred duty to honor all these silent, recorded lives.\n\n4.\nIt was a quiet Tuesday at the Center. He was cataloging papers from an Angel Island detainee when his gloved finger stopped on a line of poetry scrawled in a margin. The ink was faded, the paper fragile as a dry leaf. \"My body is a cage, but my heart flies to the Gold Mountain.\" Wei felt the century between them collapse. It was the same resilient yearning he heard in his own father's stories, a visceral reminder that every document he touched was once a human heart, beating.\n\n5.\nLast week, walking through Nob Hill, Javier stopped to admire the ginkgo trees he\u2019d recommended for a local courtyard, talking about their resilience. As Javier spoke of living things, Wei looked past the trees to the building\u2019s weathered brick facade, imagining the generations who had lived and dreamed within its walls. Javier tended to the present, while Wei guarded the past. Holding his partner's warm hand, Wei felt a moment of perfect, quiet balance right there on the pavement."
