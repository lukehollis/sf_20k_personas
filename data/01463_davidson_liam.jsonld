Raised in a state of constant, gentle upheaval, he never had a hometown, just a series of temporary bases. His adolescence was spent in the sun-baked flatness of California's Central Valley, a stark contrast to his family's intellectual world, fostering in him a quiet self-reliance and an observer's detachment.\n\nFormal education felt inefficient to Liam. He saw the traditional university path as a data point with a poor return on investment. Instead, he forged his own curriculum in the digital wilderness. After high school, he dove into online courses, data science bootcamps, and freelance gigs, teaching himself the languages of Python, R, and human behavior through datasets. This unconventional path was his first major turning point; landing his first full-time role as a Market Research Analyst without a degree validated his belief that skill trumps pedigree.\n\nNow 28, Liam lives a life of calculated routine in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bed to a standing desk in the corner of his minimalist apartment. His days are a disciplined rhythm of coffee, spreadsheets, and data visualization, deciphering market trends for a remote tech firm. He understands humanity in the aggregate, predicting mass behavior with startling accuracy, yet often finds individual, face-to-face interactions puzzling. His social circle is small and curated\u2014a few friends from a coding bootcamp and a climbing partner he meets at Mission Cliffs twice a week.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is sensory and solitary. He loves the way the fog erases the city's hard edges and the structured chaos of Golden Gate Park, where he runs every evening to decompress. He dreams of using his analytical skills for a public good, perhaps optimizing resource allocation for a non-profit or an environmental group. More privately, he hopes to build a relationship that isn\u2019t based on predictable patterns\u2014a connection that is messy, illogical, and profoundly human, proving that his own life can be more than a well-optimized data set."
