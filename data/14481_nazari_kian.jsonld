His family, a civil engineer father and a seamstress mother, fled Iran during the Revolution, eventually settling in Fremont. They brought with them not wealth, but a deeply ingrained belief in the value of tangible skills. While other kids in the Bay Area were dreaming of college and coding, Kian was fascinated by the way things worked, inheriting his father\u2019s methodical mind and his mother\u2019s dexterity. He\u2019d spend hours taking apart radios and lawnmowers, finding more truth in gears and wiring than in textbooks.\n\nSchool was a means to an end. Recognizing his practical intelligence, a high school guidance counselor steered him towards vocational training. Kian excelled, earning a certification in advanced machining. His early career was in traditional East Bay manufacturing plants, shaping metal for industrial use. The turning point came in the late 2000s when a burgeoning hardware startup needed a complex prototype built, fast. Kian, with his deep understanding of materials and tolerances, brought their digital design to life when others couldn't.\n\nThis success catapulted him into the lucrative world of tech manufacturing. He is now an Advanced Prototyping Technician at a cutting-edge R&D lab in the Dogpatch. Kian is the essential bridge between idea and object. He translates the ephemeral visions of engineers half his age into polished, functional aluminum, steel, and composite forms.\n\nHe lives a quiet, ordered life in the Sunset District. The 7.5-mile drive across town is a daily ritual of coffee and Farsi-language podcasts. Divorced for nearly a decade, his life is centered on his work and his high-school-aged daughter, Layla. He chose the Sunset for its foggy tranquility and proximity to Ocean Beach, a world away from the frantic energy of his workplace. Kian\u2019s hopes are not tied to stock options or climbing a corporate ladder. He dreams of seeing Layla thrive and, perhaps one day, opening his own small, specialized workshop\u2014a place where true craftsmanship is honored, a quiet legacy of skill in a city obsessed with the next big thing."

His mother gripped his hand, her knuckles white. In that chaos, a formative truth settled in him: when everything falls apart, the only things of value are the tools you carry and the skills in your hands. This single image became the blueprint for his life, a deep-seated need for the tangible and the real.\n\n2.\nHis father's lawnmower sputtered and died. Kian, around thirteen, spent a Saturday on the concrete driveway in Fremont, methodically disassembling the engine. Surrounded by greasy parts, he felt a calm clarity that eluded him in the classroom. When he found the clogged fuel line, cleaned it, and the engine roared back to life on the first pull, it wasn't just triumph. It was a revelation. He understood the world through gears and gaskets, not words and numbers. His path was set.\n\n3.\nIt was 2009. A group of nervous, brilliant kids from a startup brought him a digital file. Two other machine shops had failed. The design was all elegant curves, impossible tolerances. Kian saw the flaw not in the code, but in the physics of aluminum. He adjusted the toolpath on his Haas mill, trusting his feel for the metal over their simulation. When he handed them the finished, perfect prototype, their awe was more rewarding than any paycheck. He wasn't just a machinist; he was a translator of dreams into reality.\n\n4.\nLayla was twelve, frustrated with a school science project\u2014a small, wobbly wooden birdhouse. He didn\u2019t give her the answers. Instead, on a foggy Saturday in their Sunset garage, he showed her how to use a coping saw, how to sand with the grain, how to feel for a flush joint with her fingertips. As she worked, a look of focused calm settled on her face\u2014the same look he recognized in himself. In that shared quiet and sawdust, he felt a profound hope. This, not a prototype, was his true legacy.\n\n5.\nLast year, an engineer half his age held a prototype Kian had spent sixty hours perfecting. \"Incredible,\" the engineer said, \"this will look great in the pitch deck.\" Two weeks later, Kian saw it in a bin, discarded after the project was cancelled. There was no anger, just a quiet ache. He realized his perfect objects were just temporary steps for others. The dream of his own workshop crystallized then: a place where the thing itself was the point, a sanctuary for craft, built to last."
