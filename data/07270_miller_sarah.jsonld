Raised by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her upbringing was one of practicality and encouragement. She pursued an English Literature degree at Ohio State, a choice born from a love of narrative and structure, though it offered no clear career path.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was accidental. After graduating, she took a job as a marketing coordinator for a small software company in Columbus simply because they were hiring. There, amidst the jargon and code, she discovered a hidden talent for translating the chaotic sprints of engineering into coherent timelines and clear objectives for the rest of the team. She wasn't a coder, but she spoke the language of progress. This realization was her turning point.\n\nLured by opportunity and the promise of a city that celebrated innovation, Sarah made the leap to San Francisco six years ago. She landed an entry-level project coordinator role, quickly proving her worth and climbing the ladder to her current position as a Project Manager.\n\nToday, her \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from her bed to the desk in the corner of her Hayes Valley one-bedroom apartment. Her days are a blur of Slack notifications, video calls, and Gantt charts. To counteract the digital haze, Sarah imposes a strict routine: a morning run through the Panhandle, a midday walk to grab coffee from a local cafe, and evenings spent detethered from her laptop. Her primary connection to San Francisco isn't found in tech meetups, but in the tangible life of her neighborhood and her weekly pottery class in the Mission, where shaping clay provides a welcome, tactile anchor.\n\nSarah's ambition is to become a Director of Program Management, but her deeper dream is to feel truly rooted in the city. She hopes to one day afford a small condo with a view of the fog rolling in, a permanent stake in the transient town she has, against all odds, made her home."
