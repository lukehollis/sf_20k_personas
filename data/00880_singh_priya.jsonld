Raised on the values of hard work and community service, Priya was expected to pursue a stable, high-achieving profession. She dutifully followed this path, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Davis.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year. While helping manage her mother's chronic diabetes, Priya became fascinated not by the immediate treatment, but by the systemic challenges: the clinical trials for new medications, the community health outreach, and the data that predicted patient outcomes. She realized her passion lay in the architecture of healthcare, not the frontline practice. This revelation led her to pursue a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, focusing on epidemiology and clinical trial management.\n\nUpon graduating, she accepted a position as a Clinical Research Coordinator at a major UCSF-affiliated medical center, a role she has now held for nearly two decades. This career move brought her to San Francisco, where she settled into the quiet, academically-inclined neighborhood of the Inner Sunset.\n\nNow 43, Priya has crafted a life of deliberate calm. Her 0.0-mile commute means most days are spent working from her tidy, bay-windowed apartment, analyzing trial data and coordinating logistics remotely. When she needs to be on-site, it\u2019s a short, brisk walk up the hill to the Parnassus campus. Her mornings begin with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, and evenings are often for her small, tight-knit book club or video calls with her brother's family in the East Bay. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, teaching her a profound appreciation for her own company and the deep-seated comfort of routine.\n\nPriya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-specific. She loves the village feel of Irving Street, the weekend farmers' market, and the cool fog that blankets her walk home. Her quiet dream is to one day lead her own research study, focusing on health disparities within the South Asian community\u2014a direct homage to the family journey that set her on this path. Until then, she finds fulfillment in the meticulous, vital work of shepherding new treatments toward reality, one data point at a time."
