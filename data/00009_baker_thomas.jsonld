            "value": "Thomas Baker is a man built of the same sturdy materials as the machines he supervises. Born and raised in a fading Ohio steel town, his world was shaped by the rhythmic clang of industry and the ever-present anxiety of layoffs. His father, a casualty of the 1980s manufacturing decline, instilled in Thomas a deep-seated belief in tangible skills over academic promises. After graduating from high school, Thomas bypassed college, instead finding work as an apprentice in a local machine shop, learning the language of lathes and mills.\n\nIn his late twenties, seeking stability that Ohio couldn't offer, he followed a rumor of a specialized, high-end furniture manufacturer in San Francisco. He arrived in the city not for its culture or vistas, but for the job. He started at the bottom, sweeping sawdust and learning the intricacies of custom cabinetry. Thomas was steady, meticulous, and reliable. Over three decades, he worked his way up from the factory floor to become the indispensable Manufacturing Supervisor.\n\nThe most significant turning point in his life came fifteen years ago. The original owner, valuing Thomas\u2019s unwavering dedication, offered him the small, spartan apartment attached to the back of the workshop. This cemented his 0.0-mile commute and fused his life entirely with his work. A brief marriage in his thirties had already dissolved, unable to compete with his commitment to the workshop, and this move solidified his solitary path.\n\nToday, Thomas lives and breathes the Dogpatch neighborhood. He wakes to the scent of lacquer and the hum of ventilation systems. His days are spent on the floor, mentoring younger craftspeople, solving mechanical problems, and ensuring every joint is perfect. He is the institutional memory of the factory, a walking archive of its processes and people. His evenings are quiet; he might share a beer with his crew at a nearby old-school bar or simply watch the neighborhood gentrify around his industrial island from his small window. His greatest hope is not for retirement, but for the workshop to outlast the relentless pressure of real estate development. His dream is to one day hand over the keys to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who understands that true value is built, not bought."
