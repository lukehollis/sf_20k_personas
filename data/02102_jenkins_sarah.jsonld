Raised in a stoic, hardworking family, emotional complexities were often swept under the rug. This quiet denial became the defining force of her youth when her older brother battled a severe, undiagnosed depression. Watching him suffer without the language or support to seek help planted a seed in Sarah: a deep-seated need to understand the unseen struggles of the human mind.\n\nThis drive propelled her west. After completing her undergraduate degree in psychology, she left Ohio for good, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program. The Bay Area was a revelation\u2014a place where vulnerability was not a weakness and self-exploration was encouraged. She interned at a community clinic in the Mission, finding her calling in the trenches of crisis intervention. Over the next decade, she worked for a large healthcare provider, earning her LCSW license and building a reputation for her calm, insightful approach.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. After an amicable divorce, she reassessed her path. Tired of institutional bureaucracy, she took a leap and opened her own private practice from her Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. This decision integrated her life and work seamlessly, eliminating her commute and allowing her to cultivate a tranquil space for her clients and herself.\n\nNow at 49, Sarah\u2019s days follow a gentle rhythm. Mornings begin with a walk with her rescue terrier, Gus, through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park, followed by a coffee from her neighborhood cafe. Her afternoons are filled with client sessions, a mix of telehealth and in-person appointments in her cozy, book-lined home office. Her social life is a curated circle of close friends, many of whom are also long-term SF residents who share her love for the city\u2019s culture and natural beauty.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is no longer about career advancement but about legacy. She aspires to write a book aimed at families like her own, offering practical guidance on how to support loved ones through mental health crises. For her, San Francisco is more than a city; it\u2019s the place that gave her the tools to heal others, and in doing so, to finally understand and heal the quiet wounds of her own past."
