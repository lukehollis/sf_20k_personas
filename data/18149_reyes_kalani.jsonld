Raised in K\u0101ne\u02bbohe on the windward side of O\u02bbahu, his earliest memories are of his Tutu\u2019s kitchen, a humid, fragrant space where `ohana` (family) was built around shared meals. It was there, shelling macadamia nuts or pounding poi, that he learned food was more than sustenance; it was an expression of `aloha`. This foundation spurred him to leave the islands for the prestigious Culinary Institute of America, a move that felt both like a betrayal and a necessity to truly honor the craft.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in his early twenties, drawn by its reputation as a culinary frontier. The city was a shock\u2014cold, fast, and demanding. He spent over a decade working his way up the line in French and Californian kitchens, mastering techniques that felt worlds away from his roots. During this time, he married, had a daughter, and subsequently divorced, the relentless pressure of the industry taking its toll on his personal life. This painful turning point solidified his resolve to create a work environment different from the ones that broke him.\n\nToday, Kalani is the celebrated Executive Chef of \"M\u0101lama,\" his restaurant in Hayes Valley. The name, meaning \"to care for,\" is his guiding principle. He blends the traditional Hawaiian flavors of his youth with Northern California's focus on seasonal, local ingredients. His day begins before dawn, driving his SUV from his quiet Outer Sunset home to the city\u2019s fish markets. He finds a profound connection to San Francisco in these routines\u2014the fog rolling over Twin Peaks during his commute, the community of purveyors he\u2019s known for years, and the walks along Ocean Beach that almost feel like home.\n\nNow, at 49, Kalani\u2019s ambitions have shifted. He\u2019s less concerned with accolades and more with legacy. He finds deep satisfaction in mentoring his diverse kitchen staff and maintains a close, long-distance relationship with his daughter, who is studying marine biology in San Diego. His dream is no longer to build an empire, but to one day open a small, simple eatery dedicated to authentic plate lunches\u2014a full-circle return to the concept of food as pure, uncomplicated `aloha`."

His Tutu guides his small hands as they grate fresh coconut for haupia, her knuckles warm against his. He remembers the feeling not of a chore, but of belonging, of being an essential part of the family\u2019s joy. That feeling of pure, uncomplicated aloha became the flavor he would spend his life trying to recreate. It was the taste of home, the foundation of everything he would become.\n\n2. At eighteen, the Honolulu airport felt like a sterile, final gateway. He remembers his father, a man of few words, hugging him tight and turning away, shoulders shaking. It was the first time he\u2019d ever seen him cry. The weight of that silent grief was crushing, yet it cemented his resolve. He wasn\u2019t just leaving for himself; he was carrying their sacrifices with him. That moment transformed his youthful ambition into a solemn duty to make his family\u2019s faith in him matter.\n\n3. He was twenty-six, drenched in sweat in a Michelin-starred kitchen. The French chef tasted his perfectly seared scallops and threw the plate in the trash, snarling, \u201cTechnique without soul is garbage.\u201d The public humiliation burned, but later, alone, the words settled. He had mastered their craft but had forgotten his own heart. This failure was a gift, forcing him to stop mimicking others and begin the long, difficult journey back to his own flavors, back to his Tutu's kitchen.\n\n4. In his early thirties, the sterile scent of the hospital replaced the kitchen's chaos. He held his daughter, Leilani, for the first time, her tiny hand gripping his calloused finger with surprising strength. In that moment, the drive for another star, for a perfect service, evaporated. A more profound purpose washed over him\u2014a fierce, quiet need to care for this small human. This was the true meaning of \u2018m\u0101lama,\u2019 a revelation that would eventually reshape his entire career and life philosophy.\n\n5. Just last month, after a grueling Saturday service, he stood on Ocean Beach. The fog was so thick it erased the line between sea and sky, the cold air sharp and clean. The Pacific\u2019s roar was different here\u2014colder, more forceful than O\u02bbahu\u2019s gentle lull. Yet, a deep sense of peace settled in him. This wasn't the home he\u2019d left, but it was the one he had built. He realized he no longer felt like an islander in exile, but a man finally, truly at home in the fog."
