The only son of a software engineer and a homemaker who settled in Fremont in the 1980s, his path was paved toward Silicon Valley. The unspoken expectation was a degree in computer science from a prestigious UC, followed by a lucrative career that would validate his parents\u2019 sacrifices. He began that journey at UC Davis, dutifully studying computer science, but felt a profound disconnect. The code felt sterile, a world away from the complex human dramas he saw playing out around him.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year when a close friend suffered a severe mental health crisis. Rohan felt utterly helpless, witnessing the struggle to find compassionate, accessible care. The experience was a quiet rebellion. He finished his undergrad degree but immediately enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, a choice that initially disappointed his family.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s public health system. He worked with the unhoused, the addicted, and those falling through the cracks of a city of immense wealth and desperate poverty. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, contributing to the amicable end of his marriage in his late thirties. Seeking sustainability, Rohan transitioned to working within a large healthcare provider and eventually established his own private practice.\n\nNow, at 49, his commute is a walk from his bedroom to his home office in a quiet Inner Sunset flat. His days are a succession of telehealth appointments, a series of faces on a screen, each carrying a piece of the city\u2019s omnipresent anxiety. Rohan is a professional container for trauma, burnout, and existential dread. He finds his own release in long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park and in the simple ritual of cooking the elaborate North Indian dishes of his childhood. He has a small circle of trusted friends, mostly other therapists, who understand the unique weight of their work. His aspiration is not growth, but balance\u2014to continue holding space for others without losing himself. He dreams of one day taking a sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage to finally quiet the many voices he carries, including his own."

All the code, all the logic he was studying, felt like a foreign language, useless against this raw human pain. It wasn't a decision made in a flash, but a slow, quiet conviction born from that helplessness. He was on the wrong path. That night, the unspoken contract with his parents was broken, and his true work began.\n\n2.\nThe silence on the phone line to Fremont was heavier than any argument. He explained the Master of Social Work program, and his father\u2019s response was just a quiet, \u201cWe will see.\u201d In that small silence, Rohan felt the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifice and their profound disappointment. It was the first time he chose his own path over their blueprint. The guilt was sharp, but beneath it was the quiet, steely resolve of a man who had finally found the work he was meant to do.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a woman at a Tenderloin shelter, her feet raw from wet shoes. It was his first year on the job, and he felt overwhelmed, useless. All he could offer were a new pair of dry socks from a donation bin. Handing them to her, she looked at him\u2014truly saw him\u2014and whispered, \"Thank you, mijo.\" In that rainy-day exchange, the scale of his work shifted. It wasn't about grand solutions, but about preserving a flicker of dignity, one person, one pair of dry socks, at a time.\n\n4.\nIt wasn't a fight that ended his marriage, but a quiet moment on their sofa. He had come home carrying the weight of a particularly tragic case, and his silence filled the small flat. His wife, placing a hand on his, said gently, \"I can't live in here with you anymore,\" gesturing not at the room, but at his haunted expression. There was no anger, only a deep, shared sadness. He understood. The work demanded a part of him she deserved, a part he no longer knew how to give.\n\n5.\nA few years after starting his private practice, the faces on the screen felt overwhelming. He walked into Golden Gate Park, not for exercise, but for escape. Standing under the eucalyptus trees near the Dutch Windmill, he consciously pictured himself exhaling the day\u2019s anxieties, letting the sea-laced wind carry them away. For the first time, he felt a space clear inside him. It wasn't a solution, but a ritual\u2014a way to empty the container so he could be ready to fill it again the next day."
