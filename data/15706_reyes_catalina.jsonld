The daughter of immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, she was raised in the vibrant, cacophonous heart of the Mission District of the 1980s. Her childhood was a canvas of color and sound: the kaleidoscopic murals of Balmy Alley, the scent of fresh pan dulce from the corner bakery, and the rhythms of Spanish spoken on every street. While her parents worked tirelessly in the service industry, instilling in her a formidable work ethic, Catalina found her sanctuary in the stories told on the neighborhood\u2019s walls. She felt a disconnect between the powerful, living art of her community and the static, Eurocentric collections she saw on school trips to city museums.\n\nThis disconnect fueled her ambition. She attended San Francisco State University, first for Art History and then for a Master's in Museum Studies, determined to build a bridge between the two worlds. Her early career was a grind of internships and assistant positions, but her breakthrough came when she curated a daring and popular exhibition on the history of Chicano protest art. This success solidified her reputation and eventually led to her current role as Lead Curator at the de Young Museum.\n\nNow 48, Catalina\u2019s life has settled into a comfortable rhythm. A decade-long marriage to a fellow academic ended amicably years ago, leaving her with a renewed focus on her career and a close-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of artists, writers, and old friends. She lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her days begin with coffee from a local cafe and a 3.5-mile Muni ride across the park, a time she uses to listen to podcasts or simply watch the city wake up. Her work is her passion\u2014a constant cycle of research, acquisition, and storytelling.\n\nCatalina\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she has watched it morph and change, fighting to preserve the cultural soul that first inspired her. Her dream is no longer just to curate exhibits, but to mentor a new, diverse generation of curators. She hopes to one day launch an international fellowship, ensuring the stories from neighborhoods like the one she grew up in are not just seen as local history, but as an essential part of the global art conversation."

She was seven, tracing the fierce lines of an Aztec eagle with her small finger. She'd just been to a museum on a field trip, all silent portraits and landscapes under glass. But this\u2014this vibrant, roaring wall\u2014felt alive. It was the first time she understood that art wasn't just something to look at; it was something that could speak for you. That day planted the defiant seed of her entire career.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt 32, on the opening night of her Chicano protest art exhibit, she saw an elderly couple from her old block staring up at a Malaquias Montoya print. They were holding hands, whispering in Spanish, their faces full of a pride she recognized. In that moment, the sterile white gallery felt as sacred as a Mission Street church. The gap between her two worlds had finally closed. It wasn\u2019t just a professional success; it was a profound, personal homecoming, a vindication for the seven-year-old girl in the alley.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe divorce was finalized over lukewarm coffee in a Noe Valley cafe. There were no shouts, just a quiet, mutual sadness. \u201cWe built a good life,\u201d her husband said, \u201cjust not the same one.\u201d She was 38. That evening, instead of feeling empty, her apartment felt spacious. It was a closing, not a collapse. Letting go of that shared future allowed her to fully embrace her chosen family and her work. It taught her that some of the most important relationships aren't about permanence, but about the beautiful, finite space they hold.\n\n***\n\n4.\nJust last fall, on her daily Muni ride, the 5-Fulton was crawling through a thick fog in Golden Gate Park. Through the window, she saw a young student with a sketchbook, charcoal staining her fingers, furiously trying to capture the ghostly silhouette of the de Young's tower. Catalina felt a surge of quiet joy, a feeling of being part of an unbroken chain. It was a simple, fleeting moment that affirmed her purpose: to be a steward for the city's relentless, beautiful, ever-changing soul.\n\n***\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, she found a new intern crying quietly in the museum archives, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of history. Catalina saw her own younger self in the young woman\u2019s passionate, frustrated eyes. She spent an hour telling her stories, not about the art, but about the artists. In that conversation, her ambition shifted. It wasn't enough to curate objects anymore. The real work, the true legacy, would be in curating the next generation of storytellers. The fellowship idea was born right there."
