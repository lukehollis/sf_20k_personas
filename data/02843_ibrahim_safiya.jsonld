The daughter of a history teacher and a fabric merchant, she grew up within a vibrant, tight-knit Muslim community where the marketplace was the city\u2019s heart. She learned early that a place was defined by its people and their intricate connections, not just its streets and buildings. This foundational belief propelled her on a scholarship to UC Berkeley, where she earned her Master's in Urban and Regional Planning, trading the tropical humidity for the Bay Area\u2019s cool fog.\n\nHer early career at a large, impersonal architecture firm felt hollow. She was designing sleek, sterile spaces that ignored the human element she cherished. The turning point came during a contentious public meeting for a luxury condo project, where she saw the displacement and pain in the residents\u2019 faces. That night, she drafted her resignation and the business plan for her own consultancy.\n\nToday, at 45, Safiya operates her successful urban planning consultancy from her light-filled Hayes Valley apartment, making her commute exactly zero miles. Her work focuses on community-centric design, advising non-profits and smaller developers on creating sustainable, inclusive spaces. Her days are a blend of focused work and neighborhood immersion. Mornings start with a cortado from her favorite local cafe, followed by hours of video calls and digital modeling. Afternoons are for \u201cresearch walks,\u201d observing how people interact with public spaces, from the benches at Patricia\u2019s Green to the flow of traffic on Octavia Boulevard.\n\nDivorced a decade ago, Safiya has built a chosen family of close friends, fellow artists, and activists. She\u2019s the revered \u201ccool aunt\u201d to her sister\u2019s children back in the Philippines, her connection to them a bridge across the Pacific maintained through nightly FaceTime calls. Her greatest aspiration is to see one of her designs for a multi-use, affordable community housing project break ground in the city. For Safiya, San Francisco isn't just a home; it's a living organism, a complex puzzle of policy, history, and dreams. And she feels privileged to spend her life trying to help its pieces fit together more humanely."
