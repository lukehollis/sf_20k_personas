The son of a pragmatic Indian philosophy professor and a free-spirited American potter, he grew up in Berkeley in a house that smelled perpetually of cardamom and turpentine. His upbringing was a gentle clash of ideas\u2014intellectual rigor from his father and expressive freedom from his mother. This duality shaped his interests, leading him to pursue a double major in Art History and Communications at a liberal arts college on the East Coast.\n\nReturning to the Bay Area in the late 90s, Adam found his humanities degree was seen as quaintly impractical. He spent years in low-paying gallery jobs and writing freelance art reviews, feeling disconnected from the dot-com boom erupting around him. The turning point came in 2005 when a struggling photo-sharing startup needed someone to organize their chaotic library of user images. Adam, with his curator\u2019s eye and communicator\u2019s clarity, was a perfect fit. He discovered his niche: bringing order and narrative to the digital world.\n\nThis role catapulted him into a successful career. He became a translator between engineers and users, transforming raw data into compelling stories. Now, as Head of Content and Curation, he leads a team that shapes how millions of people interact with information online. His personal life saw its own shifts; a loving but ultimately divergent marriage ended amicably five years ago, leaving him with a quiet sense of independence.\n\nAdam lives in a tastefully minimalist condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to the opera house, independent boutiques, and top-tier restaurants. His daily routine is structured: a morning walk to a local cafe, followed by a Muni ride to his SoMa office. Evenings are for gallery openings, dinners with a close-knit circle of friends from both the art and tech worlds, or simply reading on his balcony overlooking the neighborhood buzz.\n\nNow at 46, Adam feels a pull back toward his roots. He\u2019s proud of his career but wonders about his legacy. He dreams of leveraging his corporate success to consult for museums, helping them navigate the digital age, or perhaps starting a small fund for emerging digital artists. He wants to ensure that in a city obsessed with the future, the stories of the past aren't just archived, but truly understood and felt."

The low hum of her potter\u2019s wheel was a steady counterpoint to his father\u2019s calm voice. It wasn\u2019t a clash, but a harmony. That day, he understood that structure could give shape to creativity, a lesson that would one day define his entire career.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, at a loud launch party in a SoMa warehouse. He stood clutching a warm beer, feeling utterly invisible amidst talk of IPOs and server architecture. He\u2019d just come from a gallery where a new piece had moved him to tears, but here, that world felt ancient and irrelevant. The loneliness was sharp. It forged a quiet resolve in him: to prove that story and meaning were not just luxuries, but necessities, even in a world obsessed with code.\n\n3.\nHis first day at the startup in 2005. An engineer showed him a screen\u2014a chaotic, endless scroll of user photos, raw and untagged. The engineer saw a data problem; Adam saw a thousand untold stories. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, a profound calm settled over him. It was a library waiting for its curator. For the first time since college, he felt not just useful, but essential. He had found his language, a way to translate human experience for the machine.\n\n4.\nHe remembers sitting on the floor of their old Potrero Hill apartment five years ago, dividing their books. There were no tears, just a quiet, shared sadness. His then-wife took the travelogues; he kept the art history texts. Handing her a favorite novel, he felt not a tearing apart, but a gentle uncoupling. The silence that followed her departure wasn't empty. It was the start of a new, quieter independence, a space he would have to learn to furnish on his own terms.\n\n5.\nLast month, standing on his Hayes Valley balcony after seeing an exhibition at SFMOMA. The city hummed below\u2014the chime from the nearby symphony hall, the murmur from a packed restaurant. He felt a deep contentment, yet a new question surfaced. He had spent his career curating the fleeting digital present. Now, he felt a powerful pull to do the same for something more permanent. He wanted to use his skills not just to organize data, but to preserve beauty."
