Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she was the dutiful daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who equated success with stability. Her father, a mechanic, and her mother, a bookkeeper, preached the virtues of a secure job and a sensible path, lessons Chloe absorbed even as her heart pulled her elsewhere.\n\nAt San Francisco State University, she fell in love with Sociology, fascinated by the complex architecture of human communities and the stories held within. She envisioned a future working for a non-profit, advocating for immigrant families or housing rights\u2014work that felt tangible and meaningful. But upon graduation, the reality of San Francisco's cost of living and the scarcity of well-paying non-profit jobs hit hard. With student loans looming, she took a \"temporary\" job as a claims adjuster at a large insurance firm, a position secured through a family friend.\n\nSeven years later, Chloe is 30, and the temporary has become permanent. Her 0.0-mile commute is from her bed to a desk in the corner of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are a disembodied stream of data: reviewing photos of car wrecks, reading medical reports, and poring over property damage assessments. The human tragedies she once hoped to alleviate are now reduced to claim numbers and settlement figures.\n\nTo counteract the sterile nature of her work, Chloe has cultivated a quiet life. Her connection to San Francisco isn't through trendy bars but through long, solitary walks in Golden Gate Park and the familiar comfort of the dim sum parlors on Clement Street she\u2019s visited since childhood. Her main social outlet is a weekly pottery class, where the tactile, messy process of shaping clay feels like a necessary rebellion against her digital existence. It\u2019s there, among a small group of other creatives, that she feels most like her younger self.\n\nChloe\u2019s dream isn\u2019t dead, just dormant. She meticulously saves a portion of her salary, harboring a quiet hope of one day transitioning into a role with more direct human impact, perhaps as a paralegal for a legal aid society. For now, she finds meaning in small acts, adjusting a claim with a little more empathy than required, understanding the story behind the numbers, and waiting for the right moment to turn her own life story in a new direction."
