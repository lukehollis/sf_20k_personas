The daughter of Filipino-Chinese immigrants, she grew up behind the counter of her family\u2019s small grocery store in the Outer Sunset. She watched her parents work punishing hours, their lives a constant negotiation with suppliers and razor-thin margins. While her peers were focused on college applications, Anjali was fascinated by the \"For Sale\" signs that seemed to promise a different kind of life. School felt abstract; the tangible value of a three-bedroom home with an ocean view was crystal clear.\n\nJust after high school, Anjali bypassed college and poured her energy into getting a real estate license, starting as an assistant at a large firm. She was relentless, absorbing every nuance of contracts, escrow, and, most importantly, the art of the deal. Her turning point came during the 2008 financial crisis. While seasoned agents floundered, Anjali saw opportunity in the wreckage, becoming an expert in short sales and foreclosures. She worked tirelessly, building a reputation for unflinching honesty and resilience. That brutal trial by fire forged her into the broker she is today.\n\nBy 35, she had her broker\u2019s license and founded Tan Realty Group, a boutique firm specializing in the complex residential market from Noe Valley to the Marina. Her success, however, came at a personal cost; her first and only marriage buckled under the weight of her 80-hour work weeks. Now, at 42, Anjali is a powerhouse. Her daily routine begins at 5 a.m. with market analysis before she drives her Audi from her meticulously restored West Portal Edwardian home to her office.\n\nThough financially secure, Anjali dreams of legacy. She wants to mentor young, hungry agents, particularly women of color who see a reflection of their own ambition in her. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she doesn't just sell property here, she sells the dream of belonging that she herself fought so hard to achieve, one closing at a time."

Anjali glanced across the street at a weathered \"For Sale\" sign. In that moment, the abstract hope of a lottery ticket felt flimsy and foolish compared to the tangible promise of that property. It wasn't about luck; it was about ownership. That was the day she decided her future wouldn't be left to chance or desperation.\n\n2.\nIt was 2008, and she was 27. Anjali sat across from a couple who had just signed the papers on their foreclosed home in the Richmond. The wife silently handed her the keys, her eyes hollow with grief. While it was a major closing that solidified her career, the victory tasted like ash. Anjali swore then to never see a transaction as just numbers on a page. That painful memory became the bedrock of her unflinching honesty and empathy.\n\n3.\nThe fight with her husband was about another missed dinner. She was 34, and her phone buzzed\u2014a critical counter-offer on a Noe Valley Victorian. She reached for it instinctively. The look of quiet resignation on his face broke her heart. He didn't have to say a word; she understood she had already made an irreversible choice. The silence that followed was heavier and more final than any closing she\u2019d ever navigated, cementing the personal cost of her ambition.\n\n4.\nHer first night in the West Portal Edwardian, around age 38, was impossibly quiet. No furniture, just the echo of her footsteps and the scent of paint and polished old wood. She sat on the floor, looking at the city lights, and thought of her parents behind their grocery counter. This house wasn't just a symbol of success; it was the physical manifestation of safety, the profound peace of belonging she had been chasing her entire life. She was finally home.\n\n5.\nLast year, a new agent, a bright young woman from Oakland, was near tears after a difficult deal collapsed. Anjali took her for coffee and, for the first time, shared the grueling story of her own trial-by-fire during the 2008 crisis. Watching the spark of resilience return to the young woman's eyes, Anjali saw a reflection of her own hunger. In that moment, her focus shifted from closing deals to building a legacy. This\u2014passing on her fire\u2014felt more valuable than any commission."
