While his father, a union electrician, valued tangible skills, Denis found his calling in the logical, ethereal world of early home computers. He was the family\u2019s designated tech support before the term was commonplace, spending hours dissecting PCs in their basement.\n\nDespite his aptitude, he swerved academically, pursuing a Philosophy degree at UMass Amherst. He was fascinated by logic systems and ethics, but post-graduation, the realities of student debt loomed larger than Plato. His basement hobby proved more lucrative. Starting on a help desk, his calm demeanor and innate ability to diagnose problems saw him rise quickly. He earned certifications on his own time, methodically climbing the ladder from junior support to network administrator.\n\nThe key turning point came at 28. A San Francisco tech firm offered him a system administrator role that doubled his salary. He packed two suitcases, leaving behind his tight-knit family and the life he knew for the promise of the West Coast. In SF, he thrived professionally, becoming the dependable, unseen force keeping complex systems online. He was good at his job because he treated server architecture like a philosophical argument: every piece had to be sound for the whole to be true.\n\nNow 39, Denis\u2019s world has condensed. His senior role is fully remote, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to his desk in his Inner Richmond apartment. His San Francisco is not the glittering skyline but the fog rolling down Clement Street, the quiet trails in the Presidio, and the familiar warmth of his preferred coffee shop. A significant five-year relationship dissolved a few years back, the breakup quiet but final, centering on her desire for suburbs and a family, a life he couldn\u2019t quite picture for himself.\n\nHis days follow a steady rhythm: a morning walk for coffee, the intense focus of putting out digital fires, and an evening run through Golden Gate Park to decompress. He hopes for a future defined by stability, not disruption. He dreams of saving enough to retire early, perhaps buying a small plot of land in Oregon. Lately, he\u2019s been thinking of taking a woodworking class\u2014a desire to build something tangible, a perfect counterpoint to a career spent managing the invisible."
