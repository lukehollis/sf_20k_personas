Raised by a high school history teacher and a union-leading longshoreman, his childhood home was a place of lively debate, where discussions about civic duty and systemic inequality were as common as Sunday dinner. He saw firsthand the power of collective action and the quiet dignity of working-class resilience, which planted the seeds for his future path.\n\nWhile academically gifted, Darius was initially adrift. He pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology at UCLA, fascinated by social structures but unsure of his place within them. The turning point came during a summer internship with a tenants' rights organization in Los Angeles. He spent weeks canvassing, translating dense legal codes into plain language for families facing eviction. Securing a rent-controlled apartment for a single mother and her two children was a profound experience; it wasn't just a win, it was justice made tangible. This crystallized his purpose, leading him to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Public Policy.\n\nNow 37, Darius is a Senior Program Manager for a San Francisco-based non-profit focused on youth advocacy and educational equity. His Lower Haight apartment doubles as his office, a space filled with books on urban policy, photos of friends, and a well-used turntable. His zero-mile commute allows for a deliberate morning routine: a run through Duboce Park, followed by coffee and a croissant at a local cafe where the baristas know his order. His days are a mix of Zoom calls with city officials, grant writing, and mentoring junior staff.\n\nThough dedicated to his work, Darius maintains a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow activists, tech workers, and artists who ground him. Evenings often involve strategy sessions at a neighborhood bar or attending a community meeting. San Francisco is more than his home; it\u2019s his mission field. His ultimate dream is to launch his own organization, creating a direct pipeline for underserved youth into policy and civic leadership, ensuring the next generation has the tools to build a more just city."
