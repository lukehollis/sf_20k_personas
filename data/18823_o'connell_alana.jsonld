Born in Daly City to an Irish-American father, a union carpenter, and a Filipina-American mother, a nurse, her childhood was a vibrant blend of cultures, languages, and expectations. She learned early on how to navigate different worlds, a skill that would define her life\u2019s purpose.\n\nThe pivotal moment came during her teenage years. Her younger brother, struggling with his own mixed-race identity and undiagnosed anxiety, fell through the cracks of their under-resourced public school system. Alana found herself acting as his impromptu advocate, translator, and therapist, fighting to get him the support he needed. Witnessing the system's failures firsthand ignited a quiet fury in her, forging a path toward social work.\n\nShe stayed local for her undergraduate degree, earning a B.A. in Psychology from San Francisco State University before pursuing her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. She chose her specialty carefully: educational services. She wanted to *be* the person her brother never had.\n\nNow, at 25, Alana is an Associate Clinical Social Worker at a bustling high school in the Mission District, diligently working toward her full LCSW licensure. Her days are a whirlwind of counseling sessions with students grappling with everything from academic pressure and family conflict to immigration stress and identity crises. Her $82,000 salary demands a frugal lifestyle, but she makes it work.\n\nHer life is contained within a small, vibrant radius. She lives in a bright but cramped apartment in the Mission with two roommates, a graphic designer and a line cook. Her 1.1-mile commute is a cherished daily ritual, a walk past colorful murals and the scent of roasting coffee and fresh pan dulce. Evenings are for decompressing: a run through Dolores Park, cheap and delicious burritos, or a drink with friends at a neighborhood dive bar.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and purpose-driven. She sees both its progressive ideals and its stark inequities every day. Alana\u2019s dream isn\u2019t about wealth or status; it\u2019s about earning her license and eventually starting a non-profit dedicated to mental health support for multiracial and immigrant youth, building bridges for the kids who need them most."

She was sixteen, sitting beside her silent brother as a teacher dismissed his struggles as \"laziness.\" In that moment, watching her parents nod, lost between languages and systems, a hot, protective fury rose in her. She spoke up, her voice trembling but clear. It was the first time she realized being a bridge wasn't just about translating words, but translating needs. It was the moment that set her path on fire.\n\n2.\nIt happened last semester. A freshman named Mateo, who had only offered one-word answers for weeks, finally looked at her and spoke. He whispered about his dad's deportation hearing, the fear that lived in their tiny apartment. Alana just listened, the weight of his trust settling on her shoulders like a familiar cloak. It wasn\u2019t a victory, but a profound affirmation: she was exactly where she was supposed to be, holding a space that had never existed for her own family.\n\n3.\nShe was twenty, crammed in a carrel at SF State\u2019s library, a textbook on systemic inequality open before her. The academic language\u2014intersectionality, cultural competency\u2014wasn't dry theory; it was a name for the silent frustrations of her childhood. It was a name for her brother\u2019s pain. A wave of quiet, intense relief washed over her. Her family's story wasn\u2019t just a private struggle; it was a case study. And she was learning how to rewrite the ending for others.\n\n4.\nJust last week, walking home from school, the late afternoon sun hit a mural on Clarion Alley. The smell of frying carnitas mixed with jasmine from a window box. She passed a gleaming tech bus, then watched a family haggle for fruit at a corner stand. The city\u2019s jarring contradictions were all there in a single block. She felt a familiar pang\u2014a mix of fierce love and deep responsibility for this beautifully, achingly imperfect home. This was the work.\n\n5.\nShe remembers being ten, her dad standing over the stove, a worried look on his face as he tried to perfect her Lola\u2019s adobo recipe. The smell of soy sauce, vinegar, and bay leaves filled their Daly City kitchen. Her mom watched, laughing, offering advice in a mix of English and Tagalog. It wasn\u2019t Irish or Filipino; it was simply *their* home. In that warm, fragrant kitchen, Alana learned that love was the most essential ingredient for bridging any gap."
