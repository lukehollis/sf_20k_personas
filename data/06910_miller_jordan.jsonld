            "value": "Jordan Miller is a product of the Bay Area's cultural confluence. Born in Vallejo to an Irish-American shipwright and a Filipina immigrant nurse, his identity was never a simple checkbox. His upbringing was a blend of blue-collar pragmatism and the vibrant, communal warmth of his mother\u2019s heritage, usually centered around a table laden with lumpia and adobo.\n\nAcademically, Jordan pursued his passion, not a paycheck. At San Francisco State University, he lost himself in the past, earning a Bachelor's degree in History. He dreamed of a life in academia or museum curation, but the reality of Bay Area rent post-graduation was a brutal awakening. The turning point came during a six-month stint working at a bookstore, where he realized his history degree wasn't going to support him. On a friend\u2019s advice, he took a pragmatic pivot, enrolling in an IT certification program. He discovered an unexpected satisfaction in the clean, logical problem-solving of tech support\u2014a different kind of historical excavation, digging through digital logs instead of dusty archives.\n\nNow 28, Jordan is an IT Support Specialist for a downtown tech firm, though he\u2019s never seen the inside of his office. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is often confined to his cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are a disciplined routine: morning coffee, logging into the support queue, a midday walk to Golden Gate Park or for soup dumplings on Clement Street, and then back to the screen.\n\nHis social life is his anchor against the isolation of remote work. His core group consists of college friends, with whom he hosts a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game. It is here, as Dungeon Master, that his history degree finds its truest expression, as he meticulously crafts worlds and narratives for his friends to explore. He is content but not fully satisfied. His dream isn\u2019t to become a CTO, but to finally launch the history podcast he\u2019s been outlining for years, focusing on the forgotten stories of California. Jordan is a quiet, essential gear in San Francisco\u2019s tech engine, living a life of practical compromise while still hoping to one day write his own chapter back into the history he loves."
