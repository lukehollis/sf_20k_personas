            "value": "Maya Ling Davis is a product of two worlds: the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of the East Bay where she was raised, and the dense, intricate city she now calls home. Her father, an aerospace engineer, and her mother, a community college ESL teacher, instilled in her a unique blend of analytical thinking and a deep empathy for people\u2019s daily struggles. Growing up, she felt the limitations of suburbia keenly, spending hours in traffic or waiting for rides. A high school field trip to San Francisco, navigating the city\u2019s veins of BART and Muni, was a revelation; it planted the seed of a lifelong fascination with urban mobility.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Davis, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Urban Studies. She devoured theories on transit-oriented development and equitable access, seeing them not as academic concepts, but as solutions to the isolation she felt as a teen. After a competitive internship, she landed her dream job as a Transportation Planner for the city of San Francisco.\n\nThe key turning point in her career was the pandemic-era shift to remote work. With a 0.0-mile commute, Maya\u2019s connection to her own neighborhood, the Inner Richmond, deepened profoundly. Her apartment, once just a place to sleep, became her entire world. Her daily routine now revolves around this small radius: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, hours spent analyzing GIS data and public transit feedback from her desk, and an afternoon run through the nearby Presidio or Golden Gate Park.\n\nHer work is no longer abstract. When she reviews proposals for a new bus-only lane or protected bike path, she pictures her elderly neighbors trying to cross the street or the young families heading to the park. She lives with her long-term partner, Alex, a graphic designer who helps ground her data-driven world with creative perspective. Maya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t just about optimizing bus schedules; it\u2019s about shaping a San Francisco where mobility is a right, not a privilege. She envisions a future where a person\u2019s zip code doesn\u2019t determine their access to the city\u2019s opportunities, a future she is meticulously planning, one route at a time, from the quiet of her own home."
