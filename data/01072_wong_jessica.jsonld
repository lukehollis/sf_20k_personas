Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she is the daughter of first-generation Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the city's diverse chorus outside, defined by long hours helping her parents and a deep-seated appreciation for hard work and family obligation.\n\nThis sense of duty, however, warred with a passion for the abstract. Eschewing a practical business degree, Jessica enrolled at San Francisco State University and earned a Bachelor's in Art History. She dreamed of curating exhibits at the de Young Museum, of a life surrounded by beauty and historical narrative. The turning point came swiftly after graduation. Faced with student loans and the city\u2019s staggering cost of living, the unpaid internships in the art world felt like an impossible luxury. A temp agency placed her in a downtown real estate firm as an administrative assistant, a \"temporary\" solution that solidified into a decade-long career.\n\nNow at 33, Jessica lives in a tidy one-bedroom apartment in NoPa, just blocks from the panhandle. Her 0.0-mile commute is a modern reality; her dining table doubles as her office desk, where she expertly manages schedules and paperwork for a team of high-powered agents. Her life is stable, shared with her long-term boyfriend, a laid-back software engineer named Leo. Weekends are for farmers' markets at the Ferry Building, long walks with their rescue corgi through Golden Gate Park, and quiet dinners with a close-knit circle of friends.\n\nThough content, the art history graduate still lives within her. Jessica\u2019s true dream isn\u2019t to climb the real estate ladder, but to save enough to one day open a small, independent gallery in a neighborhood like the Mission, showcasing emerging local artists. For now, she finds solace in visiting SFMOMA on free-admission days and running an anonymous art blog that has a small but devoted following. She loves the city that shaped her, but yearns to reclaim the piece of herself she set aside for practicality, hoping to one day blend her passion with the life she so carefully built."
