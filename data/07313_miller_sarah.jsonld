Raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, she was the practical daughter of an engineer and a librarian, a background that steeped her in a world of logic and order. Yet, her heart led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Art History at Michigan State, a choice driven by a love for beauty and narrative that seemed at odds with her upbringing.\n\nAfter college, the reality of the art world set in. A low-paying gallery assistant job in Chicago taught her that passion didn\u2019t always pay the bills. In a pragmatic move, she took a temp job in the shipping department of a large retailer. There, she discovered an unexpected satisfaction in untangling complex logistical puzzles. She had a natural talent for seeing patterns and creating efficiency, a dormant inheritance from her father. Over several years, she built a solid career in supply chain management, leaving her art degree as a relic of a past life.\n\nThe key turning point came at 38. A tech recruiter, impressed by her unique skill set, offered her a position as a logistics analyst for a burgeoning hardware startup in San Francisco. Seeking a significant life change after a long-term relationship ended, she accepted. She traded the Midwest for the West Coast, immersing herself in the fast-paced tech industry.\n\nNow 48, Sarah has carved out a tranquil existence in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days are defined by her neighborhood. Mornings begin with a walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park before she settles into her home office, a bright room in her classic Edwardian flat. She maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, preferring intimate dinner parties and weekend trips to Sonoma over the city's bustling nightlife.\n\nWhile content, Sarah dreams of synthesis. Her ultimate goal is to leverage her decade of tech logistics experience to consult for museums and international art galleries, ensuring the safe and efficient transport of priceless artifacts. It would be the perfect fusion of her two lives\u2014the final, elegant solution to the puzzle of her own unique path."
