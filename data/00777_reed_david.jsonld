He was not born into the chaotic charm of San Francisco, but into the ordered calm of suburban Portland, Oregon. The son of a civil engineer and a landscape architect, dinner table conversations were less about school gossip and more about the elegant efficiency of a well-designed bridge or the social impact of a new public park. This upbringing instilled in him a belief that a city\u2019s structure could fundamentally shape its citizens' happiness.\n\nHis path felt preordained. He pursued a Master of Urban Planning at UCLA, trading Portland\u2019s gentle rain for the sprawling complexity of Southern California. It was there he became fascinated by San Francisco, seeing it as the ultimate puzzle: a city of immense beauty and innovation hobbled by its own legacy systems and political friction. He arrived in his mid-twenties, an idealist ready to solve its housing crisis and streamline its transit.\n\nHis first years with the city planning department were a brutal education in bureaucracy. A turning point came during a contentious project to upzone a sleepy, single-family-home neighborhood. He spent months in heated community meetings, absorbing the vitriol of long-time residents and the desperation of young families seeking housing. The project ultimately stalled, but the experience solidified his resolve. It was no longer an academic exercise; it was a fight for the city's future.\n\nNow, at 30, David\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with his work. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his home office means the city he\u2019s planning is just outside his window. His days are a blur of Zoom calls and digital blueprints. To decompress, he walks. He wanders through the Mission to admire its murals and public life, or cycles through the Presidio, mentally redesigning intersections. He is recently single after a long-term relationship ended, the casualty of divergent life goals. His social life now revolves around a small circle of fellow policy wonks and architects. They meet for drinks in SoMa, their conversations inevitably circling back to their shared obsession: making this beautiful, impossible city just a little more livable. David\u2019s dream isn't to build skyscrapers, but to simply ensure a place like San Francisco has room for everyone."
