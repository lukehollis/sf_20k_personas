Raised in the pragmatic, rain-soaked suburbs of Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a civil engineer and a high school teacher. Her childhood was one of structured curiosity, defined by well-organized family road trips and dinner-table debates. Bucking her parents\u2019 practical expectations, she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History, fascinated by the stories objects and buildings could tell about a society's values and ambitions.\n\nUpon graduating, the romance of academia collided with economic reality. Heather took an assistant job at a commercial real estate firm in Portland, a role she initially despised. However, she soon discovered her art history skills were surprisingly transferable; she could analyze a building not just for its square footage, but for its potential narrative and place within the urban fabric. She was sharp, insightful, and quickly climbed the ladder. The 2008 financial crisis was her defining turning point. Watching the traditional real estate world crumble, she became obsessed with how technology could rebuild it\u2014smarter, faster, and more efficiently.\n\nThis obsession drew her to San Francisco in her late twenties. She leveraged her deep real estate knowledge to land an associate position at a venture capital firm with a budding interest in PropTech. She was relentless, outworking her peers and demonstrating a unique ability to bridge the gap between old-world property developers and young tech founders. Her rise to Principal was swift.\n\nNow, at 41, Heather\u2019s life is headquartered in her sleek Hayes Valley condo, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her standing desk overlooking the city. Her days are a disciplined marathon of Zoom pitches, financial modeling, and networking dinners. Her social circle is largely synonymous with her professional one, composed of other ambitious founders and VCs. A long-term relationship fizzled out years ago, a casualty of 80-hour work weeks.\n\nWhile she has achieved immense financial success, Heather aspires for more than just a high return. She dreams of funding a \"unicorn\" that genuinely tackles housing affordability, a legacy that would connect her high-finance present back to her early fascination with the foundational structures of society."
