The son of Filipino immigrants who settled in Fremont, David grew up straddling two worlds: the loud, communal warmth of his family home and the quiet, individualistic ambition of the Bay Area. His parents, a nurse and a postal worker, preached the gospel of stability, hoping he\u2019d become an engineer. David, however, was drawn to the past, graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in History, a choice that caused his parents quiet concern.\n\nThe reality of a historian\u2019s job market hit him hard after graduation. Adrift and feeling the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifices, David made a pragmatic pivot. He enrolled in a six-month IT certification bootcamp, discovering a surprising aptitude for troubleshooting complex systems. This led to his current role as an IT Support Specialist for a large, downtown-based tech firm. It was the stable, respectable job his parents had always wanted for him, even if it wasn't the one he'd dreamed of.\n\nA key turning point came with the pandemic, when his job went fully remote and never returned to the office. This is the origin of his 0.0-mile commute. His apartment, once just a place to sleep, became his office, cafeteria, and entire world. David\u2019s days are now a disciplined routine: log in at 8:59 AM, solve a queue of support tickets, break for a walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, and log off at 5:00 PM. His social life consists mainly of a weekly online Dungeons & Dragons campaign with old college friends and the occasional dinner with his family in the East Bay.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond, David feels connected to a version of San Francisco that is foggy, residential, and rich with the aroma of bakeries and dim sum. He loves his proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he takes long walks to escape the confines of his apartment. His dream is to save enough money to finally use his history degree\u2014not for a career, but for himself. He meticulously plans a solo trip to Japan, hoping to see the ancient temples and feudal castles he once only studied in books. David seeks a future where his life expands beyond his screen, hoping to find a connection as real and tangible as the history he still loves."
