The son of Filipino immigrants who settled in Fremont, David grew up straddling two worlds: the loud, communal warmth of his family home and the quiet, individualistic ambition of the Bay Area. His parents, a nurse and a postal worker, preached the gospel of stability, hoping he\u2019d become an engineer. David, however, was drawn to the past, graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in History, a choice that caused his parents quiet concern.\n\nThe reality of a historian\u2019s job market hit him hard after graduation. Adrift and feeling the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifices, David made a pragmatic pivot. He enrolled in a six-month IT certification bootcamp, discovering a surprising aptitude for troubleshooting complex systems. This led to his current role as an IT Support Specialist for a large, downtown-based tech firm. It was the stable, respectable job his parents had always wanted for him, even if it wasn't the one he'd dreamed of.\n\nA key turning point came with the pandemic, when his job went fully remote and never returned to the office. This is the origin of his 0.0-mile commute. His apartment, once just a place to sleep, became his office, cafeteria, and entire world. David\u2019s days are now a disciplined routine: log in at 8:59 AM, solve a queue of support tickets, break for a walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, and log off at 5:00 PM. His social life consists mainly of a weekly online Dungeons & Dragons campaign with old college friends and the occasional dinner with his family in the East Bay.\n\nLiving in the Inner Richmond, David feels connected to a version of San Francisco that is foggy, residential, and rich with the aroma of bakeries and dim sum. He loves his proximity to Golden Gate Park, where he takes long walks to escape the confines of his apartment. His dream is to save enough money to finally use his history degree\u2014not for a career, but for himself. He meticulously plans a solo trip to Japan, hoping to see the ancient temples and feudal castles he once only studied in books. David seeks a future where his life expands beyond his screen, hoping to find a connection as real and tangible as the history he still loves."

            "value": "1. He remembers the family dinner just after his UC Santa Cruz graduation. His mother brought out a huge tray of her famous pork lumpia, her pride palpable. But later, he overheard her telling his aunt, in Tagalog, \"History is nice, but I just worry.\" The worry in her voice, quieter than her pride but so much heavier, was the moment he knew his dream had become a liability to them. It planted the seed of pragmatism that would later define his career choice.\n\n2. Three months into his IT bootcamp, he was stumped by a complex network routing problem. After hours of staring at command lines, something finally clicked. He saw the logic, the pathway through the digital mess. The feeling wasn't the thrill of history, but a clean, quiet satisfaction. It was the first time since graduation he hadn't felt adrift. In that moment of clarity, he knew he could do this job. He could be stable. This was a skill that could earn his parents' peace of mind.\n\n3. He\u2019ll never forget the email in late 2020 confirming his job was now permanently remote. At first, he felt a jolt of relief\u2014no more crowded MUNI buses. But then, he looked around his small apartment, at the desk crammed near his kitchen. The walls seemed to subtly press in. His freedom from the commute suddenly felt like a new kind of confinement. That was the day his world officially shrank to 700 square feet, and his 0.0-mile commute began to feel infinitely long.\n\n4. After a brutal Tuesday spent on back-to-back support calls, he walked into Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in thick and deep. Surrounded by the scent of damp earth and the muffled silence of the mist, he felt completely untethered from his digital life. He reached out and touched the rough bark of a cypress tree. The tangible, grounding sensation was a profound relief, a reminder of the real, physical world he craved, a world that existed beyond his screen and keyboard.\n\n5. Last year, on a quiet Saturday, he opened a separate high-yield savings account. He typed the name \"Japan Trip\" and made the first transfer. It was a small, digital act, but it felt monumental. Seeing the balance, no matter how small, transformed his vague yearning into a concrete plan. His IT job was no longer just a compromise; it was the fuel. Every closed ticket, every disciplined login, was now a step toward seeing the stone walls of Himeji Castle with his own eyes."
