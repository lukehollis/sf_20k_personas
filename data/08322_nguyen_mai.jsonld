As the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, she grew up translating utility bills and absorbing the weight of her parents' sacrifices. Their dream for her was security, and Mai internalized this, channeling her ambition into education. She attended UC Berkeley, earning a business degree, and was the first in her family to graduate from college.\n\nHer early career during the dot-com bust was a trial by fire. She clung to a junior coordinator role at a hardware company, learning to navigate the volatile tech landscape. To get ahead, she pursued a part-time MBA from Santa Clara University, sacrificing weekends and evenings for six years. The hard work paid off, catapulting her into project management. Now, as a Senior Project Manager, she wrangles complex software rollouts from the comfort of her home office, a privilege she earned through decades of long commutes and late nights.\n\nA key turning point was her move to San Francisco in her early thirties, a deliberate break from the suburban expectations of the South Bay. The city offered an anonymity and cultural vibrancy she craved. Here, she built a life on her own terms, separate from her dutiful daughter role. Her social life is a curated tapestry of close friends\u2014a mix of college pals and former colleagues\u2014with whom she explores the city's ever-evolving food scene.\n\nHer daily routine is anchored by her neighborhood. The 0.0-mile commute means her day starts with a walk to a local cafe, followed by hours of focused remote work. Afternoons might include a Pilates class or a walk through Patricia's Green. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, Mai finds herself at a crossroads. She dreams of taking a sabbatical to travel through Southeast Asia, to connect with her roots not as a daughter, but as an individual. For now, she finds fulfillment in mentoring junior colleagues and perfecting her own version of her mother\u2019s pho, finally understanding the love and resilience that simmered in every bowl."
