The only son of Filipino immigrants, he was born and raised in the Excelsior District, a neighborhood where the rumble of the city felt both distant and ever-present. His father, a U.S. Navy veteran who later worked as a longshoreman, and his mother, a meticulous seamstress, instilled in Arthur a profound respect for hard work and tangible skills. While his friends chased tech dreams in the 90s, Arthur was fascinated by the mechanics of motion, the intricate dance of gears and engines that kept the city alive.\n\nHis educational path was direct and practical. He earned an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from the City College of San Francisco, a choice that felt more honest to him than a four-year university. He started as a mechanic for SFMTA, his hands covered in grease at the Kirkland bus yard. Arthur found deep satisfaction in diagnosing a failing transmission or fine-tuning an engine; it was a solvable puzzle that had a direct impact on thousands of lives daily. His reliability and deep knowledge led to a steady climb, and for the past eight years, he has served as a Maintenance Supervisor, overseeing a team that keeps a fleet of buses running.\n\nA key turning point was meeting his wife, Maria, a public school teacher, at a neighborhood potluck. They bonded over a shared, unglamorous dedication to the city's essential services. They bought a small home in the Outer Sunset, where they raised their daughter, now a student at SF State. Arthur\u2019s life is a rhythm of consistency. He wakes before dawn, taking the L Taraval to the yard, his 6.5-mile commute a daily quality-control inspection. He notices the specific rattle in car 1509 or the slight pull on a newer hybrid bus.\n\nArthur's dreams are grounded. He hopes to see his daughter graduate without crushing debt and wants to retire comfortably with Maria, perhaps taking a long-overdue trip back to the Philippines. Professionally, his greatest aspiration is to successfully oversee the full transition of his depot to zero-emission electric buses, leaving behind a legacy of a cleaner, more reliable system. He is the quiet engine of San Francisco, a man who doesn't code the future but ensures the city can physically get there."

When Arthur was ten, his father sat him down in their Excelsior garage and taught him to tie a bowline knot, explaining how that simple loop held thousands of pounds on the docks. Feeling the rough rope in his small hands, Arthur understood that real power wasn't abstract; it was tangible and functional. It was the moment he knew he wanted to work with the physical mechanics that held the world together.\n\n2.\nDuring the chaotic Muni meltdown of '98, Arthur was a rookie mechanic facing a yard full of dead buses. One articulated bus had a transmission fault no one could crack. He stayed 16 hours, grease to his elbows, finally tracing it to a single faulty sensor. Hearing that engine roar back to life in the pre-dawn quiet was a validation deeper than any paycheck. That night, he realized he wasn't just fixing a machine; he was restoring a city\u2019s artery.\n\n3.\nHe met Maria at a neighbor\u2019s potluck in the Sunset, a few years after starting at MTA. She wasn't talking about tech stocks; she was passionately defending the new budget for her public school\u2019s library. Arthur listened, recognizing the same fierce dedication he felt for his bus fleet. In her conviction, he saw his own purpose reflected. He fell in love not just with a person, but with a partner in the unglamorous, essential work of keeping the city running.\n\n4.\nHe remembers riding the L Taraval with his daughter when she was six, the fog thick outside their window. He pointed to the floor and told her, \"Papa checks the brakes on these so you're always safe.\" She looked up, her eyes wide with absolute trust. In that moment, his abstract sense of civic duty became fiercely personal. Every inspection, every repair, was a direct promise to his daughter and every other child on that train.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, commuting home on the L, he felt a faint, intermittent vibration in car 1509 that operators hadn't reported. He trusted his gut over the maintenance logs and had his team pull the car. They found a hairline fracture in an axle housing\u2014a catastrophic failure waiting to happen. There was no public praise, just the quiet satisfaction of knowing his deep, physical connection to the system had averted disaster. It affirmed that true management comes from your hands, not just a desk."
