Raised in a quiet, manicured suburb of Chicago, the son of a civil engineer and a librarian, his childhood was a study in order and predictability. This foundation fueled his academic path, leading him to a Master of Urban Planning from the University of Illinois. He saw cities not as chaotic messes, but as complex systems waiting to be optimized. San Francisco, with its chaotic topography and intractable social problems, was the ultimate puzzle, and he moved west in his late twenties, eager to solve it.\n\nFor his first decade working for the city\u2019s planning department, Michael thrived on the friction. He was in the field daily, mapping out transit-oriented developments, and attending heated community meetings in the Mission and the Sunset. He believed in the power of good policy to shape a more equitable city. The turning point was not a single event, but the slow grind of bureaucratic inertia and political compromise. The pandemic, and the subsequent shift to permanent remote work for his department, was an unexpected relief.\n\nNow, Michael\u2019s 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bed to a standing desk in the corner of his minimalist Hayes Valley apartment. His world has shrunk to fit his screen. His apartment is a command center, its walls adorned not with art, but with zoning maps and project timelines. His days are a blur of GIS data, policy drafts, and Zoom calls. He\u2019s more connected to the abstract idea of San Francisco\u2014its datasets and demographic trends\u2014than the living city outside his window. His social life has similarly contracted, mostly limited to drinks with a small circle of fellow policy wonks where they debate the merits of density bonuses and road diets.\n\nMichael\u2019s connection to San Francisco is now purely intellectual. He analyzes the city but rarely experiences it. His dream remains to see a major, transformative project he designed come to fruition\u2014a tangible legacy etched into the city's blueprint. Privately, however, he yearns for something simpler: to feel the effortless belonging of a native, to shed the detached perspective of the planner, and to find a connection to his chosen home that can\u2019t be quantified on a spreadsheet."
