Born in El Salvador and adopted as a toddler by a loving, working-class couple from San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, she carries the surname of her adoptive parents but holds onto the first name from her birth country. Her upbringing was modest but stable, steeped in the practicality of her parents\u2014a postal worker and a seamstress\u2014who taught her the value of a steady hand and a reliable day\u2019s work. Her formal education ended with a GED, as academic pursuits never held the same appeal as tangible, real-world skills.\n\nAfter high school, Priya navigated a patchwork of early jobs in retail and food service, feeling adrift. The true turning point came with the birth of her son, Leo. As a single mother, her priorities snapped into sharp focus. She needed stability, decent hours, and benefits. A flyer for SFUSD transportation services caught her eye, and she discovered a surprising aptitude for maneuvering the city\u2019s challenging streets. For over twenty years, she has been a school bus driver, a career born of necessity that blossomed into a quiet vocation.\n\nNow at 49, Priya\u2019s life is one of dependable routine. Her 0.0-mile commute is no data error; she lives in a small, tidy apartment in the Bayview, just a few blocks from the bus depot. Her mornings start before dawn with the familiar scent of coffee and diesel as she performs her pre-trip inspection. She knows every child on her route, their parents, and even their family dogs. To them, she is \u201cMs. Priya,\u201d a quiet pillar of their daily lives. Her social circle is small but tight, consisting of a few other drivers and neighbors who share coffee on their front steps.\n\nWith Leo now grown and working in tech downtown, Priya finds herself with more time for quiet reflection. Her dreams are not extravagant. She hopes to save enough to finally visit El Salvador, not to search for a past she can\u2019t remember, but simply to see the landscape of her origins. More than anything, she looks forward to a simple, peaceful retirement in the city that has been her steadfast home, content in the knowledge that she safely carried a generation of San Francisco\u2019s children toward their future."
