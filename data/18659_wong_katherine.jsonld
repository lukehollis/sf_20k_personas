Raised in a quiet suburb of Chicago by loving but emotionally guarded parents, Katherine always felt like an observer of feelings rather than a participant. She moved to San Francisco in her early twenties, not for a grand purpose, but for the simple promise of change, landing a generic marketing job that paid the bills.\n\nIt was here she met David Wong. Their relationship was a whirlwind of passion and discovery, culminating in marriage at 25. But the same intensity that brought them together eventually pulled them apart. Their divorce at 28 was her life\u2019s great turning point. Navigating the emotional wreckage, Katherine began therapy herself and discovered the language for the feelings her upbringing had never taught her to name.\n\nThis transformative experience became her new calling. She quit her corporate job and enrolled in a Master of Arts program in Counseling Psychology. Now, at 36, Katherine is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) working for a non-profit that provides mental health services in public schools. Her days are spent helping children and families navigate complex emotional landscapes, a role she finds deeply fulfilling.\n\nKatherine lives in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is a ritual of balance: a foggy morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by a 2.8-mile Muni ride to a school in the Western Addition, often with a psychology podcast playing in her earbuds. Evenings are for decompressing\u2014yoga, cooking, or meeting a small circle of close friends for pho on Clement Street.\n\nSan Francisco is no longer just a place of escape; it's the city that broke her open and allowed her to rebuild herself. Her dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on helping young adults through major life transitions. Katherine Wong is a study in resilience, a woman who found her true self not by avoiding life\u2019s fractures, but by learning how to mend them."

It wasn\u2019t just sadness that hit her, but a vast, terrifying emptiness. In that silence, she realized she had no idea who she was without him. It was the moment the wreckage became real, the quiet, hollow ground zero from which she would have to rebuild her entire life. This happened just after the divorce at 28.\n\n2.\nAt 29, sitting in a therapist's office in Hayes Valley, she was asked a simple question: \"What does that grief feel like in your body?\" No one had ever asked her that. The question unlocked something deep and guarded. She finally wept\u2014not just for her marriage, but for a lifetime of unnamed feelings. That session was the first time she felt truly seen. It wasn't just healing; it was an education, the first lesson in the emotional language she would later dedicate her life to teaching others.\n\n3.\nShe vividly recalls walking out of her downtown marketing office for the last time at 30, her box of personal items feeling ridiculously light. The Financial District buzz seemed distant, unreal. A wave of pure terror washed over her, followed instantly by a giddy, unshakeable sense of freedom. She wasn't just quitting a job; she was shedding a skin that no longer fit. That walk to the Muni stop was the first real step into a life she was intentionally choosing, not just enduring.\n\n4.\nOn a foggy Tuesday morning around age 33, walking past the Conservatory of Flowers, the usual quiet felt different. The damp air and muffled sounds of the city didn't feel isolating; they felt like a comforting embrace. She stopped, breathing in the scent of eucalyptus and earth, and realized the city was no longer the backdrop to her heartbreak. It was her home, a quiet witness that had held her while she fell apart and was now holding her as she healed. It was a moment of profound, peaceful belonging.\n\n5.\nLast year, a quiet third-grader she\u2019d been working with for months finally looked up from his drawing and said, \u201cI feel sad because my chest feels tight.\u201d Katherine\u2019s own breath caught. She saw her younger self in him\u2014an observer, unable to name the feeling inside. In that small office, she wasn\u2019t just a therapist; she was the adult she had once needed. The moment was a quiet confirmation that her own deepest wound had become her greatest gift to give."
