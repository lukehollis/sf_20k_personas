Born in San Francisco, his upbringing was a patchwork of third-floor walk-ups and the constant hum of a city that never fully slept. His mother, a resilient woman who worked two jobs to keep them afloat, instilled in him a powerful work ethic, but formal education was a casualty of their circumstances. Lei left high school at 17, his diploma an abstract concept compared to the immediate need for rent money. His education came from the city itself: loading trucks in the Bayview, washing dishes in North Beach, and learning the intricate language of San Francisco\u2019s streets.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life arrived at age 20 when he was hired as a street cleaner for the Department of Public Works. It was more than a job; it was an anchor. For the first time, he felt part of the city\u2019s essential machinery. Lei was a quick study and a tireless worker, moving from cleaning to road repair crews, and eventually to utility maintenance. He never earned a degree, but over two decades, he earned a deep, institutional knowledge of the city\u2019s infrastructure. This practical expertise led to his promotion to Operations Coordinator, a role he earned through respect, not credentials.\n\nNow 46, Lei\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with his work. He lives in a small, quiet apartment adjacent to the DPW\u2019s central yard in the Dogpatch, his 0.0-mile commute a walk across a paved lot. His daily routine is dictated by the city's needs: dispatching crews before dawn to fix a burst water main or coordinating pothole repairs after a winter storm. His social life consists of grabbing beers with his crew after a long shift at a nearby brewery. He was once married, but the union buckled under the weight of his unwavering dedication to his job.\n\nLei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is visceral. He doesn\u2019t see the iconic skyline; he sees the electrical grid that powers it and the sewer lines that run beneath it. His dreams are modest. He hopes to see the city he maintains run smoothly, with his crews working safely. Privately, he saves for a small boat, aspiring to a future where he can finally leave the land he has spent his life mending and find peace on the quiet waters of the Bay."
