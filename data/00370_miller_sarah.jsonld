Her childhood was shaped by her mother\u2019s long battle with a chronic illness, making hospitals and the language of care a familiar landscape. While her friends were at the mall, Sarah was learning to navigate insurance paperwork and provide steady, emotional support. This early immersion in the healthcare system planted the seed for her calling, steering her away from more conventional paths.\n\nShe pursued her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, drawn to the Bay Area's progressive energy. After graduating, Sarah threw herself into the high-stakes environment of a major San Francisco hospital. For two decades, she was on the front lines, guiding families through devastating diagnoses, end-of-life decisions, and the bureaucratic maze of medical care. She was good at it, but the emotional cost was immense. The turning point was the pandemic; the unrelenting tide of grief and systemic failure pushed her to a breaking point.\n\nSeeking sustainability, Sarah pivoted to a fully remote medical social worker role for a large healthcare provider. Now, her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to a sunlit corner of her living room. Her apartment in the Inner Richmond is her sanctuary. Days begin with the cool Pacific fog during a walk with her rescue terrier in Golden Gate Park. She then spends hours on calls, coordinating patient care and offering counsel, her calm voice a lifeline through the phone.\n\nA decade past the end of a long-term relationship, Sarah has cultivated a rich, independent life. Her social circle is a small, tight-knit group of friends, bonded over book club meetings and potlucks. She feels deeply connected to her neighborhood, frequenting the local bakeries and knowing the Clement Street grocers by name. Her aspiration is no longer about career advancement, but about reclamation. She dreams of taking a pottery class, of traveling to Spain not for a conference, but to walk the Camino de Santiago, and simply having the energy to tend to a small balcony garden\u2014finding ways to pour care back into herself."
