Raised in the green, drizzly suburbs of Portland, Oregon, to a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his childhood was one of predictable comfort. He was a quiet, observant kid, more interested in taking apart old electronics to understand their logic than in team sports. This curiosity led him not to computer science, but to Cognitive Science at UC Santa Cruz, where he became fascinated with the intersection of the human mind and the digital tools shaping it.\n\nHis key turning point was landing a research assistant position at a major San Francisco tech firm right after graduation. The offer was a dream, the culmination of his unique academic focus. However, he started the job remotely during the tail end of the pandemic, and the company\u2019s promised \"return to office\" date was pushed back indefinitely until it became permanent policy for his team. Consequently, his commute is a ten-step walk from his bed to his desk.\n\nHis daily routine is one of quiet discipline. Mornings start with a ritualistic walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, the day\u2019s main point of human interaction. The rest of his hours are spent analyzing user data, compiling reports on interface usability, and participating in video calls where he\u2019s often the youngest person in the virtual room. Socially, he feels adrift; his work colleagues are distant avatars, and his few college friends are scattered across the Bay. He\u2019s tried dating apps, but finds the impersonal nature of swiping to be an ironic reflection of the systems he critiques at work.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is aspirational. He loves the city from his window\u2014the fog rolling over Twin Peaks, the distant clang of a cable car. He runs through Alamo Square in the evenings, an anonymous figure among many. His dream isn't to be a coder or an executive, but to lead a research team focused on creating more ethical, human-centric technology. He hopes to one day break out of his digital bubble, to build a life as vibrant and connected as the city just outside his door, but for now, he remains a researcher in every sense, observing the world more than he participates in it."
