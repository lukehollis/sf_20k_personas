Born to Iranian immigrants who had established a life in Silicon Valley\u2014his father an electrical engineer, his mother a celebrated baker\u2014Ashkan grew up straddling two worlds. At home, the air was filled with the scent of saffron and the lyrical rhythm of Farsi. At school, it was the relentless drive of tech innovation and American ambition. While his parents hoped he\u2019d follow a stable path into engineering, Ashkan was captivated by the art, music, and poetry his family cherished as a cultural lifeline, not a career.\n\nThis gentle rebellion defined his educational journey. He pursued Art History as an undergraduate at UC Davis, a choice that caused loving friction with his family. He proved his practicality, however, by earning a graduate degree in Arts Administration from the University of Chicago, framing his passion within a structure his pragmatic father could understand. He returned to the Bay Area, drawn not to the tech campuses of his youth, but to the cultural heart of San Francisco.\n\nHis career began with internships at small galleries in the Mission, followed by a role as a program coordinator at a mid-sized museum. A key turning point was developing a successful series that merged digital art with traditional performance, catching the eye of a major scientific foundation. Now, as the Director of Public Programs for the prestigious Bay Area Institute for Innovation, he curates the intersection of science, art, and public discourse, creating events that challenge and inspire a city often divided by its own success.\n\nAshkan lives in a well-loved one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His daily 2.8-mile bicycle commute is a meditative ritual, a coast past boutique windows and bustling parklets. His social life is a rich tapestry of artists, tech workers, and fellow third-culture kids. He\u2019s close with his parents, who are now immensely proud, often attending his events and marveling at the world he has built.\n\nHis core aspiration is to make San Francisco\u2019s intellectual and cultural capital accessible to everyone, not just the privileged. He dreams of launching a city-wide festival that bridges the gap between STEM and the humanities, ensuring the soul of the city thrives alongside its booming industries. For Ashkan, San Francisco is not just a home; it's a grand, complex project he is passionately dedicated to improving."

Ashkan didn\u2019t look up from his sketchbook, where he was trying to capture the jewel-like seeds of a pomegranate. The silence was heavy with his father\u2019s disappointment and Ashkan\u2019s own quiet guilt. It wasn't loud defiance, but a painful, necessary act of self-preservation. That moment cemented his resolve to follow a path his heart understood, even if his family didn't yet.\n\n2. He was twenty-five, sweeping confetti off the floor of a tiny Mission gallery, long after the unpaid internship opening had ended. For a fleeting second, the thought, *my father was right*, was a cold weight in his chest. But then he looked at the vibrant, chaotic paintings on the wall, still buzzing with energy. A profound sense of purpose washed over him. This struggle, he realized, was more fulfilling than any stable success he had been expected to chase.\n\n3. The opening night of his digital art series, his father, the engineer, stood mesmerized. On stage, a dancer\u2019s movements were traced by light, a projection-mapped symphony Ashkan had curated. Afterwards, his father didn\u2019t just say he was proud; he asked how the projectors were synced with the motion sensors. It was true engagement, a bridge built between their two worlds. In that moment, the teenage guilt Ashkan had carried for years finally dissolved completely.\n\n4. It was an ordinary Tuesday last spring, biking home. As he coasted down Fell Street, the golden hour light ignited the windows of the Victorians. He passed the murmur of conversation spilling from a parklet and the distant sound of a saxophone from Patricia\u2019s Green. He wasn't just commuting; he was moving through the veins of a city he knew intimately. A simple, overwhelming feeling washed over him: *this is home*. It was a quiet confirmation, more powerful than any professional achievement.\n\n5. At a sterile tech gala two years ago, he overheard two programmers discussing AI ethics with a brilliance that excited him. But the room felt like a fortress. He thought of a poet he knew in the Mission grappling with the same questions through verse, and the two would never meet. A sudden, urgent clarity struck him. His job wasn't just to curate events; it was to tear down the walls between these fortresses. The idea for his festival was born then, not from ambition, but from necessity."
