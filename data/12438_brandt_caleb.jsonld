The son of a pragmatic civil engineer and a detail-oriented librarian, he spent his youth observing the inefficiencies of his surroundings. While his friends were obsessed with getting their driver's licenses, Caleb was fascinated by maps, tracing the winding cul-de-sacs and arterial roads, mentally redesigning them for walkability. This innate desire to fix broken systems defined his path. He pursued an undergraduate degree at CU Boulder before moving to Los Angeles for his Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, where he had a pivotal realization: traditional planning was too slow. A forward-thinking professor introduced him to the power of quantitative analysis, and Caleb quickly pivoted, diving into data science to model urban life with predictive precision.\n\nAfter a few years working in LA, he felt stifled by the city\u2019s immovable car culture. San Francisco, for all its faults, was a living laboratory for the future he wanted to build. He accepted a senior position as a Mobility Data Scientist, eager to apply his skills to a city actively grappling with transportation challenges. Today, Caleb lives his professional ethos. He resides in a thoughtfully organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he chose for its central location and vibrant, walkable streets.\n\nHis mornings begin with coffee from a local cafe before he hops on his bicycle for the 4.5-mile commute, often combining it with a Muni train ride. At work, he wrangles vast datasets from city sensors and transit apps, building models to predict traffic flow or optimize bus routes. His six-figure income affords him a comfortable life, but he lives with intention, preferring to spend his money on experiences over possessions. Evenings are for running in Golden Gate Park or decompressing at a bouldering gym, followed by quiet dinners with a close-knit group of friends who work in adjacent fields like architecture and environmental policy.\n\nAt 36, Caleb feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2014he loves its progressive energy but is acutely aware of the systemic inequities his data reveals daily. His ultimate aspiration isn't a promotion, but to lead a project that tangibly improves the lives of all residents, creating a more equitable and sustainable transit system. He hopes to find a partner who shares this vision, building a life as thoughtfully designed as the city he works every day to improve."

Lines of light, representing people, flowed through a digital Los Angeles like blood through veins. Caleb felt a jolt\u2014a feeling of seeing the future. In that moment, the slow, abstract world of urban planning felt archaic. The elegant, brutal truth of data was where real change lived. It set the entire course of his career. This was in his mid-twenties.\n\n2.\nHis first commute in San Francisco. He\u2019d meticulously planned the route: a 2-mile bike ride to a Muni Metro stop. He felt a surge of satisfaction cycling through the Wiggle. But then, on the train platform, the system revealed itself\u2014crowded, delayed, a chaotic ballet of humanity. He wasn't an observer analyzing a dataset anymore; he was a data point himself, pressed between a tourist and a tired construction worker. The abstraction of his work met reality, grounding his professional purpose in a powerful, humbling way. This was at age 30.\n\n3.\nA run in Golden Gate Park one evening last year. The fog was rolling in, thick and low, catching the last of the sunset and turning the air a hazy gold. He stopped near the Conservatory of Flowers, breathing in the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth. All the city\u2019s complex problems\u2014the traffic models, the equity gaps\u2014dissolved into a simple, profound sense of peace. That feeling of pure, natural beauty existing within the urban grid is why he stays. It\u2019s the soul of the city he works to protect.\n\n4.\nHe can still see the woman\u2019s exhausted face. He was heading home through a downtown station when he saw her, elderly and carrying two heavy grocery bags, staring at the long, still stairs of a broken escalator. He helped her, but the image seared into his mind. His models optimized for flow and efficiency, but they didn\u2019t capture the acute failure of a system for one person. From that day on, his work became less about averages and more about ensuring the system served its most vulnerable users.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, over dinner with his friends\u2014an architect and an environmental policy advisor. The conversation devolved into a shared venting session about bureaucratic inertia and the sheer scale of the city's problems. For a moment, Caleb felt a familiar wave of despair. But looking at them, both fighting their own battles against the same tide, it transformed into camaraderie. He felt the weight of his mission shift from a solitary burden to a shared, achievable goal. He wasn't alone in trying to fix this place."
