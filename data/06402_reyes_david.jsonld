            "value": "David Reyes is a product of San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, born and raised. The son of first-generation Mexican immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood carnicer\u00eda, David\u2019s childhood was a mix of Spanish spoken at home, the scent of fresh bread from the panader\u00eda next door, and the rumble of the 14 Mission bus. He was a bright, artistic kid who sketched in notebooks and dreamed of a life beyond the family business.\n\nAfter graduating from Mission High, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, intending to study graphic design. However, his journey was cut short. When his father suffered a major health crisis, David, as the eldest son, dropped out of college to help his mother run the carnicer\u00eda. The temporary measure became permanent. He learned business not from textbooks but from vendors, long-time customers, and the unforgiving reality of thin profit margins. This was his true education.\n\nAfter his father passed away, his mother sold the shop. Freed from that specific duty but armed with a decade of retail savvy, David leveraged his experience. He worked his way up the ladder at various stores, from a big-box retailer to a trendy boutique in Hayes Valley, where he is now the manager. His calm demeanor and innate understanding of people make him a natural leader.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s life is defined by a quiet, hyperlocal routine. He was incredibly fortunate to find a small, rent-stabilized apartment directly above the shop he manages, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His world exists within a ten-block radius. He knows the baristas, the dry cleaner, and the bartenders by name. His social circle is small but loyal, consisting of a few childhood friends and work colleagues.\n\nWhile he\u2019s content, a persistent dream simmers beneath the surface. He hopes to one day save enough to open his own small store\u2014not a butcher shop, but perhaps one selling vintage vinyl and local art, a tribute to the passion he set aside years ago. For David, San Francisco isn't a tech playground; it\u2019s a city of ghosts, memories, and the enduring hope of building something of his own."
