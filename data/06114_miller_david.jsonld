            "value": "David Miller is a product of the fog-laced Outer Sunset, a neighborhood he has never truly left. Born and raised in a small, pastel-colored house just blocks from Ocean Beach, his upbringing was modest. His father was a Muni driver who knew the city\u2019s every hill and his mother a secretary for a downtown law firm. David was never an academic star; he was the kid who took apart the family radio and actually managed to put it back together, better than before.\n\nAfter graduating from a local high school, he bypassed the four-year university route, instead earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Electronics from City College of San Francisco. In his twenties, David fell into the local music scene, working as a freelance sound technician for punk and indie bands playing in grimy clubs across the Mission and SoMa. It was an exciting, if precarious, existence. The turning point came around age 30. Tired of late nights and inconsistent pay, he sought stability. He found it in an opening for an Audio-Visual Technician with the San Francisco Unified School District, assigned to the very K-8 school he could see from his childhood bedroom window.\n\nHe and his then-wife used their modest savings to buy his parents' home in the late 90s, a decision that cemented his place in the city. The marriage eventually dissolved amicably; she wanted to see the world, while David\u2019s world was his ten-block radius. They have one daughter, now a graphic designer living in Oakland, who is his greatest pride.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is governed by the school bell. His commute is a three-minute walk. He\u2019s the calm presence who fixes the uncooperative smartboard, untangles microphone cords before an assembly, and ensures the history teacher\u2019s documentary can be heard in the back row. His social life consists of nods to neighbors, conversations with teachers in the staff lounge, and a weekly call with his daughter. He misses the old, grittier San Francisco but finds a quiet contentment in his routine. His dream isn't to launch a startup or travel the globe; it's to retire with his pension in the same foggy quiet he has always known, perhaps finally restoring the vintage amplifier that has sat in his garage for a decade."
