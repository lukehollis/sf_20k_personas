His early years were steeped in stories and sea salt, a childhood of two cultures that, to him, were one. The collapse of the Soviet Union fractured this unity, not with a bang, but with a slow, grinding erosion of identity and stability. In his late teens, his family made the difficult choice to emigrate, chasing a distant cousin\u2019s promise of opportunity in America.\n\nThey landed in Sacramento, where Alexei\u2019s world shrank to the confines of a small apartment and the bewildering aisles of American grocery stores. His foreign education, rich in literature and mathematics, translated poorly. He was intelligent but lacked the formal credentials to prove it. He abandoned dreams of university, instead taking on a series of grueling jobs\u2014in warehouses, as a night-shift cleaner\u2014to help support his aging parents. A pivotal turning point came when a compassionate social worker helped his family navigate the labyrinthine process of securing subsidized senior housing. In her work, Alexei saw a reflection of his own desire to bring order to chaos and provide a steady hand to those adrift.\n\nThis revelation became his new career path. Lacking a formal degree, he started as an overnight monitor at a San Francisco homeless shelter, his calm demeanor and fluency in Russian and Ukrainian making him invaluable. He learned on the job, eventually earning a promotion to Case Manager at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin.\n\nNow 31, Alexei\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small staff apartment on the third floor of the renovated building where his clients reside. His days are a marathon of connecting residents with healthcare, mediating disputes, and celebrating small victories like a new ID card or a sober anniversary. His social life is sparse, limited to brief coffees with overworked colleagues. He is a ghost in his own city, deeply connected to its struggles but rarely partaking in its joys. His dream is simple: to one day afford a small, quiet studio in the Outer Sunset, a place where he can finally separate his work from his home and fall asleep to the sound of the ocean, a faint echo of the sea he left behind."
