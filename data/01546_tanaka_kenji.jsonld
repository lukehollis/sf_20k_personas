The son of a Nisei Japanese-American father and a Caucasian mother from Ohio, Kenji grew up in San Jose feeling perpetually in-between worlds. He was never quite Japanese enough for his paternal grandparents and always stood out in his predominantly white suburban school. His refuge was the family garage, where he meticulously disassembled and reassembled everything from lawnmowers to VCRs, finding solace in the logic of mechanics.\n\nForgoing college, Kenji took an entry-level job at a semiconductor manufacturing facility right after high school. While his peers were studying theory, he was mastering the intricate dance of robotics and cleanroom protocols. His innate talent for optimizing workflows and troubleshooting complex machinery saw him rise steadily. Without a degree, he outworked and out-innovated his colleagues, eventually earning the title of Manufacturing Engineer Manager through sheer competence and a reputation for solving the unsolvable. This relentless focus, however, contributed to the quiet dissolution of his marriage in his late thirties.\n\nSeeking a change, Kenji sold his suburban home and bought a spacious live-work loft in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. The move was a rebirth. Here, his mixed heritage and unconventional career path were unremarkable. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from his minimalist living quarters to his personal workshop, a space filled with 3D printers, CNC machines, and half-finished prototypes. He manages his corporate team remotely, his days structured by video calls and digital blueprints, but his evenings are for his own creations.\n\nNow at 49, Kenji feels a pull toward a new future. He dreams of leaving the corporate world behind to launch a small, bespoke design and fabrication studio from his loft. He envisions creating beautiful, functional objects\u2014from custom furniture to specialized cycling components\u2014for clients who value craftsmanship. For Kenji, San Francisco is not just a city; it\u2019s the place where a man defined by process can finally engineer a life of his own design."
