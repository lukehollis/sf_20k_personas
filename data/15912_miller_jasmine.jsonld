The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, Jasmine grew up surrounded by the expectation of practical success. Her parents, who ran a small neighborhood grocery store, preached the virtues of engineering or finance. However, Jasmine was a quiet observer, more attuned to the unspoken emotional currents around her. The turning point came in middle school when a close friend\u2019s family silently imploded from addiction and mental health struggles. It was a compassionate, overworked school social worker who finally intervened, and seeing that tangible impact planted a seed in Jasmine\u2019s mind.\n\nForsaking her parents\u2019 preferred path, she pursued psychology at UC Davis and returned to the city for her Master of Social Work at SF State, determined to serve the community that raised her. Now, as a clinical social worker, she works primarily with high school students in a district grappling with poverty and systemic inequities. Her days are a triage of academic anxiety, family trauma, and the complex challenges facing marginalized youth.\n\nJasmine\u2019s 3.8-mile commute on the Muni N-Judah from her shared Inner Richmond apartment is a daily ritual of decompression. The rumbling journey gives her time to process the day's intense sessions before returning to the life she\u2019s built with her two roommates. Evenings are often spent on long runs through Golden Gate Park or exploring the dumpling houses on Clement Street with a tight-knit group of friends, many of whom also work in public service.\n\nHer relationship with her parents has softened; they now see the profound pride she takes in her demanding work, even if they don\u2019t fully grasp it. Jasmine dreams of one day opening a small, culturally-competent practice focused on serving Asian-American families, bridging the generational gap in understanding mental health. For now, she finds fulfillment in the small victories: the student who graduates against all odds, the family that learns to communicate. In a city of frantic ambition, Jasmine\u2019s purpose is rooted in quiet, essential care."

It wasn\u2019t the drama that stuck with her, but the way the school social worker, Ms. Albright, simply sat with her, creating a safe harbor with her quiet presence. Jasmine realized then that power wasn\u2019t about solving problems with loud answers, but about holding space for pain. That single observation planted the seed of her life\u2019s purpose, offering a path that valued the empathy she had always hidden.\n\n2.\nIt was the Sunday phone call during her sophomore year at Davis. Her father was talking about internships at Oracle, the guaranteed path. Jasmine\u2019s heart hammered as she said the word: \u201cpsychology.\u201d The silence that followed felt like a chasm opening between her and her parents. Though terrifying, it was the first time she felt the full weight of her own agency. She was choosing to honor the quiet observer within her, not the daughter they had planned, and the choice felt both lonely and deeply right.\n\n3.\nLast Lunar New Year, she was helping her parents at their store. As she swept, her mother quietly placed a steaming thermos on the counter. \u201cFor your long ride home,\u201d was all she said. Inside was her favorite winter melon soup. There was no big discussion of her job, but Jasmine felt everything in the warmth of the container. It was her mother's unspoken acceptance; a recognition of her daughter\u2019s fatigue and a desire to care for her. It was love, brewed and silent.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, a perpetually truant student named Marcus wordlessly handed her a graduation announcement. He\u2019d spent months in her office, angry and closed off, and she thought she\u2019d failed him. But seeing his name printed on that card was a quiet explosion of relief and pride. It wasn't a dramatic breakthrough, but tangible proof that her presence mattered. This memory became her anchor during difficult days, a reminder that success in her work is often silent and slow.\n\n5.\nJust a few months ago, after a session with a student in crisis, Jasmine felt hollowed out. She slumped into a seat on the N-Judah, the train\u2019s familiar rumble a comfort. As it crested the hill past the tunnel, the Sunset unfolded below, draped in evening fog. She watched the gray tendrils snake through the avenues of her childhood. In that rattling moment, watching her city breathe, her exhaustion was replaced by a fierce sense of belonging. This was why she stayed."
