Raised in a Berkeley home overflowing with books, radical debate, and the scent of both curry and challah, Imran grew up as a quiet observer, the keeper of his family\u2019s complex, loving history. He was fascinated not by grand events, but by the small pieces of life that told the real story: faded photographs, letters, and ticket stubs.\n\nHis path seemed clear when he enrolled in a Library and Information Science program. However, his mother\u2019s diagnosis with a long-term illness forced him to leave school to help his father with her care. This turning point defined his future. While he never completed his degree, his passion for preservation didn't fade. He took an entry-level job digitizing collections at a university library, learning on the job with a fierce dedication. Over two decades, as paper records gave way to digital files, Imran became a self-taught expert, rising through the ranks on the strength of his meticulous work and deep understanding of digital decay.\n\nNow 51, Imran is the Lead Digital Archivist for a prominent San Francisco museum. He lives a deliberately simple life in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are structured: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, a ride on the N Judah Muni downtown, and hours spent ensuring the city\u2019s digital cultural artifacts don't vanish into the ether. He is a man who finds profound meaning in preventing the loss of memory, a duty he feels on a deeply personal level.\n\nHis social circle is small but steadfast\u2014a few colleagues and a weekly board game night. While polite and warm, he remains private, a man more comfortable with organized data than messy human connections. His dream isn't one of wealth or travel, but to start a personal project: a free, open-access digital archive of Bay Area immigrant and mixed-heritage family stories, a tribute to the beautiful complexity of his own upbringing. For Imran, San Francisco is not a city of tech booms and disruption, but a fragile manuscript he is tasked with saving, one file at a time."

The light from his mother\u2019s Shabbat candles flickered across a page of Urdu poetry his father was translating. The air was a perfect fusion of frying onions for daal and melting candle wax. He didn\u2019t see two separate worlds that needed reconciling; he felt one complete, layered home. It was the first archive he ever knew, and he instinctively understood its precious, fragile nature.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, he remembers carefully packing his library science textbooks into a cardboard box. His father\u2019s voice on the phone had been heavy but steady. He looked from the books on cataloging theory to a faded photo of his mother on his desk, her smile bright and defiant. There was no real choice. He realized then that preservation wasn't an academic exercise; it was an urgent act of love. He was leaving school not to abandon his passion, but to practice it in its most essential form.\n\n3.\nLong after closing, alone in the library basement in his late twenties, he coaxed life from a corrupted hard drive from the \u201880s. It held the only records of a vanished neighborhood activist group. His boss had called it a lost cause. But after hours of meticulous work, a single, grainy photo of a protest flickered onto the screen. It wasn't just a recovered file; it was a ghost he had brought back. In that silent, fluorescent-lit room, he felt the profound thrill of a rescuer.\n\n4.\nOn the N Judah just last year, he watched an elderly woman show her grandchild how to fold a paper crane, her gnarled Cantonese-speaking fingers guiding the small hands. Around them, the city\u2019s symphony played out\u2014different languages, tired workers, students with headphones. He felt a sudden, fierce protectiveness. These weren\u2019t just commuters. They were all living documents, fragile and fleeting. His daily ride wasn\u2019t a commute; it was a field survey of the manuscript he was charged with protecting.\n\n5.\nWhile digitizing a collection for the museum, he found it: a recipe for borscht, handwritten in Yiddish on the back of a receipt from a Pakistani grocery store in the Mission, dated 1978. It was someone else\u2019s curry and challah moment. He stared at the scanned image, a perfect artifact of a beautifully complicated life. In that instant, his quiet personal project ignited into a clear and urgent calling. He had to build a home for these stories\u2014not just for his parents, but for all of them."
