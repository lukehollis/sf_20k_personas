Raised by a meticulous bookkeeper mother and a self-employed electrician father, he learned early that financial stability was a craft built on practicality and diligence, not prestige. The 2008 financial crisis, which hit his family\u2019s contracting work hard, was his turning point. While his high school peers stressed over college applications, a teenage Aidan became obsessed with market trends and investment strategies, determined to understand the forces that could so easily disrupt a family\u2019s security.\n\nThis obsession guided his non-traditional path. Aidan bypassed a four-year degree, finding it an inefficient and expensive route to the knowledge he craved. Instead, he devoured online courses, earned financial certifications, and leveraged his mother\u2019s local business contacts to do freelance bookkeeping. He was a natural, with an intuitive grasp of data and risk. This self-made expertise eventually led him to a niche as a freelance financial analyst for burgeoning tech startups that needed sharp minds without the C-suite price tag.\n\nNow 32, Aidan\u2019s life is centered in his quiet Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office, explaining his 0.0-mile commute. His mornings don\u2019t begin with a frantic rush to Muni but with a disciplined run through Golden Gate Park, the fog-dampened air clearing his head for the spreadsheets and market reports that await. His work is a series of intense, project-based sprints, building financial models and funding strategies for anxious founders over Zoom.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. He thrives on the city\u2019s innovative energy, yet appreciates the grounded, residential feel of his neighborhood. After work, he explores the dim sum spots on Clement Street or meets his long-term girlfriend, a graphic designer, for a beer at a local brewery. His dream isn\u2019t a lavish lifestyle, but complete independence. He hopes to one day launch a financial literacy program for young adults from working-class backgrounds, turning his own hard-won knowledge into a tool for others to build their own security. For Aidan, San Francisco is not a ladder to climb, but a platform on which to build a meaningful, self-directed life."
