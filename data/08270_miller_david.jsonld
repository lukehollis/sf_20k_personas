The son of first-generation Chinese immigrants, he grew up in the apartment above his family\u2019s small convenience store in the Inner Richmond. His parents, who chose the name \"David Miller\" from a television show hoping it would help him assimilate, poured their life savings and endless hours into \"Miller's Sundries.\" For them, the store was the foundation of an American dream for their son.\n\nDavid\u2019s childhood was a blend of San Francisco public school and stocking shelves after class. He was a quiet, observant boy who preferred sketching in a notepad to playing sports in Golden Gate Park. Pressured to pursue a more stable career, he enrolled at San Francisco State, vaguely studying business. However, during his sophomore year, his father suffered a heart attack. David left college without hesitation to run the store, a temporary measure that slowly solidified into a permanent reality. He never went back.\n\nThe key turning point was realizing he was good at it. He modernized the inventory, added a high-end coffee machine that became a neighborhood favorite, and remembered the names of every regular. Now 34, David is the store\u2019s official manager. His life exists within a few city blocks; his commute is a single flight of stairs. His social circle consists of other small business owners and a few close friends he meets for beers to watch the Giants.\n\nThough he feels a deep sense of duty and pride in preserving his parents\u2019 legacy, a quiet yearning persists. At night, after locking the front door, he sometimes scrolls through graphic design blogs, imagining a different life. His dream isn\u2019t to escape, but to merge his worlds. He hopes to one day rebrand the store, design his own website, and perhaps sell prints of his photography next to the lottery tickets\u2014to finally add a piece of himself to the family business he so faithfully maintains."
