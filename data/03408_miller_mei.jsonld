Growing up in San Jose, she was the daughter of a pragmatic Chinese immigrant mother who ran a small bakery and a gentle, introspective American father who taught high school English. Her name itself was a bridge: \"Mei Ling\" for her mother's heritage, \"Miller\" for her father's. In their quiet home, love was expressed not through words but through actions\u2014a perfectly cut piece of fruit from her mother, a shared silence reading a book with her father. It was in this silence that Mei Ling discovered art, using charcoal sketches to articulate the complex, unspoken emotions that filled their house.\n\nThis early reliance on non-verbal expression became the cornerstone of her future. After completing her undergraduate degree at UCLA, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, specializing in Art Therapy. She felt a profound calling to help others find a voice when words failed, just as she had. Her clinical work began in a bustling community health clinic, but a key turning point arrived with the pandemic. The sudden shift to telehealth forced her to adapt, transforming her small Inner Richmond apartment into a virtual sanctuary for her clients.\n\nNow, at 30, Mei Ling\u2019s life is defined by a quiet, deliberate rhythm. Her commute is a few steps from her bedroom to her home office, where she guides clients through trauma and anxiety using both talk therapy and creative expression. Her life in San Francisco is her own act of integration. She lives in the Inner Richmond, where the scent of her mother's culture from the bakeries on Clement Street mingles with the fog rolling in from the Pacific, a landscape that feels as beautifully mixed as her own heritage. After long days of pixelated intimacy with her clients, she recharges by walking through Golden Gate Park or losing herself in her own pottery at a small community studio. Her dream is to one day open a small, private practice dedicated to bicultural and immigrant families, creating a space where every member, young and old, can feel truly seen and understood."

Her mother entered and placed a small plate beside her: a pear, peeled and sliced into perfect, dew-kissed rabbits. Mei Ling didn\u2019t look up from her sketchpad, but her hand paused. With the sharp scent of the fruit and the soft scratch of her charcoal, she felt a love so complete it needed no words. This memory became the blueprint for how connection could be built in silence.\n\n2.\nDuring a harsh critique in a UCLA art class, a professor called her work emotionally vague. Mei Ling fumbled for words to explain the portrait of her grandmother, her voice failing her. Then, a fellow student from Korea quietly said, \u201cIt feels like my grandmother\u2019s kitchen. I can smell the soup.\u201d In that moment of shared, unspoken understanding across cultures, Mei Ling\u2019s path clarified. Her art wasn\u2019t vague; it was a language for those who knew how to listen with their eyes. It\u2019s why she chose therapy over a gallery.\n\n3.\nHer first breakthrough as an intern at Berkeley felt like a quiet miracle. For weeks, a traumatized, selectively mute boy had sat silently across from her. One Tuesday, she simply pushed a tub of clay toward him. He spent the entire session methodically squashing small, neat balls of clay flat, one after another. At the end, he looked at her, his eyes clear for the first time. The repetitive, destructive act was his story. It was the moment she knew, with bone-deep certainty, that she was doing exactly what she was meant to do.\n\n4.\nIn the first month of the pandemic, she felt like a fraud. A client was sobbing on her screen, and Mei Ling, trapped in her own apartment, felt the miles between them like a physical wall. Desperate, she guided the client to find a piece of paper and a pen. \u201cDon\u2019t try to draw anything,\u201d she said softly. \u201cJust make the marks your sadness feels like.\u201d The frantic, angry scribbles that filled the screen became a bridge. It was then she realized a sanctuary wasn\u2019t a place, but a shared intention.\n\n5.\nJust last year, after a draining day of telehealth sessions, she walked to her community pottery studio. Her mind was still buzzing with a client\u2019s anxiety. But as she centered the lump of wet clay, feeling the cool slip and gritty texture under her hands, the noise quieted. The steady hum of the wheel and the solid weight of the earth became an anchor. This act of creating for herself wasn't an escape but a return\u2014a reminder that before she could hold space for others, she first had to ground herself."
