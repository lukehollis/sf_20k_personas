She grew up in a small apartment above her parents' modest laundry business, the scent of soap and steam a constant backdrop to her childhood. Her parents, immigrants from Guangdong province, instilled in her the values of hard work, resilience, and community. While finances were always tight, they ensured Mei had access to books and encouraged her academic pursuits.\n\nMei's path to social work wasn't immediate. Initially, she entertained thoughts of business, but witnessing the struggles of her elderly neighbors with navigating complex medical and social systems stirred a deeper calling. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, earning her Bachelor's in Social Work. Her fieldwork exposed her to the myriad challenges faced by vulnerable adults \u2013 isolation, exploitation, and navigating bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nA pivotal moment came during an internship at a community center, assisting an elderly woman facing eviction. The helplessness the woman felt, coupled with the systemic barriers, solidified Mei's commitment to direct service. After graduation, she secured a position at Adult Protective Services. The work was demanding, emotionally taxing, but deeply rewarding. She became a skilled advocate, navigating complex cases of neglect and abuse, her quiet demeanor masking a fierce determination to protect those who couldn't protect themselves.\n\nMei\u2019s personal life is anchored by a small circle of close friends, many of whom she met during her time at SFSU. They gather for dim sum in the Sunset or hikes in Golden Gate Park, their conversations a lifeline in the face of demanding careers. While she is not married, she has a deep bond with her aging parents, offering practical support and comfort.\n\nHer current life is a steady hum of dedication. Her days begin early, catching the Muni bus, the city awakening around her. Evenings are spent reviewing cases, perhaps a quiet dinner with friends, or tending to the small balcony garden that brings a touch of green to her urban landscape. She finds solace in the familiar streets of her Richmond district neighborhood, its blend of cultures a reflection of the city she serves.\n\nMei harbors no grand dreams of wealth or fame. Her aspirations are rooted in impact: to continue advocating for vulnerable adults, to mentor younger social workers, and to see tangible improvements in the lives of her clients. She dreams of a society where elderly and disabled individuals are treated with dignity and respect, where systems are easier to navigate. Her hope for the future is for quiet progress, one case, one person, at a time, a testament to the dedication she brings to her life and her work in the heart of San Francisco."

A realization bloomed: resilience wasn't just about enduring, but about finding beauty in mending, in making things whole again. It was a quiet lesson in care that would echo in her later work, a testament to the strength found in small acts of repair. (Childhood in Chinatown apartment).\n\n2.  Sitting in the cramped community center, listening to the elderly woman's trembling voice recounting her eviction notice, the helplessness was palpable, a heavy weight in the room. A fire ignited within Mei \u2013 not anger, but a fierce resolve. This moment solidified her path, confirming that her quiet strength would be best served fighting for those whose voices were unheard. (During her SFSU internship).\n\n3.  The fog rolled in thick over Golden Gate Park as they laughed, sharing cold noodles and the anxieties of their demanding jobs. These friendships, forged during late-night study sessions at SFSU, became a vital anchor. In their shared vulnerability and unwavering support, she found the strength to face the emotional toll of her work, a reminder that even in the face of hardship, connection offered solace. (Throughout her SFSU years and beyond).\n\n4.  The relief on a client's face, a frail woman finally safe after months of navigating complex paperwork and advocacy, was a tangible reward. It was a quiet victory in a landscape often filled with setbacks. This memory, etched in her mind, reinforced her belief in the power of persistent advocacy and the deep satisfaction of seeing her efforts bring tangible, positive change. (Early in her career at Adult Protective Services).\n\n5.  Standing on her small balcony, the scent of damp earth from her potted herbs mingling with the distant city sounds, felt like an exhale. This small patch of green, a vibrant contrast to her often-stark cases, became a sacred space for reflection and renewal. It was a reminder that even in a demanding life, finding small pockets of peace and growth was essential for nurturing the soul. (Her current life in the Richmond district)."
