            "value": "Jaspreet Miller has always lived between two worlds. The son of a pragmatic Punjabi Sikh immigrant father who worked as an engineer and a compassionate, book-loving mother from Ohio, he grew up in Fremont navigating a dual identity. The name on his birth certificate was a testament to this union: Jaspreet, for his father\u2019s heritage, and Miller, for his mother\u2019s. His childhood was a blend of boisterous family gatherings filled with the aroma of spices and quiet afternoons in the local library, where his mother nurtured his love for history.\n\nHe wasn't a gifted student initially, finding the structured curriculum less engaging than the stories in his books. After earning a history degree from San Jose State, he drifted, unsure of his path. The turning point came during a stint as a long-term substitute teacher at a tough middle school in Oakland. There, he saw himself in the bright, overlooked students who were slipping through the cracks. He discovered a calling not just to teach history, but to shape the very institution that could change their lives. This newfound purpose propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's in Educational Leadership.\n\nJaspreet\u2019s career was a steady climb: teacher, vice-principal, and for the last eight years, the principal of a thriving public elementary school in the Inner Sunset. His life is deeply woven into the fabric of his community. After the tragic loss of his wife, Elena, to cancer five years ago, the school became his anchor and his family. He sold their larger home and moved into a small apartment just a block away, making his commute a short, reflective walk.\n\nHis days are a marathon of greeting children by name at the gate, mediating parent-teacher conflicts, fighting for budget approvals, and finding quiet moments to read to a kindergarten class. Jaspreet\u2019s dream is no longer a grand ambition, but a focused, tangible one: to secure funding for a permanent music teacher and see the school\u2019s aging library renovated in Elena\u2019s name. He pictures a quiet retirement filled with travel\u2014perhaps finally visiting the villages in Punjab his father described\u2014but for now, his purpose is found in the morning bell and the echoing laughter in the schoolyard. He is Principal Miller, a constant, calming presence in the heart of his San Francisco neighborhood."
