The son of Chinese immigrants who built their life around a bustling Cantonese restaurant in the Sunset District, Liam was raised on the values of hard work and pragmatism. His parents chose his Western name as a key to a door they could never fully unlock, urging him towards a stability they had to fight for.\n\nHe obliged, but on his own terms. At UC Berkeley, he sidestepped engineering and business, losing himself in the narratives of the past, earning a Bachelor's degree in History. He dreamed of a quiet life as a museum curator, but the reality of San Francisco\u2019s cost of living\u2014and a sense of filial duty\u2014pushed him down a different path. The turning point was declining an offer to a Master\u2019s program, instead taking an entry-level administrative job at a burgeoning tech startup. His talent for seeing patterns and building efficient systems, honed by studying the rise and fall of civilizations, saw him promoted steadily. Now, as an Operations Coordinator, he ensures the complex machinery of a large tech firm runs smoothly from his apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute creates a disciplined, if solitary, routine. The day begins with a coffee from a familiar cafe, is structured by Slack notifications and Zoom calls, and ends with a long run through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. A recent breakup left him feeling adrift, amplifying the distance he sometimes feels from his college friends, who are now scattered across different industries and life stages.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is layered. It\u2019s the city of his childhood, smelling of his parents\u2019 cooking, and the city of his adulthood, a pressure cooker that shaped his career. He finds solace in his neighborhood\u2019s quiet rhythm. His dream is to bridge his two worlds: to launch a podcast detailing the forgotten histories of San Francisco's neighborhoods. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration to reclaim the historian he set aside, proving to himself that his life in the city can be more than just operational efficiency."
