Raised in a Sacramento suburb, he was the son of a pragmatic Punjabi immigrant father, an engineer who rarely spoke of India, and a second-generation Irish-American mother, a high school teacher. His father, wanting his son to assimilate completely, emphasized achievement over heritage. Adam grew up identifying as White, his last name a curious outlier in an otherwise all-American upbringing focused on good grades and athletic competence.\n\nDriven by this instilled ambition, he pursued an economics degree at UCLA. After a few years in a junior marketing role, he saw the ceiling and knew he needed more leverage. He meticulously planned and executed his entry into UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. The MBA was his key to a new world. It sharpened his strategic mind and plugged him directly into the Bay Area\u2019s tech ecosystem. He graduated with honors and a coveted Product Manager offer. For the next decade, he climbed, his ascent steady and impressive.\n\nThe turning point wasn't a sudden crisis, but a slow burn. At 37, after a grueling 18-month product launch that cemented his promotion to Director, the expected sense of triumph was replaced by a profound hollowness. He had the title, the team, and the income, but the \"why\" felt increasingly distant. Around the same time, his five-year relationship ended, a casualty of his demanding schedule and a mutual inability to define a future beyond their careers.\n\nToday, Adam\u2019s life runs on a disciplined rhythm. He lives alone in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. His morning starts at a 6 a.m. spin class, followed by a Muni ride to his FiDi office, listening to industry podcasts. His days are a blur of strategic meetings and roadmap planning. Evenings are often spent at networking dinners or unwinding with a precisely made Old Fashioned. He came to San Francisco for the opportunity but has stayed for the city itself\u2014the weekend hikes in the Headlands, the crisp air in Golden Gate Park, the vibrant energy of his neighborhood. He feels like a resident, yet disconnected from its deeper soul. His greatest hope is to pivot, leveraging his hard-won skills to build a product with a tangible social or environmental impact. He\u2019s started exploring his own history, wondering if the purpose he seeks lies not in another promotion, but in finally understanding the \"Singh\" part of his name."

At the Sacramento public library, a librarian looked at his card and said, \"Singh... what a beautiful Indian name.\" Adam froze, feeling a hot blush creep up his neck. He saw his father, a few aisles over, shake his head almost imperceptibly. Adam mumbled, \"My mom's Irish,\" and quickly grabbed his books. The librarian\u2019s warmth felt like a spotlight on something he was supposed to hide. That day, he learned that his name was a complication, a detail to be managed rather than claimed.\n\n2.\nHe was 26, sitting on the floor of his cramped LA apartment. He\u2019d just hit \u2018submit\u2019 on his Haas MBA application. For a year, this goal had consumed him, a strategic campaign planned with military precision. The click of the mouse felt like a det C4 charge blowing a door open to the future. It wasn't hope he felt, but the cold, satisfying thrill of a problem solved. This act cemented his belief that success wasn't about luck or identity, but about flawless execution.\n\n3.\nThe night he was officially promoted to Director, he stood in his Hayes Valley apartment, a bottle of celebratory whiskey untouched on the counter. He stared at his reflection in the floor-to-ceiling window, the glittering city behind him. There was no triumph, no crescendo\u2014just a profound and terrifying silence in his own head. He had reached the summit he\u2019d aimed for his whole life, only to find the view was meaningless. At 37, this hollowness was the loudest thing he had ever felt.\n\n4.\nOne Sunday last fall, after his relationship had ended, he was walking through the AIDS Memorial Grove in Golden Gate Park. He watched a family spread a blanket, their easy laughter echoing through the serene redwoods. The unfiltered joy felt entirely foreign. He was an observer of a life he wasn\u2019t living, separated by an invisible wall of ambition and routine. He felt the sharp ache of loneliness, realizing he\u2019d built a life in this beautiful city, but had forgotten to build a home.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, at a networking dinner, a young founder asked about his name\u2019s origin. Adam gave his standard, deflective answer. But later, making an Old Fashioned in his quiet condo, the question returned. On a whim, instead of opening his work laptop, he opened his personal one and typed \"Amritsar\" into the search bar. As images of the Golden Temple filled the screen, he felt a flicker\u2014not of understanding, but of a deep, unfamiliar curiosity. It was the first step on a path back to himself."
