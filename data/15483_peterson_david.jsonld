Raised in the sun-drenched suburbs of Walnut Creek, David grew up with a pragmatic, middle-class worldview. His father, a small-scale building contractor, instilled in him an appreciation for property, not as an abstract asset, but as something tangible with history and potential.\n\nHis journey through San Jose State\u2019s business program was brief. Restless and eager, David found the classroom too slow, the real world too tempting. He dropped out after two years for an entry-level assistant job at a commercial real estate firm in San Francisco in the early 1990s. This became his true education. He learned the city not from a textbook, but by walking its streets, understanding its micro-neighborhoods, and being mentored by old-school brokers who knew every landlord in the Financial District.\n\nDavid\u2019s career is a story of surviving and thriving through San Francisco\u2019s economic tides. He made his first real money during the dot-com boom, leasing office space to startups with more venture capital than sense. He learned a brutal lesson in the subsequent bust, watching those same offices empty out overnight. The 2008 financial crisis further forged his cautious, value-driven approach. He isn\u2019t the broker for flashy tech campuses; he\u2019s the one who understands long-term leases, stable tenants, and the enduring value of a Class A building with good bones.\n\nThis relentless drive came at a personal cost, contributing to a divorce in his late thirties. Now, David\u2019s life is more balanced. Remarried to a high school teacher, he lives in a quiet Larkspur home where the loudest noise is often the wind in the eucalyptus trees. His two children from his first marriage are grown, one a software engineer in Austin, the other in grad school in LA.\n\nHe maintains a complex relationship with San Francisco. He loves its energy and the thrill of closing a major deal downtown, but finds himself increasingly weary of its noise and social friction. The ferry commute is his perfect compromise. As he glides past Alcatraz, he feels a profound sense of accomplishment, having built a comfortable life by skillfully navigating the very city he now chooses to keep at a gentle distance. His dream is no longer to conquer the market, but to mentor a successor and retire in five years to a life of sailing the Bay and traveling with his wife."

Pointing with his cigar at a nondescript tower, Sal said, \u201cThe family that owns that? They won\u2019t lease to lawyers.\u201d In that moment, the city ceased to be a map of properties and became a web of stories and secrets. It was a feeling of being let in on the real game. This deep, unwritten knowledge became the foundation of his entire career, cementing his decision to never return to a classroom.\n\n2.\nThe champagne tasted electric. It was 1999, and he\u2019d just closed a massive lease for a startup called \"WebVan.\" The CEO, a kid younger than his brother, had barely glanced at the floorplan. A wave of giddy, terrifying power washed over David; he felt invincible, like he was printing his own money. It was the peak of his ambition, a feeling of effortless success he would spend the rest of his career being deeply suspicious of, knowing how hollow the building would soon become.\n\n3.\nThe silence was the worst part. In 2001, he walked through that same WebVan office, the one he\u2019d leased out just two years prior. Abandoned Aeron chairs were scattered like tombstones, and a whiteboard still held the ghostly scrawls of a defunct business plan. The cold knot in his stomach wasn't just about a lost commission; it was a profound lesson in humility. He vowed then to only trust in buildings with good bones and tenants with real, tangible value, a principle that would save him in 2008.\n\n4.\nHe remembers standing in the hallway of their first home as his ex-wife packed a box of books. It was 2007. She didn't shout. She just looked at him with weary finality and said, \"David, even when you're here, you're downtown.\" The words struck him harder than any market crash. He realized his ambition had built a wall around him, leaving him successful but utterly alone. That profound failure reshaped his definition of a well-lived life, planting the seed for the balance he would later find.\n\n5.\nJust last week, leaving the city on the 6:20 PM ferry, he felt it. The deal he\u2019d closed was solid\u2014a long-term lease for a stable financial firm. As the diesel engines hummed and the city\u2019s lights began to sparkle behind him, his phone buzzed. It was his wife, asking if he wanted pasta or fish for dinner. A deep, quiet contentment settled over him. This feeling, he knew, was the real return on his investment. It was the profit that truly mattered, gliding home across the water."
