Born Kim Min-jun, he was adopted at eighteen months by a loving Caucasian couple from suburban Sacramento. Raised as David, his childhood was a comfortable Californian tapestry of cul-de-sacs and summer road trips, yet always tinged with a quiet sense of displacement. He was the only Asian face in his family photos, a loving son who didn't share his parents' features.\n\nThis search for structure and meaning led him to UC Berkeley, where he unexpectedly fell in love with Art History. He was fascinated by how civilizations organized their beliefs and aesthetics into tangible forms. Upon graduating, however, the practical realities of the early 1990s set in. The art world felt impenetrable, so he took a temp job doing data organization for a burgeoning software company in San Francisco, simply to pay rent on a shared apartment in the Haight.\n\nThis was his pivotal turning point. David discovered he had an innate talent for taming the digital chaos of engineers and creatives. The logic of a well-executed project plan appealed to the same part of his brain that appreciated the composition of a Renaissance painting. He wasn't a coder, but he was fluent in the language of Gantt charts and stakeholder management. He earned certifications and climbed the ladder through the dot-com boom, bust, and subsequent resurgences, becoming the calm, reliable IT Project Manager he is today.\n\nNow 54, David\u2019s world is contained within his meticulously tidy Inner Sunset condo, where his commute is a ten-step walk to his standing desk. His days are a disciplined rhythm of international Zoom calls, digital spreadsheets, and the persistent hum of his servers. He lives alone, having ended a long-term relationship a few years prior, and finds solace in routine. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal: the morning fog drifting over Golden Gate Park, the familiar baristas at his neighborhood coffee shop, the weekend ritual of walking to the de Young Museum.\n\nHis dream isn\u2019t one of grand ambition, but of quiet integration. He aspires to bridge the gap between his pragmatic career and his forsaken passion. He fantasizes about volunteering as a docent at the museum, using his project management skills to organize art events for the community, and finally reconnecting with the young man who saw a beautiful, coherent story in a chaotic world."
