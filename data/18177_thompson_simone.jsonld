The daughter of a high school history teacher and a city bus driver, her world was rich in culture, if not in cash. The pivotal moment came at age twelve, seeing a local production of *A Raisin in the Sun*. The power of live performance\u2014the raw emotion under the hot lights\u2014ignited a fire in her that never went out. She knew she didn't belong on stage, but behind it, making the magic happen.\n\nHer path led her across the Bay to San Francisco State University for a degree in Arts Administration, a practical choice for an impractical passion. Simone started her career where most do: at the bottom. She sold tickets in a box office, wrote grant proposals in a cramped back room, and learned the intricate dance of fundraising. Her big test came during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, when arts funding evaporated overnight. As a mid-level manager at a struggling theater, she fought relentlessly, finding creative ways to keep the doors open. That crucible forged her into the resilient, savvy leader she is today. The long hours and unwavering dedication, however, contributed to the amicable end of her decade-long marriage; her \"child\" was, and remains, the venue she serves.\n\nNow, as the Executive Director of a respected mid-sized performing arts venue in the Mission District, Simone\u2019s daily life is a controlled whirlwind. Her mornings begin in her airy Hayes Valley apartment, followed by a 4.5-mile MUNI ride where she reviews programming notes. Her days are a blend of schmoozing donors, mentoring young staff, and advocating for the fragile arts ecosystem. Evenings are often spent in the familiar comfort of the theater\u2019s velvet seats, watching the work she championed come to life.\n\nSimone feels deeply woven into the fabric of San Francisco, a city whose progressive ideals and artistic soul mirror her own. Her future aspirations aren't for a bigger title or a higher salary, but for legacy. She dreams of establishing a permanent endowment for her venue, ensuring it can weather future storms and continue to be a platform for new, diverse voices long after she takes her final bow."

At twelve, watching Walter Lee Younger's dreams defer in that local production of *A Raisin in the Sun*, she felt a profound shift. It wasn't the actors she wanted to be, but the unseen force that built their world\u2014the one that focused the lights and quieted the house. That night, in a small Oakland theater, the dusty velvet seats felt more like home than anywhere else. It was the moment her purpose clicked into place, quietly and forever.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in the failing theater office, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. She was a mid-level manager then, during the dot-com bust. Poring over old files, her fingers found it: a small foundation grant miscategorized years before. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to make payroll for one more week. In that moment of exhausted triumph, she learned that survival in the arts wasn\u2019t about grand gestures, but about relentless, gritty faith. It sharpened her into a fighter.\n\n3.\nThe talk with her husband wasn't a fight, but a quiet, sad agreement over lukewarm tea in their apartment. He pointed to the stacks of programs on their coffee table. \"This is your great love,\" he'd said, without malice, only truth. The admission didn\u2019t break her heart so much as clarify it. She was choosing this life, this demanding, all-consuming child of a theater. That evening, she accepted the profound solitude of her ambition, understanding a part of her would always belong to the house lights.\n\n4.\nLast spring, she stood in the back of the house during the premiere of a young playwright's first show. The lead was a trans actress from the Tenderloin, her voice filling the space Simone had fought so hard to protect. Watching the audience lean in, captivated, was more rewarding than any glowing review or donor check. This was the point of it all: not just keeping the lights on, but making sure they illuminated new faces, new stories. It was the feeling of legacy in motion.\n\n5.\nHer 4.5-mile morning MUNI ride is a sacred ritual. As the bus lurches down Market Street, she sees the city wake: the barista, the tech worker, the unhoused person. Looking out the window, with programming notes in her lap, she feels a deep connection to the eclectic community she strives to serve. This ride is her daily reminder that the theater isn't an island; it's a reflection of the vibrant, messy, beautiful city outside its doors. It\u2019s what keeps her grounded and fuels her advocacy."
