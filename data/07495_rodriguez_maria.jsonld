Born at SF General, she is the eldest daughter of Salvadoran immigrants who arrived in the 1970s, trading civil war for the promise of work and safety. Growing up in a bustling, rent-controlled apartment, Maria\u2019s childhood was steeped in cumbia music, the scent of pupusas from her mother's kitchen, and the responsibility of translating for her parents and looking after her two younger brothers.\n\nHer dream took root at City College of San Francisco, where she enrolled in the Early Childhood Education program. She envisioned herself as a lead teacher, perhaps one day opening her own small, bilingual daycare. However, when her father suffered a debilitating stroke during her second year, Maria\u2019s path shifted. She dropped out to take on full-time work, helping her mother with his care and ensuring her brothers could finish school. The dream was shelved, but not forgotten.\n\nShe found her purpose just steps from her childhood home. A position opened for a teaching assistant at \"La Casita de Colores,\" a small preschool on her street. For the last 25 years, that has been her calling. Her zero-mile commute is a short walk from the apartment she eventually took over from her parents, a rare bastion of affordability that allows her to remain in the neighborhood she knows as home.\n\nMaria\u2019s life is a tapestry woven from small, consistent threads. Her mornings begin with a cafecito and pan dulce from the local panaderia, where she\u2019s known by name. At school, she is the calm in the storm of toddler energy, the one who can soothe any tantrum or bandage any scraped knee. While she never married or had children of her own, she has been a mother figure to hundreds.\n\nNow 51, Maria watches the neighborhood change with a mix of pride and anxiety. The tech boom has brought new faces and expensive cafes, pricing out families she\u2019s known for decades. Her greatest hope is simple: to remain. She occasionally looks at the CCSF course catalog online, entertaining the idea of finishing that degree\u2014not for a new career, but for herself. More than anything, she wants to continue being a steady, loving presence for the next generation, a living piece of the Mission\u2019s resilient heart."
