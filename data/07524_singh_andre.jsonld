The son of pragmatic Punjabi immigrants who settled in Daly City, Andre\u2019s childhood was steeped in the expectation that he would pursue a stable, respectable career. His name itself was a compromise\u2014his parents\u2019 nod to the American dream, while their hopes for a son in medicine or engineering remained firmly rooted in tradition. He dutifully enrolled in the business program at SF State, a path paved with his parents\u2019 pride, but one he found sterile and suffocating.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. After impulsively giving a friend a dramatic haircut that turned out surprisingly well, he felt a spark of genuine passion. A pair of shears felt more natural in his hands than any textbook. He dropped out of college, causing a painful rift with his family, and enrolled in cosmetology school. To them, it was a failure; to Andre, it was the first honest decision he had ever made. He thrived in the tactile, creative environment, discovering a talent for seeing the architecture of a hairstyle and understanding the person in the chair.\n\nNow 29, Andre has carved out a perfect existence in Hayes Valley. His chic, minimalist salon, \u201cStructure,\u201d occupies the ground floor of his building; his apartment is just two floors up, making his commute a simple elevator ride. His days are a blur of client conversations, the snip of scissors, and the scent of expensive hair products. He has become a confidant and artist to a loyal clientele of tech workers, designers, and fellow creatives. His relationship with his parents has slowly mended, marked by his mother\u2019s recent, unspoken visits to his salon for a trim\u2014a quiet admission of his success.\n\nAndre\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. He knows the baristas and boutique owners by name. His dream isn't about building an empire, but about perfecting his craft. He aspires to be a master of his art, a local icon whose work is instantly recognizable. For Andre, success is living a life as carefully and beautifully designed as the hairstyles he creates."
