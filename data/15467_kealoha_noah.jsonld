Born and raised on the west side of O\u02bbahu, his childhood memories are scented with salt-laced air and the earthy smell of his grandmother\u2019s workshop, where she masterfully wove lauhala mats. He was a quiet, observant boy, more fascinated by the intricate patterns of her craft and the stories embedded in old koa wood bowls than in surfing with his peers.\n\nThis fascination with tangible history led him away from the islands. A high school trip to the Bishop Museum ignited a passion not just for the artifacts, but for the science keeping them from decay. He pursued a chemistry degree at UCLA before earning a highly specialized master's in Art Conservation Science from the University of Delaware. His early career was spent meticulously restoring artifacts in East Coast institutions, but he always felt a pull back toward the Pacific.\n\nThe turning point came when he landed a position at one of San Francisco's major art museums thirty years ago. The city, a gateway to both Asia and the Pacific, felt like a fitting compromise between his ancestral home and his professional world. He methodically rose through the ranks, his quiet authority and deep knowledge earning him the respect of curators and scientists alike. Today, as Director of Conservation Science, he manages a team, budgets, and the long-term preservation strategy for priceless collections.\n\nNoah lives in a thoughtfully decorated apartment in the Inner Richmond with his partner of two decades, David, a landscape architect. Their home is a sanctuary of clean lines, native Californian plants on the lanai, and a few cherished pieces of Hawaiian art. His daily routine begins with the #38-Geary Muni bus. This 3.5-mile commute is a cherished ritual, a time to observe the city\u2019s pulse before immersing himself in the quiet, climate-controlled world of the museum.\n\nAt 54, Noah\u2019s ambition has shifted from personal achievement to legacy. His greatest hope is to establish a fellowship program that brings young, aspiring conservators from Hawai\u02bbi and the Pacific Islands to San Francisco, ensuring the people whose culture is being preserved are also the ones protecting it for future generations. It is his way of weaving the past into the future, just as his grandmother taught him."

The air was thick with the scent of dried pandanus leaves, a smell he would later learn was composed of specific volatile organic compounds. But then, it was just the scent of *t\u016bt\u016b*. As she wove a lauhala mat, she showed him how to hold his breath to make a finer, tighter weave. In that quiet moment of shared air, he learned that preservation required not just skill, but sacrifice and reverence. It was the first, truest lesson of his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAt 25, a year into his new job in San Francisco, he was tasked with restoring a small, delicate Hawaiian kapa cloth. Its stamped geometric patterns were faded, its fibers brittle. Touching it, he felt a profound wave of *hiraeth*\u2014a homesickness for a place he knew intimately but could no longer live in. That feeling of longing and duty cemented his purpose. He wasn't just a scientist in a lab; he was a guardian, a long-distance son ensuring his ancestors\u2019 voices weren't silenced by time and neglect.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the exact moment he fell in love with David. It wasn\u2019t a grand declaration, but a quiet afternoon on their lanai about nineteen years ago. David was repotting a native manzanita, his hands covered in soil, explaining how its form was shaped by coastal winds. Noah saw the same gentle authority and respect for fragile life that he applied in his lab. In that moment, he realized home wasn't just a place of origin, but a sanctuary you build with someone who understands the quiet language of care.\n\n4.\nThe promotion to Director felt less like a victory and more like a quiet weight settling on his shoulders. His first week, he left his new, larger office and walked down to the climate-controlled silence of the Pacific artifacts storage. He stood before a row of koa wood bowls, their polished surfaces reflecting the dim light. A deep sense of responsibility washed over him. He was no longer just saving one object, but was now the keeper of the entire ecosystem, responsible for every single story held on these shelves.\n\n5.\nJust last year, staring out the window of the 38-Geary as it rumbled through the Richmond, he saw a group of university students laughing. A sudden, sharp vision hit him: an eager young woman from Maui or Guam standing in his lab, her eyes wide with possibility. The idea for the fellowship arrived fully formed, not as an ambition, but as an obligation. His grandmother had passed her knowledge to him; now, it was his turn to complete the circle, weaving the next generation into the fabric of their own history."
