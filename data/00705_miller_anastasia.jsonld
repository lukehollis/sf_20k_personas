Born in Berkeley to two exacting linguistics professors, she grew up in a home where intellectual rigor often overshadowed emotional warmth. Books were her earliest and most constant companions, offering escape and a sense of order her parents\u2019 academic world lacked.\n\nShe pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Comparative Literature at UC Santa Cruz, finding solace in the misty redwood campus and the intricate patterns connecting global narratives. This love for stories spurred her to enter a Master's program at SF State, but the competitive, theory-heavy environment felt suffocating. The joy she found in literature was being dissected into dust. In a quiet act of self-preservation, she dropped out after one semester, a turning point that felt like both failure and liberation.\n\nAdrift, she answered an ad for a Library Assistant at a prestigious private K-12 school in the city. The moment she stepped into the serene, sunlit library, she knew she was home. That was eighteen years ago. Today, at 43, Anastasia lives in a rent-controlled apartment directly adjacent to the school campus, making her commute a 30-second walk across a shared alley.\n\nHer days follow a comforting rhythm: morning tea while watching the fog burn off over Golden Gate Park, the school bell signaling the start of her shift, and the gentle hum of students researching and reading. She knows the students not by their grades, but by their literary tastes\u2014the freshman obsessed with manga, the junior discovering Virginia Woolf. She is a quiet, steady presence in their academic lives.\n\nHer social circle is small but deep, consisting of a book club with two other school staffers and a weekly phone call with her college roommate. Though single, she doesn't feel lonely; her life is full. Her true passion unfolds after hours. For the past five years, Anastasia has been meticulously researching and writing a biography of a little-known female correspondent from the 1906 earthquake. In a city constantly reinventing itself, her dream is to preserve one of its forgotten stories, anchoring herself to its history while helping shape the intellectual lives of its future residents."
