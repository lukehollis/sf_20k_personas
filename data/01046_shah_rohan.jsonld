His father, a university professor, and his mother, a librarian, instilled in him a disciplined work ethic and a belief that education was the key to a global future. When they immigrated to Fremont, California, during the first dot-com boom, a teenage Rohan felt the immense pressure to adapt and excel. He quickly channeled his focus into academics, seeing it as the clearest path to validating his family's sacrifice.\n\nHe pursued an economics degree at UC Berkeley, followed immediately by a grueling stint in New York finance. The work was lucrative but felt hollow. A turning point came during a trip back to the Bay Area, where the palpable energy of tech innovation reignited a dormant spark. He pivoted, earning an MBA from Stanford, and re-emerged as a management consultant specializing in tech strategy. For over a decade, he thrived on the intensity, guiding startups through funding rounds and helping tech giants navigate market shifts.\n\nNow 45, Rohan\u2019s life has settled into a new rhythm. The frantic travel has been replaced by a 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his home office in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. His marriage ended amicably years ago, a casualty of two demanding careers, and his social life is a curated circle of industry peers and old university friends. His days are a marathon of video calls, his evenings often spent decompressing with a run to the Panhandle or enjoying a solitary meal from one of the many acclaimed restaurants nearby.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal; it's the city that gave his career its defining shape. Yet, he dreams of a different future. He aspires to leave consulting for a singular leadership role, hoping to build something lasting within one company. More privately, he hopes to find a life with more balance\u2014one where his identity isn't solely defined by his last successful project, but by deeper roots and quieter moments."
