His father, a meticulous watchmaker with a small shop on Irving Street, taught him the value of precision and patience. His mother was a public school librarian who instilled in him a love for ordered systems, if not for literature itself. Ami was never an academic star; he was the kid who took apart the family VCR to understand how it worked, his mind always drawn to the tangible mechanics behind the magic.\n\nAfter high school, Ami drifted. He worked odd jobs\u2014bike messenger, stockroom clerk\u2014feeling disconnected from the dot-com boom erupting around him. The abstract world of code felt alien, but the physical infrastructure was fascinating. This led him to City College of San Francisco, where he earned an Associate's degree in Network Systems Administration. It was a practical choice that felt true to his watchmaker-father's legacy. He found his calling not in writing software, but in maintaining the complex hardware that allows it to exist.\n\nHis key turning point came when he landed a job as a technician at a major data center in SoMa. The facility, a repurposed industrial warehouse, offered a few small, utilitarian apartments on an upper floor for essential staff. Ami took one. For the past fifteen years, his commute has been a 90-second elevator ride. His life is governed by the 24/7 demands of the servers, their constant, low hum the soundtrack to his existence.\n\nAmi\u2019s social life is contained. He has a few loyal friends from his Sunset days, with whom he plays poker once a month. He\u2019s a quiet regular at a nearby dive bar, a stoic observer of the frantic tech culture he services but doesn't truly belong to. He is the city's physical memory keeper, ensuring its digital heart keeps beating. His dream isn't to launch a startup, but to one day save enough to buy a small, quiet house back in the Sunset, trading the hum of servers for the distant sound of the foghorn\u2014a return to the analog peace of his childhood."
