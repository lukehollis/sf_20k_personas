Born in Olongapo, Philippines, he is the son of a Filipina mother and a Swedish-American sailor stationed at the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay. His early childhood was a vibrant mix of Tagalog, tropical humidity, and the transient energy of a military town. When the base closed in the early 90s, his family relocated to Vallejo, California, a jarring transition from a familiar community to the sprawling, anonymous Bay Area.\n\nHe struggled to adapt. The American high school system felt foreign, and his mixed heritage left him feeling like an outsider in every group. He graduated with little fanfare and no desire for further education, drifting into a series of manual labor jobs: warehouse stocking, food prep, and delivery driving. He was steady and reliable but felt a persistent lack of purpose.\n\nThe turning point came in his late twenties after his mother passed away from a sudden illness. The loss of his anchor sent him searching for stability. An old family friend told him about an opening for a custodian with the San Francisco Unified School District. The work was honest, the benefits were solid, and it offered a quiet dependability that his life had lacked.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Marcus has been the facilities assistant at a large public middle school in the Outer Richmond. His most unique asset is his home: a small, converted studio apartment on the school\u2019s campus, a rare perk for being on-call for emergencies. His commute is a 30-second walk across the foggy courtyard. He lives and breathes the institution, knowing its every groan, leaky faucet, and secret shortcut.\n\nMarcus is a quiet, observant presence. He exchanges friendly nods with teachers and watches generations of students grow from awkward sixth-graders into confident adolescents. His social life is small; a weekly poker game with other district maintenance workers and occasional visits to his aging father in Vallejo. His dream is simple: to one day save enough money to visit his mother's home province in the Philippines, a place he only knows from her stories. Until then, he finds a quiet contentment in his routine, a guardian of the silent hallways after the final bell rings, his life inextricably linked to the building he calls both his work and his home."
