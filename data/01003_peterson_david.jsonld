Raised in a working-class family, his father a general contractor and his mother a part-time bookkeeper, David learned the language of balance sheets and building permits at the dinner table. He saw formal education as a slow, inefficient path. While his peers studied for the SATs, David was on job sites, learning the tangible realities of zoning laws and material costs. He barely finished high school, his real education happening in the field, a practical apprenticeship that no university could offer.\n\nHis turning point came at 24. Working for a small-time developer in Ohio, he saw the immense capital flowing into coastal tech hubs and realized he\u2019d hit a local ceiling. With a few thousand dollars saved, he moved to San Francisco, fueled by scrappy ambition. He talked his way into a junior analyst position at a boutique real estate investment firm, where his raw, ground-level knowledge consistently outmaneuvered the Ivy League theories of his colleagues. He worked relentlessly, his lack of a degree a chip on his shoulder that drove him to be smarter and faster than everyone else.\n\nNow, at 34, David is a partner in his own development venture. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to a state-of-the-art home office in his condominium, overlooking the Bay Bridge. His life is a disciplined cycle: a 5 AM workout in the building\u2019s gym, followed by a twelve-hour day of calls with investors, architects, and city planners. His social life is largely an extension of his work\u2014industry events and high-stakes dinners. Deep connections are a luxury he feels he cannot yet afford, and his relationships often have the same transactional nature as his business deals.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of conquest and creation. He doesn\u2019t walk the Mission for burritos; he sees viable parcels for mixed-use development. His dream is no longer just wealth, but legacy. He wants to build something iconic, a structure that will permanently alter the skyline and cement the name of the Cleveland kid who built his own empire, one meticulously planned blueprint at a time."
