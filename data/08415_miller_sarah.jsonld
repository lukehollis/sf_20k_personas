Raised in a quiet Ohio suburb by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, Sarah was encouraged to pursue stable, sensible paths. She rebelled quietly, losing herself in the European masters and earning a graduate degree in Art History, dreaming of a life spent curating exhibits at a world-class museum.\n\nThe reality of student loan debt and the meager salaries in the art world provided a harsh awakening. During a post-grad visit to a friend in San Francisco, she saw a different path. The city\u2019s energy was intoxicating, and the dot-com boom was still echoing with opportunity. In a pivotal decision that still feels like a minor betrayal to her younger self, Sarah leveraged her sharp analytical skills\u2014honed by dissecting Renaissance paintings\u2014and took certification courses in finance. She was surprisingly good at it.\n\nShe ascended the corporate ladder with a relentless, quiet focus, becoming a Senior Financial Analyst at a major downtown firm. For years, her life was a blur of BART commutes and long hours in a sterile office tower. The pandemic, however, gifted her the one luxury she craved: time. She fought to make her remote work permanent, and now her 0.0-mile commute is a non-negotiable perk.\n\nHer days are structured. A morning coffee on her small balcony overlooking Alcatraz, a brisk walk up the Hyde Street hill for exercise, and then eight to ten hours untangling complex financial models. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of friends from a long-disbanded book club. Though professionally successful, a quiet restlessness stirs within her. She finds herself spending evenings browsing gallery openings online and has started a modest art collection. Sarah\u2019s future aspiration isn't to escape finance, but to merge her two worlds. She dreams of leveraging her wealth and analytical mind to join the board of SFMOMA or to create a grant for emerging Bay Area artists, finally curating a future that honors both the life she built and the one she left behind."
