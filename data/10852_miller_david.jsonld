His father, a first-generation immigrant from Korea, ran a small dry cleaning business, while his mother, of Chinese descent, worked as a seamstress. Growing up, David witnessed firsthand the struggles and resilience of the working class in the city, fostering a deep sense of empathy within him.  He attended public schools, excelling academically and exhibiting an early interest in social justice.\n\nHis path led him to UC Berkeley, where he initially considered a more traditional route but quickly found his passion in community work. A pivotal moment came during a volunteer stint at a local food bank, solidifying his commitment to serving others. He pursued a Master's in Nonprofit Management, recognizing the power of organized action to effect change. His early career involved positions at various community organizations, each experience shaping his understanding of the systemic issues facing marginalized communities.\n\nHe met his partner, Sarah, a public school teacher, at a neighborhood clean-up event \u2013 a shared commitment to their community forming an immediate bond. They live in a rent-controlled apartment in the Sunset District, a neighborhood they cherish for its quieter pace and diverse community. David\u2019s 3.5-mile bike commute to his downtown office is not just a means of transportation but a daily connection to the pulse of the city he serves.\n\nNow, as the Executive Director of a non-profit focused on providing essential services to low-income families, David\u2019s days are filled with grant writing, managing staff, and advocating for policy changes. He earns a comfortable, though not extravagant, income, prioritizing mission over wealth. His hopes are centered on expanding his organization's reach and impact, dreaming of a San Francisco where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive. Despite the challenges of non-profit work, David finds immense satisfaction in knowing he is contributing to a more equitable city, deeply rooted in the very neighborhoods he calls home."

            "value": "1.  The smell of his father\u2019s dry cleaning shop, a mix of solvents and starched cotton, is etched into David's memory. He remembers the worn counter, the rhythmic hum of machines, and the quiet determination on his father\u2019s face. This instilled a deep respect for hard work and the immigrant spirit, shaping his understanding of resilience from a young age, during his childhood in the Richmond.\n\n2.  Standing in line at the Berkeley Bowl, carrying grocery bags heavier than he was used to during that initial volunteer shift at the food bank, David felt a profound switch flip. Seeing the gratitude, and sometimes shame, in people's eyes ignited a burning desire to do more than just volunteer; it solidified his path towards nonprofit work and truly changed his career trajectory in his early college years.\n\n3.  Catching Sarah\u2019s eye across a pile of discarded plastic bottles at the neighborhood clean-up \u2013 it was instant. Her genuine smile and muddy knees spoke volumes. That shared commitment to their corner of San Francisco felt like coming home, solidifying his belief in finding partnership through shared purpose, early in his professional life.\n\n4.  The first time he saw his organization's name on a grant acceptance letter felt like a weight lifting and simultaneously a new one settling on his shoulders. It was validation of years of hard work, but also the daunting reality of expanded responsibility. This moment, a few years into his Executive Director role, cemented his drive to secure resources and make a tangible impact.\n\n5.  Riding his bike through the Sunset fog, the familiar chill on his face and the rhythmic whir of his wheels grounding him after a challenging day, David felt a deep sense of belonging. This daily commute, a constant in a demanding life, reminds him why he does what he does \u2013 serving the vibrant, complex city he navigates every single day, a feeling solidified throughout his adult life."
