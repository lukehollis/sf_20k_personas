A third-generation Japanese American, he was raised in Daly City by a civil engineer father who taught him the value of systems and a librarian mother who instilled in him a love for history. His childhood was a stable landscape of foggy summers and unassuming, middle-class expectations.\n\nFascinated by the rise and fall of empires, David pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History at UC Davis. He graduated in the mid-90s with no clear career path, just as the first dot-com boom was electrifying the Bay Area. He stumbled into a temp job at a chaotic startup, not as a coder, but as an office administrator tasked with bringing order to the madness. He discovered a natural talent for it; his study of historical systems gave him a unique perspective on creating efficient operational processes. While the company eventually folded in the dot-com bust, David\u2019s practical skills were transferable. He steadily built a career in operations, the unseen but essential force ensuring that the technical visionaries had a stable platform from which to launch.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce at 38. The amicable split left him rethinking the relentless pace of his life. He deliberately sought roles that valued stability over chaotic growth, eventually landing his current position as an Operations Manager. Now, he works from his meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a cherished routine: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, coffee from a favorite Clement Street cafe, and the quiet, focused hum of managing remote teams and digital infrastructure.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, centered on a few old friends and regular visits with his aging parents. At 49, David no longer chases ambition. His dream is a form of modern *shokunin*\u2014the pursuit of perfection in one's craft. He aspires to one day visit the small towns in Japan his grandparents left behind, not as a tourist, but as a quiet observer connecting his own orderly life to a deeper history. His San Francisco is not the glittering skyline, but the misty avenues of his neighborhood, a place where he has found a sustainable, personal peace."
