The son of hardworking Gujarati immigrants who ran a successful convenience store in suburban Fremont, Ethan grew up surrounded by the gospel of practicality and financial security. His parents had sacrificed everything for a stable American life, and they envisioned a future for their son paved with a respectable, high-earning profession like medicine or engineering.\n\nEthan, however, was drawn to the world of literature. He devoured novels and, against his family\u2019s gentle but persistent advice, pursued and earned an MFA in Creative Writing from a prestigious East Coast university. For two years post-graduation, he tried to make it as a writer, accumulating a stack of rejections and dwindling savings. The pressure mounted, and a pragmatic compromise felt inevitable. A friend connected him with an entry-level position at a Bay Area investment firm. To everyone\u2019s surprise, including his own, Ethan\u2019s sharp, analytical mind excelled at dissecting market trends. He was good at the job, and the steady promotions followed.\n\nNow 38, Ethan is a senior financial analyst who hasn\u2019t commuted in four years. His world is largely confined to his meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley, where he starts his day before dawn, analyzing global markets. The 0.0-mile commute offers a sterile efficiency he both appreciates and resents. It allows him to control his environment, but also deepens a sense of isolation. His social life is sparse, consisting of a few close friends from his analyst cohort and occasional, guarded dates that rarely lead anywhere substantial.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of proximity, not immersion. He loves the idea of the city\u2014its history of rebellion and art\u2014but he experiences it as a spectator, taking long, solitary walks through the Presidio or browsing the shelves at City Lights Bookstore, feeling like a ghost from a different life. His greatest aspiration has nothing to do with a corner office. Late at night, after the markets have closed and the city has quieted, he opens a password-protected file on his laptop. His dream is to finish the manuscript he abandoned a decade ago, to finally reconcile the analyst with the artist and write an ending where he is the main character of his own story."
