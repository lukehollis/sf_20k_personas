Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, she is the daughter of a second-generation Chinese-American father, who ran a small neighborhood grocery on Clement Street, and an Irish-American mother, a folk musician who fell in love with both the city and the man who stocked her favorite tea. Mei Li\u2019s childhood was a blend of weekend dim sum and evenings filled with the mournful strings of her mother\u2019s fiddle\u2014a lived-in fusion that defined her from the start.\n\nHer education was not found in a university lecture hall. While friends left for college, Mei Li stayed, her knowledge accumulating behind cash registers and in stockrooms. Her true diploma was an innate understanding of inventory, customer service, and the subtle art of running a small business, learned at her father\u2019s knee. The turning point came when she was 19, when her parents, worn down by the changing economics of the city, sold their beloved grocery. The loss felt like a severed root, and for a few years, Mei Li drifted through unfulfilling retail jobs.\n\nEverything changed when she was hired at \"The Daily Refill,\" a sustainable living and bulk goods store just a few blocks from her childhood home. Here, her practical, old-world retail sense merged with a modern, conscientious mission. She thrived, quickly rising to Assistant Store Manager.\n\nNow 26, Mei Li\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She lives in a small apartment directly above the store, making her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a familiar rhythm: a morning bun from the bakery on the corner, managing staff and inventory, and chatting with customers who are also her neighbors. Her social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends, mostly SF natives who understand the city\u2019s eccentricities.\n\nMei Li dreams of one day owning her own shop, a place that honors her family's legacy of community service while embracing a sustainable future. She envisions a modern general store, a hub where old neighbors and new arrivals can connect. She is deeply rooted, a guardian of the neighborhood\u2019s memory, striving to build something new upon the foundations of the past."
