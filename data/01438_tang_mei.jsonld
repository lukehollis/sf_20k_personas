Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, she is the daughter of a second-generation Chinese-American father, who ran a small neighborhood grocery on Clement Street, and an Irish-American mother, a folk musician who fell in love with both the city and the man who stocked her favorite tea. Mei Li\u2019s childhood was a blend of weekend dim sum and evenings filled with the mournful strings of her mother\u2019s fiddle\u2014a lived-in fusion that defined her from the start.\n\nHer education was not found in a university lecture hall. While friends left for college, Mei Li stayed, her knowledge accumulating behind cash registers and in stockrooms. Her true diploma was an innate understanding of inventory, customer service, and the subtle art of running a small business, learned at her father\u2019s knee. The turning point came when she was 19, when her parents, worn down by the changing economics of the city, sold their beloved grocery. The loss felt like a severed root, and for a few years, Mei Li drifted through unfulfilling retail jobs.\n\nEverything changed when she was hired at \"The Daily Refill,\" a sustainable living and bulk goods store just a few blocks from her childhood home. Here, her practical, old-world retail sense merged with a modern, conscientious mission. She thrived, quickly rising to Assistant Store Manager.\n\nNow 26, Mei Li\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She lives in a small apartment directly above the store, making her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. Her days are a familiar rhythm: a morning bun from the bakery on the corner, managing staff and inventory, and chatting with customers who are also her neighbors. Her social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends, mostly SF natives who understand the city\u2019s eccentricities.\n\nMei Li dreams of one day owning her own shop, a place that honors her family's legacy of community service while embracing a sustainable future. She envisions a modern general store, a hub where old neighbors and new arrivals can connect. She is deeply rooted, a guardian of the neighborhood\u2019s memory, striving to build something new upon the foundations of the past."

Her father\u2019s warm, calloused hands guided hers as they weighed dried goji berries on the old brass scale. The air was a mix of earthy fungus from the mushroom bins and the fragrant Keemun tea her mother was brewing in the back. From their small apartment above, she could hear the faint, sweet cry of her mother\u2019s fiddle. In that moment, she felt the perfect, warm center of her world, learning that community was measured in ounces and kindness.\n\n2.\nThe final day at the grocery, when she was 19, the shelves were skeletal. The silence was heavier than any inventory. She watched her father turn the key in the lock for the last time. The click was brutally loud, an official end to everything she knew. He didn\u2019t look at her, just stared at their name on the window, now a ghost. That sound wasn\u2019t just a lock turning; it was the severing of a root, a click that set her adrift in her own city.\n\n3.\nAt 21, folding sweaters in a soulless chain store, a manager chided her for spending too long talking to an elderly customer. \"Engage, upsell, and move on,\" he\u2019d said. The words felt like a violation. She remembered her father letting kids from the block have a piece of candy for free, knowing their names and their stories. The memory burned with a quiet fury, cementing her disdain for impersonal commerce and clarifying what she needed to find again: a place built on people, not transactions.\n\n4.\nHer first shift at The Daily Refill. A customer handed her a glass jar, and Mei Li pulled the lever on a bulk bin of red lentils. The rhythmic cascade and the dusty, earthy scent were a visceral echo of her childhood. But the context was new\u2014sustainability, mindful consumption. It wasn't just a job; it was a revelation. In the simple act of pouring lentils, she felt the broken threads of her past re-weaving into a future she could finally, passionately, build.\n\n5.\nJust last year, Mrs. Chen, a neighbor who\u2019d known her since birth, came into the store. \"This place,\" she said, looking around, \"it feels like your father's store. A place you come to talk, not just to buy.\" The words landed with the weight of a benediction. Suddenly, her dream of owning her own shop wasn't just a vague ambition. It was a clear purpose, a duty to carry her family's legacy of connection into a new San Francisco."
