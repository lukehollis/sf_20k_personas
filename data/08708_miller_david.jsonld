Raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and deeply rooted in Midwestern practicality. He was an observant, thoughtful child who preferred books to sports, a trait that led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature at Ohio State. He loved the structure of stories but had no clear idea how to turn that passion into a career.\n\nAfter graduating, he drifted, working at a bookstore and then as a freelance copy editor. The turning point came in the late 1990s. A college friend, swept up in the dot-com boom, called from San Francisco, insisting that tech companies desperately needed people who could simply write and organize information clearly. On a whim, David packed two suitcases and moved west. He landed a job as a technical writer, translating complex engineering jargon into user-friendly manuals. He discovered he had a knack not for coding, but for understanding the entire process\u2014the personalities, the deadlines, and the dependencies. This talent guided him naturally into project coordination.\n\nFor over two decades, David has navigated the tech industry's cycles of boom and bust, finding a stable niche as the person who ensures projects stay on track. A long-term relationship that defined his thirties ended amicably a few years ago, leaving him with a quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond and a newfound sense of solitary contentment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his life is intensely local. David\u2019s day begins not with a drive, but with a walk to a small cafe on Clement Street for a black coffee. He works from a tidy desk in his bay-windowed living room, the city\u2019s fog often his only coworker. His connection to San Francisco is less about the frenetic energy of SoMa and more about the rhythm of his neighborhood: the merchants setting up shop, the families walking in Golden Gate Park, the evening hum from local restaurants.\n\nAt 45, David feels a gentle pull toward his past. He\u2019s financially secure but creatively unfulfilled. His dream isn't a promotion, but to finally start the novel he\u2019s been outlining in his head for years\u2014a story about a man who moves across the country, only to find the place he was trying to escape was within himself all along."
