The daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small but beloved noodle shop on Clement Street, she grew up breathing in the scent of saltwater fog and simmering broth. Her childhood was a library of stories\u2014tales from her parents of a life across the ocean, and the daily dramas of the neighborhood regulars who treated their restaurant as a second home. This immersion in narrative sparked her desire to tell stories, leading her to pursue a journalism degree at San Francisco State University.\n\nGraduating in the late 90s, Michelle entered a field on the verge of digital disruption. She found brief success as a reporter for a local paper, but grew disillusioned with the relentless 24-hour news cycle and the shift toward clickbait. The turning point came during an assignment covering the closure of a century-old community center. While others focused on the immediate controversy, Michelle was captivated by the boxes of fading photographs and brittle documents being discarded. She realized she cared more about preserving the past than chasing the fleeting present.\n\nThis epiphany prompted a career pivot. She retrained in information science and found her true calling as a digital archivist. Now, as a senior archivist for a major cultural institution downtown, she spends her days safeguarding the city\u2019s memory\u2014digitizing fragile histories, from Gold Rush-era letters to the records of a defunct tech startup. Her work is a quiet rebellion against the ephemeral nature of the digital age.\n\nHer daily routine is a bedrock of stability. She takes the 5R Fulton MUNI from her tidy apartment, a few blocks from where she grew up, to her SoMa office. Evenings are often spent with her now-retired father, sharing a meal and listening to his familiar stories. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, many known since childhood, with whom she shares weekend dim sum and hikes at Land\u2019s End.\n\nMichelle\u2019s dream is to launch a personal project: a comprehensive digital archive of the Sunset and Richmond districts\u2019 Cantonese-speaking communities. She wants to preserve the stories of the grocers, the tailors, and the noodle shop owners like her parents, ensuring their history is not lost to gentrification and time. For Michelle, archiving isn't just a profession; it\u2019s an act of love for the city that raised her."

Mr. Chen would pat her head, leaving a dollar for candy. It wasn't just a restaurant; it was the world\u2019s safest harbor. That feeling of communal warmth and belonging became the bedrock of her life\u2019s work: to preserve such spaces, even if only in memory. This memory is from her early childhood.\n\n2. The assignment was a closing community center. While other reporters chased quotes, Michelle saw a box of photos marked for the dumpster. A faded portrait from the 1950s stared up at her, its subject\u2019s life suddenly more real than any soundbite. A profound ache hit her\u2014the realization that she was documenting destruction when her soul yearned to preserve. That moment of clarity in her late twenties ended her journalism career before she even drove back to the office.\n\n3. After her mother\u2019s passing, her father finally gifted her the restaurant's old recipe book. Its pages were soft as cloth, stained with soy sauce and grease, the penciled Cantonese characters faded from years of use. Holding it, she felt the weight of their entire history in her hands\u2014the gamble of immigration, the long hours, the love. This inheritance, given to her about five years ago, transformed her archival project from a dream into a non-negotiable duty.\n\n4. Early in her archiving career, she handled a Gold Rush-era letter from a Chinese merchant to his family. The paper was brittle, the ink faint, but the longing in the script was timeless. She saw her own parents\u2019 unspoken hopes in those hundred-year-old strokes. In that hushed, climate-controlled room, she felt a powerful connection across generations. It cemented the belief that her work wasn't about data, but about honoring the quiet, resilient ghosts of the city.\n\n5. Last winter, walking home from the MUNI stop, the fog rolled in so thick it erased the streetlights and muffled the city. It smelled of eucalyptus and salt, the exact scent of her childhood evenings. For a moment, she wasn't an archivist or a daughter, but simply a part of the Richmond's fabric, held by the same fog that had held generations before her. This recurring sensory memory always reaffirms her place in the world, anchoring her to the city she vows to remember."
