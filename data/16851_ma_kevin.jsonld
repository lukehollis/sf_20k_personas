The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, Kevin grew up in the back of his parents' small laundromat, absorbing the quiet rhythms of hard work and the stories of their customers. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable, lucrative career, Kevin was always more interested in people, possessing a calm empathy that drew others to him.\n\nHis path seemed set when he enrolled in the Social Work program at City College of San Francisco. He excelled, feeling he had found his calling. However, during his second year, his father suffered a major health crisis. Kevin dropped his classes to help run the laundromat and, more critically, to become his parents' full-time translator and advocate in navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system. This trial by fire became his true education. He saw firsthand the gaps in access and understanding that vulnerable communities faced.\n\nThe experience was a turning point. Realizing his bilingual skills and lived experience were invaluable, he found a position as a Community Health Worker for a non-profit serving families in his neighborhood. He never returned to finish his degree.\n\nToday, Kevin lives a life of purpose. He resides in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a 0.8-mile walk from his office. His days are a mosaic of home visits, connecting families with food assistance, translating at medical appointments, and mediating school issues. His social life is a tight-knit circle of high school friends, and he spends most Sundays sharing dim sum with his now-stable parents.\n\nKevin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but stability\u2014for his family and the families he serves. He hopes to one day finish his degree, not for a career change, but for himself. He is the city's invisible scaffolding, quietly holding his community together, one family at a time."

Mrs. Chen, a regular, was confiding in his mother about her son, her voice a quiet mix of Cantonese and worry. Kevin didn't understand every word, but he felt the weight of them. He learned then that the world was full of quiet stories you could only hear if you were still. It was the beginning of his empathy, long before any classroom.\n\n2.\nIn his first semester at City College, a guest lecturer\u2014a former addict who now ran a shelter\u2014spoke to his Social Work class. The man spoke with a raw honesty that cut through the academic jargon. Kevin felt a jolt of recognition, a feeling of finding his frequency. He walked out of that classroom onto Ocean Avenue feeling like the fog had lifted, not just over the city, but inside his own head. He knew, with absolute certainty, that this was the work he was meant to do.\n\n3.\nHe was nineteen, sitting under the flickering fluorescent lights of a hospital waiting room. His father, looking smaller than ever in the stiff chair, handed him a clipboard of medical intake forms. In his father\u2019s eyes, Kevin saw not just confusion, but total trust in him to bridge the gap. In that moment, the theories from his textbooks evaporated. The weight of that clipboard, the responsibility to translate fear into clarity, set the course for the rest of his life.\n\n4.\nHis first true breakthrough as a Community Health Worker was helping the Tran family get approved for CalFresh. He remembers Mrs. Tran, after weeks of calls and paperwork he'd translated, just holding the approval letter and crying quietly in her kitchen. The relief in that small room felt more profound and real than any academic achievement. It was the first time he truly understood that his lived experience wasn't a detour from his calling\u2014it was the path itself.\n\n5.\nJust last Sunday, at their usual dim sum table, he watched his parents argue playfully over the last siu mai. His father, healthier now, caught his eye and winked. The clatter of dishes, the steam from the carts, the familiar cadence of their voices\u2014it was everything. This simple, repeating moment was the stability he fought for, both for them and for the families he served. It wasn't a grand achievement, but a quiet, deeply felt peace."
