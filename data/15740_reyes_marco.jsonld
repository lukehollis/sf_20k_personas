Raised in Daly City, the son of Filipino immigrants, he grew up in a home filled with the aromas of adobo and the quiet hum of hardworking parents. His mother, a registered nurse, and his father, a logistics manager, instilled in him a profound sense of community service and the importance of education as a ladder.\n\nHis path wasn't always clear. At San Francisco State University, he chose psychology, fascinated by the \"why\" behind human decisions. He considered clinical therapy until a pivotal moment during his senior year. He watched his *lola* (grandmother) struggle for nearly an hour on the phone, trying to navigate a confusing online portal to schedule a medical appointment. In that moment of her frustration, Marco\u2019s purpose crystallized. He realized he could use his understanding of human cognition to bridge the gap between people and the essential technologies that were supposed to help them.\n\nThis led him directly to User Experience (UX) Research. He deliberately sought roles in sectors that mirrored his family\u2019s values: education, healthcare, and social services. Now, as a UX Researcher for a health-tech company, he spends his days conducting interviews, analyzing user data, and advocating for designs that are intuitive and accessible for everyone, especially those like his grandmother.\n\nMarco lives in a small apartment in the Mission District, a short, 2.8-mile MUNI ride from his SoMa office. His daily routine is a quintessentially San Francisco blend: a strong coffee from a local cafe, a packed commute on the J-Church line, and evenings spent either at a bouldering gym or sharing dinner with college friends. Weekends often involve visiting his family in Daly City, bringing back Tupperware filled with his mom's cooking.\n\nHis dream isn't about founding a unicorn startup. Instead, Marco aspires to lead a research team that fundamentally redesigns how underserved communities access public services online. He sees his work not as a tech job, but as a modern form of the community care he was raised on\u2014ensuring no one gets left behind in an increasingly digital world."

She would return from a 12-hour nursing shift at Seton Medical Center smelling of antiseptic and exhaustion. But her first act was always to check on him, her love a quiet, powerful force. In those moments, watching her deep-seated commitment to care, he understood service not as a grand gesture, but as a daily, human act of showing up. It became the bedrock of his professional compass.\n\n2. It was his senior year at SF State. He sat in his parents\u2019 kitchen in Daly City, listening to his *lola* on the phone. Her voice, usually so warm, was tight with frustration as she battled a confusing health portal. A simple task made impossible by code. Marco felt a surge of protective anger, followed by a sudden, striking clarity. His psychology degree wasn't for a clinic; it was for this. It was to tear down these invisible walls for her, and for everyone like her.\n\n3. About a year into his first UX job, he read a transcript from a user interview. An elderly man, after using a redesigned appointment scheduler, said, \"It was simple. I didn't have to call my daughter for help for once.\" The words hit Marco with profound force. It wasn't a product launch or a key metric; it was independence given back. It was his *lola\u2019s* struggle, inverted. In that moment, he knew he wasn\u2019t just a researcher\u2014he was an advocate for dignity.\n\n4. Some mornings on the crowded J-Church line, the train lurches past Dolores Park. Marco looks at the faces around him\u2014a student, a sous chef, a construction worker\u2014each person navigating their own world on their phone. This brief commute isn't just a trip to his SoMa office; it's a daily, silent user study. It\u2019s a tangible reminder of the beautifully complex, diverse, and often overlooked community he is designing for, one stop at a time. It keeps his work grounded in reality.\n\n5. He was at the bouldering gym a few months ago, staring at a difficult route, what climbers call a \"problem.\" His arms burned, but his mind was focused, searching for the next hold, the correct sequence. As his fingers finally found the key grip, it clicked. This was his work in microcosm: analyzing a complex system, finding the point of leverage, and creating a path. He realized then that his real ambition was to solve the biggest problems\u2014the systems that lock entire communities out."
