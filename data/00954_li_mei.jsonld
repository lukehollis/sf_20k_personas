The only child of immigrants, she was raised in a small home where the scent of her father's cooking from a Chinatown restaurant mixed with the salty air from Ocean Beach. Her parents instilled in her a quiet diligence and a deep appreciation for the city that gave them a new start. While they worked tirelessly, Mei found solace and wonder in the natural world at her doorstep: the sprawling wilderness of Golden Gate Park and the powerful tides of the Pacific.\n\nThis childhood fascination led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Environmental Science. She was driven by a desire to protect the ecosystems she grew to love. After graduating, Mei landed a coveted job at a major downtown engineering firm, but she quickly grew disillusioned. She felt her work was more about helping corporations navigate environmental regulations for profit\u2014a practice she called \"performative sustainability\"\u2014than making a genuine impact.\n\nThe turning point came at 29. After a contentious project involving a new luxury development, she quit. Using her savings, she established herself as an independent environmental consultant, working from a dedicated corner of her apartment. Her zero-mile commute is a point of pride. She now chooses her clients, focusing on non-profits, urban planning initiatives, and small businesses committed to tangible change.\n\nHer daily life is a structured blend of work and wellness. Mornings start with coffee from a local roaster before she dives into data analysis and environmental impact reports. She breaks for lunch with her partner, Alex, a freelance graphic designer she met at a neighborhood art walk. Evenings are for yoga, trying new recipes, or tending to the native plants on her balcony. Weekends are for visiting her parents, who still live in the Sunset, or for long hikes on Mount Tamalpais.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is her life\u2019s throughline. She is a product of its immigrant grit, its world-class education, and its progressive ideals. Her dream is to eventually launch a non-profit focused on restoring the SF Bay's shoreline habitats, transforming her lifelong passion into a lasting legacy for the city that shaped her."
