Raised in a quiet, orderly suburb of Naperville, Illinois, by a high school math teacher father and a librarian mother, he learned early to find comfort in systems and logic. While his peers were drawn to sports or music, Ethan was fascinated by the intricate bus schedules of Chicago and the flow of people through the local mall, seeing them not as chaos, but as complex, predictable equations.\n\nThis fascination led him not to computer science, but to a Master's in Urban Planning, with a heavy focus on quantitative analysis. He wanted to understand the human story behind the data\u2014the \"why\" behind the city's pulse. However, the slow pace of public sector work frustrated him. A post-graduation trip to San Francisco revealed a world where data was being used to build the future in real-time. He saw his calling not in zoning commissions, but in the burgeoning tech industry. He moved to the city at 27, landing a junior analyst role and quickly proving his value by translating user behavior into actionable insights.\n\nNow 36 and a Senior Data Analyst, Ethan\u2019s life is contained within his Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a mere ten steps from his bed to his desk. His days are a disciplined routine: pour-over coffee at 7 AM, deep work analyzing datasets until noon, a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green for lunch, and more analysis until he logs off sharply at 6 PM. The key turning point in his San Francisco life wasn't a promotion, but discovering the Dogpatch Boulders climbing gym. The physical problem-solving on the wall offered a necessary escape from the digital ether, and it\u2019s where he found his small, tight-knit circle of friends.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deeply analytical. He observes the city from his window\u2014the MUNI buses, the delivery apps, the shifting demographics\u2014as one massive, living dataset. His ultimate dream is to pivot back to his roots, using his high-level tech skills to work in civic tech, optimizing city services like housing or transportation. Ethan Miller isn't just living in San Francisco; he's constantly, quietly trying to solve it."
