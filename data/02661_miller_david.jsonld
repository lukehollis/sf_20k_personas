Raised in a blue-collar family where practicality was prized above all else, David learned to read the integrity of a structure with his hands long before he saw a blueprint. He bypassed a traditional four-year degree, instead earning an associate's in drafting from a community college at night while working as a site foreman during the day. He understood the language of both the architects with their grand visions and the electricians with their pragmatic concerns, making him a natural bridge between the two worlds.\n\nThe tech boom of the early 2000s pulled him west to San Francisco, a city remaking its skyline. The sheer scale and ambition were intoxicating. His big break came managing the complex renovation of a historic waterfront warehouse into a modern tech campus. The project was a high-wire act of preserving character while integrating cutting-edge infrastructure, and its success solidified his reputation. He proved he could deliver difficult projects on time and on budget, a rare and valuable skill.\n\nNow 43, David operates from a meticulously organized SoMa loft, where architectural plans cover a vast drafting table and dual monitors display Gantt charts and 3D renderings. His commute is a ten-foot walk from his kitchen to his desk. A demanding career contributed to a quiet divorce years ago, and his social life is now a curated circle. His day is a disciplined sequence of Zoom calls with developers, digital walkthroughs with clients, and troubleshooting with contractors. He breaks the digital monotony with a morning run along the Embarcadero and an evening walk to a local wine bar, where he trades industry gossip with a few old colleagues.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is etched in steel and glass; he navigates the city by the projects he helped build. He sees the skyline not as a static image, but as a living blueprint he\u2019s had a hand in drawing. David\u2019s quiet dream is to one day manage his own project from start to finish: a small, sustainable cabin in the Sierra, a testament to simplicity built with the hard-won precision he\u2019s spent a lifetime perfecting."
