Born in Toronto to a Punjabi Sikh father and a second-generation Irish-American mother, she grew up in a household of quiet, intellectual dissonance. Her name was a bridge between worlds she never fully inhabited, leaving her feeling ethnically amorphous, an observer rather than a participant. The family moved to a quiet California suburb when she was ten, where her sense of otherness only deepened.\n\nForgoing a traditional college path, Sarah found her university in the sprawling, chaotic libraries of the early internet. She was a natural-born organizer of information, a self-taught taxonomist of the digital world. The turning point came with her father\u2019s death when she was 27. Tasked with handling his digital estate, she spent a year piecing together his life from scattered emails, corrupted hard drives, and forgotten cloud accounts. In resurrecting his digital ghost, she discovered her vocation: preserving the legacies of others.\n\nNow 41, Sarah is a freelance digital archivist, working from her meticulously organized apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. Her clients are private families, aging artists, and small foundations seeking to bring order to their digital chaos. Her work is intimate and solitary; she sifts through decades of photos, documents, and correspondence, building coherent narratives from the ether.\n\nHer life in San Francisco mirrors her work. She chose the city for its promise of anonymity and acceptance of the unconventional. Her daily routine is a quiet ritual: strong coffee, hours spent immersed in her digital digs, and a late afternoon walk through the foggy expanses of Golden Gate Park to decompress. Social connections are few but meaningful\u2014a weekly video call with her mother in Oregon, a standing Friday wine night with her one close friend, a potter from down the street.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is not of wealth or recognition, but of continued purpose. She hopes to one day create an open-source guide for people to archive their own lives, democratizing the act of remembrance. She is a guardian of modern memory, finding profound human connection not in crowded rooms, but in the quiet, glowing data streams of lives lived."
