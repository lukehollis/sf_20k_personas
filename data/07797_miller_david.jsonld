The only son of Elena and Ricardo Miller, who immigrated from Jalisco, Mexico, in the 1970s, David was raised in Fresno. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, poured their energy into their small landscaping business, instilling in him a profound sense of duty and a meticulous work ethic. While they dreamed of him becoming a lawyer or doctor, David was a quieter soul, lost in history books that offered an escape from the valley heat.\n\nHe stayed close to home for college, earning a Bachelor's in History from Fresno State. The degree seemed impractical to his parents, but for David, it was about understanding the systems and stories that shape the world. In the late 90s, the magnetic pull of the dot-com boom drew him to San Francisco. He wasn't a coder, but his methodical, history-trained mind found a perfect niche. He started in project coordination at a burgeoning startup, discovering a talent for untangling logistical knots and making complex processes run smoothly. He survived the dot-com bust by being indispensable, quietly ensuring the lights stayed on while others chased fleeting glory. This forged his career path in operations, where he became a calm, stabilizing force in the chaotic tech world.\n\nNow 49, David lives a life of comfortable solitude in his NoPa condo. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured by his own rhythms. Mornings start with a walk to a favorite cafe for an oat latte, followed by hours of focused work managing global teams via video calls. His key turning point came three years ago with the passing of his mother, his father having died years earlier. Freed from his role as the long-distance dutiful son, he is now recalibrating his future.\n\nHe feels deeply connected to the city's settled-in neighborhoods, a veteran who has watched SF's skyline and culture shift dramatically. His social life is small but meaningful\u2014a weekly trivia night with former colleagues and dinners with a few trusted friends. His dream is no longer about a promotion, but about fulfillment. He\u2019s saving aggressively to one day trade his operations checklists for a backpack, finally visiting the Roman ruins and forgotten battlefields he once only read about in his Fresno bedroom."
