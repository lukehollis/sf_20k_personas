Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, he was the son of a pragmatic civil engineer father, whose family had been in California for generations since the Spanish land grant days, and a thoughtful high school English teacher mother from the Midwest. This parental combination instilled in Cody a unique dual-mindedness: a respect for hard data and structure, and a love for the power of a well-told story.\n\nHis journey to San Francisco began at SF State, where he pursued a journalism degree. Initially envisioning a career as a traditional beat reporter, a pivotal internship during his junior year changed his trajectory. Tasked with organizing city polling data for a local news outlet, he discovered a passion for finding the narratives hidden within spreadsheets. He quickly pivoted, taking courses in statistics and data visualization, realizing the future of journalism wasn't just in words, but in the patterns they revealed. This foresight landed him his current role at a data-driven news startup in SoMa.\n\nNow 27, Cody\u2019s life is defined by a disciplined routine. His day begins with a 2.5-mile bike ride from his small-but-sunny apartment in the Inner Mission, a commute that takes him past colorful murals and the early morning lines at neighborhood panaderias. At work, he spends his hours wrangling complex datasets into compelling infographics and articles about urban life, from housing affordability to transit efficiency. His $95,000 salary affords him a comfortable, if not extravagant, existence in a city known for its high cost of living.\n\nRecently out of a long-term relationship, his social life is a close-knit circle of work friends and a couple of college buddies. Evenings often involve a craft beer at a local taproom or a run through Dolores Park. Cody\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal; he analyzes the city\u2019s flaws by day while loving its vibrant, chaotic energy by night. His aspiration is to one day lead a major investigative project that uses data to expose a significant city-wide inequity, hopefully creating not just an impactful story, but tangible change."

Suddenly, the numbers clicked into a map in his head\u2014a hidden story of neighborhood neglect. It wasn't just data; it was a revelation. In that silent, fluorescent-lit moment in his junior year at SF State, he found his true calling, pivoting from traditional reporting to the powerful narratives hidden within the numbers.\n\n2.\nHe recalls the day he got the keys to his Inner Mission apartment. The landlord left, and he stood alone in the empty living room. Afternoon light streamed through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. For the first time since moving to the city, a profound sense of ownership washed over him\u2014not of property, but of his life here. This small, sunny space, secured a year after graduation, was his official foothold, a tangible reward for his hard work.\n\n3.\nHe remembers sitting on the upper slope of Dolores Park, the city skyline impossibly beautiful as his long-term relationship ended. The conversation was quiet, more resignation than anger. As she walked away, the park, once a symbol of their shared joy, became a landmark of his solitude. That evening walk home alone through the Mission six months ago marked the painful start of rediscovering the city, and himself, on his own terms, reinforcing a bittersweet independence he hadn't planned for.\n\n4.\nHe\u2019ll never forget hitting \"publish\" on an interactive map detailing Muni \u201cghost bus\u201d patterns two years ago. He had spent weeks cleaning the messy transit data. That afternoon, his phone buzzed with notifications\u2014people were sharing it, arguing in the comments, seeing their daily frustration validated by his work. It was the first time he felt his professional ambition solidify into real-world impact: turning frustrating data into a story that made thousands of San Franciscans feel seen.\n\n5.\nThere was a late-night bike ride home from SoMa about a year into his job. He crested the small hill on Folsom Street as cool fog rolled in, muffling the city sounds. Ahead, streetlights reflected on the damp pavement, and the smell of a nearby taqueria hung in the air. He felt a sudden, overwhelming affection for the city's imperfect, pulsing energy. In that solitary moment, he wasn\u2019t just an analyst studying the city; he was part of its living, breathing dataset."
