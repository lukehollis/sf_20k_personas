Raised in the starkly practical landscape of Bakersfield, her childhood was devoid of the creative chaos she now orchestrates. Her parents, a mechanic and a bookkeeper, preached stability over passion, which led Sarah to a community college associate's degree in Business Administration\u2014a sensible, uninspiring choice. In her early twenties, she fled the Central Valley\u2019s oppressive heat for the foggy allure of San Francisco, seeking a life she couldn\u2019t yet define.\n\nHer entry into the art world was pure chance. A temp agency placed her at a small SoMa gallery during a frantic installation week. While artists debated aesthetics, Sarah saw a system in disarray. She instinctively started organizing shipping manifests, coordinating with trucking companies, and creating a coherent schedule. The gallery owner, impressed by her quiet competence, offered her a permanent job. Sarah had found her calling not in creating art, but in ensuring it could be seen. For over two decades, she has been the invisible force behind countless exhibitions, the logistical linchpin for sculptors, painters, and multimedia artists.\n\nNow 46, Sarah lives in a converted warehouse loft in Dogpatch, a space that is both her home and her office, hence the zero-mile commute. Her days are a flurry of emails and international calls, her kitchen table often doubling as a staging ground for crating supplies. Having weathered multiple tech booms, she remains a steadfast member of the city\u2019s shrinking arts-first community. Her relationships are deep but few, primarily with the artists who rely on her as a confidant and problem-solver.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of fame or fortune. She aspires to use her modest savings to curate and fund a small show for emerging local artists\u2014the kind who are easily priced out of the city\u2019s glossy gallery scene. It\u2019s her way of protecting the ecosystem that gave her a purpose. Sarah Miller is a testament to the fact that for every masterpiece hanging on a wall, there is someone like her in the background, making sure it gets there safely."
