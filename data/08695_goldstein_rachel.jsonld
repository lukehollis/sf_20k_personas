            "value": "Rachel Goldstein was born into a world of books and theory in Berkeley. Her father, a history professor, and her mother, a librarian, raised her in a home where ideas were paramount. But Rachel was a creature of sawdust and steel; she was always more interested in how things were built than in the philosophy behind them. Eschewing the four-year university path expected of her, she moved across the bay to San Francisco in the late 1980s and enrolled in a community college, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Stagecraft Technology.\n\nShe found her tribe in the city\u2019s gritty, underfunded experimental theater scene. Rachel thrived on the chaos, quickly earning a reputation as the person who could build a rotating set on a shoestring budget or fix a faulty lighting rig minutes before curtain. Her career wasn\u2019t a ladder so much as a slow, steady accumulation of trust and expertise. The dot-com boom was a turning point; as arts funding dried up, she pragmatically took on lucrative but soulless corporate event production gigs. It was a compromise that allowed her to secure the ultimate San Francisco prize: a sprawling, rent-controlled live/work loft in SoMa before the neighborhood became unaffordable.\n\nNow 53, Rachel is the unseen anchor of the city\u2019s arts world. As a Production Supervisor, she orchestrates everything from major museum installations to festival stages, all from her SoMa fortress. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life and work are seamlessly intertwined; the ground floor of her loft is a workshop of tools and half-finished projects, while her living space is a cozy sanctuary upstairs.\n\nHer social life consists of a chosen family of fellow technicians, artists, and the bartender at her local dive. A long-term relationship with a charismatic but unreliable director ended a decade ago, leaving her content with her well-ordered independence. Rachel\u2019s dream is no longer about the next big show. She aspires to downshift, perhaps mentoring young technicians or finding a position with a small community theater. She wants to pass on her practical magic, ensuring that even as the city changes around her, someone will always know how to build the world for the story."
