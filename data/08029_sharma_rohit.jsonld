Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a mother who taught high school history, his upbringing was a blend of fiscal discipline and rich storytelling. He was encouraged to pursue a stable path, leading him to a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics\u2014a practical, if uninspiring, choice.\n\nHis early career was in corporate finance in Mumbai, a world of spreadsheets and quarterly reports. While competent, Rohit felt a profound disconnect. The real turning point came in his late twenties. Intrigued by the burgeoning tech scene, he began devouring online tutorials on data analysis, teaching himself SQL and Python in the evenings. He discovered a passion for finding the narrative hidden within numbers, a skill that felt like a perfect synthesis of his parents\u2019 influences.\n\nThis self-driven education led to a career pivot. He landed an analyst job at a tech firm in Bangalore, and for the first time, felt professionally alive. His breakthrough came at age 32 when he was recruited by a major San Francisco tech company. Arriving with two suitcases, he was overwhelmed by the city\u2019s steep hills and even steeper cost of living, but exhilarated by the professional challenge.\n\nNow 41, Rohit is a senior data analyst who has worked entirely from his NoPa (North of the Panhandle) apartment since the pandemic normalized remote work. His life is one of structured discipline. Mornings start with a run through the Panhandle, followed by hours translating complex data into actionable insights for his team. His 0.0-mile commute gives him an intimate connection to his neighborhood; he knows the baristas at his local coffee shop on Divisadero and the best time to get fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n\nWhile professionally successful, he feels a quiet yearning for deeper personal connections. His social life revolves around a small group of friends, but he hopes to find a lasting partnership. Having achieved the career stability his father championed, Rohit\u2019s current dream is to build a life in San Francisco that is as rich and multifaceted as the datasets he so expertly navigates each day."
