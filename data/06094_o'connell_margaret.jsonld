Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, the daughter of a civil engineer who built freeways, she spent her youth yearning for walkable streets and vibrant public squares. This contrast fueled her academic path, leading her from a history degree at UC Davis to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley in the early 1990s.\n\nHer early career was idealistic, working for the City of Oakland\u2019s planning department during the dot-com boom. She championed mixed-use developments and public transit expansions, believing she could help shape a more equitable Bay Area. The key turning point came with the 2008 financial crisis. Facing departmental cuts and bureaucratic stagnation, she pivoted to the private sector, joining a prestigious San Francisco consulting firm. The move felt like a compromise, but it gave her greater influence on larger, more ambitious projects, even if it meant navigating the complex demands of private developers.\n\nAnother defining moment was the end of her decade-long relationship with an environmental lawyer. He wanted to move to Marin for a quieter life; Margaret couldn't imagine leaving the city that was both her home and her life's work. The breakup, nearly fifteen years ago, solidified her identity. The city, with all its flaws and potential, became her most enduring partner.\n\nToday, Margaret lives in a meticulously restored Edwardian flat in Cole Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her kitchen to a home office overlooking the street. Her days are a mix of Zoom calls with city officials, poring over zoning codes, and mentoring junior planners. Her routine is grounded in her neighborhood: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, coffee from her favorite local cafe, and a weekly trip to the Clement Street Farmers Market. She knows the names of her neighbors and the mail carrier, embodying the community fabric she advocates for professionally.\n\nAt 54, Margaret\u2019s ambition has shifted from changing the world to leaving a tangible legacy. Her dream is to see her signature project\u2014a car-free, affordable housing development in the Mission Bay\u2014break ground before she retires. It represents the culmination of her life\u2019s purpose: to build a small piece of the San Francisco she always envisioned."
