His 0.0-mile commute from his bed to his standing desk is a testament to the life he\u2019s carefully constructed since moving to San Francisco a decade ago.\n\nBorn and raised in a quiet suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, Kevin was the son of a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing librarian mother. They instilled in him a love for order and stories, which manifested in an unexpected way. He rebelled gently, eschewing a business degree for a Bachelor's in History, fascinated by the patterns and narratives of the past. After graduation, he found that a history degree didn\u2019t pay the bills. He spent three years drifting through unfulfilling administrative jobs in Chicago, feeling increasingly lost.\n\nThe turning point came at a drab marketing firm where he was tasked with organizing years of customer survey data. He discovered a knack for it, finding the hidden stories within the spreadsheets more compelling than any history textbook. This was a new kind of archaeology. He promptly enrolled in online data science courses, teaching himself SQL and Python at night. In 2013, a San Francisco startup took a chance on the history major with a passion for data, and he never looked back.\n\nNow at 39, Kevin is a senior data analyst for a major tech company. His life is one of disciplined routine: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, pour-over coffee from a local cafe, and eight hours logged in from his apartment overlooking Geary Boulevard. His social life is small but tight-knit, consisting of a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game with other tech transplants and the occasional hike in Marin. A long-term relationship ended two years ago, and he has since found a quiet comfort in his solitude.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of an appreciative observer. He loves the fog rolling over the avenues and the city\u2019s endless culinary options, but he often feels detached from its frantic energy. His dream isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to finally write that book\u2014a data-driven historical analysis of trade routes\u2014and perhaps find a connection that pulls him out of his comfortable routine and back into the story of the city itself."
