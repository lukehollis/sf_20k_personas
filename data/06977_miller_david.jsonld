Born in the Mission District to a mother who had immigrated from Michoac\u00e1n and an American father who left when he was five, David learned responsibility early. While his friends were dreaming of college, David was focused on helping his mother make rent, taking on odd jobs after school. He graduated from high school with a diploma in one hand and a full-time job offer in the other.\n\nHis career began at 18 on the floor of the very warehouse he now supervises. It was a local department store\u2019s distribution center then, gritty and familial. He learned every job: packing boxes, driving a forklift, managing inventory sheets. Over three decades, through loyalty and a quiet, steady competence, he worked his way up. When a national retail giant bought the company, David\u2019s institutional knowledge made him indispensable, and he was promoted to supervisor.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was a practical one. Fifteen years ago, the company converted the storage space above the warehouse into a few stark, functional loft apartments for essential personnel. David took one. The move solidified his identity as the heart of the operation but strained his marriage, which soon ended. His ex-wife wanted a yard in the East Bay; David couldn\u2019t imagine a commute.\n\nHis life now runs on the rhythm of delivery trucks. His \"commute\" is a flight of metal stairs from his apartment down to the concrete floor. He has a daughter, Elena, now a graphic designer in Oakland, who is the immense pride of his life. He poured his unspent dreams into her education. His social life is the local pub, where he shares beers with a few of his crew members after a long shift.\n\nDavid is an anchor to a vanishing San Francisco. He watches the neighborhood gentrify around his brick building, seeing new condos and artisan coffee shops replace old machine shops. He feels more like a caretaker of a bygone era than a resident of the modern city. His aspirations are simple: to see his crew keep their jobs until he can retire, and perhaps buy a small fishing boat. But he secretly fears retirement, wondering who he would be without the familiar hum of the warehouse beneath his feet."
