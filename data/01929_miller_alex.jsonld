His childhood was stable, predictable, and steeped in a Midwestern practicality he would one day both rely on and resent. He rebelled not with loud music or fast cars, but by majoring in English Literature, dreaming of a life surrounded by words, perhaps as a novelist or an editor in a city that crackled with creative energy.\n\nIn his early twenties, that city became San Francisco. He arrived in the late 1990s with two suitcases and a head full of Kerouac, finding a cheap room in the Mission. The dream, however, quickly collided with the reality of rent. A temp agency placed him in a data-entry role at a large insurance firm to make ends meet. It was meant to be temporary, but Alex discovered an unexpected aptitude for the work. His literary training made him a meticulous reader of reports, and his calm demeanor was well-suited for processing claims. One promotion led to another, and by his early thirties, the temporary job had ossified into a permanent career as a claims adjuster. The novel was never started.\n\nHis primary long-term relationship ended a decade ago, a casualty of what his partner called \u201ca failure of nerve.\u201d He had become too cautious, too focused on risk assessment in his life as well as his work. Now, his social connections are limited to a few old friends and the familiar faces at his local pub in the Inner Richmond, where he\u2019s lived for fifteen years.\n\nAlex\u2019s life operates on a quiet, disciplined rhythm. Since his work went fully remote, his commute is a ten-step walk to a desk in his spare room. He spends his days analyzing accidents and calculating loss, a detached arbiter of misfortune. In the evenings, he takes long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park or the Presidio, the Pacific fog rolling in as a familiar companion. He loves San Francisco not for its frantic energy, but for these pockets of contemplative quiet. His dream is no longer of literary fame, but of simple security\u2014to keep his rent-controlled apartment and retire without worry. He is a man who has successfully insured himself against all risks, at the cost of any chance at grand adventure."
