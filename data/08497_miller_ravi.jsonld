Born in Cupertino to a vibrant, artistic mother from Mumbai and a quiet, methodical American father, his childhood was a blend of fragrant spice markets and Silicon Valley pragmatism. His mother, a gifted home cook, taught him that food was a language of love and memory. His father, an engineer, taught him the value of a stable plan. This dichotomy defined Ravi\u2019s early path.\n\nPressured to pursue a conventional career, Ravi enrolled in business classes at a state college. He lasted three semesters. The world of spreadsheets and marketing theory felt hollow compared to the tangible satisfaction of transforming raw ingredients into something that could bring people together. He found more purpose experimenting with his mother\u2019s recipes in his dorm\u2019s communal kitchen than he ever did in a lecture hall. The turning point came when he cashed out his remaining tuition money and moved to a shared apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District in the late 1990s, determined to make a life in the kitchen.\n\nHe started at the bottom, washing dishes and working the line in bustling, demanding restaurants. He absorbed the discipline and pace, but the cutthroat, high-pressure environment never felt like home. His true calling revealed itself a decade ago when he answered an ad for a Kitchen Manager at \u201cThe Kiln,\u201d a large live/work artist collective in a converted Dogpatch warehouse.\n\nToday, Ravi lives in a small loft apartment directly above the industrial kitchen he manages. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of steel stairs. He is the quiet, steady anchor of the community, a paternal figure to the painters, sculptors, and musicians who call The Kiln home. His days are a rhythm of farmer\u2019s market runs, menu planning based on what\u2019s in season, and orchestrating communal meals that have become legendary among the residents. His relationships are deep and familial, forged over shared dinners and early morning coffee.\n\nRavi\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a Michelin star, but something more lasting. He hopes to one day compile his recipes\u2014a mix of his mother\u2019s traditional Indian dishes and his own Californian creations\u2014into a small community cookbook. His aspiration is to continue nurturing the found family he feeds daily, proving that the most profound art can be a life built with care, purpose, and a well-seasoned meal."
