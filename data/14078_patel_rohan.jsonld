The only child of Indian immigrants who ran a small corner grocery store, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a blend of American schooling and the subtle, constant pressure to help the family business. He learned to count change before he could properly ride a bike and understood inventory management better than algebra.\n\nCollege was the expected path, but life intervened. During his senior year of high school, his father suffered a heart attack, a stark reminder of his parents\u2019 mortality and the fragility of their finances. The choice became painfully clear: he could take on student debt for a future he couldn't guarantee, or he could start earning immediately. He chose the latter, shelving his half-formed plans for community college to help stabilize his family.\n\nPossessing a natural charm and the street smarts honed from years in his parents' store, Rohan found a low-level assistant job at a real estate firm. He was a quick study, absorbing the language of leases, market rates, and client management. Within two years, he passed his real estate license exam on the first try. Now, as a leasing agent, he's in a constant state of hustle, his $62,000 income a direct result of his unrelenting drive and ability to close deals.\n\nHis daily life is a map of San Francisco\u2019s public transit. He lives with two roommates in a classic, slightly worn-down apartment in the Inner Richmond. Each morning, he takes the Muni across the city to his SoMa office, scrolling through new listings on his phone. His days are a blur of apartment showings, from tiny studios in the Tenderloin to two-bedrooms in Noe Valley. He is intimately familiar with the city's every corner, a gatekeeper to the very dream of living in SF that he himself is still chasing.\n\nRohan\u2019s ultimate goal is to be on the other side of the transaction. He dreams of saving enough for a down payment on a small condo, a tangible piece of the city he sells to others every day. He maintains a tight circle of high school friends, some of whom are finishing grad school, and while he sometimes feels a pang of what could have been, he\u2019s fiercely proud of the path he\u2019s forged. For Rohan, San Francisco isn't an abstract concept; it's a grid of opportunities, and he\u2019s determined to claim his square."

Rohan meticulously checked the invoice for the soda delivery against the towering pallets, his small hand steady as he signed. For the first time, he felt not like a kid helping out, but like a partner. The weight of the family business settled onto his shoulders, and he found he could carry it. This was the moment responsibility became his identity.\n\n2.\nThe memory that haunts him is the smell of the SF General waiting room when he was seventeen. His father was in the CCU, and Rohan could feel his mother\u2019s silent tremors beside him. Tucked in his backpack was a City College application, full of highlighted courses. He looked at his mother's worn hands, then imagined the tuition bills. Without a word, he mentally tore up the application. In that sterile, quiet room, he traded a future of what-ifs for the certainty of his family\u2019s immediate survival.\n\n3.\nIt was his first solo closing, two years ago. He handed the keys to a tiny North Beach studio to a young couple, musicians who looked dizzy with joy. Their gratitude was overwhelming. Walking down the hill towards the Transamerica Pyramid, his phone buzzed with the commission notification. It wasn\u2019t a huge amount, but it felt like a fortune. It was the first dollar he\u2019d earned that wasn't for survival, but for a future. It was the sound of his hustle paying off, proving he belonged.\n\n4.\nLast year, he was grabbing beers with his high school friends at a dive bar in the Haight. They were complaining about their grad school workloads and thesis advisors. A sharp, bitter pang of envy hit him\u2014a fleeting vision of a life he didn't choose. But when the bill came, he casually tapped his card to pay for the round without checking his balance. In that small gesture, pride surged past the envy. His path was different, harder, but it was real and he was succeeding on his own terms.\n\n5.\nHe showed a studio in the Tenderloin last month. The prospective tenant was a young man, not much older than himself, with hopeful eyes and a nervous energy Rohan knew well. As Rohan explained the income requirements and the application process, he saw a mirror of his own ambition and anxiety. He wasn't just a gatekeeper; he was a guide. The interaction left him with a hollow ache and a renewed, fierce determination to one day be the one receiving the keys, not just handing them over."
