The only child of Cantonese immigrants, he grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District. His father, a pragmatic and hardworking grocer, saw the city as a grid of commercial opportunities. David, however, saw it as a living museum of form and texture\u2014the ornate Victorians, the stark lines of the Sutro Tower, the cascading hills. While his father hoped he\u2019d pursue business, David spent hours sketching the city\u2019s unique architectural language, a silent rebellion drawn in graphite.\n\nHis formal education took him from a state university to a prestigious Master of Architecture program on the East Coast, but San Francisco always called him back. He returned in the mid-90s, just as the first dot-com boom was reshaping the skyline. While his peers chased lucrative contracts designing sterile tech campuses, David resisted. He carved out a niche for himself in the arts, believing that a city\u2019s soul resides not in its offices, but in its galleries, theaters, and public spaces. This decision defined his career, leading him to establish his own small, highly respected firm.\n\nNow, David lives and works in a converted warehouse loft in Dogpatch, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his living quarters to his studio downstairs. His days are a disciplined ritual of drafting, model-making, and quiet contemplation, punctuated by client meetings at construction sites or nearby cafes. A significant long-term relationship ended a decade ago, strained by his unwavering dedication to his craft, leaving him more introspective. His social life is a small, curated circle of artists, writers, and academics who share his appreciation for quiet conversation over loud parties.\n\nDavid feels an intense, almost paternal connection to San Francisco. He laments the hyper-gentrification but finds hope in the resilient creative scenes in its nooks and crannies. His future aspirations are not for wealth or fame, but for legacy. He dreams of designing a community arts center or a small, perfectly executed museum\u2014a permanent contribution to the cultural fabric of the city that raised him, a space that will inspire another quiet kid sketching in the fog."
