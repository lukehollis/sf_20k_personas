His grandparents were part of the Indian diaspora in the Pacific, and his parents immigrated to Sacramento, California, where they instilled in him a powerful work ethic, hoping he\u2019d pursue medicine or engineering. However, Vikram found his voice not in labs, but under the stage lights of his high school drama club. For a quiet, observant boy navigating a complex Indo-Fijian-American identity, theater was a space where he could explore every facet of himself.\n\nThis passion led him to UCLA for his MFA in Theater Arts, a decision that caused a gentle rift with his pragmatic parents. He threw himself into his studies, absorbing everything from classical Greek tragedy to experimental performance art. After graduating, he moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a haven for boundary-pushing artists. He spent years in the trenches of the Bay Area theater scene\u2014stage-managing, acting in small non-equity shows, and directing fringe festival pieces on a shoestring budget. His turning point came when a bold, multicultural adaptation of a classic play he directed gained critical notice, leading to his current role as Artistic Director for a respected-but-underfunded theater in the Mission District.\n\nNow, at 34, Vikram\u2019s life is his art. He lives in a small but bright apartment in Hayes Valley, a 2.1-mile Muni ride from the theater. His days are a whirlwind of grant writing, season planning, and late-night rehearsals. His social circle is woven from the fabric of his work\u2014actors, playwrights, and designers he collaborates with. He is fiercely dedicated to his theater\u2019s mission: to amplify stories from underrepresented communities. Vikram dreams of securing enough funding to offer his artists a living wage and, one day, transferring a home-grown show to a larger stage. For him, San Francisco is not just a city; it is a canvas, and he is determined to paint it with the vibrant, diverse stories he believes the world needs to see."

The cheap velvet costume felt like armor. For the first time, he wasn't just the Indo-Fijian kid navigating Sacramento suburbs; he was someone else entirely. The applause felt like a validation that echoed louder than his parents' career hopes. In that echo, he found the first true sound of his own voice.\n\n2.\nHe was 22, clutching the phone after telling his father he\u2019d chosen UCLA\u2019s MFA theater program. There was no yelling, just a long, heavy silence that felt more damning than any argument. In that quiet, Vikram could feel the future his parents had built for him\u2014a stable, respectable life\u2014dissolving. That silence was the price of his dream. It was the moment he learned that creating his own story meant gently breaking the heart of the one they\u2019d written for him.\n\n3.\nDirecting a fringe show at 28 in a leaky black box theater south of Market. A crucial light blew mid-performance, but the lead actress, without a cue, finished her monologue illuminated only by the faint glow of an exit sign. The audience leaned in, utterly rapt. In that moment of near-disaster turned accidental genius, Vikram felt a surge of love for the grit and resilience of San Francisco theater. It wasn't about perfection; it was about making magic from whatever you had.\n\n4.\nIt was the opening night of his multicultural adaptation of *Antigone* that changed everything. He was 31, hiding in the back of the theater. He saw an elderly Latina woman gasp at a line, her expression mirroring a young Black man two rows ahead of her. He wasn\u2019t just watching a play; he was watching strangers connect across cultures through his art. This wasn't just directing; it was bridge-building. That night solidified the mission that would define his entire career.\n\n5.\nJust last month, riding the J Church Muni home to Hayes Valley after a 14-hour tech rehearsal. Exhausted, he watched the city lights blur past and saw a poster for a blockbuster show at a major downtown theater. A sharp pang of envy hit him, followed by a surge of fierce determination. He wasn\u2019t just fighting for his theater anymore; he was fighting for its place on that larger canvas. The 2.1-mile ride felt like the distance between his reality and his ultimate ambition."
