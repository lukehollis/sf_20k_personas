The only child of a public school teacher and an accountant, she grew up in a household that valued both civic duty and fiscal responsibility. Her mother\u2019s dinner-table stories of under-resourced students instilled in her an early sense of injustice, while her father\u2019s pragmatism taught her that good intentions required sound planning.\n\nThis duality defined her educational journey. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an elective on urban poverty led her to volunteer at a local food shelter. It was a turning point. She saw that while handing out meals provided immediate relief, it didn't address the systemic failures that created hunger in the first place. Driven by a newfound desire to fix the system itself, she pursued a Master's in Public Policy at Georgetown University, focusing on social and urban policy.\n\nUpon graduating, she turned down offers in Washington D.C., drawn instead to San Francisco. The city represented the epicenter of the issues she\u2019d studied: a place of immense wealth and innovation shadowed by a severe housing crisis and stark inequality. She accepted a role as a Policy Analyst for the \u201cBay Area Housing Justice Coalition,\u201d a non-profit dedicated to advocating for affordable housing legislation.\n\nNow, at 24, her world is largely confined to her small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her zero-mile commute means her days are a disciplined cycle of strong coffee from a cafe on Clement Street, hours deciphering housing data and drafting policy briefs, and midday walks in Golden Gate Park to escape the screen. Her social life is a work-in-progress, built around a small circle of fellow grad school transplants and a weekend hiking group she joined to force herself out of her intellectual bubble.\n\nSarah is deeply connected to San Francisco through her work, fighting for its future on spreadsheets and in Zoom meetings. Her dream is to see a policy she helped draft become law, creating tangible change for the city\u2019s most vulnerable. More personally, she hopes to one day feel as rooted in a San Francisco neighborhood as the people she advocates for, transforming her academic connection into a true sense of home."
