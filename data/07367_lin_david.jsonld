Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, he was the only son of Taiwanese immigrants who poured their life savings into a small, bustling grocery store. David grew up stocking shelves and running the cash register, learning the language of inventory and margins before he could drive. He admired his parents' relentless work ethic but knew the family business wasn't his path. He was drawn to systems and order, the quiet hum of a well-run organization.\n\nHis educational journey led him away from the Bay Area, first to UC Davis for his undergraduate studies in biology, and then to UCLA for a Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA). While he excelled in science, he had no desire to be a clinician; it was the architecture of healthcare delivery that captivated him. His turning point came during a college internship where he shadowed a hospital COO during a massive systems upgrade. Seeing the intricate ballet of logistics, finance, and human resources required to keep a hospital running smoothly solidified his career choice.\n\nDavid returned to San Francisco and began a steady climb up the administrative ladder at a prominent city hospital. His career became his life's central pillar, a demanding pursuit that ultimately contributed to an amicable divorce a decade ago. Now, at 51, his life is a case study in efficiency. He lives in a modern condominium in Cole Valley, directly across from the hospital campus. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing him to be on-site in minutes for any crisis.\n\nHis days are a marathon of meetings, budget reviews, and strategic planning. Evenings are often quiet, spent with a home-cooked meal and policy journals. His social life is small but meaningful, consisting of dinner with a few longtime colleagues and monthly visits to his aging parents, who are now retired in the Sunset. On weekends, he finds solace in long, anonymous walks through Golden Gate Park, finding a peaceful contrast to the structured chaos of his job. David\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing higher, but about mentoring the next generation of administrators and leaving behind a more efficient, patient-focused system. He sometimes imagines retiring early to pursue landscape photography, a forgotten hobby, and finally taking a long trip to Taiwan to connect with a heritage he knows mostly through his parents\u2019 stories."
