The son of Filipino immigrants\u2014a nurse and a postal worker\u2014David was born with the surname his ancestors adopted during Spanish colonial rule, a common heritage in his community. His parents instilled in him a profound work ethic and the belief that education was the ladder out of their hardworking, yet modest, existence. He absorbed their sacrifice, channeling it into academic excellence.\n\nHe stayed local for his undergraduate studies at San Francisco State University before pursuing an MBA at the University of San Francisco, a choice that felt both ambitious and practical. His career began not in a corporate high-rise, but on the sales floor of a Union Square department store. He learned retail from the ground up: the psychology of a customer, the feel of fabric, the flow of a well-designed space. This hands-on experience proved invaluable as he climbed the ladder, moving from assistant buyer to a coveted merchandising role.\n\nThe major turning point in David\u2019s career was the digital retail explosion. While others saw brick-and-mortar stores failing, David saw an opportunity to translate the art of in-person merchandising to the online world. He championed data-driven design and intuitive user experiences, earning him a promotion to Director of Merchandising for a national apparel brand. The pandemic solidified his value, and his role became permanently remote.\n\nNow at 49, David\u2019s world is his meticulously curated Hayes Valley condo. The 0.0-mile commute means his days start not with traffic, but with a walk to a local cafe for a flat white, followed by hours of video calls and digital strategy sessions from his home office overlooking a quiet courtyard. He is professionally fulfilled but privately contemplates the life he built. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, his focus has been almost entirely on work.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate; it\u2019s the city that shaped him, from his Daly City roots to his current polished life. He cherishes weekends spent exploring the Ferry Building Farmer's Market or hiking in the Presidio with a small circle of friends. His dream is no longer about climbing higher on the corporate ladder. Instead, he aspires to use his experience to mentor young, first-generation professionals and, perhaps, to finally take the extended trip to the Philippines he\u2019s always promised himself, connecting with the history embedded in his name."

His dad\u2019s hands, impossibly calloused, would meticulously organize stray letters. There was no complaint, only a quiet dignity. In that moment, David felt the weight of his father\u2019s labor not as a burden, but as a silent promise he had to keep. Education wasn't about personal wealth; it was about honoring their sacrifice. That image fueled every late night he spent studying, a constant reminder of his purpose.\n\n2.\nHe was 24, working the floor at a Union Square department store. An elegant older woman needed a scarf for her granddaughter\u2019s wedding. Instead of just selling, David listened. He found one with the exact shade of blue from her own wedding dress story. Her tearful gratitude felt more valuable than any commission. He learned then that merchandising wasn't about product, but about connecting an object to a human story\u2014a lesson he would later apply to the anonymity of online data.\n\n3.\nIn his mid-thirties, he presented his first e-commerce redesign to a room of skeptical executives. He put a website's heat map on the screen, calling it a \u201cdigital floor plan\u201d where customers were getting lost. \u201cWe're losing them at the front door,\u201d he argued. In their reluctant nods, David felt the thrill of translating his tangible retail instincts into a new language. That moment cemented his belief that the soul of a store could, and must, exist online.\n\n4.\nHe was 44. The end of the relationship wasn\u2019t a fight, but the silence after. He remembers his partner placing their key on the polished condo countertop. The click was louder than any shout. Looking around the immaculate space he'd worked so hard for, he felt a profound emptiness. He had built a successful career but had forgotten to build a shared life. That quiet failure forced a long-overdue inventory of his own soul and what truly mattered.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a company coffee chat, a young, first-generation Filipino intern asked him how he \u201cmade it.\u201d David saw the familiar mix of ambition and fear in the intern\u2019s eyes\u2014the same look he once wore. He shared a story not of triumph, but of a mistake from his early career. In the intern\u2019s visible relief, David felt a purpose deeper than any promotion. His experience wasn\u2019t just his ladder; it was meant to be a guide for those climbing behind him."
