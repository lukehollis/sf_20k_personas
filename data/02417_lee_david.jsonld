Born and raised in the fog-drenched avenues of the Sunset District, David was the quiet son of hardworking Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small grocery store. His parents hoped he\u2019d become a doctor, but David, a contemplative soul, pursued a history degree at San Francisco State University, fascinated by the grand narratives of the past.\n\nHis life\u2019s trajectory shifted sharply in his late twenties. During his mother\u2019s long, final battle with cancer, David felt profoundly helpless. While doctors came and went, it was the nurses who provided the constant, tangible comfort. He witnessed their unique blend of clinical skill and deep empathy, and found his calling. He enrolled in an accelerated nursing program, trading history books for anatomy charts, driven by a newfound purpose.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, David has lived on-site at \"The Beaumont,\" caring for a small number of elderly residents. His small apartment, a converted carriage house in the back garden, is his sanctuary. His life is a routine of quiet diligence: morning medication rounds, shared breakfasts, listening to stories of old San Francisco, and providing dignified end-of-life care. His history degree was not wasted; he has become the keeper of his patients' lived histories, a curator of memories that will soon vanish.\n\nA solitary man, his most profound relationships are with those he cares for. A past marriage dissolved under the weight of his all-consuming work. Now, his social life consists of long, solitary walks through the Presidio on his days off and weekly dim sum with his sister in Richmond. His connection to San Francisco is not in its trendy restaurants or tech scene, but in the echoes of the past he sees in the architecture and hears in the frail voices of his patients.\n\nAt 52, David doesn\u2019t dream of retirement. His aspiration is simpler: to travel to Tuscany, not for himself, but to see the cypress trees a former patient, a painter, described to him in her final days. He hopes to see the world through the eyes of those he has guided out of it, honoring their stories one quiet journey at a time."
