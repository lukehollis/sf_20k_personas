Born and raised in the fog-laced avenues of the Sunset District, he is the son of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who owned a small grocery store. His childhood was a quiet rhythm of stocking shelves, helping with homework, and the unspoken expectation that he would pursue a lucrative career in tech or finance. He was a dutiful son, but he saw the city not as a series of economic opportunities, but as a complex organism of interconnected lives.\n\nThis perspective led him not to business school, but to a Master's program in Urban Planning at UCLA. He was fascinated by how physical spaces could shape communities for better or worse. However, during an internship designing low-income housing models, he felt a profound disconnect. The blueprints and policy papers felt sterile compared to the messy, vibrant, and often painful realities of the people he was meant to serve. This was his turning point. He realized he didn't want to design the building; he wanted to support the families living inside it.\n\nReturning to the Bay Area, Daniel pivoted, earning a Master of Social Work. He intentionally sought a position where he could be deeply embedded in a community. He found it as a school social worker in the Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute is no accident; he lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment just three blocks from the middle school he serves. His days are a whirlwind of mediating conflicts, connecting families with food and housing resources, and being a stable presence for kids navigating the turbulence of adolescence and city life.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of old friends from Lowell High and fellow educators. Though single, his emotional energy is largely invested in his work. He hasn't abandoned his urban planning roots; his dream is to one day launch a non-profit that integrates community-led design projects with social support services. For now, he finds purpose walking the familiar, mural-covered streets, knowing that building a better city starts not with a blueprint, but with one supported child at a time."

His father, ever practical, began to remove a small bag of rice. Daniel watched the woman\u2019s shoulders slump. Later, as she was leaving, he quietly slipped a mandarin orange into her bag. The fleeting, grateful look in her eyes was the first time he understood that community was a currency more valuable than cash. It was a secret act of defiance that defined his path.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring his urban planning internship at UCLA, he proudly presented a 3D model for a low-income housing unit. He\u2019d maximized every square foot for efficiency. After, he overheard a community advocate whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful box, but where does a family actually live?\u201d The words struck him like a physical blow. He saw the sterile walls and perfect lines of his blueprint and realized with shame that he hadn't designed a home, but a data point. That night, he started researching social work programs.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis second year as a social worker, he met Javier, a seventh-grader who was constantly sleeping in class and getting into fights. After weeks of building trust, Daniel learned Javier's family was living in a single, unheated room. Daniel spent a month navigating city bureaucracy, finally securing them a spot in a subsidized apartment. The real victory came a week later, when he saw Javier simply reading a book in the school library, looking rested for the first time. It was a quiet moment that felt louder than any city council approval.\n\n***\n\n4.\nWalking home through Clarion Alley on a Tuesday evening, he paused. The scent of pupusas from a nearby kitchen mixed with the faint smell of spray paint. New murals bloomed over old ones, a chaotic, living conversation on the walls. He saw not blight or disorder, but the city\u2019s vibrant, resilient heartbeat. This was the San Francisco he wanted to serve\u2014not the gleaming postcard image, but the messy, beautiful, interconnected organism he had always seen, even as a child stocking shelves.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, over dim sum with his two best friends from Lowell, he confessed his non-profit idea felt impossibly huge. Before he could finish, Sarah, now an architect, grabbed a napkin and started sketching a layout for a multi-use community space. Mike, a teacher, began listing potential school partnerships. In that moment, surrounded by the clatter of plates and the comfort of lifelong friendship, his abstract dream felt solid and achievable. He realized he had already been building his foundation, person by person, all along."
