Born in Berkeley, he was raised by his Iranian father, a literature professor who recited Hafez from memory, and his American mother, an urban planning consultant who mapped cities with a pragmatist's eye. His childhood was a blend of Persian New Year celebrations and meticulous discussions about zoning laws, instilling in him a unique appreciation for how culture and civic structure shape human experience. This duality became the cornerstone of his identity.\n\nHis educational path was a search for a way to merge these influences. After completing an undergraduate degree in Sociology at UC Berkeley, a pivotal internship with a struggling community arts non-profit in Oakland opened his eyes. He saw the profound impact of art but also the frustrating bureaucratic hurdles that stifled it. Driven to work on the system itself, he pursued a Master's in Public Administration at the University of Washington, focusing on non-profit management and municipal policy.\n\nReturning to the Bay Area was a given. He felt a magnetic pull to San Francisco's complex cultural fabric and landed an entry-level position at the San Francisco Arts Commission. Over the next decade, he diligently worked his way up, proving his value through a rare combination of cultural sensitivity and administrative acumen. Now a Program Manager, he oversees grants for public art installations, a job that feels like the perfect synthesis of his parents\u2019 worlds.\n\nToday, Kian lives in a tidy one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His 2.8-mile commute to Civic Center is a short ride on the #21 Muni bus, a daily ritual he uses for reading or listening to podcasts on urban design. Evenings are often spent attending gallery openings or neighborhood meetings, and his social circle is a tight-knit group of friends from different walks of life. His great hope is to one day spearhead a city-wide initiative that uses art to bridge divides between San Francisco\u2019s disparate communities, creating a permanent legacy of unity in the city he loves."

His father recited a Hafez couplet while placing the ceremonial mirror on the Haft-sin table. Across the room, his mother had a zoning map of Oakland spread on the floor, her red pen tracing future bus lines. In that moment, Kian didn\u2019t see two separate worlds. He saw two people drawing beautiful, hopeful lines on the world. It was the first time he understood that poetry and policy could spring from the same well of love for humanity.\n\n2.\nThe Oakland arts internship, age twenty-one. He stood before a stunning, ferocious mural painted by local teens on the non-profit\u2019s wall. But above it, a brown water stain spread from a leaky roof they couldn't afford to fix. The raw power of the art versus the mundane decay of its container filled him with a hot surge of frustration. It was a clarifying anger. He realized he didn't just want to support art; he wanted to build a sturdier, more just building to house it in.\n\n3.\nThe email arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, five years into his job at the Arts Commission. The subject line was just the grant number for the sound installation under the Central Freeway. He clicked it open: \"APPROVED.\" He felt not just success, but synthesis. He pictured the ethereal music playing for thousands of commuters and residents below the concrete overpass. It was his father's poetry and his mother's infrastructure finally having a conversation, and he had been the translator. He quietly closed his laptop and just breathed.\n\n4.\nLast autumn, on his daily #21 Muni ride home, the bus crested the hill by Alamo Square. The Painted Ladies were glowing in the late afternoon sun. Through his headphones, a podcast was deconstructing the politics of public benches while outside the window, a family laughed, posing for a photo. The intellectual and the emotional, the civic and the human, all collided in that simple view from the bus window. It was a pang of deep, quiet affection for the city\u2019s complex, beautiful, and flawed machinery.\n\n5.\nAt a gallery opening in the Mission a few months ago, he watched an elderly Latina woman and a young tech worker stand before the same abstract painting. They were both visibly moved, but their circles of friends were on opposite sides of the room, an invisible wall between them. They shared a moment of profound connection to the art, but not with each other. The memory became his mission: it wasn't enough to put art in a room. He had to find a way to make them see each other, too."
