The collection she manages\u2014an eclectic mix of post-war European art and rare Napa vintages\u2014was her late mentor's, and now it is her life's work. This explains her zero-mile commute; work is simply in the next room.\n\nRaised in a quiet Philadelphia suburb, the daughter of a history professor and a librarian, Eleanor\u2019s upbringing was scholarly but financially modest. She pursued a Bachelor's in Art History, a degree she now considers a mere footnote. Her real education began when she moved to San Francisco at 23, taking an entry-level job at a prestigious Union Square gallery. It was there she met Isolde Blackwood, a formidable, sharp-tongued collector who saw in Eleanor a rare combination of raw intuition and academic rigor. Isolde hired her as a personal assistant, and over the next decade, molded her into a discerning connoisseur.\n\nThe turning point came five years ago with Isolde\u2019s sudden passing. Instead of a financial inheritance, Isolde left Eleanor something more profound: stewardship of the collection and the right to live in the apartment that houses it. Overnight, Eleanor went from apprentice to master, her life simultaneously elevated and confined within these beautifully curated walls.\n\nHer days are a disciplined ritual of research, correspondence with auction houses, and overseeing the climate-controlled wine cellar. Her social life is sparse and revolves around her profession; she entertains potential buyers and museum curators, her personal and professional selves having long since merged. A long-term relationship ended years ago, unable to compete with the ghost of her mentor and the demands of the collection.\n\nNow, at 39, Eleanor feels a quiet restlessness. She is the guardian of another's legacy. Her private dream is to one day use her expertise to build her own small legacy\u2014perhaps by establishing a grant for emerging Bay Area artists, finally stepping out from the shadow of the collection and into the light as a patron in her own right."
