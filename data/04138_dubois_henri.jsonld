The only child of French immigrants from Lyon, he grew up in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of Chicago. His parents filled their home with stories of walkable city life, instilling in Henri a fascination with how cities live and breathe. This led him to pursue a Master of Architecture with a focus on Urban Design, seeing the built environment not as static structures, but as a dynamic organism.\n\nHis early career was solid but unfulfilling, designing suburban community centers in the Midwest. The turning point came at 32, following a quiet divorce. Seeking a radical change, he moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the city\u2019s complex topography and the optimistic energy of the dot-com boom. He quickly found work with a firm consulting on the city\u2019s burgeoning development projects, his unique perspective on creating human-scaled public spaces earning him a strong reputation.\n\nNow a Senior Consulting Urban Planner, Henri works directly with city agencies from his home office. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing him to live inside the very urban fabric he studies. His Hayes Valley condo, a sanctuary of clean lines and architectural models, overlooks the bustling street life that emerged after the removal of the Central Freeway\u2014a project he still analyzes with reverence.\n\nA quiet intellectual, Henri\u2019s social life is curated. He has a small circle of colleagues and a standing reservation for one at the bar of his favorite Absinthe brasserie. His days are a disciplined routine of poring over blueprints, conducting virtual stakeholder meetings, and taking long, analytical walks through different neighborhoods, observing how people interact with the space.\n\nThough content, Henri is driven by a desire for legacy. He isn't dreaming of retirement but of one final, defining project\u2014a sustainable, mixed-use development that perfectly harmonizes the city's historic character with its desperate need for housing. For Henri, San Francisco is not just his home; it is his life's work, a beautiful, chaotic contradiction he is still hoping to solve."

The building felt sterile, disconnected\u2014a monument to the asphalt sea separating it from life. He thought of the bustling market squares his parents described from Lyon. This wasn\u2019t architecture; it was an intellectual and spiritual surrender. That profound sense of failure wasn't an ending. It was the catalyst that made him book a one-way ticket to San Francisco a month later.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, his first week in the city. Lungs burning, he\u2019d forced himself up the Filbert Street steps. Turning around, he saw the city not laid out on a grid, but clinging to the topography. Each bay window and terraced garden felt like a hard-won victory against gravity. He wasn\u2019t just looking at a skyline; he was feeling the city\u2019s physical structure, the bones beneath its skin. He knew then his move wasn\u2019t an escape, but a pilgrimage to his life\u2019s true subject.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe remembers the specific sound from his apartment window in 2003: the grinding groan of rebar and concrete as a section of the Central Freeway was torn down. For others, it was a traffic story. For Henri, it was watching a wound begin to heal. In that cloud of dust, he saw the future\u2014the park, the brasseries, the life that would fill the void. The demolition cemented his belief that cities were not static, but could be deliberately, beautifully remade.\n\n***\n\n4.\nAround 2012, sitting at his usual corner stool at the Absinthe bar, he watched the street life unfold. He wasn\u2019t interacting, merely observing the intricate dance: a courier weaving through traffic, a couple meeting under the theater marquee, the murmur from sidewalk tables. He realized he wasn\u2019t lonely; he was embedded. He felt like a quiet, necessary sensor, absorbing the data of the urban organism. In that moment of detached belonging, San Francisco finally felt less like a project and more like home.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, on an analytical walk through a neglected corner of the Mission, he stopped before a sprawling, underused MUNI bus yard. He saw past the chain-link fence and the diesel stains. In a flash of absolute clarity, he envisioned it: tiered public housing, a maker-space, a new pedestrian corridor. It wasn't just a fantasy; it was a blueprint. The sudden, intense vision gave him a renewed sense of purpose. This was his legacy project. The beautiful contradiction he could finally help solve."
