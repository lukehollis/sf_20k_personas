Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, Liam is the only son of Hong Kong immigrants who poured their life savings and boundless energy into their small business. They envisioned a different future for him\u2014one paved with a prestigious degree and a stable, white-collar profession.\n\nHe tried to follow that path, enrolling at UC Santa Cruz to study graphic design. For two years, the coastal redwood campus was his world, a place where his artistic sensibilities felt valued. However, that world fractured when his father suffered a major heart attack during his junior year. Without hesitation, Liam left school and returned to San Francisco to help his mother run the shop. What was meant to be a temporary arrangement slowly solidified into a permanent reality.\n\nThe transition was challenging. Liam wrestled with a quiet resentment, mourning the creative career he\u2019d abandoned. But over time, he discovered a new kind of fulfillment. He learned the satisfying rhythm of retail\u2014the morning inventory checks, the conversations with neighborhood regulars, the thrill of discovering a new local artist whose work he could feature. He didn\u2019t just manage the store; he reshaped it. Under his care, \"The Gilded Page\" evolved from a simple stationery shop into a curated haven of unique gifts, independent zines, and artisanal paper goods, reflecting his own refined taste.\n\nNow 33, Liam\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with his Hayes Valley neighborhood. He lives simply in the apartment above the store that was once his childhood bedroom. His social life consists of beers with other local business owners and a long-running, unspoken flirtation with the barista at his favorite coffee shop. While the dream of being a full-time designer has faded, it hasn't vanished. His new aspiration is to launch an online version of the store and start a small in-house design service for custom invitations. For Liam, San Francisco is no longer a place of lost opportunity, but a city where he is building a legacy\u2014one carefully chosen greeting card at a time."
