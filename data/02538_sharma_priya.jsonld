The only child of a literature professor and a university librarian who emigrated from Lucknow, India, she grew up in the quiet, academic town of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Her childhood was spent amongst towering library stacks and the gentle rustle of turning pages, instilling in her a deep appreciation for structure and systems.\n\nShe naturally pursued a Master's in Library and Information Science, but as the late 90s dot-com boom ignited, Priya saw its potential with visionary clarity. While her peers cataloged physical books, Priya was fascinated by the chaotic, burgeoning digital world. She realized the principles were the same; the internet was just a much larger, messier library in desperate need of a cataloger. In 1998, she packed her bags for San Francisco, trading ivy-covered walls for the frenetic energy of Silicon Valley.\n\nPriya thrived, surviving the dot-com bust and re-emerging as a sought-after Information Architect. Her career became her anchor, especially after a long-term relationship ended in her late thirties when her partner wanted to leave the city she had grown to love. The breakup was a pivotal moment, solidifying her identity as a fiercely independent San Franciscan. She poured her savings into a down payment on a sleek condo in NoPa, a neighborhood offering a perfect balance of urban energy and residential calm.\n\nNow at 49, Priya\u2019s life is a masterclass in deliberate design. Her commute is a ten-step journey from her espresso machine to her standing desk, overlooking Alamo Square. Her days are structured by focused work, mentoring junior architects, and broken up by brisk walks through the Panhandle. Evenings are for herself: a new recipe, a foreign film, or dinner with a small, tight-knit circle of friends cultivated over two decades.\n\nShe has achieved the stability her parents dreamed of for her, but her aspirations have shifted. The hunger for career advancement has been replaced by a desire for legacy. Priya dreams of taking a sabbatical to consult for a museum or a struggling public archive, applying her high-tech expertise to preserve cultural history\u2014a project that would beautifully connect the digital world she built with the analog one she came from."
