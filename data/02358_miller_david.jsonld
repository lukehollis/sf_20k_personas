Raised in a pragmatic, emotionally reserved household in Sacramento, David was the sensitive son of an engineer father and a homemaker mother. He escaped to San Francisco State University in the late 1980s, intending to pursue an English literature Ph.D., intoxicated by the city's intellectual freedom and vibrant counter-culture.\n\nThat dream dissolved in the face of the AIDS crisis. The academic felt trivial as friends and community members fell ill and died, navigating a healthcare system riddled with fear and prejudice. Volunteering at a hospice, David witnessed the profound impact of compassionate care and advocacy. This was his turning point. He abandoned his literary ambitions, driven by a raw, urgent need to help. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work to give his empathy a clinical framework.\n\nHis early career was spent in the trenches of public health, working in hospitals and clinics during the most harrowing years of the epidemic. The work was grueling, steeped in grief, but it cemented his professional identity. He learned to hold space for the suffering of others while fiercely protecting his own emotional core.\n\nNow 54, David\u2019s life is one of deliberate calm. His zero-mile commute is to his home office, a converted sunroom overlooking a small garden, where he runs a private tele-health practice. His clients, many dealing with chronic illness or grief, benefit from his decades of experience. His days follow a rhythm: a morning walk with his partner of fifteen years, Mark, through Golden Gate Park; hours of intense virtual sessions; and evenings spent cooking and decompressing.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul; it is the city that broke his heart and then taught him how to heal. His hope is no longer to change the world but to continue offering a pocket of peace to those navigating it. He dreams of mentoring a new generation of social workers, ensuring the lessons of empathy learned in a time of crisis are not forgotten."

It was 1989, and he\u2019d just spent four hours in a Haight Street caf\u00e9 debating Derrida with his new classmates. The world felt limitless, a thrilling intellectual puzzle he was destined to solve. That feeling\u2014of pure, boundless academic potential\u2014was a kind of innocence. It was the person he was before the city, and a virus, demanded he become someone else entirely. It was the dream he had to let die.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt the hospice in 1991, he sat with a man named Robert, a former dancer whose body had been ravaged. His literary theory felt like a useless trinket. David began reading a Keats poem aloud, his voice shaking. Robert, too weak to speak, simply closed his eyes and let a single tear trace a path through a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion on his temple. In that silence, David\u2019s path became clear. Compassion wasn't an abstract concept; it was a physical presence. It was the only thing that mattered.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe fluorescent lights of the SF General ward in 1996 seemed to hum with exhaustion. He was a newly minted MSW, and the sheer volume of loss was a physical weight. During a brutal shift, he simply sat beside a young man whose family refused to visit, saying nothing for an hour. This was the work now: not fixing, but witnessing. It was the moment he learned to build a wall around his own heart\u2014not to block empathy, but to create a space strong enough to hold the grief of others without shattering.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHis first walk with Mark through the AIDS Memorial Grove wasn\u2019t defined by the familiar ghosts of the past, but by the quiet comfort of the present. It was 2009. They didn\u2019t need to fill the silence with talk. For the first time, David felt a connection that wasn\u2019t forged in crisis or grief, but in a simple, shared peace. He realized his heart, broken by San Francisco\u2019s harshest years, could also be healed by its gentle moments. It was the beginning of his own sanctuary.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last week, after a difficult telehealth session with a grieving client, David closed his laptop and looked out at his garden. A hummingbird, a tiny, iridescent jewel, hovered over the fuchsias. The world\u2019s immense suffering was still there, just beyond his window, but inside this small sunroom, he could offer a moment of calm. He wasn\u2019t changing the world anymore. He was tending a garden, for himself and for others. This quiet, deliberate purpose felt more profound than any youthful ambition."
