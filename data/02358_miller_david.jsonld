Raised in a pragmatic, emotionally reserved household in Sacramento, David was the sensitive son of an engineer father and a homemaker mother. He escaped to San Francisco State University in the late 1980s, intending to pursue an English literature Ph.D., intoxicated by the city's intellectual freedom and vibrant counter-culture.\n\nThat dream dissolved in the face of the AIDS crisis. The academic felt trivial as friends and community members fell ill and died, navigating a healthcare system riddled with fear and prejudice. Volunteering at a hospice, David witnessed the profound impact of compassionate care and advocacy. This was his turning point. He abandoned his literary ambitions, driven by a raw, urgent need to help. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work to give his empathy a clinical framework.\n\nHis early career was spent in the trenches of public health, working in hospitals and clinics during the most harrowing years of the epidemic. The work was grueling, steeped in grief, but it cemented his professional identity. He learned to hold space for the suffering of others while fiercely protecting his own emotional core.\n\nNow 54, David\u2019s life is one of deliberate calm. His zero-mile commute is to his home office, a converted sunroom overlooking a small garden, where he runs a private tele-health practice. His clients, many dealing with chronic illness or grief, benefit from his decades of experience. His days follow a rhythm: a morning walk with his partner of fifteen years, Mark, through Golden Gate Park; hours of intense virtual sessions; and evenings spent cooking and decompressing.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul; it is the city that broke his heart and then taught him how to heal. His hope is no longer to change the world but to continue offering a pocket of peace to those navigating it. He dreams of mentoring a new generation of social workers, ensuring the lessons of empathy learned in a time of crisis are not forgotten."
