Born in Berkeley to a Japanese-American architect father and a mother of mixed European heritage, David\u2019s upbringing was intellectually rich but culturally ambiguous. His parents emphasized universal humanism over specific traditions, leaving him with a sense of being an observer rather than a participant in any single ethnic identity.\n\nHe bypassed a traditional college path, finding more truth in tangible creation. For over a decade, David was a masterful woodworker and furniture maker, his hands shaping raw timber into objects of quiet beauty. This life, however, felt incomplete. The turning point came when a close friend spiraled into a severe mental health crisis, navigating a system that felt broken and impersonal. Witnessing this struggle from the sidelines ignited a profound need in David to understand and to help, not with wood and tools, but with empathy and intervention.\n\nAt 32, he made a radical shift. He enrolled in community college, voraciously consuming psychology and sociology texts, before earning his bachelor\u2019s from SF State and, eventually, a Master of Social Work. His past as a craftsman informed his new profession; he saw his clients not as cases to be managed, but as complex structures to be carefully understood and supported.\n\nNow 47, David lives where he works. His spartan apartment is in the same South of Market (SOMA) building that houses the non-profit community health clinic where he is a Clinical Social Worker. This explains his zero-mile commute; his life and work are woven into the same city block. His days are a relentless cycle of telehealth sessions, street outreach, and crisis management, primarily with the unhoused population. His furniture consists of a few exquisite pieces he built years ago\u2014a stark contrast to his otherwise minimalist life. Divorced years ago, the intensity of his work having strained the relationship, he finds connection in a small, tight-knit circle of fellow social workers. His aspiration is not for wealth, but for small victories: seeing a client secure stable housing, or helping someone navigate a single, sober day. He dreams of a more compassionate city, one he works to build, one conversation at a time."
