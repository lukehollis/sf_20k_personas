Born in Berkeley to a Japanese-American architect father and a mother of mixed European heritage, David\u2019s upbringing was intellectually rich but culturally ambiguous. His parents emphasized universal humanism over specific traditions, leaving him with a sense of being an observer rather than a participant in any single ethnic identity.\n\nHe bypassed a traditional college path, finding more truth in tangible creation. For over a decade, David was a masterful woodworker and furniture maker, his hands shaping raw timber into objects of quiet beauty. This life, however, felt incomplete. The turning point came when a close friend spiraled into a severe mental health crisis, navigating a system that felt broken and impersonal. Witnessing this struggle from the sidelines ignited a profound need in David to understand and to help, not with wood and tools, but with empathy and intervention.\n\nAt 32, he made a radical shift. He enrolled in community college, voraciously consuming psychology and sociology texts, before earning his bachelor\u2019s from SF State and, eventually, a Master of Social Work. His past as a craftsman informed his new profession; he saw his clients not as cases to be managed, but as complex structures to be carefully understood and supported.\n\nNow 47, David lives where he works. His spartan apartment is in the same South of Market (SOMA) building that houses the non-profit community health clinic where he is a Clinical Social Worker. This explains his zero-mile commute; his life and work are woven into the same city block. His days are a relentless cycle of telehealth sessions, street outreach, and crisis management, primarily with the unhoused population. His furniture consists of a few exquisite pieces he built years ago\u2014a stark contrast to his otherwise minimalist life. Divorced years ago, the intensity of his work having strained the relationship, he finds connection in a small, tight-knit circle of fellow social workers. His aspiration is not for wealth, but for small victories: seeing a client secure stable housing, or helping someone navigate a single, sober day. He dreams of a more compassionate city, one he works to build, one conversation at a time."

His father spoke of sightlines and load-bearing walls, but David saw an empty frame, a beautiful, hollow shell. He felt a strange distance, the same way he felt during Obon festivals or Christmas dinners\u2014an admirer of the structure, but never truly inside. It was his first lesson in the architecture of belonging, and the feeling of being just outside the blueprint.\n\n2.\nAt 28, in his Dogpatch workshop, the air thick with the scent of cedar, he ran his hand over the impossibly smooth arm of a chair he\u2019d just finished. The grain flowed like a current under his palm. He felt a profound, solitary pride in its creation. Yet, as he stood back, the chair\u2019s beautiful emptiness echoed his own. It was a masterpiece of joinery that offered no conversation, no shared struggle. It was the moment he realized that the most beautiful objects are still silent.\n\n3.\nHe was 31, sitting on a cracked vinyl chair in a sterile waiting room at SF General. His friend, usually so vibrant, stared through him, lost in a fog of medication and bureaucracy. David\u2019s hands, so capable of shaping stubborn wood into art, felt useless. He couldn\u2019t sand away the trauma or dovetail the shattered pieces of a mind back together. That feeling of utter helplessness in the face of a cold, indifferent system was the spark. It burned away his old life, leaving a clear, urgent purpose.\n\n4.\nJust last year, on a grimy SOMA sidewalk. A client, a woman whose trust he\u2019d spent months earning, pulled a single, shiny key from her pocket. \u201cIt ain\u2019t the Fairmont,\u201d she\u2019d said, a fragile smile breaking through, \u201cbut it\u2019s a door I can lock.\u201d David felt something in his chest unlock, too. It wasn\u2019t a loud triumph, but a quiet, foundational victory against the chaos of the street. In that moment, the weight of a thousand small failures was lifted by the simple, profound dignity of a key.\n\n5.\nOne evening after a draining telehealth session, he traced the dovetail joints of the walnut bookshelf in his apartment\u2014a relic from his former life. The seamless connection of wood, a result of patience and precision, felt familiar. He saw the same principle in his work now: carefully understanding how pieces fit, supporting the whole structure, honoring the material. He wasn't two different men, but one man who had simply changed his medium from wood to human connection. The craft was the same."
