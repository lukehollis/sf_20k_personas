The son of a successful architect and a primary school teacher, his childhood was comfortable but emotionally complex. His older sister, Sarah, battled a severe eating disorder and subsequent addiction, and Michael, the observant and empathetic younger brother, became the family\u2019s silent shock absorber. He witnessed firsthand the revolving door of therapies and the immense, often thankless, work of the social workers who tried to piece his family back together. This exposure planted a seed of purpose in him.\n\nInitially, Michael rebelled against this path, pursuing a degree in Philosophy at UC Santa Cruz, searching for abstract answers to human suffering. But the theoretical felt hollow. The turning point came during his senior year when Sarah had a near-fatal relapse. Visiting her in a San Francisco General Hospital ward, Michael spoke at length with her case manager, a pragmatic and deeply compassionate woman. In that conversation, he saw his future. He enrolled in SF State\u2019s Master of Social Work program the following year.\n\nNow 40, Michael is an LCSW embedded in the city\u2019s healthcare system, working remotely from his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to a small, dedicated home office where he conducts telehealth sessions with patients navigating chronic illness, end-of-life care, and the trauma of medical emergencies. He is the calm voice on the other end of the line, connecting people to resources and helping them process life-altering diagnoses.\n\nHis life is one of deliberate balance. After intense, emotionally draining workdays, he unplugs completely. He and his partner of seven years, Alex, a graphic designer, find solace in long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park or cooking elaborate meals together. Michael\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees both its progressive ideals and its deep-seated fractures every day through his clients. His dream isn\u2019t of fame or wealth, but of sustainability\u2014to continue his vital work without succumbing to burnout, and to one day lead a small team dedicated to palliative care, offering dignity to those at their most vulnerable."
