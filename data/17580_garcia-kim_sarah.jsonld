Born Sarah Kim in a quiet Sacramento suburb to a Korean-American engineer father and a white librarian mother, she was raised at the intersection of logic and narrative. This unique blend fostered her fascination with how people organized their worlds, both digitally and emotionally. She pursued a psychology degree at UC Davis before finding her true calling in the Bay Area, earning a graduate degree in Human-Computer Interaction from UC Berkeley.\n\nThe move to the Bay was a defining turning point. The region\u2019s chaotic energy invigorated her, and she dove into the burgeoning tech scene. After a formative, scrappy period at a small startup, her talent for translating human behavior into intuitive design led her to her current role as a Lead UX Researcher at a major information services company in San Francisco. There, she advocates for the end-user, ensuring technology serves people, not the other way around.\n\nHer personal life found its anchor when she met Mateo Garcia, a landscape architect, at a mutual friend\u2019s gallery opening. His focus on tangible, natural systems provided a grounding counterpoint to her digital world. They married five years ago, combining their names to honor both their heritages and their partnership. They now live in Oakland\u2019s Grand Lake neighborhood, a conscious choice to separate home from the high-octane environment of her FiDi office.\n\nHer daily routine is intentional: an early morning run around Lake Merritt, followed by a book on the BART train into the city. Evenings are for collaborative meals with Mateo, discussing everything from user flows to drought-resistant native plants. Though she finds deep satisfaction in her career, Sarah dreams of a future beyond corporate structures. Her long-term goal is to launch a small consultancy focused on ethical design for nonprofits. She and Mateo often talk of one day buying a small parcel of land in Sonoma, a place where they can design and build a life that is, like her work, perfectly and humanely connected."

At ten years old, she sat on the floor, organizing checkout cards using a color-coded system her engineer father helped her devise. In that quiet moment, she saw it: her father\u2019s logic was the invisible structure holding her mother\u2019s boundless stories. It wasn\u2019t about organizing books; it was about organizing access to worlds. That feeling of clicking systems into place for human curiosity was the first flicker of what would become her life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nAn elderly man squinted at the prototype, his frustration a physical presence in the tiny startup office. It was 9 PM, and Sarah, then 26, felt a hot wave of failure. Then, clarity. It wasn't his fault; it was the design\u2019s. Her abstract HCI principles suddenly had a human face and a furrowed brow. In that moment of profound empathy, her career found its true north. She wouldn't just build things; she would be the unwavering advocate for the person on the other side of the screen.\n\n3.\nThey met seven years ago, standing before a chaotic painting at a SoMa gallery. She was trying to decipher its narrative, while he\u2014Mateo\u2014quietly pointed out the artist's structural use of color to create balance. \u201cEven chaos needs a system to grow,\u201d he\u2019d said. She felt a jolt of recognition, as if her digital world and his tangible one had found their common language. That conversation was the first user test of their life together, and the connection was immediate, intuitive, and perfectly designed.\n\n4.\nHer first morning run around Lake Merritt after they moved to Oakland five years ago. The cool air, the pale light hitting the distant FiDi skyline\u2014a world away. As her feet hit the path, she felt the deliberate boundary she and Mateo had created. This side of the bridge was for living; that side was for work. This simple, physical act of separation wasn\u2019t an escape but a foundation, giving her the grounding and perspective she needed to thrive in the city\u2019s demanding energy.\n\n5.\nLast autumn, on a dusty hillside in Sonoma, Mateo unrolled a simple sketch. It wasn't a blueprint, just lines on paper: a small house, a garden, a workshop, all linked by pathways. \"Here\u2019s the user flow for our life,\" he said with a smile. In that instant, her vague dream of an ethical consultancy and a different future snapped into focus. It became a shared project, a tangible goal. The memory isn't just of a place, but of the moment their separate dreams were wireframed into one beautiful plan."
