Growing up in a loving, middle-class Irish-American family, he was the responsible younger son, perpetually in the shadow of his brilliant but troubled older brother, Sean. While Liam was steady and observant, Sean was a magnetic force who began a long, losing battle with opioid addiction in his late teens. Liam\u2019s adolescence was a blur of frantic late-night calls, hushed arguments, and the helpless feeling of watching someone you love disappear.\n\nThe definitive turning point came during Liam\u2019s sophomore year at San Francisco State University. After a brief period of hope, Sean died of an overdose. The tragedy shattered his family and crystallized Liam\u2019s purpose. He channeled his grief and quiet determination into his studies, switching his major to Sociology to better understand the systemic failures that had consumed his brother. He felt a profound sense of responsibility\u2014a need to offer the support his own family couldn't provide.\n\nUpon graduating, he accepted a demanding role as a Case Manager at a supportive housing facility in the city\u2019s SoMa neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his commitment; he is a live-in staff member, occupying a small studio apartment in the same building as his clients. His life and work are completely interwoven. His mornings start not with a commute, but with checking on a resident in crisis or coordinating a client's medical appointment. His neighbors are the people he serves\u2014individuals battling addiction, mental health issues, and homelessness.\n\nHis social life is small and intense, mostly consisting of other overburdened social workers with whom he shares a gallows humor and deep-seated empathy. He finds solace in long, anonymous runs along the Embarcadero and quiet evenings with a book, the city\u2019s sirens a constant soundtrack. His dream isn\u2019t of wealth, but of small, tangible victories: seeing a client achieve six months of sobriety, helping another secure a steady job. For Liam, San Francisco isn't the city of tech glamour; it's the city of second chances, a place where he fights every day to give others the future his brother never had."
