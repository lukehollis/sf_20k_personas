Her name itself is a testament to her origin: born to a dissident Russian artist who fled to Shanghai and the fiercely pragmatic Chinese woman who gave him shelter. Mei was raised not in a nation, but in the vibrant, chaotic space between her parents' worlds. Her upbringing was a tapestry of borscht and congee, of Cyrillic poetry recited over the sizzle of a wok. When people ask her ethnicity, she says \"None,\" not out of defiance, but because no single box has ever felt like home.\n\nHer education was sensory and practical, conducted in the kitchens of her youth. She never attended university; her schooling was the precise art of folding a pelmeni, taught by her father, and the delicate balance of five-spice powder, mastered under her mother\u2019s watch. Food became her only truly native language. She arrived in San Francisco at 22, drawn not by the Golden Gate Bridge but by the fog-laced promise of anonymity and the city\u2019s reputation as a sanctuary for those forging their own identities.\n\nMei\u2019s career was a tough, unglamorous climb through the city\u2019s back-of-house hierarchies. A key turning point came after she was fired from a high-end French restaurant for \"unauthorized creativity\"\u2014infusing a classic sauce with star anise and smoked paprika. It was then she realized she couldn't cook someone else's story.\n\nNow, at 33, Mei\u2019s life is contained within a single city block in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a creaking flight of stairs from her small studio apartment to the kitchen of \"Vremya,\" the tiny, 20-seat restaurant she co-owns. The restaurant, like her, defies categorization. The menu is a reflection of her soul: fermented black bread served alongside dan dan noodles; lamb stew seasoned with both dill and Sichuan peppercorns.\n\nHer daily routine is a ritual of prep, service, and clean-up. Her social life is the found family of her regulars\u2014the elderly Cantonese couple who come for soup, the young tech workers who marvel at her creations\u2014and her small, fiercely loyal staff. Mei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a Michelin star or expansion. She aspires to perfect this small world she has built, a place where a meal is the only identity that matters. Her connection to San Francisco is tethered to this neighborhood, a quiet corner where the story of Mei Ivanov is finally, simply, her own."
