Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving, boisterous Irish-American couple, she grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of San Francisco's Sunset District. Her father, a union carpenter, and her mother, a public school teacher, instilled in her a profound sense of justice and community service. While she cherished her heritage, she often felt like a quiet observer, navigating the space between her Asian face and her Gaelic surname, a dual identity that sharpened her empathy for those who felt like outsiders.\n\nThis drive for understanding led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate studies in political science. A pivotal turning point came during a college internship at a Tenderloin non-profit, where she witnessed firsthand the bureaucratic hurdles faced by families seeking housing and aid. The experience was transformative; she saw that good intentions weren't enough. Real, systemic change was forged in the dense, often frustrating language of policy. This realization propelled her to pursue a Master's in Public Policy at Georgetown.\n\nReturning to San Francisco was a deliberate choice. She felt a deep-seated responsibility to the city that raised her. Now, as a Legislative Aide for a City Supervisor, Grace is in the thick of it. Her day begins with a brisk walk to the N Judah Muni line for the short ride downtown to City Hall. Her life is a blur of policy briefings, constituent emails, and community meetings. She lives in a small but bright apartment in Hayes Valley, its proximity to work a strategic decision. Her space is filled with books on urban planning, potted succulents, and photos of her parents.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from college and work who share her passion for civic engagement. They decompress over craft beer in the Mission or go on long runs through Golden Gate Park. Grace\u2019s dream isn\u2019t just to support legislation, but to one day write it herself. She aspires to run for the Board of Supervisors, fueled by the conviction that she can help build a more equitable San Francisco\u2014a city that truly works for everyone, from the union carpenters in the Sunset to the vulnerable families in the Tenderloin."

A man nearby commented on the novelty of a Korean girl with such a proud Irish dad. For a flash, she felt exposed. But then her father\u2019s hand, calloused from his carpenter\u2019s tools, squeezed her ankle. \u201cShe\u2019s the best Sullivan of the lot,\u201d he beamed. In that moment, surrounded by green and the city\u2019s cheers, she didn't feel like an outsider. She felt chosen, cementing an identity that was proudly, uniquely hers.\n\n2.\nDuring her college internship, a young mother in the Tenderloin broke down in front of her. She had every piece of paper for a housing voucher except one obscure, back-dated form. Grace watched, helpless, as the system\u2019s rigidness slammed a door on a desperate family. That night, her empathy curdled into a cold, clear resolve. Good intentions were a bandage. She realized then that she needed to learn how to tear down the walls themselves, one policy at a time. It's why she went to Georgetown.\n\n3.\nShe was deep in a Georgetown library, surrounded by federal policy texts, when a profound homesickness hit. On a study break, she scrolled through a friend's photos and saw it: the N Judah emerging from the tunnel into the thick Sunset fog. She could almost feel the damp air and hear the streetcar\u2019s familiar groan. In that instant, she knew her work wasn't in DC's marble halls. It was back home, on those streets, for the city that was imprinted on her soul. Her return became a mission.\n\n4.\nLast year, an elderly shop owner from the Outer Richmond called the office, tangled in permit hell. Grace recognized the weary frustration she\u2019d seen in the Tenderloin years ago. But this time, she had a desk in City Hall. She spent two weeks making calls and tracking down obscure ordinances. When she finally called him with the solution, his simple, grateful \u201cThank you, Grace,\u201d felt more validating than any academic praise. It was the first time she truly felt the tangible impact of her position.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy morning run through Golden Gate Park a few months ago, she paused near Stow Lake. The world was muted, the city\u2019s roar softened to a hum. She thought of her parents in the Sunset and a family in a Tenderloin SRO. The distance between them felt vast, but from here, they were all part of the same landscape. The thought crystallized in the quiet air: she couldn\u2019t just be an aide. She had to be a voice at the table. That was the moment her ambition became a promise."
