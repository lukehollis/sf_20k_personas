His father worked in construction, and his mother was a stay-at-home parent who instilled in him a deep appreciation for community and empathy. From a young age, Liam displayed a natural patience and warmth around children, often entertaining his younger cousins and neighbors.\n\nAfter graduating from Lowell High School, Liam enrolled in City College of San Francisco with aspirations of becoming a kindergarten teacher. He excelled in his Early Childhood Education courses, finding genuine joy in learning about child development and pedagogical approaches. Financial constraints and a sense of needing to contribute sooner, however, led him to leave college after two years and seek employment.\n\nHis first job was as an after-school program assistant in a Chinatown community center, an experience that solidified his passion for working with children from diverse backgrounds. A key turning point came when a lead teacher at the center encouraged him to apply for a full-time assistant teacher position at a small preschool in the Mission District. He landed the role, and for the past five years, he has been dedicated to nurturing young minds in a vibrant and supportive environment.\n\nLiam\u2019s closest relationships are with his family, particularly his two older sisters who remain his confidantes. He maintains a small but close circle of friends, many of whom he met through work or college. While not actively dating, he cherishes meaningful connections and hopes to one day build a family of his own.\n\nHis daily routine revolves around the rhythm of the preschool day. He wakes early, navigates the Muni bus for his 3.5-mile commute to the Mission, and spends his days guiding children through play, learning, and social interactions. Evenings are often spent preparing simple meals, reading, or occasionally meeting friends for a casual dinner in his neighborhood.\n\nLiam's connection to San Francisco is deeply woven into his identity. He appreciates the city's diverse tapestry and the unique energy of his Mission District workplace and Outer Sunset home. His hopes for the future center on professional growth, possibly returning to college to earn his degree and become a lead teacher. He dreams of opening a small, accessible preschool in a underserved community, providing a safe and stimulating environment for children to flourish. For now, his aspiration is simple: continue making a positive impact on the young lives entrusted to his care, one day at a time."

The simple act of planting a seed, seeing it sprout, and eventually harvesting a few cherry tomatoes with her taught him patience and the quiet satisfaction of nurturing growth, a feeling that echoes in his work with children.\n\n2. There was a particular afternoon at the Chinatown community center, a little girl struggling with building blocks. Instead of fixing it for her, he knelt down and patiently showed her how to balance the pieces. The slow dawning of understanding and the triumphant smile on her face was a profound moment, solidifying his calling to teach and empower.\n\n3. He'll never forget the first time a child at the Mission preschool, usually shy, ran up and hugged his leg with uninhibited joy. It was a small gesture, but in that instant, he felt a wave of belonging and affirmation, confirming that he was in the right place, making a real difference in these tiny lives.\n\n4. That night at the Mission community meeting, listening to parents voice their struggles for affordable childcare, resonated deeply. He saw his own family's past reflected in their words and felt a surge of determination to be part of a solution, the seed planted for his dream of an accessible preschool.\n\n5. He cherishes the memory of riding the Muni bus home one foggy evening from the Mission, watching the city lights blur outside. In that quiet commute, a sense of gratitude washed over him \u2013 for his family, his work, and the vibrant, flawed city he calls home. It cemented his feeling of being rooted here, contributing to its fabric."
