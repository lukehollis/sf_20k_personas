His upbringing was practical and devoid of frills, instilling in him a quiet work ethic over academic ambition. He bypassed college, diving straight into the workforce after high school. His journey was a series of lateral moves\u2014barista, bookstore clerk, and finally, a mailroom position at a burgeoning dot-com startup in 1999.\n\nHe never wrote a line of code, but he learned the ecosystem. David was reliable, organized, and had a knack for remembering people\u2019s names and their coffee orders. As the company grew, so did his role. He became the go-to person for everything from onboarding new hires to fixing the perpetually jammed printer. Over two decades and three different tech companies, he solidified his identity as the indispensable Office Manager, the calm center of the workplace storm.\n\nThe key turning point was the pandemic. His company, a mid-size data analytics firm, went fully remote and never looked back. Suddenly, David\u2019s job became entirely virtual, managing logistics, shipping equipment, and maintaining morale through a screen from his apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute was a revelation. It untethered him from an office but anchored him more deeply in his own neighborhood.\n\nNow 46 and divorced for nearly a decade, David\u2019s life is defined by a comfortable routine. His days begin and end with walks in Golden Gate Park with his scruffy rescue mutt, Buster. He\u2019s a familiar face at the local bakery and knows the mail carrier by name. His social circle is small but enduring, consisting of a few friends from his early startup days. He feels more connected to San Francisco now than ever before; his city isn't the glittering skyline of downtown but the foggy avenues and the quiet hum of his neighborhood. His dream isn't to climb a corporate ladder but to perfect his sourdough starter, a tangible craft in a life that has become increasingly digital. He aspires to a future of quiet contentment, a man who has found his permanent place in a city of perpetual motion."
