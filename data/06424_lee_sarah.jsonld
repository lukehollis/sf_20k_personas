The only child of Korean immigrants, her upbringing was a masterclass in work ethic. Their dream for her was a stable, prestigious career\u2014doctor or lawyer\u2014a world away from their own grueling small-business life.\n\nInitially, Sarah tried to follow their path. On a pre-med track at UCLA, however, she found herself more fascinated by the flow of information in the campus hospital\u2019s database than by human anatomy. This realization was a quiet but pivotal rebellion. She pivoted, earning a Master\u2019s in Information Management & Systems from UC Berkeley, a degree that perfectly bridged technology with human systems. Her career as a management consultant took off immediately. For over a decade, she was a road warrior, solving complex tech integration problems for Fortune 500 companies, thriving on the pressure and intellectual challenge.\n\nA brutal burnout at 35 served as a harsh turning point. Exhausted and disconnected, she took a three-month sabbatical, the first real pause of her adult life. When the pandemic normalized remote work, she embraced it permanently. Now 42, her 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice. Her renovated condo in Hayes Valley is her sanctuary and office, a minimalist space overlooking a quiet street.\n\nHer days are structured: a morning walk to a local caf\u00e9 for an oat latte, followed by intense hours of video calls and strategy decks. Evenings are for unwinding, either with a yoga class or by losing herself in the aisles of a neighborhood bookstore. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of friends from her grad school days who understand the unique pressures of her world.\n\nThough financially secure and professionally respected, Sarah feels a growing desire for purpose beyond corporate efficiency. She dreams of leveraging her skills for a cause she truly believes in, perhaps advising a local arts non-profit on their digital strategy or mentoring young female founders. She loves San Francisco not just for its innovation, but for its spirit of reinvention\u2014a spirit she hopes to soon embody herself."
