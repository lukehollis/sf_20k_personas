Born in the Excelsior District to a Filipina mother who worked as a home health aide and a father of Black and Native Hawaiian descent who drove a city bus, Leilani\u2019s world was a vibrant mix of cultures, languages, and financial realities. The arts weren\u2019t a luxury; they were the glue of her community\u2014murals on storefronts, garage bands, and the low-rider shows at Balboa Park. School was a place for social connection, but her real education happened on the streets and in the community centers of her neighborhood.\n\nForegoing college for immediate employment, Leilani started as a clerk at City Hall at 19. A temporary assignment landed her in the San Francisco Arts Commission, where she found her calling. Surrounded by proposals and grant applications, she recognized the names of community artists and organizations she\u2019d grown up with. The first dot-com boom was cresting, and she watched with growing alarm as the cultural fabric of her city was threatened by displacement. This wasn't an abstract policy issue; it was personal. She threw herself into her work, her encyclopedic knowledge of the city\u2019s neighborhoods and grassroots movements making her indispensable. Over two decades, through sheer institutional knowledge and fierce dedication, she rose to Program Coordinator, earning the respect that others sought through degrees.\n\nNow 42, Leilani lives in a cherished rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. Her 3.8-mile MUNI commute is a daily ritual, a time to observe the city she fights for. Her life is deeply intertwined with her work; evenings are often spent at gallery openings for emerging artists she helped fund or attending community board meetings. Her friendships are few but deep, forged with fellow activists, artists, and city lifers who share her protective love for San Francisco's soul.\n\nLeilani\u2019s dream isn't for wealth or recognition but for permanence. She aspires to build a grant program so robust it can act as a permanent bulwark against displacement, ensuring that the next generation of kids from the Excelsior and Mission have a place to create. Privately, she hopes to one day dust off the old 35mm camera her father gave her and document the faces and places that make up her San Francisco, a quiet anchor in a city of relentless change."

Above the rumble of engines and the scent of exhaust, she saw it: a mural of an Aztec warrior airbrushed across a Chevy Impala\u2019s hood, gleaming under the lights. \u201cThat\u2019s our art, mija,\u201d her dad said, his voice a low thrum against her legs. It wasn\u2019t in a museum; it was powerful, on the street, for everyone. In that moment, she learned that culture wasn\u2019t a quiet thing; it was a defiant, beautiful noise.\n\n2.\nAt 21, sorting through a dusty pile of grant proposals in a drab City Hall office, her breath caught. She saw the names: Precita Eyes, the community center on Mission Street, the garage band from her old block. These weren\u2019t just applications; they were lifelines. In that fluorescent-lit room, the abstract threat of the first dot-com boom became intensely personal. It was the moment her job stopped being a paycheck and became a calling\u2014a fierce, protective instinct to keep the ink on those pages from ever running dry.\n\n3.\nThe day Garcia\u2019s Panaderia on 24th Street closed, the air on the block felt thinner. She\u2019d gone there for pan de dulce since she was a little girl. Now, a sterile eviction notice was taped to the glass where the \u201cOpen\u201d sign used to hang. It wasn\u2019t a policy debate; it was a physical ache, a specific scent and warmth erased from the city map forever. The grief quickly hardened into a cold resolve: this fight wasn\u2019t about saving an idea of San Francisco, but about saving its actual heartbeats.\n\n4.\nShe remembers standing on a corner in the Bayview, watching a group of teenagers put the finishing touches on a mural she\u2019d championed. For months, she'd fought for their small grant, making her case in sterile boardrooms to people who\u2019d never set foot there. Seeing the vibrant paint transform a bleak wall, watching the kids laugh and high-five, she felt a profound rightness. It wasn\u2019t just a win; it was proof that her fight could build something tangible, a bright shout of color that pushed back against the encroaching gray.\n\n5.\nOn her 18th birthday, her father handed her his old Pentax K1000, its metal body cool and heavy. \u201cYou see things people miss,\u201d he\u2019d said, showing her how to load the film. He drove the city\u2019s arteries every day, and he taught her to see the stories in its veins\u2014the faces on the 14 Mission, the light on a Victorian facade. The camera wasn\u2019t just a gift; it was a responsibility. It was a promise to him, and to herself, to never stop looking closely, to document the soul he showed her."
