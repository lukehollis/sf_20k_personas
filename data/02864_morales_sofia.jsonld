Raised by a librarian mother and a contractor father, second-generation Mexican-Americans, Sofia grew up in a vibrant Boyle Heights community. The pivotal moment of her youth came not as a celebration, but as a loss: watching her grandparents\u2019 long-time home be bought out for a new mixed-use development. She saw how a planner's pen stroke could erase a family's history, and a fire was lit within her.\n\nThis experience drove her to study Sociology at UCLA, seeking to understand the social fabrics that developments tore apart. But understanding wasn't enough; she wanted the tools to build, not just analyze. This led her to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning, where she specialized in equitable development and community engagement. Upon graduating, she accepted a position with the San Francisco Planning Department, seeing the city as the ultimate urban laboratory\u2014a place of immense wealth and deep-seated inequity.\n\nNow 37 and a Senior Urban Planner, Sofia lives a life of professional irony. Her \"commute\" is a ten-foot walk from her bed to her standing desk in her sleek, modern condo in the Mission District. From her window, she can see the vibrant murals and taquerias of her culture juxtaposed with artisan ice cream shops and tech-shuttle stops. She grapples with this paradox daily, drafting policies to protect legacy businesses while living in a building that represents the neighborhood's changing demographics.\n\nHer days are a blur of Zoom meetings with city supervisors, poring over zoning codes, and analyzing environmental impact reports. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow policy wonks and creatives, with whom she enjoys weekend hikes in Marin or exploring new restaurants in the Richmond District. Though professionally successful, her deep aspiration remains unchanged since her teens: to help build a city where a family isn't a casualty of progress. Sofia dreams of a San Francisco that retains its soul, one project, one policy, one protected community at a time."
