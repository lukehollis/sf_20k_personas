A fair-skinned man with sandy brown hair, he was adopted as an infant by a loving Chinese-American family in the Sunset District. His childhood was a vibrant, and at times confusing, tapestry of cultures. He spent weekends at boisterous dim sum lunches with his grandparents and celebrated Lunar New Year with red envelopes, yet he was always conscious of being the only white face in his family photos. This unique position, both an insider and an outsider, made him a keen observer of identity and belonging from a young age.\n\nThis fascination naturally led him to a journalism degree at San Francisco State University. He saw storytelling as a way to explore and connect the disparate communities he saw around him. After graduating, he started as a general assignment reporter for a local digital publication but found his true calling covering the city\u2019s thriving arts scene. He had a natural talent for finding the human element in a gallery opening or the political undertone in a new play. Now, as the Arts and Culture Editor, he shapes his publication's coverage of the city's creative soul.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with the passing of his adoptive father. The loss solidified his profound connection to the Wong family legacy and the city that had shaped them. He moved from a shared apartment in the Mission to a small, rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Richmond District, wanting to be closer to the neighborhood's familiar rhythms and his aging mother.\n\nHis daily routine is quintessentially San Franciscan. He catches the 38 Geary bus for his 4.5-mile commute downtown, using the time to read submissions or a new collection of poetry. His work life is a flurry of editing, meeting with freelance writers, and attending evening events. His social circle is a small but tight-knit group of fellow journalists and artists. Though his $98,000 income requires careful budgeting, he prioritizes live performances and supporting local artists over lavish expenses.\n\nCaleb\u2019s ultimate dream is to write a book\u2014a series of profiles on San Franciscans whose identities defy simple categorization, much like his own. He feels most at home not in one specific community, but in the complex, layered identity of the city itself."

At his Gung Gung\u2019s house for Lunar New Year, the air was thick with the scent of turnip cakes and incense. As his grandmother pressed a red envelope into his hand, he felt the familiar, gentle gazes of his great-aunts. In that moment, he felt a confusing mix of pure love and a sharp, quiet sense of being different. This feeling, of being both cherished and separate, became the lens through which he would eventually see the world.\n\n2.\nDuring his sophomore year at SF State, a journalism assignment led him to Clarion Alley for the first time. He stood, mesmerized, before a mural depicting generations of a Filipino family. He couldn't read the Tagalog script, but he understood the story of struggle and resilience in the painted faces. A jolt of recognition ran through him; here was a language that could articulate the complex, overlapping identities he felt inside. It was then he knew he didn't just want to report facts, he wanted to tell stories.\n\n3.\nFive years ago, a week after his father\u2019s funeral, he sat with his mom on the living room sofa in the Sunset. She quietly turned the pages of an old photo album. He saw himself, a white-blond toddler, held in his father\u2019s arms. The grief was a physical weight, but looking at his dad\u2019s beaming face, a new feeling bloomed: not of being an outsider, but of being unequivocally his father\u2019s son. The \"Wong\" in his name finally settled into its proper place, a legacy he was proud to carry.\n\n4.\nHis first big break, at 26, was a profile on a reclusive, elderly calligrapher in a tiny North Beach studio. Caleb spent hours just watching him grind the ink, listening to stories of the Cultural Revolution between silent, deliberate brushstrokes. He wrote about the art as a form of survival. The story earned a local award nomination, but more importantly, it was the first time his work felt truly essential. It validated his instinct to find the human heart beating beneath the surface of the city's art.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, he was riding the 38 Geary home. The fog was swallowing the Richmond District, blurring the streetlights into soft halos. He was reading a galley of poems by a local writer, the gentle lurch of the bus a familiar rhythm. Surrounded by the tired, diverse faces of his fellow commuters, a profound sense of peace washed over him. He wasn't just in San Francisco; he was a part of its complicated, beautiful, and ever-changing story. He felt, finally, completely at home."
