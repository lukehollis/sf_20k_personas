Raised in a quiet Cincinnati suburb, David was the son of a pragmatic civil engineer who revered bridges and dams. While his father taught him the beauty of structural integrity, David was drawn to the soul within the structure. A high school trip to Chicago, where he stood mesmerized by the works of Wright and Mies van der Rohe, solidified his path: he wouldn't just build things; he would create spaces that made people feel something.\n\nHis educational journey took him from a solid Midwestern university to the prestigious halls of Harvard's Graduate School of Design for his Master of Architecture. After cutting his teeth in the competitive New York scene, he was lured west in the late 1990s by San Francisco\u2019s intoxicating blend of technological optimism and bohemian spirit. Initially, he worked for a large corporate firm, designing sleek but soulless office towers. The turning point came when he took on a pro-bono project to redesign a small community arts center in the Mission. The challenge of creating an inspiring space on a shoestring budget rekindled his original passion, leading him to quit his job and found a boutique firm dedicated exclusively to cultural projects: museums, galleries, theaters, and artists' studios.\n\nNow at 50, David is a respected figure in the city\u2019s art and design community. His personal life is intertwined with his work; a past amicable divorce left him with a deep friendship with his ex-wife and a singular focus on his craft. His loft, a sanctuary of concrete, steel, and light, serves as both his home and his firm's headquarters. Mornings begin before dawn with black coffee and charcoal sketches, followed by client meetings and site visits. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or fundraising dinners for the very institutions he helps build. While he has achieved professional success, his ultimate aspiration remains: to design a truly iconic public landmark for San Francisco, a legacy of form and function that will inspire future generations just as he was once inspired on a Chicago sidewalk."
