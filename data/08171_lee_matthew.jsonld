The son of first-generation immigrants who ran a beloved bakery in the Sunset District, Matthew grew up enveloped in the scent of warm bread and the gentle murmur of Cantonese. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable, prestigious career. Matthew, however, was a romantic, drawn to the grand narratives of the past. He enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, earning a Bachelor's in History, dreaming of academia and dusty archives.\n\nReality hit hard after graduation. The path to becoming a history professor was long and uncertain, and the pressure to find a foothold in an expensive city was immediate. On a whim, he took a temp job doing entry-level tech support for a downtown startup. To his surprise, he was good at it. The same analytical skills he used to deconstruct historical events were perfect for troubleshooting software glitches. He was patient and a clear communicator, skills honed by explaining complex historical concepts.\n\nThe turning point was his promotion to IT Support Manager three years ago. The role validated a career path he\u2019d stumbled into, providing the financial stability his parents had always wished for him. Now, at 33, his 0.0-mile commute means his day is a quiet rhythm of Slack notifications, video calls, and the hum of his server rack. He breaks the monotony with walks to a local coffee shop on Clement Street or a lunchtime run through Golden Gate Park, his sanctuary from the digital world.\n\nSocially, Matthew relies on a tight-knit group of friends for a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game, a ritual that satisfies his love for storytelling and collaborative world-building. His dating life is a series of well-intentioned but underwhelming app-fueled coffees. His deepest aspiration remains tied to his first love: he quietly dreams of writing a niche non-fiction book on the social history of early internet forums. Matthew Lee lives a life of quiet contradiction\u2014a historian managing the immediate present, a homebody in a city of endless destinations, searching for a way to connect his past self with the man he has become."
