Born in a small province of the Philippines, he arrived in Daly City with his family at age eight, the fog a constant, damp welcome. His parents, a nurse\u2019s aide and a bus driver, preached the gospel of hard work and practicality. David absorbed these lessons, but a creative spark flickered within him. He loved to draw and take things apart just to see how they fit together.\n\nHe enrolled at City College of San Francisco with a vague notion of studying industrial design, but family duty called louder than academic ambition. When his father fell ill, David left his studies to take a full-time job as a maintenance assistant at a downtown hotel, ensuring his family had one less thing to worry about. He discovered an innate talent for understanding how things worked\u2014the temperamental boilers, the labyrinthine electrical systems, the secrets of old plumbing. He never went back to school.\n\nThe key turning point was the sudden death of his wife of fifteen years, Elena, from an aggressive cancer. The grief hollowed him out. Shortly after, the offer of a live-in Facilities Manager position in a grand, aging Nob Hill apartment building felt like a quiet refuge. The 0.0-mile commute was a deciding factor; he could retreat into his work, his world shrinking to the elegant, demanding confines of the building he now called home.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is a predictable rhythm of responding to tenant calls, coordinating contractors, and performing preventative maintenance. He knows the building\u2019s groans and sighs better than he knows most people. His social life is limited to polite nods in the lobby and a weekly call with his sister in Sacramento. In his small basement apartment, surrounded by schematics and spare parts, David nurtures a quiet dream. He saves diligently, hoping to one day buy a small house with a yard in a quieter part of the Bay Area. He imagines a workshop where he can restore old furniture\u2014a callback to the designer he almost was\u2014and a garden where, for once, he can cultivate something that doesn't need fixing."
