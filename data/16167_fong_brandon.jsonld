Raised in the foggy, quiet avenues of Daly City, he was the son of Hong Kong immigrants who equated success with stability. His father, a meticulous auto mechanic, turned the family garage into Brandon\u2019s first laboratory, where he learned the simple magic of taking things apart and putting them back together. His parents championed a practical path, envisioning a secure future for him built on diligence and education, a world away from the uncertainties they had left behind.\n\nHe honored their wishes, excelling in math and science and earning a spot in UC Davis\u2019s mechanical engineering program. College was an awakening, but the true turning point came during a summer internship. Tasked with refining the joint mechanism for a lower-cost prosthetic hand, Brandon saw his theoretical knowledge translate into a tangible improvement in someone\u2019s quality of life. The work wasn't just about tolerances and materials; it was about human dignity. This discovery spurred him to pursue a Master\u2019s at UC Berkeley, focusing on product design.\n\nNow, at 25, Brandon works as a Product Design Engineer for a manufacturing firm in the Dogpatch. His daily routine is a study in precision. He wakes in his small but tidy apartment in the Mission, takes the T Third Street light rail to work, and spends his days immersed in CAD models, 3D-printed prototypes, and collaborative design sprints. His $115,000 salary affords him a comfortable life, though homeownership feels like a distant fantasy.\n\nHis life is anchored by his long-term girlfriend, Clara, a UX designer he met at Berkeley, and a close-knit group of college friends. Weekends are for hiking Mount Tam, searching for the perfect soup dumplings in the Richmond District, and obligatory family dinners in Daly City. He loves the Mission's vibrant, organized chaos, a stark contrast to his methodical work. The neighborhood\u2019s energy fuels his creativity.\n\nBrandon\u2019s dream is not to climb a corporate ladder, but to lead a team designing sustainable consumer goods or accessible medical devices. He is pragmatic yet idealistic, a builder at heart, determined to use his skills to engineer a better, more thoughtful world, one perfectly designed product at a time."

He was ten, and his father\u2019s calloused hands were guiding his own as they reassembled a carburetor. There was no grand speech, only the quiet language of tools clicking into place. In that shared, focused silence, Brandon didn\u2019t just feel love; he felt the deep, grounding satisfaction of making something broken work again. It was the moment he learned that precision was a form of care.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the plastic prosthetic joint, still warm from the 3D printer during his UC Davis internship. After weeks of tedious calculations, he snapped it into the model hand. It articulated with a smooth, quiet click\u2014a sound that changed his life. Holding it, he felt a powerful jolt, a current of pure purpose. This wasn't just an elegant solution to a mechanical problem; it was a tangible piece of dignity he could give to someone. Engineering suddenly had a soul, and he had found his calling.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a late night in Berkeley\u2019s design studio, staring at a failing CAD model. Clara, who he barely knew then, came over. She didn\u2019t offer a solution but asked a single, insightful question about the user\u2019s experience that unlocked the entire design. Illuminated by the monitor's glow, he saw more than a classmate; he saw a partner whose mind worked in sync with his own. That moment of shared understanding was more intimate than any first date, the beginning of their shared blueprint.\n\n4.\nHe remembers walking home from the T Third light rail last week. The day had been sterile, full of right angles and decimal points. But as he stepped into the Mission, he was hit by a wave of vibrant life: cumbia blasting from a grocery, the smell of grilling onions, the bright chaos of murals crowding every wall. The stark contrast didn't feel jarring; it felt like balance. This neighborhood, with its messy, brilliant humanity, was the reason his clean, methodical work mattered so much.\n\n5.\nHe remembers last month's family dinner, pulling a prototype for a new medical device from his backpack. His father, a man of engines and steel, took the intricate plastic piece. He turned it over and over, his mechanic\u2019s eye silently judging the tolerances and the finish. Then he looked at Brandon and gave a single, slow nod of approval. It was a quiet, profound validation, an unspoken understanding that the son's world of design wasn't so different from the father's world of repair."
