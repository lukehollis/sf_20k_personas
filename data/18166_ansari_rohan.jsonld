The first is the city of his childhood: the foggy, quiet streets of the Inner Richmond, where his immigrant parents from Hyderabad ran a small, beloved corner grocery for over twenty years. He grew up stocking shelves and doing homework behind the counter, absorbing their lessons of relentless work ethic and the constant, low-grade anxiety of making ends meet. Witnessing their struggle cemented his resolve to find a more stable path, one paved with numbers and certainty.\n\nHe excelled in school, his mind a natural fit for the logic of economics. A degree from UC Berkeley led him directly into the gleaming towers of the Financial District, a world away from his parents' humble shop. As a Real Estate Investment Analyst, he became fluent in the language of capital growth, risk mitigation, and market trends, translating the city's physical spaces into spreadsheets and profit projections. For years, he felt a quiet pride in his success, sending money home and enjoying a life of financial security his parents never knew.\n\nThe turning point came two years ago when the building housing his parents\u2019 grocery was sold to a private equity firm. They were forced out, their lease terminated in favor of a new, high-end tenant. While his company wasn't involved, Rohan understood the transaction perfectly; he\u2019d modeled similar deals himself. The impersonal forces he analyzed daily had suddenly dismantled his family\u2019s legacy, leaving him with a profound sense of complicity.\n\nToday, Rohan still takes the 5-Fulton Muni bus from his rent-controlled apartment in Hayes Valley to his downtown office. The 3.5-mile journey feels like a crossing between his past and present. He spends his evenings with his girlfriend, a public school teacher, or with friends who work in tech and finance. Yet, a restlessness has taken root. His ambition is no longer just about personal wealth. He dreams of leveraging his expertise for good, hoping to one day move into affordable housing development or impact investing\u2014a way to build a future for San Francisco that honors the city that raised him, not just the one that pays his salary."

His mother is at the register, her fingers, stiff from stocking shelves, fumbling slightly as she counts out change for a neighbor. Rohan watches her quiet, tired smile and feels a knot of anxiety in his chest that mirrors her own. He finishes his math homework on a brown paper bag, vowing he will one day work with numbers that are clean, abstract, and never have to be counted by his mother\u2019s tired hands.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-six, sitting in his glass-walled office overlooking the Bay Bridge, he saw the six-figure bonus hit his account. The number felt unreal, intangible. His first thought wasn't of a new watch or a vacation, but of the wire transfer he could finally send his parents. It was a feeling of pure, unburdened relief, the sound of a generational weight lifting. For a few years, he truly believed he had outsmarted the struggle, that his success had built a permanent wall between his family and the precarity of his youth.\n\n3.\nHe was reviewing a deck on \"asset repositioning\" when his father called. Through the phone, Rohan heard the same sterile jargon he used daily, now applied to their life\u2019s work. \"They're terminating the lease... new high-end tenant.\" A wave of nausea hit him. The abstract forces he modeled on spreadsheets\u2014the invisible hand he worshiped\u2014had reached back through time and strangled the heart of his childhood. In that moment, the pride he felt in his career curdled into a profound and sickening sense of complicity. That was two years ago.\n\n4.\nLast week, on the 5-Fulton, the bus passed a boarded-up taqueria near Alamo Square. A year ago, he would have barely noticed. Now, he couldn't help but see the ghost of a spreadsheet behind the plywood. He could mentally calculate the buyout cost, the projected rent increase, the cap rate that made it all inevitable. His financial fluency no longer felt like a superpower; it felt like a curse, a lens that revealed the cold, calculated heartbreak embedded in the very streets he called home.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, walking with his girlfriend through the Mission, she pointed to a dilapidated building and sighed about a student whose family had just been displaced. Rohan stopped. Instead of just feeling a pang of sympathy, his analyst brain kicked in unbidden. He saw the zoning, the lot lines, the potential for a mixed-income project. For the first time, his skills didn't feel like a weapon. They felt like a key, and a flicker of a new, more meaningful ambition started to burn within him."
