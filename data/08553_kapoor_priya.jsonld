Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants who sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, her path was meant to be one of engineering or medicine. Her parents, a software engineer and a lab technician, saw the Bay Area as a ladder, and a lucrative career was the only acceptable rung to grasp. Priya, however, was drawn to the stories of people, not code.\n\nWhile studying at UC Berkeley, initially on a pre-law track, a volunteer position at a legal aid clinic for domestic violence survivors in Oakland irrevocently altered her course. The raw, urgent need she witnessed eclipsed any ambition for corporate law. Against her family\u2019s wishes, she pivoted, pursuing a Master's in Public Policy from Mills College, determined to build systems that protect the vulnerable.\n\nHer career began in the trenches: case management, grant writing, and community outreach. The work was grueling, the pay modest, but the purpose was clarifying. A difficult divorce in her mid-thirties became a painful but pivotal turning point. With her personal life stripped back to its studs, she poured her formidable energy into her work, climbing the ranks with a quiet, fierce competence.\n\nToday, at 49, Priya is the Program Director for a non-profit supporting underserved youth. Her commute is a walk from her bedroom to the small desk in the corner of her Mission District apartment. Her world is a five-block radius: the corner coffee shop where the baristas know her order, the vibrant murals of Clarion Alley she walks past to clear her head, and the calming expanse of Dolores Park on sunny afternoons. Her social life is a close-knit chosen family of artists, activists, and fellow non-profit veterans, their potlucks a welcome refuge from the city's frantic tech-driven pace.\n\nPriya no longer seeks her parents\u2019 approval, but has earned their quiet respect. Her dream isn\u2019t wealth, but sustainability\u2014for her organization and for the communities it serves. She aspires to secure a multi-year endowment that will ensure their work outlives her own career, a quiet, lasting legacy built not of stocks and code, but of tangible human impact."
