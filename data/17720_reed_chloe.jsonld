Raised in a quiet Portland suburb by a high school history teacher and a ceramicist, her childhood was filled with dusty library books and the earthy smell of wet clay. She inherited her father's reverence for the past and her mother's appreciation for meticulous craft. This foundation led her to a history degree, but a university library internship revealed her true calling: saving the stories that were being born and lost entirely in the digital realm. The ephemeral nature of early websites and digital media struck her as a cultural crisis, prompting her to pursue a graduate degree in Library and Information Science.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco for its promise of innovation and landed an entry-level position at a university archive. Over the next decade, Chloe methodically built her career, eventually becoming the Lead Digital Archivist for a major cultural institution, tasked with preserving the Bay Area's digital footprint. Her work is a quiet battle against bit rot and obsolete file formats, a mission she finds deeply fulfilling.\n\nA key turning point was the end of a five-year relationship with a tech startup founder. His world was about relentless disruption and \"moving fast and breaking things,\" a philosophy fundamentally at odds with her meticulous work of preservation. The breakup, though painful, solidified her identity and commitment to her own values.\n\nNow, at 38, Chloe\u2019s life has a comfortable rhythm. She lives in a simple one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, filled with books, plants, and a few of her mother\u2019s ceramic pieces. Her 3.1-mile bicycle commute, often looping through Golden Gate Park, is a meditative start and end to her day. Evenings are for a weekly pottery class, arthouse films at the Balboa Theatre, or quiet dinners with a small, close-knit circle of friends\u2014a graphic designer, a landscape architect, and a public-school teacher.\n\nChloe loves San Francisco not for its frantic hustle, but for its layers. She sees the digital history she archives reflected in the city\u2019s Victorian architecture sitting alongside glass towers. Her aspiration is to launch a major initiative to preserve the Bay Area's earliest online communities. Personally, she hopes to find a partner who shares her appreciation for the slow, meaningful work of building a life, and perhaps one day, buy a small condo in the neighborhood she has come to call home."
