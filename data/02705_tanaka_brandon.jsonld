Born and raised in Japantown, Brandon\u2019s childhood was a blend of the savory smell of his mother\u2019s cooking and the faint, clean scent of cedar and high-grade steel from his parents\u2019 kitchenware store downstairs. He was a third-generation San Franciscan, a *Sansei* whose world was the bustling, tight-knit community, but all he dreamed of was escape.\n\nHe saw the store as a beautiful cage. While his parents, hardworking *Nisei*, found fulfillment in curating the finest Japanese imports, Brandon sought a different kind of curation. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s in Art History, with ambitions of working at the de Young Museum. He wanted a life of quiet galleries and academic reverence, far from the daily grind of retail inventory and customer service.\n\nThe turning point came at 28. His father suffered a major stroke, leaving his mother struggling to manage the business alone. Brandon reluctantly stepped in, promising himself it was temporary. But \u201ctemporary\u201d stretched into months, then years. He discovered, to his surprise, that he was good at it. His art history degree gave him an impeccable eye for design and merchandising. He could speak about the minimalist elegance of a Kinto carafe with the same passion he once reserved for a Rothko painting.\n\nNow 41 and single, Brandon\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. His mornings start with coffee from the cafe next door before he opens the shop. Lunch is often ramen at a counter where he knows the owner by name. His social life consists of drinks with other local merchants and quiet evenings in his apartment, the city lights of the Fillmore District twinkling beyond his window. He has accepted his path, but his dream has evolved. He no longer wishes to escape, but to innovate. He hopes to introduce a line of modern goods from young Japanese-American designers, blending his parents\u2019 tradition with his own contemporary vision, ensuring Tanaka Home thrives for another generation."
