Born to nomadic parents who were more like weather systems than anchors, her childhood was a blur of coastal towns from Oregon to Baja California. Her mixed heritage was a kaleidoscope of features that left people guessing, so Simone stopped trying to define it, simply seeing herself as a product of the Pacific coast. Formal education was a casualty of their lifestyle; her classroom was the back of a van, her lessons taught by observing the patrons of roadside diners and the complex social ecosystems of beachside-towns.\n\nAt seventeen, craving stability, she landed in San Francisco and never left. She found work as a dishwasher at \"Verve,\" a bustling, farm-to-table bistro in the Mission District. It was there she found her calling. The restaurant's owner, a sharp-eyed woman named Lena, saw past Simone\u2019s quiet demeanor and recognized a rare, innate ability to organize chaos. Simone absorbed everything\u2014the rhythm of the kitchen, the language of wine pairings, the art of de-escalating a customer complaint. Verve became her university, and its staff her surrogate family. She moved from dishwasher to busser, server to bartender, and finally, to restaurant manager.\n\nA key turning point was her promotion to manager at 28. It cemented her identity but also cost her a long-term relationship; her partner couldn't compete with the 80-hour workweeks and the emotional energy she poured into her job. Now 32, Simone\u2019s life is a highly controlled loop. She lives in the small apartment directly above Verve, her commute a single flight of stairs. Her days are a whirlwind of inventory checks, staff scheduling, and gracefully navigating the nightly dinner rush. Her social life is intertwined with her work\u2014sharing late-night drinks with her chefs or catching up with regulars who have watched her grow up.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is rooted in the Mission. She loves the neighborhood's vibrant, unpretentious energy, which mirrors her own path. Simone dreams of one day owning her own small restaurant\u2014not a trendy hotspot, but a neighborhood institution like Verve, a place that feels like home. For a woman who grew up without roots, she has painstakingly built her own anchor in the heart of the city."
