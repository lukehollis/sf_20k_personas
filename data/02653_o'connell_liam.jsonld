            "value": "Liam O\u2019Connell was born worlds away from the curated calm of his Hayes Valley gallery, in the bustling, blue-collar heart of Chicago's South Side. The son of a union carpenter and a parish bookkeeper, Liam\u2019s upbringing was steeped in practicality, hard work, and the steadfast traditions of his Irish-American family. Art was a framed print of the Sacred Heart, not a challenging abstract canvas. He was a quiet, observant boy who felt more at home in the public library, poring over art history books, than he did at family gatherings.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma. Rejecting the expected path of a trade or a local college, Liam took his modest savings and embarked on a backpacking trip through Europe. This was his true university. In the small, avant-garde galleries of Berlin and the dusty artist studios of Montmartre, he found his calling. He learned not from professors, but from the art itself and the passionate, often penniless, artists who created it. This journey was a profound turning point, severing his ties to the life his family envisioned for him.\n\nDrawn by its reputation as a haven for misfits and dreamers, Liam landed in San Francisco in his early twenties. He spent a decade working odd jobs\u2014bartender, rare bookseller, art handler\u2014while obsessively immersing himself in the city\u2019s underground art scene. He built a reputation for having an impeccable, intuitive eye. Eventually, he scraped together enough to lease a small, neglected storefront in Hayes Valley, renovating the space himself and converting the apartment above into his home. This became O\u2019Connell Contemporary, and with a 0.0-mile commute, his life and work became one.\n\nNow 44, Liam is a fixture in the neighborhood. His life is monastic in its dedication. Mornings begin with strong coffee and emails to artists before he descends the stairs to open his gallery. His social life consists of the artists he champions and the dedicated collectors who have become friends. A significant long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his singular focus on the gallery. Liam\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but legacy: to discover a truly visionary artist and launch their career. He moves through his small kingdom\u2014the gallery below, his apartment above\u2014a quiet high priest in his temple of modern art, forever tethered to the city that allowed him to build it."
