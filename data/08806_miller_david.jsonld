His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a creaking flight of stairs from his rent-controlled apartment to the small, independent art gallery where he works as an assistant. This quiet, contained life is a deliberate rebellion against the one he was supposed to live.\n\nRaised in the sprawling suburbs of San Jose by a pragmatic engineer father and a schoolteacher mother, David was pushed toward the promise of Silicon Valley. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science from UC Davis and, by 25, was a programmer at a rising dot-com startup. He had the salary, the stock options, and the fianc\u00e9e\u2014the complete package of late-90s success. But he was miserable, haunted by the feeling that he was merely arranging abstract symbols while life, tangible and beautiful, happened elsewhere.\n\nThe turning point was the bust. The company folded, the stock became worthless paper, and the immense stress fractured his engagement. At 29, with his prescribed future in ruins, David felt a profound sense of relief. He sold what he could, backpacked through Southeast Asia for a year, and returned to San Francisco a different man. He took the first job that felt real: hauling crates and hanging canvases at a gallery.\n\nFifteen years later, David is a permanent fixture. He knows the hum of the gallery\u2019s HVAC system, the specific slant of afternoon light on the polished floors, and the subtle tells of a serious buyer versus a casual browser. His social life is a small constellation of the eccentric gallery owner, the rotating cast of artists, and the barista at his corner caf\u00e9.\n\nThough he is the quiet custodian of other people's dreams, David secretly nurtures his own. An accomplished street photographer, he spends his evenings and weekends capturing fleeting, unnoticed moments of city life. His hope isn't for fame or fortune, but for the courage to one day ask his boss if he can hang a few of his own photos in the back room\u2014to finally close the distance between the life he assists and the one he truly wants to live."
