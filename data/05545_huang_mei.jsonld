Born to first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, her childhood was scented with the competing aromas of her mother\u2019s cooking and the chemical tang of the dry-cleaning business her parents owned and operated on Clement Street. From a young age, Mei an her brother helped behind the counter, learning the rhythm of the city through its residents' laundry. She was meticulous, finding a quiet satisfaction in organizing tickets and balancing the day's cash drawer.\n\nWhile her friends aimed for UCs, the pressure to remain close to home and the practical realities of her family\u2019s finances guided Mei to City College of San Francisco. She pursued an Associate's degree in Business Administration, a no-nonsense path to a stable job. This pragmatism defined her early career. She landed her first office job as an administrative assistant, and her sharp eye for detail quickly moved her into an Accounts Payable Specialist role at a mid-sized financial services firm downtown.\n\nThe pandemic was a quiet turning point. Her role shifted to permanently remote, erasing her commute and tethering her to the same apartment she\u2019d lived in for years. Her world shrank to the dimensions of her laptop screen and the familiar blocks of her neighborhood. Her social life, once built around casual work lunches and post-work drinks, now relies on a tight-knit group of high school friends, with whom she shares weekly dim sum.\n\nNow 33, Mei\u2019s life is a study in routine. Her days are a sequence of processing invoices, reconciling accounts, and communicating through Slack. Her parents finally sold the business and retired last year, a change that left Mei feeling both proud and adrift. In the solitude of her apartment, a new dream is taking root. She spends her evenings in a community ceramics class, the feel of clay a welcome contrast to her keyboard. Her quiet aspiration is to one day use her business acumen to open a small ceramics studio and gallery, a place that blends her inherited practicality with her own burgeoning creativity. For now, she remains a steady, unassuming presence in the Richmond, her connection to San Francisco not one of trendy bars or tech disruption, but of deep roots and meticulously managed dreams."

The dry cleaner was quiet, filled with the sharp scent of perchloroethylene and the late afternoon sun slanting through the dusty window. Her father had left her to balance the cash drawer alone for the first time. With her mother\u2019s abacus clacking softly beside her, she meticulously sorted the bills and counted the coins. When the numbers on her notepad matched the register tape exactly, a silent, profound wave of competence washed over her. It was a feeling of order she would chase for years.\n\n2.\nIt was a foggy Tuesday at City College. Huddled in the library, she scrolled through Instagram, seeing a photo of her best friend laughing on the green lawn of UCLA\u2019s campus. Mei looked out the window at the gray, windswept Phelan Loop. There was no bitterness, just a quiet, heavy acceptance of her own path. It was the moment she understood her life would be built on practicality, not possibility. She closed the app and focused on her accounting textbook, her determination hardening like a resolve.\n\n3.\nThe day her parents sold the shop, she stood with them in the empty space for the last time. The air was unnaturally still without the hiss of the presses and the rumble of the washers. Her mother ran a hand over the bare counter, her father stared at the hook where he used to hang the keys. Mei felt a swell of immense pride for them, but also a sudden, unmoored feeling. Their life's work was finished, and with it, a huge, foundational piece of her own identity had just been dismantled.\n\n4.\nThe first time her friend group managed to get dim sum after the longest stretch of the pandemic lockdown felt like a homecoming. The clatter of carts and the boisterous Cantonese chatter at the restaurant were overwhelming and beautiful. As she plucked a har gow from the steamer basket, the easy, familiar laughter of her friends wrapped around her like a shield. She realized then that while her world had shrunk, its foundation\u2014these people, this ritual\u2014had become stronger and more precious than ever before.\n\n5.\nIn her first ceramics class, her hands, so used to the precise click of a keyboard, were clumsy in the cool, wet clay. She was trying to center a lump on the wheel, but it kept wobbling into a misshapen mound. Frustration gave way to a giggle. The mess, the lack of an \u2018undo\u2019 button, felt radical. When she finally formed a small, lopsided bowl, she felt a flicker of a different kind of satisfaction\u2014not of balancing an account, but of creating one. It was the first breath of a new dream."
