Raised in a quiet Des Moines suburb by a pragmatic accountant father and a history teacher mother, David was a solitary, intellectually curious child. His passion wasn't sports, but the elegant, cosmic mathematics of the universe. This led him to pursue a PhD in Astrophysics at UC Berkeley, bringing him to the Bay Area with dreams of mapping distant galaxies.\n\nThe key turning point came after graduation. The academic job market was bleak, and the promise of unraveling the universe\u2019s secrets felt distant. A friend, working at a burgeoning startup, showed David how his skills in modeling vast, complex datasets could be applied to consumer behavior. The transition from astrophysics to data science was less a calling and more a pragmatic pivot. The intellectual challenge was there, but the subject matter\u2014predicting clicks instead of supernovas\u2014left a lingering sense of dissonance.\n\nNow 41, David is a Lead Data Scientist for a major tech firm. His 0.0-mile commute terminates at a meticulously organized standing desk in his Inner Sunset condo. His days are a disciplined rhythm: a pre-dawn run in Golden Gate Park, a strong black coffee from the caf\u00e9 on Irving Street, then hours of deep focus, managing his team and building predictive models via Slack and Zoom. His personal life is similarly structured. An amicable but draining divorce in his mid-thirties, a casualty of his intense focus on his new career, left him valuing solitude and order.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate but narrow. He loves the fog rolling over the hills and the intellectual hum of the city, but avoids the frantic downtown and tech-bro social scenes. His world is the Inner Sunset and the adjacent park. He knows the names of the baristas and the grocers, finding community in these small, daily interactions. His dream is to reconcile his past and present\u2014to one day apply his powerful analytical skills to a problem with more soul, perhaps in climate science or public health. On weekends, he pores over public datasets, still searching for the grand, elegant patterns in the noise, just as he once did with the stars."
