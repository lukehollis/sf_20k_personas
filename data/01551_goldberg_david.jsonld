Raised in a working-class Jewish family in Brooklyn, David learned the value of a hard day's work from his father, a union carpenter. He wasn't one for school, finding more education in the bustling streets and loading docks of New York than in a classroom. At 19, he followed a girl and a vague job offer to the West Coast, landing in San Francisco in the early 1990s. The relationship fizzled, but the job stuck.\n\nHe started on the floor of a warehouse near the Port of Oakland, learning the intricate dance of freight and shipping. David possessed a natural talent for seeing patterns and creating efficiencies where others saw chaos. Over two decades, he methodically climbed the ladder, his lack of a college degree compensated for by his sharp mind and gritty work ethic. He eventually became the Logistics Operations Manager he is today, a respected, self-made man.\n\nHis key turning point wasn't professional, but personal. He married in his late twenties and had a daughter, Maya, who became the anchor of his life. The marriage ended amicably a decade later, and they co-parented successfully. The second turning point came three years ago when Maya left for college at UC Santa Barbara. The quiet left in her absence was profound.\n\nNow, at 51, David\u2019s world is contained within the walls of his tidy two-bedroom apartment in the Richmond District. The pandemic normalized his 0.0-mile commute, and he found he preferred it. His days are a disciplined routine: up at 6 AM, a strong coffee, then logging on to orchestrate a global ballet of cargo containers. His connection to San Francisco is deep but quiet; he loves the salty air and the relentless fog that rolls over his neighborhood. He finds peace walking the trails of Lands End, watching the ships he helps direct glide under the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nDavid is proud of the life he\u2019s built, but he dreams of a future beyond spreadsheets. He sends most of his disposable income to Maya, ensuring she has the educational opportunities he never did. His quiet hope is to one day save enough to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain\u2014a long, deliberate journey for a man whose life has been dedicated to making sure everything else arrives on time."
