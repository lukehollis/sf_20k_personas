The daughter of a stoic Korean engineer and a vibrant Russian literature professor, she grew up navigating a world of precise calculations and sprawling Dostoevsky novels. Her father instilled a relentless work ethic, while her mother filled her head with stories of faraway lands. This duality shaped her path: she pursued a degree in International Relations, dreaming of a diplomatic career, but minored in Economics as a pragmatic concession to her father\u2019s belief in tangible skills.\n\nThe turning point came during a senior-year internship. Witnessing the slow, bureaucratic pace of government work, Anastasia grew disillusioned. A recruiter from a San Francisco fintech firm presented an alternative: a world of fast-paced problem-solving and clear metrics for success. She took the job, trading her diplomatic ambitions for a Junior Financial Analyst role, and moved across the country three weeks after graduation.\n\nNow 27, Anastasia\u2019s life is a study in digital discipline. Her zero-mile commute keeps her tethered to her small Inner Richmond apartment, her world often confined to the dual monitors on her standing desk. Days are a blur of market analysis and spreadsheet modeling. To escape the screen, she finds solace in the misty quiet of Golden Gate Park and explores the culinary landscape of Clement Street, where the scent of a Korean bakery reminds her of her father's rare weekend baking.\n\nHer social circle is a small constellation of college friends who also migrated to the Bay Area and a few work colleagues she knows mostly through Slack. The isolation of remote work has made deep connections elusive. While grateful for her financial stability, Anastasia feels a growing disconnect between her daily tasks and the passions of her youth. Her dream is to bridge that gap\u2014to eventually move into impact investing, using her financial acumen to support international arts programs or social enterprises. For now, she finds purpose in the precision of her work, hoping it\u2019s a stepping stone to a future where numbers and stories can finally coexist."
