The middle child of a Filipino-American father who worked as a Muni driver and an Irish-American mother who was a school administrator, Marco\u2019s upbringing was a lively blend of cultures, defined by family gatherings and a deep-seated loyalty to the city. While his older sister excelled academically, Marco was more of a social connector, the charismatic kid who knew everyone. College never felt like his path; instead, after graduating high school, he took a job as a bank teller to help with family finances.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was a pivotal turning point. He watched his parents, and many of their neighbors, struggle with fear and confusion over their mortgages. It was then that a branch manager, seeing Marco\u2019s natural rapport with customers and his sharp, practical mind, encouraged him to get his Mortgage Loan Officer license. He saw an opportunity not just for a career, but to demystify the intimidating world of real estate finance for people like his parents. Marco excelled, his street smarts and genuine empathy making him a trusted advisor in a field often seen as predatory.\n\nToday, Marco lives in a modest apartment in the Outer Richmond. His 7.5-mile commute in his well-maintained Acura takes him to his downtown office, where he guides first-time homebuyers through the city\u2019s notoriously difficult market. He carries a quiet pride in helping other locals secure a foothold in their hometown. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of childhood friends, sharing beers while watching the 49ers or grabbing burritos in the Mission.\n\nHis ultimate dream is to own a piece of the city he loves\u2014a multi-unit building where he can live and create stability for himself and his future family. Having recently ended a long-term relationship, Marco is focused on this goal, channeling his energy into his work and saving diligently. He is a man defined not by a prestigious degree but by his resilience and his unwavering connection to the streets that raised him."

He wasn\u2019t just a passenger; he was the driver\u2019s son. His dad, steady at the wheel, would nod at familiar faces, a quiet king of his route. Marco saw the city not as a map, but as his father\u2019s domain\u2014a web of lives connected by this machine. It was his first lesson in how the city worked, a feeling of belonging that settled deep in his bones, fueled by pride.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was 2008. He heard his parents\u2019 hushed, worried voices from the kitchen table. His father, a man who commanded a 60-foot bus with ease, looked small staring at a mortgage statement, his face a mask of confusion. In their quiet fear over numbers they didn\u2019t understand, Marco felt a hot surge of purpose. He wasn\u2019t just a bank teller collecting paychecks anymore. He had to learn this language of finance, not for a career, but to shield the people he loved from that specific kind of helplessness.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHis first major closing wasn\u2019t a mansion; it was a small condo in the Excelsior for a family just like his. When he handed the keys to the couple\u2014a city mechanic and a teacher\u2019s aide\u2014the wife started to cry. The husband just kept shaking Marco\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cWe never thought we could do this here.\u201d Seeing their relief, the same tangible security he\u2019d craved for his own parents, was more potent than any commission. It cemented his belief that he wasn't selling loans; he was selling footholds.\n\n***\n\n4.\nLast fall, after a brutal 49ers loss, he and his friends ended up at their usual spot in the Mission, sharing a foil-wrapped super burrito on the hood of a car. Nobody was saying much, just watching the traffic go by. There was no need to perform or explain. In the comfortable silence, punctuated only by the crinkle of foil, he felt the solid anchor of his friendships. This was his foundation, an unspoken loyalty more valuable than any down payment, the real reason he could never leave.\n\n***\n\n5.\nA month after the breakup, he was driving home along Geary and saw it: a classic Richmond Special duplex, a \u2018For Sale\u2019 sign tilting in the wind. He pulled his Acura over and just stared. For a moment, the loneliness of his empty apartment was replaced by a sharp, clear vision. He pictured himself in the top unit, maybe renting the bottom to a friend. The vague dream of owning property suddenly had an address. It wasn't about a relationship anymore; it was about building his own stability, brick by brick."
