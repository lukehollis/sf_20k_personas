            "value": "Ivan Washington knows the soul of San Francisco through its sound waves and light beams. Raised in a working-class Sacramento family, his father\u2019s garage was his first classroom. While his dad worked on cars, Ivan tinkered with discarded speakers and old mixing boards, learning to solder and splice before he could legally drive. Traditional schooling never held his interest; he completed high school but found community college aimless. His real education began when he started doing live sound for friends\u2019 bands in dive bars, discovering a passion for the controlled chaos behind the curtain.\n\nAt 20, he packed his tools and moved to San Francisco, chasing the bigger stages. The first years were a grind of couch-surfing and taking any freelance gig he could find\u2014hauling gear for corporate events in Moscone Center, coiling cables at The Fillmore, and running spotlights for indie theater productions. This nomadic hustle eventually led to a full-time position as a Production Technician for a major events company. The role offered stability but maintained the dynamic, project-based work he craved.\n\nNow at 26, Ivan lives in a converted warehouse loft in the Dogpatch, a space that serves as both his home and his workshop. This live/work setup explains his zero-mile commute; his days are spent either on-site at a venue or in his loft, repairing equipment and designing lighting rigs. His social life is intertwined with his profession, a tight-knit crew of fellow technicians and stagehands who have become his chosen family in the city. Relationships beyond this circle have been fleeting, casualties of a schedule that runs on event calendars, not 9-to-5 clocks.\n\nIvan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tactile. He builds the city\u2019s temporary realities\u2014the festivals in Golden Gate Park, the product launches in SOMA, the concerts that echo through its historic venues. He dreams of eventually becoming a Production Manager for a major tour or starting his own boutique firm specializing in immersive art installations. For now, he finds quiet satisfaction in his craft, a backstage artist who makes the magic happen, one perfectly timed light cue at a time."
