As the daughter of practical Korean immigrants, her path was expected to be stable and lucrative. But her father\u2019s quiet weekend trips to LACMA planted a different seed. While her parents saw geometry, he taught her to see the line and form in a Franz Kline painting.\n\nThis seed blossomed at UCLA, where she dutifully started as a pre-law major before secretly switching to Art History. The ensuing confrontation with her family was the most difficult moment of her life, but her resolve was absolute. She moved to San Francisco for her graduate degree at the California College of the Arts, captivated by the city's rebellious creative spirit and drawn to the work of pioneering video artist Nam June Paik, whose art resonated with her own Korean-American identity.\n\nHer career was a hard-won ascent from unpaid intern to curatorial assistant, culminating in her current role at a major downtown museum. Now 36, Miriam\u2019s life is a curated balance. She lives in a bright, minimalist apartment in NOPA, her 2.8-mile bike commute a daily ritual that clears her head as she navigates the Wiggle. Her days are a whirlwind of research, artist meetings, and meticulous exhibition planning. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or in quiet contemplation at home, sketching out ideas in her journal.\n\nAfter a long-term relationship ended two years ago, she has poured her energy into her work and a tight-knit circle of friends. Her ambition is clear: to become a Head Curator and use the platform to champion underrepresented AAPI artists. She dreams of mounting a landmark exhibition that re-contextualizes contemporary art through a diasporic lens. For Miriam, San Francisco is more than a home; it is the canvas where she defied expectations and built a life of her own design, a city whose constant reinvention mirrors her own artistic sensibilities."

Her father stopped her in front of a chaotic black-and-white canvas. \u201cNot a mess,\u201d he whispered in Korean, \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling, made of lines.\u201d In that quiet moment, watching her father trace a Franz Kline painting in the air, a secret door opened in her mind. It was the first time she understood that art wasn\u2019t a decoration, but a language. That day shaped her entire way of seeing.\n\n2.\nThe silence after she told them she\u2019d switched to Art History was heavier than any argument could ever be. She remembers the look on her mother\u2019s face\u2014not anger, but a deep, aching disappointment. At twenty, sitting at their worn kitchen table, Miriam felt her own voice, brittle but unbreakable, defending a future they couldn\u2019t comprehend. The heartbreak of that confrontation was immense, but it forged her resolve into steel. She had chosen her own story, and there was no turning back.\n\n3.\nIt was a grad school screening at CCA, a flickering wall of stacked televisions broadcasting a chaotic symphony of images. Nam June Paik. She felt a jolt of recognition so profound it was almost physical. Here was a Korean name, a Korean face, not in the past but at the vanguard of the future. It was the moment her hyphenated identity clicked into place\u2014a source of power and unique perspective. That night, her ambition gained a crucial new focus: to create a space for voices like his, and like hers.\n\n4.\nHer first solo-curated show was in a tiny, awkward side gallery. After the final piece was hung, long after midnight, she stood alone in the quiet space. She ran her hand over the cool vinyl letters of the artist\u2019s name she had just applied to the wall. A wave of exhaustion and pure, unadulterated pride washed over her. This was it. Not an internship, not an assistantship. It was her vision, made real. It was the first tangible proof that every sacrifice had been worth it.\n\n5.\nLast fall, biking home through the Wiggle, the fog rolled in thick, muffling the city. Streetlights bloomed into soft halos. The stress from a tense acquisitions meeting dissolved with each turn of the pedal. Cresting the slight hill onto Divisadero, she looked at the glowing storefronts and felt a quiet, simple sense of rightness. This life\u2014this specific, hard-won, solitary peace\u2014was the masterpiece she had been building all along. She was home, entirely on her own terms."
