Born in Fremont to parents who emigrated from Delhi in the 1970s, his childhood was a blend of fragrant home-cooked Indian meals and the suburban ambition of Silicon Valley. His parents, an engineer and a school administrator, preached the gospel of stability and education. Rohan dutifully followed this path, earning a practical economics degree from UC Davis and landing a safe analyst job in corporate finance.\n\nThe turning point came during the dot-com bust. Surrounded by the wreckage of fleeting digital fortunes, Rohan found himself drawn to the tangible. He was fascinated by why people chose one store over another, what made a physical space feel compelling. This revelation led him to pursue an MBA at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, pivoting his career toward retail. He thrived, discovering a natural talent for dissecting consumer behavior and market trends. His journey took him from a junior analyst at a major clothing brand to his current role as Director of Retail Strategy, where he shapes the in-store experience for a national home goods company.\n\nNow 45, Rohan\u2019s life is centered in San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley. His commute is a 3.5-mile Muni ride downtown, a daily ritual of podcasts and people-watching. An amicable divorce two years ago prompted a period of introspection, leading him to reconnect with old friends and cultivate hobbies beyond his demanding career, including weekly pottery classes. His social life revolves around a small circle of fellow professionals and a couple of friends from his MBA program, often meeting for dinner in the Mission or catching a show at the SFJAZZ Center near his apartment.\n\nWhile professionally successful, Rohan dreams of a smaller, more personal venture. He fantasizes about opening a highly curated bookstore and wine bar in a neighborhood like the Richmond or Noe Valley, a space built on community and tactile experience\u2014a full-circle tribute to the tangible world that first captivated him. He seeks a future defined less by corporate metrics and more by quiet, meaningful connection."

The fragrant dust coated his small hands, the scent filling the warm air and mixing with the sound of his father\u2019s news program. It wasn't about efficiency; it was about the process, the feel, the aroma. That sensory memory, of creating something real with his hands, became the foundation for his entire philosophy\u2014the belief that true value is tangible.\n\n2.\nHe remembers walking through SOMA in early 2001, past a startup office that was bustling a month before. Now it was just an empty glass box. Sunlight illuminated dust motes and the faint outlines on the carpet where desks had been. All that digital ambition, vanished into thin air. He felt a profound disillusionment with the intangible. In that moment, the silent, physical space felt more real and resonant than any stock ticker. It was the spark that pushed him away from finance and towards the tangible world.\n\n3.\nIt was a late-night brand strategy class at Haas, maybe 2006. The case study was a failing national retailer. While his classmates debated financials, Rohan found himself mapping the store's layout, imagining the customer's path from the door to the dressing room. He spoke up, outlining how lighting and fixture placement could alter perception. The professor stopped and listened. For the first time, Rohan\u2019s intuition felt like a strategic tool, not just a feeling. He knew, with absolute certainty, he was finally on the right path.\n\n4.\nLast year, after weeks of lopsided failures at his pottery class, a small bowl finally rose evenly between his hands. The whir of the wheel, the cool slip of the clay\u2014it was a perfectly centered moment. It wasn't for a presentation or a metric; it was just for him. In the quiet satisfaction of creating a simple, functional object, he felt a piece of himself click back into place after the divorce. It was a feeling of patient, solitary reconstruction, shaping something new from the mess.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after a show at SFJAZZ, he ducked into a small wine bar to wait out the rain. The low light, the murmur of conversation, the scent of old paper from the bookstore next door\u2014it all converged. He watched people talking, sharing a bottle, lost in their own small worlds. The thought landed, fully formed: *This*. This is what he wanted to build next. A space measured not in sales per square foot, but in quiet, meaningful connections. His future felt clear."
