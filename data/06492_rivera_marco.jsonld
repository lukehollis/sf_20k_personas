Born in Daly City to a Filipina mother and a Mexican-American father who left when he was young, Marco inherited his mother\u2019s resilience and a name that hinted at a heritage he barely knew. He grew up in a small, bustling household, his mother working two jobs to keep them afloat. Marco was a dutiful son, excelling in art but always aware of the practicalities of life.\n\nHis artistic talent led him to SF State, where he enrolled in the graphic design program. For two years, he felt a thrilling sense of purpose, his creativity finally finding an outlet. The turning point came during his junior year when his mother\u2019s health declined sharply. Without a second thought, Marco dropped out of college to become her primary caregiver and find stable work. He landed a job as an administrative assistant, a role that prized organization over originality.\n\nNow 32, Marco lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a shuffle from his bed to the small desk in his living room, where he remotely manages schedules and correspondence for a downtown law firm. His days are structured by calendar alerts and the quiet hum of his laptop. For Marco, San Francisco isn't about the bustling nightlife or tech scene; it\u2019s about the predictable comfort of his neighborhood. It\u2019s the solitary walks through Golden Gate Park, the familiar taste of dim sum from Clement Street, and the fog rolling in as he logs off for the day.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few high school friends and his mother, whose health has stabilized. Though content with the stability he provides, a quiet dream persists. In the evenings, he fills sketchbooks with designs he once imagined on posters and websites. Marco hopes to one day return to his art, perhaps by opening an online print shop. He yearns to create again, believing his life in the city has more chapters yet to be written, ones filled with color and a purpose all his own."
