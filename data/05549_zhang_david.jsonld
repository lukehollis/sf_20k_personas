The only child of immigrants from Shanghai, he grew up in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. His parents ran a small, beloved Shanghainese restaurant, their lives a testament to relentless hard work and the dream of providing their son with opportunities they never had. David absorbed their work ethic but initially rebelled against their practicality, drawn instead to the very structure of the city around him.\n\nHe pursued this passion at UC Berkeley and later earned a Master's in Urban Planning from UCLA, filled with visions of designing equitable, sustainable communities. However, he graduated into the teeth of the 2008 financial crisis. Public sector jobs were scarce, and the weight of student loans was immense. On a whim, leveraging his natural talent for quantitative analysis, he took an entry-level job at a financial firm. To his own surprise, he excelled. The logical clarity of market analysis provided a different kind of satisfaction, and the financial security was a profound relief. The promotions came steadily, and the idealistic planner became a successful financial analyst.\n\nNow 38, David lives a life of curated routine in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his espresso machine to his standing desk. The work-from-home structure suits his focused nature, but it has reinforced a tendency toward isolation. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of college friends and, recently, a budding relationship with a landscape architect named Maya, who reawakens his dormant passion for urban design. His daily routine includes a morning run through the Panhandle and quiet evenings analyzing market trends, the city\u2019s skyline glowing outside his window.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and dichotomous. He is an analyst of its economic engine by day, yet he walks its streets seeing the ghost of the urban planner he might have been. His ultimate aspiration is to bridge this divide. He dreams of leveraging his financial acumen to move into impact investing, specifically funding innovative urban development and affordable housing projects. He wants to finally use the language of finance to build the city he always dreamed of shaping."

The air was thick with the scent of star anise and his father\u2019s relentless work. Through the steamy window, the N Judah streetcar rattled down the avenue. He didn't just see a train; he saw a system, a network connecting lives. That's when he first felt the pull of the city's structure, a world far more ordered and vast than the comforting, chaotic warmth of the kitchen behind him.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the fluorescent hum of the Wurster Hall library at Berkeley, age 21. His blueprints for a revitalized West Oakland\u2014a tapestry of greenways and community hubs\u2014were spread before him. Tracing a line for a new bike path, he felt a jolt of pure, unadulterated purpose. He wasn't just drawing; he was building a more just world on paper. That feeling of certainty became the ghost that would haunt the pragmatic choices he had yet to make.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't a celebration. At 24, the job offer from the financial firm glowed on his laptop screen next to his staggering student loan balance. He remembered the physical sensation of his shoulders slumping, not in defeat, but in weary surrender. He wasn't choosing a passion; he was choosing solvency. It was the quiet, pragmatic death of the planner to ensure the basic survival of the man, a trade he would analyze for years to come.\n\n4.\nOn a run through the Panhandle just last month, he saw it: a new bench, artfully designed with dividers to prevent anyone from sleeping there. The analyst in him noted the cold efficiency, but the planner inside him\u2014that dusty, dormant self\u2014felt a sharp pang of shame. His sleek condo, his curated life, his entire financial security suddenly felt complicit in this small, public cruelty. The distance between his window and the street had never felt so vast.\n\n5.\nA few weeks ago, walking with Maya near the Ferry Building, she critiqued the new waterfront development, not its beauty, but its wind-tunnel effect and lack of accessible public seating. She spoke the language he had packed away with his thesis years ago\u2014the language of place, equity, and human-centered design. Looking at the city through her eyes, he felt a dormant part of his own mind stir. For the first time in a decade, he saw San Francisco not as a market, but as a home to be fixed."
