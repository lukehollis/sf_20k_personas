The only child of immigrants from Guangdong, he grew up amidst the scent of rosin flux in his parents\u2019 small electronics repair shop in the Outer Richmond. While his father taught him how to diagnose a faulty capacitor, his parents dreamed he would transcend their humble work, pushing him towards a prestigious engineering degree.\n\nWei, however, harbored a different passion. In a quiet act of rebellion, he enrolled at San Francisco State University and earned a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, focusing on sculpture. He loved the interplay of form, texture, and balance, but the reality of a post-graduation artist's life was harsh. Galleries were indifferent, and commissions were scarce. Facing financial pressure, Wei felt a pang of failure, as if his parents\u2019 pragmatism had been proven right all along.\n\nThe turning point came not in a studio, but at a friend's fledgling startup. They were struggling with a clumsy hardware prototype. Seeing the mess of wires and poorly machined parts, Wei\u2019s two worlds collided. He took the device home and, drawing on both his father\u2019s lessons and his sculptor\u2019s eye for design, rebuilt it into something elegant and efficient.\n\nToday, Wei is a highly sought-after freelance Production Technician. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his lifestyle; his SoMa loft is both his home and his workshop. One side is a minimalist living space, the other a meticulous workbench laden with oscilloscopes, 3D printers, and custom tools. He builds prototypes for tech companies and specialized, high-performance computing rigs for a niche clientele who appreciate his artistry.\n\nHis life is disciplined: a morning pour-over from a local cafe, long, focused hours at his bench, and late-night bike rides through the quiet city streets to clear his head. His social circle is small, comprised of fellow makers and a few old college friends who admire his unique path.\n\nWei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to found a unicorn startup, but to open a boutique hardware design studio\u2014a place where technology is treated as a craft. He feels deeply connected to San Francisco, not for its venture capital-fueled glamour, but as a city of artisans. He\u2019s a crucial, unseen part of the innovation engine, a modern craftsman forging the physical tools for a digital world."
