The only child of Korean immigrants, he spent his youth observing the quiet struggles of his parents\u2014the language barriers, the labyrinthine tax forms, and the ever-present anxiety of keeping a small business afloat in Silicon Valley\u2019s shadow. It wasn\u2019t a single crisis but a slow accumulation of inequities that fueled his interest in how systems could either help or hinder people like his family.\n\nThis early education in grassroots economics led him to UCLA for his undergraduate studies in political science, and later to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Public Policy. A pivotal moment came during his graduate internship when a proposed city zoning change threatened dozens of small businesses in a San Jose neighborhood, eerily echoing his parents\u2019 past anxieties. Daniel threw himself into the work, helping to research and present alternative plans that protected the community. Seeing policy directly impact lives solidified his career path; he wasn't just studying theory anymore, he was wielding it as a tool for justice.\n\nNow, as a Policy Analyst for the City of San Francisco, Daniel lives a life both defined by and dedicated to the city\u2019s complex fabric. His 1.2-mile commute on a rattling MUNI bus from his Hayes Valley apartment to his City Hall office is a daily immersion in the very issues he analyzes\u2014transit efficiency, homelessness, and the vibrant, chaotic pulse of urban life. His days are spent in data sets and briefing papers, tackling thorny issues like housing density and small business support programs.\n\nHis social life is a close-knit circle of fellow Berkeley alumni who share his civic-minded passion, often debating policy over craft beers in the Mission or ramen in Japantown. He\u2019s navigating the city's dating scene with thoughtful intention, hoping to find a partner who shares his values.\n\nDaniel\u2019s love for San Francisco is not blind; he sees its deep flaws and glaring inequalities. But unlike many, he sees them as problems to be solved, not just endure. His quiet aspiration is to one day move from analysis to action, perhaps by running for a local office like a Board of Supervisors seat, to give a real voice to the communities that remind him so much of where he came from."

The English words were a wall she couldn't climb, and the numbers a language of pure anxiety. He felt a hot, helpless anger rise in his chest. It wasn't about the money; it was the quiet indignity of it all. That moment wasn't just a memory; it was the foundation of his entire career, a vow to understand the systems that could make his parents feel so small.\n\n2.\nHe remembers calling his father from his Berkeley dorm room after the San Jose city council adopted their revised zoning plan. He explained how they\u2019d saved a dozen small businesses, including a family-run cleaners. There was a long pause. Then, his father, a man of few words, said in Korean, \"You did a good thing, son.\" The simple, profound validation in his voice was more powerful than any academic praise. It was the moment his abstract policy studies became a tangible tool for protecting people like his family.\n\n3.\nJust last winter, his crowded MUNI bus shuddered to a halt. An elderly woman had slipped on the wet steps, her groceries scattering. Instantly, a young man with face tattoos offered a hand while a woman in a suit steadied her bags. For a brief moment, the bus wasn't a collection of strangers but a single unit of care. Daniel watched, his policy notes forgotten. This was the city a spreadsheet could never capture\u2014flawed, but capable of breathtaking decency. It\u2019s the human data that keeps him going.\n\n4.\nHe was on a second date at a sleek bar in the FiDi. She was smart and successful, and complained bitterly about a new homeless shelter planned for her neighborhood. \"It\u2019s dragging down property values,\" she\u2019d said. Daniel felt a quiet but definitive click inside him\u2014the sound of a door closing. It wasn't about agreeing on every policy, but about the fundamental empathy behind it. He knew then he wasn't just looking for a partner to share a life with, but an ally in building a more compassionate city.\n\n5.\nHe was leaving City Hall late one Tuesday when he saw an elderly Cantonese couple trying to read a public hearing notice, their faces etched with confusion. It was his parents, twenty years ago, all over again. He paused, his briefcase suddenly heavy. He realized all his data analysis and policy briefs were useless if they never reached the people on this side of the door. The thought of running for the Board of Supervisors shifted from a distant ambition to an urgent, undeniable need. He had to be their voice."
