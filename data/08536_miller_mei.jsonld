            "value": "Mei Lin Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s cultural confluence. Born in the Richmond District to a Chinese immigrant mother from Guangzhou and a second-generation Irish-American father, her childhood was a blend of distinct traditions. She spent weekends with her paternal grandparents learning to bake sourdough and weekdays in her maternal grandmother\u2019s (her *p\u00f2p\u00f3*) kitchen, enveloped in the scents of star anise, ginger, and garlic. It was there, mastering the delicate art of folding wontons, that she discovered her life\u2019s calling was not just to cook, but to tell stories through food.\n\nShe was a practical student, forgoing a four-year university for a focused Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College. She knew she could cook, but she needed to understand how to run a business. After graduating, Mei Lin paid her dues in established kitchens across the city, from traditional Cantonese banquet halls in Chinatown to fine-dining establishments downtown. She absorbed techniques and discipline but felt constrained by others' menus.\n\nThe turning point came during the 2008 recession when the upscale restaurant she worked at shuttered. Unemployed but resolute, she pooled her savings and started a pop-up at a local farmers' market, serving \"Cal-Chinese\" dishes that fused her two heritages\u2014think five-spice short rib tacos and scallion pancake grilled cheese. It was there she met Alex, a charismatic front-of-house manager who saw the genius in her food. They became partners, and after years of saving, they secured a small space in Hayes Valley to open \"Jasmine & Sage.\"\n\nNow 43, Mei Lin\u2019s life is the restaurant. She lives in the small apartment directly above it, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to her dedication. Her day begins before sunrise with trips to the wholesale produce market and ends long after the last customer has left. Her staff is her family, and her loyal regulars are her community. While she has achieved her dream of ownership, she now aspires to something more enduring: earning a Michelin star, not for the ego, but as a tribute to her *p\u00f2p\u00f3's* legacy. She dreams of one day creating a space that feels like a true San Francisco story\u2014a welcoming table where different cultures meet and create something new and beautiful together."
