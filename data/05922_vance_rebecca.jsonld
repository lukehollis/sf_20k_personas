            "value": "Rebecca Vance grew up under the vast, often-gray skies of a small town outside Portland, Oregon. The only child of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her upbringing was stable, predictable, and imbued with a sense of civic duty. This led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Political Science at the University of Washington, where she dreamed of working on Capitol Hill. A disillusioning summer internship in D.C., however, soured her on that path, leaving her with a diploma and a profound uncertainty about her future.\n\nFollowing a college boyfriend, she moved to San Francisco at 23. The relationship soon fizzled, but the city\u2019s electric energy captured her. Needing to pay the rent on a shared apartment in the Inner Richmond, she took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a burgeoning tech startup. It was meant to be a stopgap, but Rebecca discovered a surprising aptitude for the structured chaos. She was meticulously organized and a natural communicator, skills that allowed her to navigate the complex personalities of engineers and designers. She parlayed the temp gig into a full-time role, and over six years, worked her way up to Product Development Coordinator. She traded C-SPAN for Slack channels, policy briefs for product roadmaps.\n\nNow 29, Rebecca\u2019s life is centered in her one-bedroom Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as her office. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her bed to her desk. Her days are a cascade of video calls, project management software, and tight deadlines. To counteract the isolation of remote work, she is fiercely protective of her evenings and weekends. She finds community in a weekly pottery class and with a small, tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom also pivoted into tech from other fields.\n\nWhile she appreciates the stability her career provides, a flicker of her old idealism remains. Rebecca dreams of one day leveraging her project management skills for a company with a clear social mission, perhaps in civic tech or environmental sustainability. For now, she finds her balance in weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands and long walks through Golden Gate Park, feeling the pull of both the digital world she helps build and the tangible, beautiful city she calls home."
