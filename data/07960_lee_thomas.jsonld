He was born and raised in the apartment directly above Lee & Son\u2019s Hardware, the Inner Richmond institution his immigrant parents built from nothing. His childhood was a patchwork of helping his father, an exacting but loving man, sort screws and stack paint cans, and listening to his mother manage the books at the kitchen table. The store wasn't just a business; it was the rhythm of their family life, a tangible piece of their American dream.\n\nFor a brief, heady period, Thomas tried to build his own dream. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, chasing a passion for graphic design that felt a world away from hardware. He loved the clean lines, the digital palettes, and the sense of creating something entirely new. But in his sophomore year, his father suffered a mild heart attack. It wasn't life-threatening, but it was a warning. The choice wasn't really a choice at all. Thomas left school to become the full-time \u201c& Son\u201d his father now needed.\n\nNow 28, Thomas is the Assistant Store Manager, a title that belies his true role as the shop\u2019s operational core. His commute is a walk down a flight of stairs. His day begins with the rattle of the security gate and ends long after the last customer, Mrs. Chen from two doors down, has bought her weekly lightbulbs. He knows the neighborhood by its home improvement projects. His social life consists of beers with a few high school friends who never left the Sunset and the daily, friendly banter with his regulars.\n\nWhile he feels the quiet weight of obligation, Thomas hasn't abandoned his creative spark. Late at night, after the books are balanced, he sketches logos for the store on receipt paper and redesigns local cafe menus on an old tablet. His hope is no longer to escape, but to integrate. He dreams of modernizing the family business, introducing an online inventory, and maybe, just maybe, carving out a small space in the back for a freelance design studio\u2014a way to build his own future within the legacy he was born to uphold."
