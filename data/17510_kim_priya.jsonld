Born in San Jose to a pragmatic Korean engineer and a vibrant Indian librarian, her childhood home was a loving fusion of cultures\u2014the scent of kimchi often mingling with that of cardamom. This upbringing instilled in her a deep appreciation for efficiency and order from her father, and a rich, narrative-driven worldview from her mother.\n\nDrawn to tangible problems, Priya pursued Industrial Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, thriving in its \"learn by doing\" environment. She began her career on the factory floor of a medical device company, learning every machine and process firsthand. Her sharp intellect and ability to streamline complex systems led to a steady ascent through the ranks. Today, as Director of Operations for a sustainable packaging company in the Dogpatch, she orchestrates the complex ballet of supply chain, production, and logistics.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce at 38. The amicable but painful separation from her college sweetheart forced Priya to rebuild her identity outside of a partnership. She poured her energy into her career and rediscovered her independence, trading a suburban life for a vibrant apartment in the Mission District. This move solidified her love for San Francisco; the city became her own, not a place shared with a past life.\n\nHer daily routine is a ritual. She starts with a pre-dawn bike ride over Potrero Hill to her office, a 3.5-mile commute that serves as her moving meditation against the city's awakening skyline. Evenings are for exploring the Mission's culinary scene with a small, close-knit circle of friends, or quiet nights with a book, a nod to her mother\u2019s influence.\n\nNow at 47, Priya feels a deep sense of contentment but harbors new aspirations. She dreams of leveraging her experience to mentor young women, especially women of color, entering STEM fields. Her ultimate hope is to one day take a year-long sabbatical to travel through South Korea and India, not as a tourist, but as a daughter connecting with the two distinct, yet harmonious, halves of her heritage."

From the kitchen drifted the scent of her mother\u2019s dal and the sound of her voice telling a story from the Mahabharata. It wasn\u2019t a collision of worlds, but a perfect, harmonious orbit. In that moment, she understood that intricate systems and rich stories were just different languages for describing the world. It became the blueprint for her life.\n\n2.\nShe was 24, the factory floor roaring around her. For weeks, a labeling machine had been jamming, creating a frustrating bottleneck. Instead of just reporting it, she spent hours observing, sketching the mechanism on a greasy notepad. Her fix was simple\u2014a small, custom-machined guide. The first time the line ran flawlessly for an entire shift, a quiet, profound satisfaction washed over her. It was the thrill of tangible order, a feeling that cemented her path and defined her career.\n\n3.\nAt 38, after the last box from her old life was unpacked, Priya stood at the window of her new Mission apartment. The sounds of the city\u2014distant laughter, the rumble of a bus\u2014felt alien yet thrilling. For the first time in her adult life, the space and the silence were entirely hers. A wave of profound loneliness was quickly overtaken by a sharp, electric pulse of possibility. This wasn't a shared city anymore; it was her own. She was rebuilding not just a home, but a self.\n\n4.\nAround 41, cresting Potrero Hill on a cold pre-dawn morning, she paused her bike ride. The sky was a soft gradient of pink and orange over the Bay Bridge, the city still asleep below. The physical burn in her legs and the crisp air in her lungs felt like an anchor. It wasn't just a commute; it was a conversation with the city, a daily reclamation of her strength and her place within it. That ride became her non-negotiable ritual, the moving meditation that grounds her.\n\n5.\nShe was 45, leading a logistics meeting. A young Latina engineer, new to the team, offered a brilliant but quietly spoken suggestion. She saw an older male colleague casually talk over her. Priya paused the meeting, turned back to the young woman, and asked her to elaborate. The spark of confidence in the engineer\u2019s eyes as she found her voice ignited a new purpose in Priya. Her ambition shifted from optimizing systems to empowering the people within them. That day, her mentorship dream was born."
