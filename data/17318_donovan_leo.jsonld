Raised in San Mateo by his Korean mother, a passionate ceramicist, and his Irish-American father, a pragmatic software engineer, Leo\u2019s childhood was a blend of creative expression and logical systems. His mother taught him the importance of aesthetics and empathy through the art of Korean cooking, while his father instilled in him an appreciation for elegant, functional design. This unique upbringing became the bedrock of his future career.\n\nHis educational journey was solid but uninspired until a post-college backpacking trip to Seoul. Immersed in his mother\u2019s homeland, Leo was captivated by how seamlessly technology was integrated into public life\u2014from the hyper-efficient subway system to intuitive digital signage. It was a revelation. He realized he didn\u2019t just want to build things; he wanted to shape the human experience of them. This epiphany led him to pursue an MFA in Interaction Design at the California College of the Arts (CCA), a move that brought him across the bay and into the heart of San Francisco.\n\nUpon graduating, Leo was quickly recruited by a burgeoning food-tech startup. His talent for translating complex user needs into simple, beautiful interfaces saw him rise rapidly, and by 28, he was leading the UX design team. His work feels like a direct extension of his upbringing: making the digital experience of discovering and ordering food feel less like a transaction and more like a joyful, human connection.\n\nNow, Leo\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission District. He lives in a small but light-filled apartment off Valencia Street. His day begins with a pour-over coffee and a 2.8-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa office. Evenings are for unwinding with his partner Clara, an elementary school teacher who keeps him grounded, or exploring the neighborhood\u2019s culinary scene under the guise of \u201cmarket research.\u201d He cherishes the city\u2019s vibrant intersection of culture, art, and innovation. Leo\u2019s dream is to one day apply his design skills to a larger civic project, perhaps redesigning public transit interfaces\u2014a full-circle aspiration to bring the harmony he witnessed in Seoul to the city that shaped him."

His father leaned over her shoulder, not with advice, but with a laptop displaying a spreadsheet he\u2019d built to calculate the perfect brine salinity. Leo saw his parents\u2019 love language in that moment: his mother\u2019s artful tradition and his father\u2019s elegant system. It planted the seed that beauty and logic weren\u2019t opposites, but partners in creating something wonderful.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-two, hopelessly lost in Seoul Station, a wave of panic began to rise. Then he saw her: a grandmother, a *halmoni*, who approached a towering digital kiosk. With a few graceful, unhurried taps, her route lit up the screen in clean, intuitive lines. It wasn\u2019t just an interface; it was a quiet act of dignity, technology serving a person with respect. In that flash of clarity, Leo\u2019s career path was no longer a question. He knew he wanted to build that feeling of seamless grace.\n\n3.\nThe boxes were still stacked to the ceiling in his first Valencia Street apartment. He and Clara sat on the floor, sharing a super burrito from the corner taqueria under the light of a single bare bulb. The sounds of the Mission\u2014music from a passing car, distant laughter, the rumble of the 14 bus\u2014drifted through the open window. Looking at Clara, he felt a profound sense of peace. This wasn't just a new address; it was the moment San Francisco truly became his home.\n\n4.\nIt was 2 AM before a critical product launch. His team was exhausted. Leo presented his final design for the checkout flow\u2014it was minimal, but featured a small, delightful animation of a chef winking upon completion. The CEO, famously pragmatic, stared at it, silent. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he finally said. \u201cThat\u2019s the humanity we\u2019ve been missing.\u201d The validation was electric. It was the first time Leo\u2019s core belief\u2014that tech should feel human\u2014wasn\u2019t just accepted, but celebrated as essential.\n\n5.\nHis mind was a tangled mess of user flows and debugging reports after a brutal week. He was trying to explain the problem to Clara when she gently took his phone and set it aside. \u201cLeo, look,\u201d she said, pointing out their window. The fog had parted just enough for the setting sun to paint the sky over Twin Peaks in impossible shades of orange and pink. The sudden, quiet beauty instantly untangled his thoughts. It was a perfect, analog reminder of what he was working for."
