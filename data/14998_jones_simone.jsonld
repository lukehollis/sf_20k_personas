The daughter of an LA Metro bus driver and a hospital administrator, she grew up in the Crenshaw district, where she witnessed firsthand how transportation infrastructure could either connect or isolate a community. She saw her father\u2019s exhaustion after navigating routes often neglected by city planners and watched her neighbors struggle with long, multi-transfer commutes to reach better jobs. These early observations planted a seed: cities could be designed better, more equitably.\n\nThis conviction propelled her through her studies at UCLA and then north to UC Berkeley for her master's in Urban and Regional Planning, where she specialized in transportation systems. The Bay Area, with its complex web of BART, Muni, and ferries, felt like the ultimate laboratory. Upon graduating, Simone was hired by a municipal transportation agency in San Francisco, where she has meticulously worked her way up over the last decade.\n\nAs a Senior Transportation Planner, Simone\u2019s work is her mission. A key turning point was her successful campaign to reroute and increase the frequency of a bus line serving a low-income senior housing community in the Bayview, a project she fought for tirelessly after extensive community outreach.\n\nSimone lives her principles. She deliberately chose her apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood reborn after the removal of a freeway, making her 1.4-mile commute to her Civic Center office a short, reliable ride on the Muni Metro. Her weekends are spent exploring the city by foot and public transit, frequenting farmers' markets, jogging through the Panhandle, and meeting her tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of architects, non-profit leaders, and artists\u2014for drinks. Though she is professionally successful, her deepest aspiration is to see a San Francisco where a child's zip code doesn't determine their access to opportunity. Her ultimate goal is to lead a major city's planning department, tirelessly working to build the equitable, accessible home she always wished she\u2019d had."

He sighed, tapping a finger on a vast area between lines. \u201cDead zone,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice heavy with exhaustion. \u201cGood people just\u2026 stuck.\u201d In that moment, the tangle of freeways outside her window wasn't just noise; it was an injustice, deliberately built. She didn't know the term 'urban planning' yet, but in her gut, she knew she had to spend her life fixing that map.\n\n2.\nHer first month at Berkeley, she stood on a BART platform, mesmerized by the glowing system map. In Los Angeles, transit maps had always felt like diagrams of isolation and long waits. But this one\u2014with its intersecting lines of BART, Muni, and ferries\u2014was different. It felt like a complex, beating heart, a promise of connection. A thrill ran through her, a dawning realization that the Bay Area wasn't just a new city; it was the laboratory she had been searching for her entire life.\n\n3.\nYears ago, at a hostile meeting about the Bayview line, a city official dismissed her data. \"The numbers don't justify it,\" he\u2019d said coldly. Simone felt a familiar despair, the weight of bureaucracy. Then, an elderly woman in the back stood up. \"It's not about numbers, sir. It's about my grandkids, who I can\u2019t visit.\" Simone\u2019s despair turned to fire. She realized she wasn't fighting for metrics; she was fighting for that grandmother. It taught her that her real job was translating human dignity into policy.\n\n4.\nShe\u2019ll never forget the first morning the rerouted bus began its new service in the Bayview. Standing anonymously on a corner, she watched an elderly man with a cane get on the bus, nodding at the driver. It was a simple, everyday moment, but Simone felt tears welling up. All the brutal meetings and late nights had collapsed into this single, tangible outcome. For the first time, she hadn't just analyzed a system; she had bent it toward justice, connecting a life to a community.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, walking home, she paused in Patricia\u2019s Green. Children were playing where the Central Freeway once sliced the neighborhood in two. The sound wasn't of rumbling traffic, but of laughter. In that quiet moment, surrounded by life blooming in a space reclaimed for people, she felt a profound sense of peace. This was it. This was the equitable home she was fighting to build for everyone, and she was lucky enough to live inside a small piece of it."
