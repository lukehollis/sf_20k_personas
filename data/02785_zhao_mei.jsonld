The only child of immigrants from Guangdong, she grew up behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store. She watched the neighborhood change, seeing beloved family-run businesses get priced out and the delicate social fabric fray. This early lesson in urban dynamics, learned through observation and overheard anxieties, instilled in her a fierce desire to protect the city's human-scale fabric.\n\nThe 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was a defining moment for a teenaged Mei Lin. Witnessing the collapse of the Embarcadero Freeway and the subsequent community-led debates about the city\u2019s future ignited her passion. She saw how a city\u2019s bones could break and, more importantly, how its people could choose to rebuild them. This led her to a Master\u2019s in City & Regional Planning from UC Berkeley, believing that thoughtful policy could be a buttress against chaotic, inequitable change.\n\nHer career in the city government has been a slow, deliberate ascent. She wasn\u2019t a flashy disruptor but a patient advocate for livable density, green spaces, and historic preservation. A brief, intense marriage to an architect in her thirties ended amicably, leaving her with a renewed focus on her work and an elegant, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley\u2014a neighborhood whose rebirth she had a hand in planning.\n\nNow at 53, her life is woven into the city\u2019s grid. Her 0.0-mile commute allows for a ritualistic morning walk to a local cafe, where she observes the city\u2019s pulse before her day of virtual meetings and policy analysis begins. She maintains a tight circle of friends, mostly other long-time residents, and has a standing Sunday dim sum date with her aging mother.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s ambition is no longer about climbing the ladder, but about legacy. She dreams of a San Francisco that successfully balances innovation with affordability, a place where a new generation can have the same experience she did: finding a home and a purpose within its seven-by-seven-mile embrace. Her work is a quiet, daily fight to ensure the San Francisco of the future still has room for the corner stores and foggy avenues of its past."
