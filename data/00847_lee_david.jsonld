He was born and raised in the Outer Sunset, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling dry-cleaning business on Noriega Street. His childhood was a gentle rhythm of foggy mornings, the whir of pressing machines, and his parents' unwavering belief in education as the key to a life beyond their own toil. While his parents hoped for a doctor or an engineer, a family trip to Yosemite when David was ten became his defining moment. Standing beneath El Capitan, he felt an overwhelming sense of awe and a nascent, fierce desire to protect such places, a feeling his quiet, observant father encouraged.\n\nThis calling guided his educational path. He pursued Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara before earning a Master of Science in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. Initially, he worked for a large non-profit, but grew frustrated by the slow pace of change. He saw the tech industry, a monolith of consumption and energy use, not as an enemy, but as the most powerful lever for change. This insight became his career. David founded a boutique consultancy, working from his apartment to advise tech giants on reducing their carbon footprint, creating circular economies for hardware, and designing sustainable data centers.\n\nNow, at 37, David lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley, a deliberate choice for its village-like atmosphere and immediate access to Golden Gate Park. His 0.0-mile commute means his neighborhood is his world. His mornings start with a coffee from a cafe on Cole Street, followed by a run through the park's verdant trails\u2014his daily dose of the nature he works to preserve. His life is quiet but full. He maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and has a close bond with his younger sister, a corporate lawyer who lovingly teases him about his \"hippie-capitalist\" job.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to see his work create a measurable, global impact. He hopes to one day leverage his expertise on a project in Taiwan, connecting his professional mission with his ancestral roots. He is a man deeply rooted in the city that raised him, a quiet force working from within to steer its most dominant industry toward a more sustainable future."
