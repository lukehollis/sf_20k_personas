He was born and raised in the Outer Sunset, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling dry-cleaning business on Noriega Street. His childhood was a gentle rhythm of foggy mornings, the whir of pressing machines, and his parents' unwavering belief in education as the key to a life beyond their own toil. While his parents hoped for a doctor or an engineer, a family trip to Yosemite when David was ten became his defining moment. Standing beneath El Capitan, he felt an overwhelming sense of awe and a nascent, fierce desire to protect such places, a feeling his quiet, observant father encouraged.\n\nThis calling guided his educational path. He pursued Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara before earning a Master of Science in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. Initially, he worked for a large non-profit, but grew frustrated by the slow pace of change. He saw the tech industry, a monolith of consumption and energy use, not as an enemy, but as the most powerful lever for change. This insight became his career. David founded a boutique consultancy, working from his apartment to advise tech giants on reducing their carbon footprint, creating circular economies for hardware, and designing sustainable data centers.\n\nNow, at 37, David lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley, a deliberate choice for its village-like atmosphere and immediate access to Golden Gate Park. His 0.0-mile commute means his neighborhood is his world. His mornings start with a coffee from a cafe on Cole Street, followed by a run through the park's verdant trails\u2014his daily dose of the nature he works to preserve. His life is quiet but full. He maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and has a close bond with his younger sister, a corporate lawyer who lovingly teases him about his \"hippie-capitalist\" job.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to see his work create a measurable, global impact. He hopes to one day leverage his expertise on a project in Taiwan, connecting his professional mission with his ancestral roots. He is a man deeply rooted in the city that raised him, a quiet force working from within to steer its most dominant industry toward a more sustainable future."

            "value": "1.\nHe was ten, craning his neck back until it ached, the granite face of El Capitan seeming to swallow the sky. The air in Yosemite Valley was crisp and smelled of pine. He felt profoundly small. His father, a man of few words, simply placed a warm, firm hand on his shoulder. It wasn't praise or instruction, but a silent permission to feel the awe, to hold it. That feeling of shared reverence became the bedrock of his life\u2019s purpose, a quiet understanding that some things were worth protecting.\n\n2.\nHe was sixteen, the smell of steam and perchloroethylene thick in the air of the Noriega Street shop. His mother, her hands chapped and raw, was expertly folding a customer's shirt. She glanced at his own hands, clean and soft from schoolbooks, not machinery. \u201cYour hands are for different work,\u201d she said in Mandarin, her voice tired but resolute. The weight of her sacrifice landed on him then, not as a burden, but as a fuel. His work would honor hers by building a world cleaner than the one she toiled in.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-nine, he sat in a sterile non-profit conference room, discussing a fundraising plan that would take six months to approve. Through the window, a fleet of gleaming tech buses slid past. He felt a wave of impotence, then an electrifying clarity. He wasn't on the right battlefield. The power wasn't in petitions; it was in those data centers, in those supply chains. He resigned a week later. That moment of frustration solidified his conviction to work from within the beast, not lobby from the outside.\n\n4.\nThe ink on his first big contract was still drying when he met his sister for drinks. She raised her glass, a wry smile on her face. \"To David,\" she toasted, \"the hippie-capitalist who convinces billionaires to hug trees.\" He laughed, feeling a rush of warmth. In her teasing, he felt completely seen and understood\u2014the idealist and the pragmatist she knew him to be. Her acceptance gave him the confidence to own his unique, often misunderstood, career path without apology.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, after a brutal negotiation, he fled to Golden Gate Park. The fog was thick, muffling the city's noise, the air heavy with the scent of eucalyptus. On a trail near Stow Lake, he stopped, listening only to his own breathing and the drip of water from the leaves. This was it. This tangible peace was the very thing he fought for in abstract spreadsheets and boardrooms. The park wasn\u2019t an escape; it was a reaffirmation, the quiet, beating heart of his entire mission."
