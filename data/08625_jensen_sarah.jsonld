Raised in a quiet suburb of Minneapolis by a CPA father and a dental hygienist mother, her path seemed destined for stability, not SOMA lofts. The turning point came at sixteen, during a family trip to Chicago. Standing before a frenetic, vibrant Jean-Michel Basquiat painting at the Art Institute, she felt a switch flip inside her\u2014a magnetic pull towards a world of expression that felt more real than her own.\n\nThis epiphany charted a new course. She pursued Art History in college, disappointing her parents who had hoped for a law degree. She then moved west, earning a Master's in Curatorial Studies from the San Francisco Art Institute, drawn by the city\u2019s legacy of counter-culture and artistic innovation. Her early career was a grind of unpaid internships and low-level gallery assistant jobs, where she learned the industry not from textbooks but from hanging shows, wooing collectors, and comforting artists after brutal reviews.\n\nHer big break came when the aging owner of a small, respected gallery in Dogpatch, \"Vessel,\" saw Sarah\u2019s relentless passion. Rather than selling, she mentored Sarah, eventually financing a buyout that allowed Sarah to take over as director. This included the gallery\u2019s most unique feature: a spacious residential loft directly above the exhibition space.\n\nNow, at 39, Sarah\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. Her commute is a ten-second walk down a spiral staircase from her coffee maker to her desk. Her days are a blur of artist studio visits, curation planning, and hosting evening receptions where wine flows and conversations hum. Her social circle is a tight-knit web of the artists she represents, local collectors, and other Dogpatch business owners. She lives immersed in the art she champions.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; she rarely leaves her Dogpatch bubble, a neighborhood whose industrial-chic aesthetic mirrors her own. While proud of the gallery's stability, Sarah\u2019s dream is legacy: to discover and launch the career of a visionary artist who will one day hang in the same museums where her own love for art was born."
