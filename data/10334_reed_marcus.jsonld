His parents, a social worker and a retired postal worker, instilled in him a strong sense of community and the importance of giving back. Growing up, he witnessed the impact of systemic inequities firsthand, which fueled his passion for public health.\n\nExcelling in school, Marcus earned a scholarship to UC Berkeley, where he majored in Public Health. He was drawn to the intersection of health, education, and social justice, participating in student groups focused on health disparities and community organizing. After graduation, he pursued a Master\u2019s in Public Health at the same institution, focusing on program development and evaluation.\n\nHis career began at a non-profit in the Tenderloin, working directly with underserved populations. This hands-on experience solidified his understanding of the complex challenges facing vulnerable communities. A few years later, he joined a larger organization, eventually becoming a Program Manager for Community Health Initiatives. In this role, he designs and oversees programs aimed at improving health outcomes through interventions in schools, clinics, and community centers across San Francisco.\n\nA key turning point in Marcus\u2019s life was a grant he secured to fund a preventative health program for at-risk youth in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. Seeing the positive impact of this initiative solidified his commitment to working within the system to create meaningful change.\n\nMarcus is currently in a committed relationship with his partner, Javier, an urban planner. They share a mutual interest in building stronger, healthier communities. Marcus maintains close ties with his family in Oakland and has a supportive network of friends and colleagues. His daily routine involves taking BART or MUNI from the Mission Bay area to his office, often spending evenings at community meetings or local events.\n\nLiving in San Francisco offers Marcus proximity to his work and a constant reminder of the city\u2019s diverse needs. He appreciates the city\u2019s energy but is keenly aware of the widening wealth gap and its impact on health. His aspirations include expanding his current programs to reach more people and eventually advocating for policy changes that address the root causes of health inequities. Marcus dreams of a San Francisco where health is not a privilege, but a right for all residents."
