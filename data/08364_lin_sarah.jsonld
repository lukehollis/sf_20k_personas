The only child of pragmatic Taiwanese immigrants, she grew up in the shadow of Silicon Valley\u2019s ambition in Fremont. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, a pharmacist, envisioned a stable, lucrative future for her in medicine or law. But for Sarah, the sterile logic of code and chemistry held no magic. She found her language in the hushed halls of the de Young Museum on family trips, captivated by how color and form could communicate what words could not.\n\nDefying her parents\u2019 gentle but persistent expectations, she pursued Art History at UC Berkeley. It was a compromise\u2014academic, at least\u2014but it was her first step toward a life of her own making. To truly sever the provincial ties, she moved to New York for her Master\u2019s in Curatorial Studies at NYU, immersing herself in the city\u2019s relentless creative churn. She returned to San Francisco with a prestigious degree and a sharp, discerning eye.\n\nSarah initially followed the expected path, landing a coveted assistant curator position at SFMOMA. While she valued the experience, she grew frustrated by the institutional inertia and creative compromises. The turning point came during a studio visit with an undiscovered sculptor in the Dogpatch. The raw, unfiltered passion of the artist\u2019s space felt more vital than any boardroom meeting. Three months later, she resigned.\n\nNow, at 34, Sarah is a respected independent curator. Her zero-mile commute is a testament to her success; she lives and works out of a converted live/work loft in SoMa, its concrete floors and high ceilings serving as her office, library, and occasional impromptu showroom. Her days are a fluid mix of solitary research, grant writing, and biking to artist studios in the Mission and Bayview. Evenings are for gallery openings, where she moves with a quiet confidence, her connections her most valuable currency.\n\nHer dream is not to run a major museum, but to be a kingmaker for the underrepresented\u2014the queer painters, the immigrant ceramicists, the voices telling the city\u2019s real, unvarnished story. Sarah Lin found her place in San Francisco not by inheriting it, but by carefully, thoughtfully, and passionately curating it for herself and for the artists she champions."
