In 1979, his academic parents, fearing for their future, fled Iran, eventually settling in the bustling Iranian community of Los Angeles. Growing up, Ramin straddled two worlds: the sun-drenched Californian life outside and the rich, nostalgic world of Persian culture at home, where food was the primary language of love, memory, and community.\n\nThis deep-rooted connection to food as experience led him to pursue a Bachelor's in Hospitality Management. He started at the bottom, working his way through LA's top hotels, learning the brutal efficiency of a line cook and the graceful art of front-of-house management. His turning point came when he transitioned from managing single restaurants to overseeing food and beverage programs for luxury hotel groups. He discovered his true talent wasn't just in cooking, but in orchestrating the entire dining narrative.\n\nTen years ago, a lucrative offer brought him to the Bay Area: Director of Culinary Experience for a major Silicon Valley tech campus. He now masterminds a sprawling food empire, curating everything from Michelin-inspired executive dining to diverse food truck rodeos and artisanal coffee bars for thousands of employees. His days begin before dawn, catching the plush company shuttle from his quiet Inner Sunset home for the long ride south. The 34.5-mile commute is his time for quiet reflection, listening to podcasts on food history or calling his daughter, a university student in New York.\n\nAmicably divorced, Ramin lives a life of comfortable solitude. His home, filled with cookbooks and Persian art, overlooks a small garden. Though he\u2019s proud of his corporate success, his true dream is to open a small, modern Persian restaurant in Hayes Valley\u2014a place that tells the story of his family\u2019s journey, one plate at a time. For now, he finds solace in his routine, his weekend explorations of the Ferry Building marketplace, and the enduring belief that a well-crafted meal is one of life\u2019s most profound connections."

Maman Bozorg lets him press a single, precious saffron thread into a mound of glistening rice before it goes into the pot. Her hands, smelling of onion and turmeric, guide his. The world outside is a low hum of uncertainty, but in that sunlit kitchen, he understands that love isn\u2019t spoken; it\u2019s shared, seasoned, and served with care. This moment became the foundation of his entire philosophy on food and connection.\n\n2.\nHe was twenty-four, drowning on the saut\u00e9 station at a high-end LA hotel. The ticket printer was spitting a relentless stream of orders; a symphony of failure. Then, his manager pulled him aside to watch the front of house. He saw the graceful maitre d' conducting the dining room, a wave of calm in the chaos. He realized then he wasn't meant to fight fires in the weeds. He was meant to see the entire design, to conduct the performance. That night, he stopped wanting to be a great cook and started dreaming of being a great host.\n\n3.\nHis daughter, Soraya, maybe ten years old, stood on a stool in their first Bay Area kitchen. He was teaching her how to listen for the soft crackle of the tahdig, the secret sound that meant the rice was forming its perfect golden crust. When they successfully flipped the pot, her gasp of delight was pure magic. In her eyes, he didn't just see a child enjoying food; he saw his grandmother\u2019s legacy taking root in a new world, a connection that defied distance and time.\n\n4.\nOn his first pre-dawn shuttle ride to Silicon Valley, he felt like an imposter. Surrounded by sleeping engineers, the plush bus hummed with an alien efficiency. He looked at the dark silhouette of the mountains and felt a profound disconnect from the kitchen\u2019s familiar fire. In that silent, thirty-four-mile void, he realized the commute must become his sanctuary\u2014the only space he had left that was truly his own, separating the corporate director from the man who dreamt of saffron and sumac.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, wandering the Ferry Building on a Saturday. He watched a chef at a small food stall meticulously plate a dish, handing it directly to an eager customer. The transaction was intimate, immediate, full of shared joy. A painful clarity struck him: he managed a food empire for thousands he\u2019d never see. In that instant, his vague desire for a restaurant sharpened into a tangible need. It wouldn't just be about Persian food; it would be about reclaiming that direct, profound human connection."
