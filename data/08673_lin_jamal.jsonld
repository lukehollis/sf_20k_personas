At 31, he manages \"Artifact,\" a curated boutique specializing in independent designer goods and vintage vinyl, and his 0.0-mile commute is a short flight of stairs from his second-floor studio apartment. His life is a testament to plans derailed and rebuilt.\n\nThe son of a Black father from Alabama and a second-generation Chinese-American mother, Jamal grew up in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset. His childhood was a warm fusion of cultures\u2014gospel music and Cantonese pop, collard greens and congee. His parents, a Muni driver and a hospital administrator, preached the value of a steady path. Jamal listened, enrolling at San Francisco State University with a vague plan to study business.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. His mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and the family\u2019s finances, already stretched thin by the city\u2019s cost of living, became precarious. Without a second thought, Jamal dropped his classes to work full-time at a downtown retail chain, the weight of responsibility settling on his young shoulders. School became a distant memory, replaced by long hours, inventory counts, and the immediate need to contribute.\n\nHe discovered an unexpected talent for retail\u2014a sharp eye for merchandising and a calm, empathetic demeanor that made him a natural leader. After several years, the owner of Artifact, a retiring bohemian who frequented the chain store, was impressed by Jamal\u2019s skill and offered him the manager position and the coveted apartment above it.\n\nNow, Jamal\u2019s days are a steady rhythm. He wakes to the sounds of delivery trucks, shares a morning coffee with the barista next door, and spends his day advising customers and mentoring his small staff. His social life is woven into his work; he knows the other local shop owners and his most loyal customers by name. Though content, a quiet ambition simmers beneath the surface. He dreams of one day owning his own shop, a space that reflects his unique heritage. He wants to prove, mostly to himself, that the path he was forced onto was not a detour, but the foundation for a future he can build with his own two hands."
