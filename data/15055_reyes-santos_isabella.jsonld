The only child of Filipino immigrants who settled in Daly City in the late 1970s, she was raised on the values of hard work, community, and education as the ultimate path to stability. Her father worked as a mechanic for Muni and her mother as a certified nursing assistant at a Laguna Honda satellite clinic. The conscious hyphenation of her name was her own adult choice, a tribute to both family lines that sacrificed so much for her future.\n\nWhile a diligent student, Isabella\u2019s career path was cemented by personal experience. Witnessing a beloved uncle navigate the bewildering and often stigmatizing mental health system ignited her calling. She pursued her undergraduate degree at San Francisco State University before earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Her early career was a trial by fire in child protective services, a role that nearly burned her out but forged an unshakeable resilience.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade ago when she transitioned to a non-profit role, becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker embedded in the city\u2019s complex web of support services. Today, at 40, she is a vital link for at-risk youth, providing counseling and connecting them with resources. Her 3.1-mile commute on the 5R-Fulton bus takes her from her quiet, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond to her bustling office near Civic Center.\n\nIsabella\u2019s life is grounded in routine and connection. Weekday mornings are for strong coffee and a quick review of her caseload; evenings are often spent decompressing with a run through Golden Gate Park. Weekends are for the Clement Street Farmers' Market and dinners with her \u201cchosen family\u201d\u2014a tight-knit group of friends who are her true anchor. Having navigated the end of a long-term relationship in her late thirties, she finds fulfillment in her independence and deep platonic bonds.\n\nHer dream is no longer to single-handedly save the world, but to make it more manageable. She aspires to move into a supervisory role, mentoring the next generation of social workers. In the quiet moments, she dreams of one day buying a small condo, a tangible piece of the city she has dedicated her life to serving, a testament to the quiet, essential work that holds San Francisco together."

She watched her parents try to bridge the gap with food and gentle questions, their love met by a confusing wall of silence. In that stuffy, crowded living room, a quiet anger bloomed in her chest\u2014not at her uncle, but at the invisible illness that stole him. It was a silent vow: she would learn the language of that silence and find a way to be heard.\n\n2.\nOne AM, her CPS office smelled of stale coffee and desperation. She stared at a child's file, the photo of his wide, fearful eyes blurring with her own tears. The weight of the city\u2019s brokenness felt crushing, an impossible burden. She almost walked out forever. Instead, she closed the file, walked to the window, and watched the Muni buses snake below. She saw her father's work, her mother's care\u2014the city's pulse. It wasn't about saving everyone, but about showing up. This moment, at 26, forged resilience from near-despair.\n\n3.\nShe was 31, a year into her non-profit job. A teenager, who hadn't spoken more than a handful of words to her in weeks, finally looked up from his phone. He quietly mentioned a mentorship program she\u2019d told him about. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he shrugged, \u201cthat could be cool.\u201d It wasn't a breakthrough, just a tiny crack of light. But after the constant crises of CPS, this small, earned trust felt monumental. It solidified her new purpose: not to fight fires, but to build foundations, one quiet connection at a time.\n\n4.\nAt 38, her apartment felt cavernous after he left. One lonely Saturday, she impulsively laced up her sneakers and ran into Golden Gate Park. The fog was thick, swallowing the trees and muffling all sound except her own breathing and heartbeat. She didn't run from the grief but with it, until she was exhausted and calm. Standing by Stow Lake, breathing in the damp air, she felt not a void, but a quiet, powerful solitude. Her own anchor. This became her ritual, her way of coming home to herself.\n\n5.\nJust last month, at the Clement Street Farmers' Market, she stood with a bag of bok choy and a bouquet of sunflowers. The murmur of Cantonese and Russian mixed with the rumble of the 1-California bus. She watched the fog drift down the avenues and felt a deep, settled peace. This was her place. The feeling was so profound it made her dream of a small condo feel less like an ambition and more like a homecoming\u2014a tangible claim on the city she quietly served, every single day."
