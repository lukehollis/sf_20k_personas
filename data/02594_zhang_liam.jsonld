A native San Franciscan, he was raised by parents who emigrated from Guangzhou and poured their life savings into a small, bustling grocery store on Taraval Street. His childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the salty air of Ocean Beach, his backyard. It was there, watching plastic waste wash ashore with the tide and learning about the fragile coastal ecosystem, that the seeds of his future career were planted. This wasn't an abstract problem for him; it was a personal affront to the landscape that defined his youth.\n\nThis deep-seated passion guided his educational journey. After completing his undergraduate degree, he pursued a Master's in Environmental Science and Management from UC Berkeley. The turning point came during an internship where he analyzed the environmental impact reports for a major tech company. He realized he could effect more change from within the system, guiding corporations toward sustainability, than by protesting outside their gates. He secured a position as an Environmental Consultant, joining a professional services firm that allowed him to work fully remotely.\n\nNow, at 25, Liam\u2019s world is contained within the sleek, modern walls of his Hayes Valley apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his days start with fresh-ground coffee and a cascade of emails, his life a digital ecosystem of reports and remote meetings. To combat the isolation, he forces himself out for a midday run through the neighborhood\u2019s parklets or works from a local cafe. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of college friends, with whom he explores hiking trails in Marin on weekends or debates policy over craft beer in the Mission.\n\nLiam feels a profound, sometimes complicated, connection to his hometown. He has witnessed its relentless transformation firsthand. While he enjoys the vibrancy of his current life, he dreams of moving beyond consulting. His ultimate aspiration is to work in public policy for the city, shaping environmental regulations that protect the very shores where his journey began. For Liam, his career isn't just a job; it's a way to give back to the city that raised him, ensuring its natural beauty endures for generations to come."
