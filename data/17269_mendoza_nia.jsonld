Raised by a postal worker father and a teacher\u2019s aide mother, her childhood was rich in community but shadowed by the systemic inequities she sawaffecting her neighbors. The pivotal moment came at sixteen when her closest friend was lost to the juvenile justice system after a family crisis, a trauma Nia felt powerless to prevent. That feeling of helplessness ignited a quiet, fierce determination to understand and dismantle the forces that fracture families and communities.\n\nHer educational path was a direct line from that promise. She attended San Francisco State University for her undergraduate degree, immersing herself in the city's diverse social landscape. She then earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, graduating with a focus on youth and family services. She began her career in community mental health before finding her true niche as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for the San Francisco Unified School District. Today, she works at a high-need high school in the Mission District, providing counseling and connecting students and their families to critical resources.\n\nNia\u2019s daily life is a study in routine and purpose. She leaves her modest Inner Sunset apartment each morning, catching the N-Judah for the 4.8-mile commute. The rumble of the train is her time to mentally prepare for the emotionally demanding day ahead. Evenings are for decompressing: a long run through Golden Gate Park, browsing the shops on Irving Street, or cooking with her long-term partner, David, an urban planner. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees both its progressive ideals and its stark disparities every day.\n\nAt 39, Nia feels a sense of grounded accomplishment but yearns for broader impact. While she finds deep meaning in her one-on-one work with students, she dreams of moving into a policy-advising role within the district or starting a small private practice focused on serving adolescents of color. Her ultimate goal remains unchanged from her teenage years: to be the person she needed when she was young, a steady, skilled, and compassionate force for healing."

The judge\u2019s voice was a flat drone, sealing her best friend\u2019s fate with a gavel's crack. It wasn't just sadness Nia felt; it was a hot, suffocating powerlessness that churned in her stomach. In that sterile room, watching her friend\u2019s family crumble, a quiet vow was forged in her own grief. She would learn the systems that broke people. She would become the person who knew how to fight back, the person she so desperately needed in that moment.\n\n2.\nIt was a lecture at SF State, maybe her sophomore year. The professor projected a map of the city showing eviction rates overlaid with truancy data. Nia saw her West Oakland childhood and her new Mission District fieldwork merge into one stark, undeniable picture. The personal pain she knew now had a name: systemic inequity. It was a jolt of academic clarity that felt intensely personal. San Francisco wasn't just a place to live; it was the text, the problem, and the community she was destined to serve.\n\n3.\nShe still remembers the first time she saw a real, unguarded smile from a student named Carlos. He\u2019d been quiet and withdrawn, and after weeks of sessions, he finally told her about his family\u2019s housing crisis. Nia spent a frantic afternoon on the phone, eventually connecting them to a legal aid nonprofit that could help. Seeing him in the hallway a week later, joking with friends, felt like a profound victory. It was the first concrete proof that she could be the steady hand she'd always wanted to be.\n\n4.\nShe\u2019d come home from work a few years ago, completely gutted after a student\u2019s foster care placement had fallen through. She just sank onto the sofa in their Inner Sunset apartment, unable to speak. Her partner, David, didn\u2019t press. He just put on some music, poured her a glass of water, and started chopping vegetables for dinner. The steady, rhythmic sound of his knife on the cutting board was a wordless comfort, a grounding force that allowed her to absorb the day's pain without shattering.\n\n5.\nJust last month on the N-Judah, heading home past Dolores Park, she saw a former student. He was a young man now, laughing on his phone, looking happy and stable. A wave of deep, quiet pride washed over her. But it was quickly followed by a new restlessness. This one victory felt wonderful, but what about the hundreds of others? The thought of moving into policy, of fixing the cracks in the system for thousands of students at once, sparked with a new, urgent light."
