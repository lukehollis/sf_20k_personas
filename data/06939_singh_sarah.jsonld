The daughter of two restless literature professors, her childhood was a blur of Pacific Northwest college towns, each one left behind before she could grow roots. She arrived in San Francisco a decade ago, armed with an Art History degree from the University of Oregon and following her then-fianc\u00e9, Ravi Singh. Theirs was a young, idealistic marriage that crumbled under the pressures of a demanding city and divergent paths.\n\nThe divorce was a quiet devastation that forced Sarah to rebuild her life from scratch. Retaining her married name as a strange memento of the woman she used to be, she took a part-time admin job and began volunteering at a local community center to fill the empty hours. There, in the chaotic, joyful world of the center\u2019s preschool program, she found an unexpected calling. The abstract beauty of art history paled in comparison to the tangible wonder of helping a child learn to write their name.\n\nThis was her turning point. Sarah enrolled at SF State, earning her certificate in Early Childhood Education. She now teaches at \"Little Sprouts Academy,\" a small, play-based preschool just two blocks from her rent-controlled in-law apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk past her favorite bakery and the corner grocer, who always has a nod for her. Her days are a whirlwind of finger paints, story time, scraped knees, and the profound satisfaction of witnessing small minds blossom.\n\nHer social life is woven into her community; she\u2019s friends with fellow teachers and has formed genuine bonds with the parents of her students. Her connection to San Francisco isn't about the glamour or the tech booms; it's about the morning fog rolling over Golden Gate Park, the tight-knit network of neighbors, and the feeling of belonging she spent her whole childhood searching for. Her dream isn't grand\u2014perhaps one day she\u2019ll have the means to open her own small school right here in the neighborhood she finally calls home."
