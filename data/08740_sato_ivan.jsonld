A third-generation San Franciscan, Ivan grew up amidst the fog and the quiet diligence of his parents\u2019 small dry-cleaning shop in the Richmond District. He was a pensive child, more interested in sketching the city\u2019s architecture in his notebooks than in sports, a quiet dreamer in a pragmatic family.\n\nHis path was once aimed at San Francisco State\u2019s graphic design program, a brief, bright period of creative exploration that felt like a true beginning. But his trajectory was irrevocably altered when his mother was diagnosed with a degenerative illness. Ivan dropped out of college in his second year to help his stoic father manage the family business and provide care. The dream of a creative career was shelved indefinitely, replaced by the immediate, pressing needs of his family. He never went back.\n\nAfter his mother passed and his father sold the shop to retire, Ivan, then 30, was adrift. He sought stability over passion, landing the Facilities Coordinator role at The Marlowe, which offered a modest salary and, crucially, a small apartment. He became the building's quiet pulse, the one who knew the secrets of the ancient boiler and the rhythm of the old, rattling elevator. His commute is a simple walk down two flights of stairs.\n\nIvan's life is a routine of maintenance requests, inventory checks, and brief, polite interactions with the building\u2019s eclectic residents\u2014aging artists, service workers, and recent immigrants. He is respected for his competence but remains a mystery to most. His primary social connection is a shared nod with the projectionist at the single-screen revival cinema that occupies the ground floor.\n\nHe carries the ghost of his artistic ambitions. In his spartan apartment, late at night, he still fills sketchbooks, drawing not grand cityscapes but the weary faces of his neighbors and the beautiful decay of his building. His quiet dream is to one day weave these sketches into a graphic novel, a silent tribute to the unseen lives of San Francisco. He hopes to finally create something for himself, to prove the artist he once was is not entirely gone, just waiting."
