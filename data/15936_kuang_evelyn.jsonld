The daughter of hardworking immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the fog-laced avenues of the Sunset District. Her parents ran a bustling neighborhood bakery, a world of tangible things: flour, sugar, and the concrete weight of cash in the register. They urged her toward a stable career in finance, a path she dutifully began at UC Berkeley. However, a summer internship at a downtown investment bank felt hollow, a place where human potential was reduced to a number on a spreadsheet.\n\nThis was her first major turning point. Rebelling against her parents' pragmatism, Evelyn switched her focus to psychology, fascinated by workplace dynamics and the invisible forces that make or break a team. She earned her graduate degree in Organizational Psychology from San Francisco State University and entered the booming tech world of the late 90s as an HR manager. She had a front-row seat to the chaos: brilliant founders who couldn\u2019t manage people, toxic cultures masquerading as \u201chustle,\u201d and rampant burnout.\n\nHer second turning point came with the 2008 financial crash. Laid off from her corporate job, she saw an opportunity not for despair, but for reinvention. She leveraged her network and reputation, marketing herself as an independent leadership coach. She found her true calling not in enforcing policy, but in untangling the personal and professional knots of the city\u2019s top executives.\n\nNow, at 47, Evelyn lives a deliberately curated life in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. Her days begin with a walk to a local cafe, followed by client sessions, some conducted from her minimalist home office, others at their SoMa headquarters. Her 0.8-mile commute is a cherished ritual, a moment of mindfulness before diving into the complex psychologies of her clients. She is amicably divorced from a tech founder, a marriage that gave her firsthand insight into the exact imbalances she now helps others navigate. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends, with whom she shares dinners and trips to the SFJAZZ Center.\n\nEvelyn's connection to San Francisco is deep; she has witnessed its many transformations. Her future aspiration is to distill her knowledge into a book on empathetic leadership, hoping to scale her impact beyond one-on-one coaching and help build healthier, more humane organizations across the city she calls home."

Her father shows her how to count back change, his flour-dusted fingers pressing the cool, heavy coins into her palm. She\u2019s not focused on the math, but on the tired look in a customer's eyes and the silent, weary gratitude they exchange with her father. In that tiny space between their hands, she felt a complex, unspoken story. It taught her that every transaction held an invisible human weight.\n\n2.\nIt\u2019s 10 PM in the sterile, silent office of her downtown finance internship, circa 1996. Evelyn stares at a spreadsheet column justifying layoffs. These aren't just numbers; they represent mortgages, families, and sleepless nights. A profound and chilling hollowness washes over her. She realizes her parents' pragmatism had its limits, that she couldn't flatten human lives into data points. This moment of empathetic rebellion wasn't just a choice to switch her major; it was the foundation of her entire career.\n\n3.\nThe day she was laid off in 2008, she walked home from her SoMa office without a plan. The fog was rolling in, swallowing the tops of buildings, a familiar sight from her Sunset childhood. But instead of feeling lost, a surprising lightness bloomed in her chest. The corporate policies and toxic cultures had fallen away, leaving only her own reputation and skill. Standing at a crosswalk, she wasn't unemployed; she was untethered. It was the terrifying, exhilarating birth of her independence.\n\n4.\nAround 2012, she sat across the dining table from her tech founder husband. He was passionately sketching a new platform on a napkin, his eyes alight with vision. In that moment, she realized with a quiet sadness that he couldn't see her sitting right there. He wasn\u2019t her husband anymore; he was one of her clients\u2014a brilliant leader lost in his own creation. This personal failure became her greatest professional asset, granting her a layer of empathy that no textbook could ever provide.\n\n5.\nJust this morning, on her cherished walk to the Hayes Valley cafe. The aroma of roasting coffee, the rumble of an early MUNI bus, the distinct feeling of cool air on her skin. This short, mindful journey is the opposite of the dot-com chaos and the stifling corporate structures she escaped. She\u2019s no longer just observing the space between people; she is now the architect of her own. This daily ritual is a quiet, powerful confirmation that the deliberate life she built was the right one."
