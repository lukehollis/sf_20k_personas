The son of a practical accountant and a driven real estate agent from the Sacramento suburbs, David\u2019s upbringing was a comfortable blueprint for a life he never wanted. His parents envisioned a stable career in business or engineering, a path he dutifully started at Sacramento State. However, two years into a Business Administration degree, he felt like he was wearing an ill-fitting suit. The concepts were abstract, the ambition hollow. The turning point was a summer job at a community day camp, where the chaotic, sticky, brilliant energy of young children felt more real and vital than any spreadsheet.\n\nAt twenty-two, he dropped out of college, disappointing his parents, and moved to San Francisco not with a grand plan, but for the freedom of anonymity. He worked as a barista and a bookstore clerk before answering an ad for an assistant at Golden Gate Sprouts, a small, play-based preschool run out of a converted Victorian. He found his vocation. For the past fifteen years, David has been the calm, steady presence in a room full of toddler-sized tempests. He's the one who can soothe a tantrum with a quiet story or turn a pile of blocks into a fantastical city.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is literal; he rents the small in-law unit behind the main house, his front door just past the fuchsia bushes bordering the play yard. His life is a gentle rhythm: waking to the city\u2019s cool fog, spending his days with the children, and enjoying quiet evenings reading or walking through Golden Gate Park. His social circle is small but deep, consisting mainly of the school\u2019s director, Maria, who has become a mentor, and a few friends from a local book club.\n\nDavid\u2019s aspirations are as modest as his lifestyle. He has no desire to run a school or climb a career ladder. His dream is to simply continue. He\u2019s slowly taking Early Childhood Education classes at CCSF, hoping to one day become a lead teacher. In a city obsessed with growth and disruption, David Miller has found profound contentment in consistency, nurturing the small patch of the world entrusted to him each day."
