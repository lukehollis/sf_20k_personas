Raised in Daly City, his childhood home was a vibrant fusion of his mother\u2019s Filipino heritage and his father\u2019s Mexican-American roots, a place where the scents of adobo and carne asada were equally familiar. His mother, a registered nurse, and his father, a union carpenter, instilled in him a profound respect for hard work and community. While he appreciated their practical world, a high school field trip to SFMOMA ignited a different passion in him\u2014not for creating art, but for understanding the ecosystem that supports it.\n\nThis revelation led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a degree in Arts Administration. He envisioned a career supporting local artists, but post-graduation reality hit hard. He spent two years working for a small, underfunded gallery in the Mission, constantly fundraising and feeling the strain of financial instability. A turning point came when he saw a job listing for a Program Manager at a large tech company\u2019s philanthropic foundation. Seeing a chance to make a bigger impact (and a stable living), he applied and got the job. Now, he shepherds grant applications from arts nonprofits, acting as a crucial bridge between corporate wealth and grassroots culture.\n\nToday, Mateo lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, just a 2.5-mile MUNI ride from his downtown office. His days are a blend of spreadsheets and community outreach, but his evenings are for him. He might catch a performance at a small theater, try a new restaurant on Valencia Street with his close circle of college friends, or simply decompress with a book.\n\nHe feels a quiet responsibility in his role. He is acutely aware of being an insider in the tech world that has priced out so many creatives. His ultimate dream is to leverage his position to create a sustainable, tech-funded endowment for Bay Area arts, ensuring the culture that shaped him can thrive for generations to come. Mateo\u2019s life is a constant navigation between two worlds, driven by a deep-seated hope to channel resources back to the community that raised him."

It wasn\u2019t just dinner; it was a warm, unspoken treaty of cultures. In that steam-filled room, he learned that two different worlds could not only coexist but create something richer together. This became the foundation of his belief in fusion and community.\n\n2.\nHe was sixteen, standing before a vast, pulsating Rothko at SFMOMA. But it wasn't the art that captured him; it was the small brass plaque beside it: \u201cGift of...\u201d In that moment, the entire invisible scaffolding became visible. He saw that art didn\u2019t just appear; it was protected, funded, and championed. He didn\u2019t want to paint the canvas; he wanted to build the wall it hung on.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-four, he stood in the empty Mission gallery after a failed fundraiser. The artist, a woman who had poured her soul onto a dozen canvases, was quietly packing her things, her face a mask of disappointment. Mateo felt a hollow, helpless ache in his chest. He realized his passion wasn't enough to fight the tide of financial reality. That night, the weight of his idealism felt less like a calling and more like a crushing burden.\n\n4.\nHis first major grant approval was for a small, Excelsior-based dance collective. Seated in his sleek downtown office, a world away from his old life, he clicked \u201cApprove.\u201d A wave of profound, almost jarring, power washed over him. It wasn\u2019t ego, but the sudden, stark realization that he was no longer begging for scraps. He was now on the other side of the wall, controlling the flow of resources. The moment cemented both his purpose and his complicated position within the system.\n\n5.\nLast month, sitting in the back of a small Mission theater he\u2019d helped fund, he watched a young poet perform. Her words, full of fire and longing for a San Francisco that was fading, struck a chord deep within him. He was anonymous in the crowd, a man with a corporate email signature who had made this night possible. In that quiet moment of connection and distance, he felt the full weight of his responsibility, renewing his resolve to build something permanent."
