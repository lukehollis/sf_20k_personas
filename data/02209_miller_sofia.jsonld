Raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by a librarian mother and a union carpenter father, she inherited a dual appreciation for intellectual pursuits and tangible results. This led her to a Master's in Art History, a field of passion where she excelled at deconstructing complex visual systems. She arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn not by the burgeoning tech scene but by the city's vibrant counter-culture and art galleries, dreaming of a curatorial career.\n\nReality, however, required a steady paycheck. Sofia took a temp job as an office manager at a chaotic dot-com startup, intending it to be a brief detour. It became her calling. She discovered an innate talent for turning operational chaos into streamlined process, a skill surprisingly similar to organizing art movements by period and influence. Her calm demeanor and sharp intellect saw her rise quickly. She moved from project management to operations, proving that one didn't need a computer science degree to run a tech company effectively. This pivot from passion to profession was her life's key turning point.\n\nNow 48, Sofia is the Director of Operations for a successful software company, managing global teams entirely from her meticulously organized Cole Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute affords her a deliberate morning routine: a walk to Reverie Coffee for a latte, followed by a stroll through the Panhandle before her first Zoom call. Her days are a blur of spreadsheets and strategic planning. An amicable divorce in her late thirties left her fiercely independent, with a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and creatives from her weekly pottery class.\n\nSofia feels deeply connected to the tangible, neighborhood-focused side of San Francisco, a counterbalance to her digital career. While proud of her professional success, a quiet dream persists. She aspires to join the board of a local institution like the de Young Museum, finally merging her operational expertise with her first love, art. Her ultimate goal is to build a bridge between the two distinct halves of her life, proving that a path pragmatically chosen can still lead back to passion."
