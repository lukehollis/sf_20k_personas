Raised by a public-school teacher mother and a city transit operator father, she was instilled with a deep-seated belief in public service and the quiet dignity of a well-run system. A perpetually curious child, Nia wasn\u2019t just interested in what people did, but *why* they did it. This fascination with the mechanics of human choice led her to UC Berkeley, where Cognitive Science felt less like a major and more like an answer to a lifelong question.\n\nWhile many of her peers were drawn to the flashy appeal of consumer tech, Nia sought purpose. A pivotal internship with an ed-tech nonprofit, where she helped design learning modules for under-resourced schools, solidified her career path. She saw how thoughtful design could empower people, not just distract them. Now, as a UX Researcher, she applies this principle daily, working for a firm that develops intuitive digital tools to help people navigate complex healthcare and social assistance programs. Her work feels like a direct continuation of her parents\u2019 legacy, just through a different medium.\n\nNia\u2019s San Francisco is centered in the Inner Richmond. She consciously chose the neighborhood for its quieter, residential feel and its proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her mornings start with the rumble of the 38 Geary bus for her commute downtown. Her evenings are often spent jogging through the park\u2019s foggy trails or meeting her tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix from college and work\u2014for dim sum on Clement Street or exploring a new brewery in Bernal Heights.\n\nAt 24, Nia feels a sense of grounded optimism. She is building a life that aligns with her values. Her aspirations aren't tied to a specific title, but to impact. She dreams of leading a research team that develops technology to genuinely reduce systemic inequality in education or healthcare access. For Nia, San Francisco is more than just a place to work; it\u2019s a complex, challenging city she is determined to understand and improve, one user experience at a time."

He\u2019d point out regulars, explaining their routines with gentle familiarity. Nia didn\u2019t just see passengers; she saw a complex, moving ecosystem. That hum of the engine and the quiet dignity of her father\u2019s work wasn't just a ride, it was her first lesson in how systems serve people. It was the moment her curiosity about the \u201cwhy\u201d behind people's lives was truly born. (Around age 7)\n\n2.\nIt was in a stuffy lecture hall at Berkeley. The professor explained \"choice architecture\"\u2014how designing the context of a decision can guide someone toward a better outcome. For Nia, it was a revelation. It connected her father\u2019s bus route to her mother\u2019s classroom lesson plans. Suddenly, her innate curiosity had a name and a methodology. In that moment, she knew she wouldn't just observe the world; she would learn how to help design it for the better. (Sophomore year of college)\n\n3.\nDuring her ed-tech internship, she watched a shy seventh-grader navigate a new learning module she\u2019d helped design. The girl struggled with a math concept, then visibly straightened as the interactive tool clarified it. A small, proud smile flickered across her face. Nia felt a profound click inside her\u2014this was it. This was the tangible impact she craved. It cemented her path, proving that thoughtful design could be a quiet act of empowerment. (Summer after junior year)\n\n4.\nHer first weekend in the Inner Richmond, she went for a solo jog as the fog rolled into Golden Gate Park. The air was cool and smelled of eucalyptus. She ran past the Conservatory of Flowers, her breath pluming, the city's noise muted to a distant hum. It wasn't the chaotic San Francisco she\u2019d braced for; it was quiet and grounded. In that moment, surrounded by mist and cypress trees, she felt a profound sense of rightness. This was a city she could make her own. (Age 22)\n\n5.\nLast fall, she interviewed an elderly man who used her team\u2019s app to navigate his Medicare options. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be on the phone for days,\u201d he said, his voice thick with relief, \u201cbut it just\u2026 worked.\u201d The simplicity of his words hit Nia with force. This was the digital equivalent of her father getting someone to their doctor's appointment on time. It was the quiet dignity of a well-run system. Her work wasn't just a job; it was service.
