The only son of a university librarian and a history professor, his childhood was cataloged in books and structured by the academic calendar. He absorbed a deep appreciation for systems and the elegant architecture of information, which led him not to code, but to a Master's in Library and Information Science from the University of Michigan.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, not for the dot-com gold rush, but for a niche role organizing a digital archive for a university. However, the city had other plans. A fledgling startup, overwhelmed by user data, discovered his unique skill set. David found that structuring a chaotic database was not so different from cataloging a library\u2019s collection. He pivoted, his career ascending rapidly as he translated his principles of information science into the language of corporate data operations.\n\nHis personal life was similarly structured. For fifteen years, he shared a condo in NoPa with his partner, an architect. They built a comfortable life, their routines intertwined with the neighborhood. But where David found comfort in stability, his partner craved change. The separation five years ago was amicable but left David the sole occupant of a home built for two.\n\nNow, at 48, his world is contained within a few square blocks. His 0.0-mile commute ends at the desk in his spare bedroom, overlooking Masonic Avenue. His days are a predictable rhythm: a morning cortado from a cafe on Divisadero, hours managing global data streams via Slack and Zoom, and an evening run through the Panhandle. His connections are few but deep\u2014a small team he respects, a neighbor he shares weekly dinners with, and his sister back in Wisconsin.\n\nWhile professionally successful, David yearns for something more tangible. He dreams of leaving the corporate world to build a comprehensive, open-source digital archive for a small historical society, a project that would feel like coming home. He loves San Francisco for the life it has given him, but his ultimate aspiration is to apply his modern skills to preserve the past, finally closing the loop on a journey that began in his father\u2019s library."

His father shows him the microfiche reader, a clunky machine that makes history tangible. He watches a massive newspaper page shrink to a translucent slide, astonished by the elegant compression of information. It wasn't just data; it was magic, a sacred act of preservation. That feeling of wonder is the quiet hum beneath his corporate career, the true north he still longs to follow.\n\n2.\nIt was 2001, and the startup\u2019s conference room was a mess of panicked energy and whiteboard scrawl. The founder spoke of \"user churn\" and \"data chaos.\" But David, looking at the diagrams, saw the chaotic shelves of an uncatalogued collection. In that moment, he realized database architecture was just the Dewey Decimal System in a new language. This thrilling, disorienting discovery set his professional path, demonstrating how his niche skills had immense value in a world he never intended to join.\n\n3.\nHe and his partner were assembling a bookshelf, sometime around 2008. His partner, the architect, sketched a dynamic, asymmetrical design. David just wanted perfectly gridded, measured shelves. He remembers the patient, slightly sad smile his partner gave him when he pulled out a level to check the first board. In that small moment of loving conflict, he felt the divergence of their paths\u2014one bending towards artistic expression, the other cleaving to rigid, comfortable systems. The shelf, a compromise, still stands in their old living room.\n\n4.\nThe first morning alone, five years ago. He went to the cabinet for coffee, his hand hovering over the empty space where his partner\u2019s favorite ceramic mug used to be. The silence wasn\u2019t peaceful; it was a vacuum, an absence of a familiar system. The entire condo, once a shared space of intertwined routines, suddenly felt vast and uncatalogued. That morning, he understood the profound difference between solitude and loneliness, and began the quiet work of recalibrating a life built for two into one for himself.\n\n5.\nDuring an evening run last winter, the fog rolled into the Panhandle, thick and fast, swallowing the tops of the eucalyptus trees. The sound of traffic on Fell Street was muffled into a distant shush. For a moment, he wasn't a data manager or an ex-partner; he was just a solitary figure moving through a shifting, ethereal landscape. In that cool, damp silence, surrounded by the ghosts of trees, he felt a profound sense of peace. This quiet, moody beauty was the San Francisco he truly loved."
