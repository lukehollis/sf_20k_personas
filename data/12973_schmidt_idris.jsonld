Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving, progressive couple in Berkeley, his identity was shaped by the Bay Area\u2019s liberal values and his own quiet journey of self-discovery. His parents, a librarian and a high school history teacher, fostered in him a deep sense of social responsibility and a passion for understanding the systems that shape people's lives. This foundation naturally led him to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, where he felt an immediate calling to work with underserved youth.\n\nHis early career was spent in the trenches as a case manager, working directly with families navigating poverty, trauma, and housing insecurity. A key turning point came in his late twenties during a trip to Seoul. His search for his birth family was inconclusive, a disorienting experience that ultimately brought him profound clarity. He realized his true home and family were the ones he had built and chosen. This solidified his commitment to his work, shifting his focus from his own origin story to helping others write their own futures.\n\nNow 46, Idris is the Clinical Program Director for a non-profit that provides integrated educational and mental health services. His days are a blend of grant writing, staff supervision, and strategic planning. He leaves his quiet Inner Richmond apartment each morning, reads on the 38 Geary MUNI bus during his 2.8-mile commute, and steps into an office buzzing with purpose. His $125,000 salary affords him a stable, not lavish, life in a city he adores.\n\nEvenings are often spent cooking with his partner of twelve years, Mateo, a graphic designer, or decompressing with a long walk through Golden Gate Park. Idris feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014not by birth, but by decades of dedicated service. His dream isn't for wealth or status, but to secure enough funding to expand his organization's mentorship program. He aspires to create more threads of connection for the city's youth, mirroring the support system that allowed him to build a life of profound meaning."

His dad didn't probe, just put a warm hand on his shoulder. \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. In that quiet moment of shared appreciation, Idris learned his heritage wasn't a void to be filled, but a piece of history to be acknowledged. It wasn't about answers, but about respecting the question itself.\n\n2.\nHe was 25, a new case manager in a cramped SRO hotel room, sitting with a mother and her young son. The air was thick with desperation. He felt useless, armed only with forms against a system designed to fail them. The mother just looked at him and said, \"Thanks for listening, at least.\" That simple gratitude cut through his idealism. It taught him his job wasn't to perform miracles, but to show up and affirm someone\u2019s humanity within the chaos.\n\n3.\nAt 29, he stood on a street in Seoul, the door of the adoption agency closed behind him. The file was thin, the trail cold. He had expected devastation but instead felt a profound, unnerving calm. The great question mark of his origin had simply\u2026 dissolved. Walking through the city, he realized home wasn't a place he had to find, but the one he had already built. He flew back to San Francisco knowing exactly who his family was, freeing him to help others build theirs.\n\n4.\nHe was 38, home from a brutal day of budget cuts. He stood silently in the kitchen, exhausted, finely dicing garlic. Mateo came up beside him, not speaking, and simply started chopping an onion. The rhythmic *thump-thump* of their knives on the cutting board was a shared language of support. In that quiet act of making dinner together, Idris felt the deep peace of a partnership that didn't need to solve his problems, but simply shared the load. This was his sanctuary.\n\n5.\nJust last year, walking through the center, he saw one of the teens in their mentorship program helping a new middle schooler. Idris remembered that older boy as a terrified 8-year-old whose family he had worked with a decade prior. Seeing him now\u2014confident, kind, a leader\u2014wasn't a dramatic victory, but a quiet, powerful confirmation. It was the thread of connection made real. This was why he wrote grants until his eyes burned. It was the legacy he was building, one caring gesture at a time."
