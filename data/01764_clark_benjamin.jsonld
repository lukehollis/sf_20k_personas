Raised in a rambling Portland, Oregon home by two free-spirited ceramic artists, Ben\u2019s upbringing was a whirlwind of unstructured days, abstract conversations, and the constant, earthy smell of wet clay. While he loved his parents, he craved the certainty they eschewed, finding solace not in art but in the immutable laws of physics and chemistry. This drive for order led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s and then a Master\u2019s degree in Chemical Engineering from Stanford, where he excelled at transforming theoretical concepts into scalable, real-world systems.\n\nHis early career was a classic Silicon Valley grind: long commutes from a sterile apartment to a sprawling tech campus where he developed manufacturing processes for next-generation microchips. He was successful, climbing the ladder to Senior Process Development Engineer, but the life felt disconnected. The true turning point was the mandated shift to remote work in 2020. Liberated from his commute, Ben sold his car and moved into a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond.\n\nNow, his 0.0-mile commute means his life is rooted in his neighborhood. His day begins not with traffic but with a precisely timed pour-over coffee routine before he logs into his home office. Work is a focused block of virtual meetings and data analysis, optimizing systems for a factory thousands of miles away. Afternoons are for clearing his head with a run through Golden Gate Park, his route as consistent as his code. He has a small, close circle of friends from grad school and a former rock-climbing gym, preferring deep conversation over loud bars.\n\nBen\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of quiet appreciation. He loves the city's inherent systems\u2014the grid of the avenues, the schedule of the Muni lines\u2014and the easy access to nature. His evenings are often spent on his personal passion: restoring vintage radios, a hobby that perfectly merges his engineering mind with a tangible, almost artistic, outcome. He dreams not of career disruption but of personal integration: finding a partner who appreciates his structured world and finally achieving a life that is as elegantly optimized for happiness as the processes he designs at work."
