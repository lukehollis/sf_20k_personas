Raised in West Oakland by a nurse\u2019s aide mother and a career Muni driver father, his childhood was a blend of grit and grace. His family couldn\u2019t afford luxuries, but they gifted him an appreciation for culture through free museum days and the vibrant gospel choir at their church. This early exposure to art and performance planted a seed he wouldn't recognize until much later.\n\nHe crossed the bridge for college, enrolling at City College of San Francisco with a vague idea of studying business. The coursework felt sterile, disconnected from the living, breathing city around him. To pay for his books, he took a job as a busser at a bustling Hayes Valley restaurant. It was there, amidst the clatter of plates and the orchestrated chaos of service, that Daniel found his calling. He realized a restaurant wasn't a business; it was a theater, and he had a natural talent for directing the show.\n\nDropping out of college was a difficult decision but a necessary turning point. He committed himself to hospitality, working his way up from server to shift lead, absorbing every lesson in inventory, staffing, and customer connection. His big break came when he landed an assistant manager position at the restaurant inside a prominent SoMa arts institution. Here, his two worlds converged: the meticulous craft of dining service and the inspiring energy of the art world.\n\nNow 36 and the full-time Restaurant Manager, Daniel lives in a small apartment just three blocks from work, making his commute a pleasant walk. His days are long, starting with inventory checks and ending after the last dessert is served. His staff is his second family, a diverse crew he mentors with patient authority. Though single, his life is full, built around industry friendships and quiet moments in a local coffee shop on his afternoons off. Daniel\u2019s dream is to one day open his own place: a small, intimate restaurant in the Fillmore, celebrating Black chefs and showcasing local artists on its walls\u2014a full-circle return to the community and culture that shaped him."
