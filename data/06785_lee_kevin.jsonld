Born and raised in Daly City, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small but beloved boba shop, Kevin was instilled with a quiet work ethic. His parents, pragmatic and weary from decades of standing behind a counter, hoped he would pursue a stable career in engineering or finance. Kevin, however, was a romantic, lost in the intricate worlds of novels. He defied their expectations and enrolled at SF State, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature, a degree that felt both like a personal triumph and a familial disappointment.\n\nThe turning point came with brutal swiftness during his final semester. His mother was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. Suddenly, the abstract themes of his literary studies felt hollow. The real, raw story was unfolding in the sterile corridors of the UCSF Medical Center. He spent his days and nights there, mesmerized not by prose, but by the precise language of oncology reports and the quiet dedication of the research teams.\n\nAfter his mother passed away, Kevin\u2019s path became clear. Lacking the prerequisites for medical school, he took the most direct route into the world that had consumed his life: he became a research assistant. He found a job in a UCSF oncology lab\u2014the same hospital, a different building\u2014and moved into a small, rent-controlled studio in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a function of necessity and design; his life intentionally orbits the institution that holds his focus.\n\nHis days are a meticulous routine of cell cultures and data entry, a stark contrast to his former life of literary analysis. Yet, he finds a similar pattern-seeking satisfaction in the work. He\u2019s quiet, keeping mostly to himself, his social life limited to polite nods with neighbors and occasional lunch with lab mates. Evenings are for runs in Golden Gate Park, the fog a familiar blanket, or reading\u2014though now he gravitates towards scientific journals. Kevin harbors a focused aspiration: to save enough and take prerequisite courses to eventually pursue a graduate degree in genetic counseling. He dreams not of wealth, but of being the person who can translate the cold, complex science into a compassionate, coherent story for families thrust into the same chaos his once was."
