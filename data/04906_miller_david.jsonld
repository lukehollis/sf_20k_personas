Raised in a quiet suburb of Chicago by an engineer father and a librarian mother, he was taught the value of systems and stories. This dual influence led him not to code, but to a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. He arrived in the Bay Area in the late 90s, brimming with idealistic visions of designing equitable, beautiful public spaces.\n\nHis turning point came after five years working for a regional planning agency. Buried in bureaucratic red tape and disillusioned by the slow pace of change, he watched as the dot-com boom reshaped the very city he was trying to improve. A friend from Berkeley, already thriving in the tech world, showed him how his skill for analyzing complex systems could be applied to business. With student loans still looming and a growing frustration, David made the leap into management consulting.\n\nThe shift was lucrative but costly. His intense focus on climbing the corporate ladder contributed to the amicable but painful end of his marriage in his late thirties. He poured himself into his work, becoming a sought-after consultant who could streamline chaotic startups and optimize inefficient corporate giants.\n\nNow, at 52, David\u2019s world is contained within the floor-to-ceiling windows of his minimalist SoMa condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to his home office. His days are a blur of Zoom calls, data analysis, and precisely timed breaks for an espresso or a run along the Embarcadero. He appreciates San Francisco from a distance\u2014the view of the Bay Bridge, the efficiency of ordering from high-end restaurants, the proximity to the airport.\n\nThough financially secure, David feels a quiet yearning for the tangible impact he once dreamed of. His hope is to pivot one last time, perhaps using his capital and expertise to advise civic tech non-profits. He aspires to reconnect with the young idealist who came to build a better city, hoping to finally merge the system with the story."

It was a tangible mix of activism, academics, and life, and he felt he was right at its center. This wasn't just studying a city; it was living inside a complex organism he was learning to heal and improve. That feeling\u2014of being part of a living system he could shape for the better\u2014was the purest sense of purpose he had ever known, a warmth he would chase for decades. This was in 1997.\n\n2.\nThe weight of the rejected proposal felt heavier than its 50 pages. It was for a small pocket park in the East Bay, full of native plants and smart drainage. \"Budgetary constraints,\" the memo read, the same reason as the year before. He looked out the gray municipal building window at the bustling street below, feeling utterly disconnected from the city he was meant to serve. For the first time, he wondered if his blueprints were just elaborate, useless stories he was telling himself. This was in the early 2000s.\n\n3.\nHis friend sketched a flowchart on a cocktail napkin in a loud SoMa bar. \"It's the same thing, Dave. You analyze complex systems. We just call it a 'market' instead of a 'city,'\" he\u2019d yelled over the music. David saw the clean lines, the clear inputs and predictable outputs. It was a system he could *solve*. In that moment, the messy, human complexity he once cherished suddenly felt like a liability, and the seductive logic of the flowchart felt like a rescue. The pivot began then, in 2003.\n\n4.\nHe remembers standing in the empty doorway of their Oakland apartment, handing Sarah the last box\u2014her books. \"Take care of yourself, David,\" she'd said, her voice gentle, not angry. The click of the door closing was the quietest, most definitive sound he'd ever heard. He had optimized his career, his schedule, his entire life, and he had successfully streamlined her right out of it. The ensuing silence was the first invoice for his success. He was 38.\n\n5.\nOn his evening run, he paused along the Embarcadero, the Bay Bridge a perfect, glittering structure in the twilight. He appreciated its elegant engineering, a flawless system seen from a distance. But he felt no connection to the millions of lives it carried. The feeling was sharp and hollow: a sudden, powerful yearning not to admire the city from his pristine condo, but to get his hands dirty again, to find a broken piece somewhere inside it and finally try to make it whole. This was last week."
