Raised in the fog-drenched avenues of the Outer Richmond, Meilin grew up navigating two worlds\u2014her mother\u2019s insistence on practicality and her father\u2019s passion for art and beauty. She chose her father\u2019s world, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History from San Francisco State University, dreaming of a life spent in the quiet, hallowed halls of a museum.\n\nThe reality of the city's cost of living and a scarcity of curatorial jobs led her down a more practical path. A temporary role as a receptionist at a fledgling tech startup during the first dot-com boom revealed an unexpected talent: she was exceptionally good at creating order out of chaos. While engineers and founders chased ephemeral ideas, Meilin built the systems that allowed them to function. For over two decades, she has been the stable, administrative backbone for a series of tech companies, a quiet constant in a volatile industry.\n\nA long-term relationship in her thirties with a charismatic founder ended when his company went public, leaving her valuing stability over volatile ambition. Now, at 44, Meilin lives alone in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in NOPA, a sanctuary filled with art prints and overflowing bookshelves. Her commute is a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her desk. Her world has become hyperlocal; she knows the baristas at her corner coffee shop by name and finds solace in long, aimless walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nMeilin\u2019s social life is a small, tight circle of old friends who knew her before tech became her life. She is the anchor of her friend group, the one who remembers every birthday. Her dreams are no longer of professional accolades but of personal fulfillment. She saves meticulously for a trip to see the masterpieces in the Louvre her father always described, and perhaps to visit her mother's ancestral village. Meilin Moreau may be an assistant on paper, but in her own life, she is the curator of a quiet, meaningful existence she has carefully built for herself."
