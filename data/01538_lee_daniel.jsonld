Raised in a working-class Bay Area suburb, Daniel was the family\u2019s soft-spoken mediator, learning early to read the unspoken tensions between his well-meaning but stressed parents. He saw how much went unsaid and developed a deep-seated desire to give voice to those hidden struggles. This innate empathy guided him to San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree in psychology, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, where he focused on community mental health.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire. Daniel worked for a prominent city non-profit, managing a heavy caseload of clients facing housing insecurity, addiction, and severe trauma. While the work was deeply fulfilling, the relentless demand and emotional weight led to significant burnout by his early thirties. This was his critical turning point. Recognizing he couldn't effectively help others if he was depleted himself, he made the daunting decision to leave the agency and slowly build his own private practice.\n\nNow 38, Daniel runs his practice entirely from a dedicated office in his Inner Sunset apartment, a reality that explains his zero-mile commute. He shares his life and home with his partner of eight years, Alex, a landscape architect whose calming presence is his anchor. His days are structured around telehealth sessions, where he provides a steady, compassionate space for his clients. To decompress from the intense emotional labor, Daniel relies on a strict routine: morning runs in Golden Gate Park, a hard stop to his workday at 6 PM, and evenings spent cooking with Alex or meeting a small circle of close friends.\n\nDaniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in its blend of natural beauty and human complexity. He sees the city\u2019s struggles mirrored in his clients' lives but also finds hope in its resilience. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or recognition, but of sustainability\u2014to continue his vital work without sacrificing his own well-being. He aspires to one day form a small group practice, mentoring new therapists and fostering a community of care that can better serve the city he calls home."
