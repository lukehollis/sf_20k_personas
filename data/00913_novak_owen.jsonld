Raised in the manicured calm of Tiburon, he was the only child of a reserved architect father and a socially meticulous mother. The Novak household was a masterpiece of clean lines and unspoken tensions, where achievement was praised and feelings were a private, almost shameful, affair. Owen learned early to become a keen observer, decoding the subtle shifts in tone and body language that betrayed the placid surface of his family life. This unsolicited training in emotional forensics would, ironically, become his calling.\n\nHe entered UC Santa Cruz as a pre-law student, a path chosen to satisfy his parents\u2019 desire for a prestigious career. However, a single elective course, \"Psychology of Interpersonal Relationships,\" felt like a key turning a lock he didn't know existed. It gave a name and a framework to the invisible dynamics he'd navigated his whole life. He switched his major, a decision met with polite confusion at home, and felt for the first time that he was walking his own path. After graduating, he enrolled directly in a Master\u2019s program in Counseling Psychology at the University of San Francisco, eager to translate theory into practice.\n\nNow 25, Owen is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist, working towards his 3,000 hours for full licensure. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bed to the carefully arranged corner of his Inner Sunset apartment that serves as his office. His days are a disciplined rotation of back-to-back telehealth sessions, guiding clients through the very emotional tangles he was taught to ignore. After work, he decompressess with long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park, the fog a welcome cloak for thought.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting mainly of a few friends from his graduate cohort who understand the unique toll of their work. He longs for a romantic partnership but finds it difficult to switch off his analytical brain on dates. Owen\u2019s ambition isn't for wealth, but for mastery. He dreams of one day opening a small, sliding-scale private practice in the city, helping young adults navigate the anxieties of modern life. For Owen, living and working in San Francisco is about building a life founded on genuine connection, a direct and healing antithesis to the beautiful, empty rooms of his past."
