The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in a cramped, rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond District. Her father worked grueling hours as a line cook in Chinatown, and her mother was a seamstress in a small garment factory South of Market. Mei witnessed their daily struggle against the city's rising costs and unforgiving transit system. This constant, quiet battle for dignity in an ever-more-expensive landscape planted the seed of her life's work. She didn\u2019t want to escape the city; she wanted to fix it.\n\nAfter earning her Bachelor\u2019s from UC Berkeley, she pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, driven by a desire to shape cities for the people, not just for profit. Returning to San Francisco, she took an entry-level position with the Planning Department. For over two decades, she has been a steady, pragmatic force within the city government, rising to the rank of Senior City Planner. Her proudest achievement was a hard-won battle to rezone a swath of industrial land for a mixed-income housing development with a large, dedicated community park\u2014a project born from memories of her own concrete childhood.\n\nNow 47, Mei lives a life of curated order in a modern Hayes Valley condo, a stone's throw from City Hall. Her \"0.0 mile commute\" is a testament to her hybrid work schedule; she spends mornings in deep focus at her meticulously organized home office, and afternoons walking to City Hall for public hearings. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, leaving her with a quiet independence she has come to cherish. Her social life revolves around a small circle of professional colleagues and her weekly visits to her retired parents in Daly City.\n\nMei\u2019s hope for the future is not personal ambition, but municipal legacy. She dreams of seeing the city implement a comprehensive public housing plan she has been championing for years, one that could give a new generation of families the stability her own parents fought so hard for. Every morning, with a cup of oolong tea, she looks out her window not just at the buildings, but at the complex, living system she has dedicated her life to improving, one zone, one permit, one policy at a time."

Her mother, smelling of starch and fabric, would pull Mei\u2019s collar tighter against the damp. The bus would finally arrive, crowded and groaning. Seeing her mother\u2019s shoulders slump with exhaustion planted a seed not of anger, but of a quiet, fierce determination. She didn't just want a car; she wanted a system that was kinder to her mother, a city that didn't demand such a high price for a simple ride home.\n\n2.  \nShe was 20, sitting in a lecture hall at UC Berkeley. The professor projected a slide showing historical redlining maps of San Francisco. Suddenly, her family\u2019s story wasn\u2019t just personal hardship; it was policy. It had a name, a history, a structure. The feeling was a cold rush of validation, solidifying her path. She wasn\u2019t just fighting a pervasive feeling anymore; she was armed with knowledge, ready to dismantle the very architecture of inequity she could now see so clearly on the map.\n\n3.  \nThe week after the Bayview rezoning vote passed, she stood alone on the cracked asphalt lot. It was just weeds and concrete, but in her mind, she saw it all: the low-rise apartments, the playground where a child like her might run, the community garden. Tears pricked her eyes\u2014not of joy, but of profound relief. All the contentious hearings and late nights had coalesced into this silent, hopeful space. It was the proudest, most tangible \u201cyes\u201d of her career, a promise made real.\n\n4.  \nShe was 42. The first Saturday in her Hayes Valley condo felt cavernously silent after he left. She made her oolong tea, sat by the large window, and watched the city wake up. The silence wasn\u2019t lonely; it was clean. It was a blank page. In that quiet moment, surrounded by her own meticulously arranged books and plans, she realized her life wasn't empty. It was simply, finally, entirely her own. Independence became not a circumstance, but a cherished, orderly state of being.\n\n5.  \nLast Sunday, in her parents\u2019 warm Daly City kitchen, she peeled an orange for her father, splitting the segments perfectly, just as he used to do for her. He took it with a soft nod, his hands worn from decades in a commercial kitchen. In this simple, weekly ritual, she feels the full circle of her life's work. It's not about grand policy speeches, but this: the quiet dignity and comfort her parents now have. It\u2019s the small, tangible result of their struggle, and her motivation to keep fighting."
