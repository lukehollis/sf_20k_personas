Raised in a small Ohio town by a well-meaning but emotionally reserved father and an anxious mother, Susan grew adept at sensing the unspoken currents in a room. She fled to California for college, seeking sunshine and a place where feelings could be expressed more openly. She landed at UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work, drawn to the Bay Area\u2019s vibrant, progressive energy.\n\nHer career was forged in the crucible of 1990s San Francisco healthcare, during the height of the AIDS crisis. As a young social worker at SF General, she provided counseling and coordinated care for patients facing unimaginable loss and stigma. This experience solidified her professional calling, teaching her resilience and the profound importance of bearing witness to another's pain. It was during this time she met her ex-husband, a journalist. They built a life together, had a son, and eventually divorced amicably a decade ago, remaining friends bonded by their shared history.\n\nNow, at 54, Susan\u2019s life is anchored in her meticulously kept Edwardian flat in Cole Valley, where a converted front parlor serves as her private practice office. Her 0.0-mile commute is a cherished luxury. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: an early morning walk through the misty trails of Sutro Forest, followed by back-to-back telehealth and in-person sessions with clients grappling with anxiety, grief, and life transitions. She is a long-standing fixture in her neighborhood, known by the baristas at her local cafe and the owner of the corner market.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014other therapists, an artist, a retired nurse\u2014with whom she shares dinners and gallery visits. Her son, now a graphic designer in Los Angeles, is a source of immense pride. Looking forward, Susan doesn't dream of grand reinvention but of deepening her impact. She hopes to begin supervising and mentoring newly licensed therapists, passing on the wisdom she has gathered over a lifetime of listening."

He didn't mention the lesions or the pain, only the way the fog rolled over Twin Peaks. Susan\u2019s own grief was a sealed vault. Bearing witness, she realized, was not about fixing but holding; a profound, quiet act of service. This moment forged the compassionate steel at the core of her professional identity.\n\n2.\nHer son, then seven years old and sitting on their living room rug, once asked, \u201cMom, does your job make people stop being sad?\u201d She remembers kneeling beside him, the scent of his shampoo in the air, and replying, \u201cNo, sweetie. I just sit with them so they aren\u2019t sad all by themselves.\u201d This simple exchange clarified her life's calling more than any textbook. It was a touchstone of purpose she returned to for decades, grounding her work in the pure truth of human presence.\n\n3.\nThe day she and her ex-husband divided their book collection, about a decade ago. There was no anger, just the quiet rustle of paper in their Sunset district home. He passed her a worn paperback they had both loved, saying, \u201cYou keep this one.\u201d In that moment of shared, gentle grief, she understood that love could change forms without shattering. This belief in graceful transitions became a cornerstone of her practice, offering clients a model for respectful endings and reconfigured relationships.\n\n4.\nHer first walk through UC Berkeley\u2019s campus as a graduate student. Coming from Ohio, the sheer chaotic energy\u2014the protests, the music, the smell of eucalyptus\u2014was intoxicating. No one was trying to read the unspoken currents in the room; everything was spoken, shouted, and sung out loud. It was a dizzying, liberating feeling of anonymity and permission. This was the moment she knew she could finally breathe, that she had found a place big enough to hold all the feelings she had learned to contain.\n\n5.\nThe morning of her very first client session in her new Cole Valley private practice. After her walk in Sutro Forest, she simply closed the door between her living space and the front parlor office. The quiet click of the latch felt monumental. A commute of zero miles. That sound represented a hard-won integration of her life and her work, a sustainable peace she had built for herself. It was not an escape, but a true arrival into a life that finally, completely, fit her."
