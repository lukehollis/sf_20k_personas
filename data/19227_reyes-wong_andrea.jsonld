Born in the Richmond District, she was raised in a home filled with the aromas of both her father's Cantonese cooking and her second-generation Filipina mother's adobo. Her father, a stoic but devoted accountant, and her mother, a gregarious nurse, instilled in her a dual appreciation for meticulous precision and compassionate care\u2014traits that would come to define her career.\n\nHer path was pragmatic. Andrea pursued a Biology degree at San Francisco State University, fascinated by the elegant logic of cellular systems but keenly aware of the need for a stable career. She began as a clinical research associate at a burgeoning biotech firm. A key turning point came not in a lab discovery, but in a moment of organizational chaos. Andrea realized her true talent wasn't wielding a pipette, but in orchestrating the complex ballet of a multi-site clinical trial. Her calm authority and meticulous planning skills were noticed, and she began a steady ascent through the ranks of operations management.\n\nAt 49, Andrea is a Director of Clinical Research Operations in Mission Bay, a position of immense responsibility that she carries with understated confidence. Her life is a rhythm of purpose and peace. Her commute is a cherished buffer: a 6.5-mile MUNI ride from her Noe Valley home, where she listens to podcasts or simply watches the city wake up. She and her husband, David Wong, a landscape architect she met through a college friend, are new empty-nesters. Their daughter, Maya, is a freshman at UC San Diego, and their video calls are a treasured part of Andrea\u2019s week.\n\nAs a lifelong San Franciscan, Andrea feels a deep, complicated love for the city. She remembers a quieter, grittier version but embraces the innovation that fuels her work. Having achieved her professional goals, her aspirations have shifted. She dreams of mentoring more young women of color in STEM, ensuring the next generation has the guidance she had to forge for herself. Her future isn't about climbing higher, but about deepening her roots and legacy within the city that has always been her home."

From the stovetop, the sharp, vinegary scent of her mother's adobo bubbles, a warm and inviting promise. At the counter, her father stands, his cleaver a rhythmic, percussive beat against the cutting board, dicing ginger with intense focus. In that moment, she feels the two halves of her world in perfect harmony: her mother's boisterous care and her father's quiet precision. This balance becomes the unconscious blueprint for her own life. This memory is from around 1983.\n\n2.\nIt was 1998, well past midnight at the biotech startup. A critical sample shipment was lost, and panic was setting in. While others wrung their hands, Andrea felt a strange calm. She grabbed a marker, commandeered a whiteboard, and began mapping logistics, making calls, creating a recovery plan. Her boss watched, stunned. For Andrea, it wasn't a choice, but an instinct. In the quiet hum of the servers, she realized she didn't just want to be part of the science; she was born to conduct it. It was the true beginning of her career.\n\n3.\nShe remembers the exact moment she fell for David. It was a windswept afternoon near Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park, shortly after they met in the mid-90s. He wasn't looking at her, but at an ancient cypress tree, explaining how its desperate lean toward the light defined its entire structure. She was captivated. Here was a man who saw the world not just for its beauty, but for the elegant logic beneath it. It was a familiar language, a different kind of science that she instantly understood and loved.\n\n4.\nMaya must have been seven, her small hand lost in Andrea\u2019s as they fought to get a kite airborne at Crissy Field. The wind was relentless, whipping their hair and threatening to steal the kite before it could fly. Then, a perfect gust caught it, and it soared, a tiny red diamond against the towering backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge. Maya\u2019s shriek of pure delight echoed over the bay. For Andrea, it was a moment of perfect San Francisco happiness, solidifying her resolve to build a life of stability and joy here for her daughter.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on her MUNI commute to Mission Bay. The train rumbled through the Mission, and Andrea looked up from her phone. She saw a young woman, likely a UCSF student, highlighting a dense biology textbook with fierce concentration. Andrea recognized the look\u2014the mix of ambition and anxiety. But instead of seeing her past, she saw her purpose. A profound peace settled over her. The climb was over. Now, her work was to turn around and offer a hand to the next woman on her way up."
