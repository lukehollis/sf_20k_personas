Born in San Francisco to an Irish-American Navy longshoreman and a Filipina immigrant he met at Subic Bay, David\u2019s identity has always been a blend of cultures, a fusion he carries with a gentle stoicism. He grew up in the fog-laced streets of the Outer Richmond, where his father taught him the difference between a Phillips and a flathead before he could properly ride a bike. These early lessons in practical mechanics became the foundation of his life.\n\nHe gave college a shot, enrolling at CCSF with a vague notion of studying engineering tech, but the abstract world of academic theory never clicked like the tangible reality of a stripped gear or a faulty circuit. The true turning point came when his father\u2019s health declined. David left his studies without a second thought, taking over his dad\u2019s informal handyman jobs to support his mother. What began as a necessity soon revealed itself as a calling. He found deep satisfaction in his work\u2019s honesty\u2014a problem identified, a solution applied, a life made slightly easier.\n\nNow, at 44, David is the live-in manager of a rent-controlled apartment building in the Haight-Ashbury, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His days are a rhythm of responding to tenant requests, patching century-old plaster, and preemptively fixing what he knows will eventually break. He is an anchor in the transient sea of San Francisco; tenants come and go, but David remains. His social life is woven into the fabric of his building and neighborhood\u2014sharing a beer with the tenant in 3B, grabbing coffee at the corner cafe where they know his order, and nodding to the familiar faces on his daily walks through the Panhandle.\n\nHis dream isn\u2019t grand. He hopes to one day save enough to buy a small, used fishing boat, a vessel to take out on the Bay on quiet Sunday mornings, just as his father once dreamed of doing. For David, fulfillment isn\u2019t found in climbing a corporate ladder but in being the man who keeps the lights on, the water running, and a small corner of San Francisco feeling like home."
