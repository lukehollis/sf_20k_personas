The son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up amidst the scent of dried goods and fresh produce in his family\u2019s small grocery store in the Richmond District. His childhood wasn't about allowances but about stocking shelves and translating for his parents, experiences that instilled in him a relentless work ethic and a fluency in navigating two different worlds. He saw his parents\u2019 sacrifice daily and promised himself he would build a life where financial security was a given, not a constant struggle.\n\nDriven by this promise, Alex excelled in school, securing a place at UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Haas School of Business. He graduated with a degree in Finance and plunged headfirst into the high-octane world of investment banking. For five years, he lived on caffeine and adrenaline, working 90-hour weeks in a polished Financial District high-rise. The turning point came during a late-night project at 3 AM. Staring out at the glittering city lights, he realized he was building wealth in a city he no longer had time to live in. The burnout was profound.\n\nHe leveraged his experience to pivot to venture capital, a move that offered not just better hours but a chance to invest in the future of technology and real estate. Now, as a VC associate, he analyzes startups, looking for the next big thing. His background gives him a unique perspective; he\u2019s especially drawn to fintech companies aiming to serve immigrant communities.\n\nHis daily routine is a portrait of modern SF life. He starts with a 6 AM workout class before taking a Lyft from his Hayes Valley apartment to his downtown office. Evenings are often spent at networking events or trying new restaurants with his long-term girlfriend, Maya, an urban planner whose work often challenges his finance-centric worldview.\n\nThough he embodies the city's new wave of tech-adjacent wealth, Alex remains tethered to his roots. On weekends, he often drives out to the Richmond to help his parents, the familiar sights and sounds a grounding counterpoint to his fast-paced career. His ultimate dream isn't just to become a partner at his firm, but to one day fund a real estate project that provides affordable housing, a tribute to the city that gave his family a chance and a way to ensure others have one, too."

Alex stepped in, the English words flowing out of him easily, calmly resolving the issue. He felt a fierce, protective pride swell in his chest, mixed with the heavy weight of responsibility. He wasn't just translating; he was their shield. That day, the promise to build a life where they would never be made to feel small took root, hard and unshakeable.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 AM in the Financial District tower. Staring at a spreadsheet, his eyes burning, Alex looked out at the Bay Bridge lights, a silent, glittering strand of pearls. He was building immense wealth in a city he only ever saw through sealed glass, a ghost in his own life. The profound emptiness of that realization was the beginning of his escape. The burnout wasn\u2019t just physical exhaustion; it was the terrifying discovery that his hard-won success felt completely hollow.\n\n3.\nDuring his first year in venture capital, he sat in a pitch meeting for a fintech app designed to help immigrant families send money home. The founders described cutting the predatory fees that had siphoned his own parents\u2019 earnings for years. He saw his father\u2019s worn hands counting cash on the kitchen table. It wasn\u2019t just a good investment; it was validation. For the first time, his work felt like it could build something more than just personal wealth.\n\n4.\nMaya had insisted they attend a community meeting in the Mission to protest a new development. He\u2019d initially viewed it through a financial lens\u2014a prime parcel of land. But then he listened to an elderly woman speak about losing her community garden, the only piece of earth that reminded her of home. He saw the city not as a series of assets, but as a fragile ecosystem of human stories. That night, his finance-centric view cracked, making space for her perspective.\n\n5.\nJust last Saturday, he was stocking shelves in his parents\u2019 store, the air thick with the familiar smell of dried goji berries. His father, now starting to stoop with age, worked beside him in comfortable silence before patting his shoulder. In that simple, grounding moment, the VC world felt a million miles away. He was just a son, surrounded by his past. It was here that his dream of funding an affordable housing project felt less like an ambition and more like a debt of love."
