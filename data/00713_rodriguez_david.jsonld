The son of Mexican immigrants, David grew up watching his father, a gifted mechanic, bring engines back to life. While his parents championed the value of hands-on labor, they pushed their son toward a different path: a college degree. This duality\u2014a respect for the tangible and an ambition for the theoretical\u2014defined David\u2019s trajectory.\n\nHe channeled his fascination with how things work into an Industrial Engineering degree from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. His early career was in Southern California's aerospace industry, optimizing production lines for airplane parts. But as the tech boom reshaped the state, David saw a more dynamic future north. He took a calculated risk, pivoting to a role at a Silicon Valley hardware company. The move paid off, and over a decade, he rose through the ranks.\n\nNow 41, David is a Manufacturing Systems Manager, a job he performs entirely from his Bernal Heights home. His commute is a ten-second walk to his standing desk. From this quiet, sun-filled room, he orchestrates a global ballet of supply chains, robotics, and assembly lines in Asia and Latin America. His key turning point was realizing he could manage the physical world virtually, a freedom that allowed him and his partner, Sarah, to choose a neighborhood for its community, not its proximity to a corporate campus.\n\nDavid\u2019s days are a blend of the local and the global. Mornings begin with a walk up Bernal Hill with their dog, Buster, followed by coffee from a cafe on Cortland Avenue. Then, he dives into a world of video calls and production dashboards. Evenings are for unwinding with Sarah, trying a new recipe, or meeting their small circle of friends. He feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2019s village-like pockets, far from the downtown bustle.\n\nHaving achieved the stability his parents dreamed for him, David now aspires to something more personal. He envisions starting his own consulting firm, helping sustainable hardware startups build ethical and efficient manufacturing processes\u2014a way to finally merge the lessons from his father\u2019s garage with the global scale of his tech career."
