Born in San Jose to Iranian immigrants who fled the revolution in 1980, he grew up hearing stories of a life rebuilt from scratch. His father, a former engineer, became a successful project manager in Silicon Valley, while his mother, a doctor in Tehran, had to navigate the arduous process of re-certification in the U.S. Kian witnessed firsthand how intelligence and drive were no match for bureaucratic and cultural barriers, an observation that planted the seed for his future path.\n\nWhile pursuing his undergraduate degree at UC Davis, he initially considered medicine, like his mother. However, a volunteer stint at a free clinic in Oakland during his graduate studies at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health was his true turning point. He saw that the most profound health issues weren't just clinical; they were systemic, rooted in poverty, language barriers, and lack of access. This cemented his decision to earn a Master of Public Health and focus on strategy rather than treatment. His career progressed steadily from analyst to manager, and now to his current role as Director of Health Systems Strategy, where he develops programs to improve health outcomes for underserved student populations across the state.\n\nToday, Kian lives in a restored Victorian flat in the Mission District with his partner of eight years, Marco, an architect. His daily 4.5-mile commute on the J-Church Muni is a cherished routine, a time for reading policy briefs or simply observing the city\u2019s complex human tapestry. Evenings often involve cooking elaborate Persian meals, a connection to his heritage, while weekends are for Dolores Park with Marco or exploring the latest exhibits at SFMOMA.\n\nKian loves San Francisco for its inherent contradictions\u2014a hub of immense wealth and tech innovation that still pulses with a fierce spirit of activism and social responsibility. His aspiration is to leverage that spirit to architect a scalable, statewide health equity model. He sees his work not as a job, but as the fulfillment of a promise to the community that raised him and a testament to the resilience his parents taught him."

Her face wasn't sad, but fiercely focused, a stark contrast to the exhaustion in her eyes. It wasn't just studying; it was a fight. In that moment, watching her painstakingly translate her brilliant mind for a new system, he understood that the greatest challenges were often invisible, bureaucratic walls. That image seeded his lifelong drive not to practice a trade, but to tear down such walls for others.\n\n2. During his MPH at Berkeley, he was trying to help an elderly Latina at a free clinic in Oakland. She\u2019d missed a critical diabetes appointment, and Kian assumed it was a medical misunderstanding. But it wasn't. She simply couldn't decipher the complex bus transfer schedule. The system, not her health literacy, was the problem. That simple, infuriating realization was an epiphany. He saw with absolute clarity that he didn't want to write prescriptions; he wanted to redesign the pathways that allowed people to fill them.\n\n3. On their second anniversary, he and Marco sat on the floor of their newly-leased, slightly dilapidated Mission flat. Marco, an architect, was excitedly sketching plans not just to fix, but to honor the Victorian's original details. Watching him trace the lines of a future they would build together, Kian felt a profound sense of peace. His work was about redesigning intangible systems for people's well-being, and here was Marco, doing the very same for the physical space they would call home. It solidified his feeling of belonging.\n\n4. He was cooking Ghormeh Sabzi a few years ago and called his father, frustrated that he couldn't get the *tahdig* right. His dad didn't just give him a recipe; he told him the story of making that very dish in their first tiny apartment in San Jose, how the smell of saffron and fenugreek was the first scent of their new life. The simple act of cooking suddenly felt monumental\u2014a tangible connection to his parents' resilience and a ritual that grounded him in the story of how his family rebuilt everything from scratch.\n\n5. Just last month on his morning J-Church commute, the car jolted, causing a collective, momentary stumble. He looked up and saw the city in one frame: a construction worker covered in dust, a venture capitalist typing furiously into a phone, and a young artist sketching in a notebook. For that one second, they were all just people sharing a space, a ride, a city. This daily observation reinforces his core belief and mission: that behind the data and policy are these individuals, a complex human tapestry whose threads he is trying to strengthen."
