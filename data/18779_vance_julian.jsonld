He grew up understanding that everything, from a bridge to a painting, was a matter of design. This understanding guided him away from a traditional academic path and toward the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he pursued an MFA, honing his innate talent for shaping space and narrative through objects.\n\nHis early career was a grind in New York\u2019s competitive retail scene, dressing windows for department stores and learning the commercial side of art. The key turning point came in the early 2000s when a burgeoning San Francisco lifestyle brand, looking to disrupt the market, headhunted him. They weren't just looking for a visual merchandiser; they wanted a storyteller. Julian seized the opportunity, drawn by the city\u2019s innovative spirit and the chance to build a brand\u2019s entire sensory identity from the ground up. He never looked back.\n\nNow, at 51, Julian is a respected VP, a master of creating immersive brand experiences. His life is a curated sanctuary he shares with his partner of fifteen years, Marcus, a landscape architect. Their Hayes Valley condo, filled with curated art, minimalist furniture, and abundant plant life, is a testament to their shared design ethos. Their rescue greyhound, Apollo, is their quiet companion.\n\nJulian\u2019s routine is disciplined. He wakes early for a walk with Apollo through the neighborhood\u2019s misty streets before catching the Muni for his 3.8-mile commute. This daily ride is his observation lab, a rolling focus group where he anonymously studies the city\u2019s populace\u2014their styles, their energy, their needs. He finds San Francisco\u2019s blend of high-tech gloss and bohemian grit an endless source of inspiration.\n\nThough proud of his corporate success, Julian aspires to a future less defined by quarterly earnings. He dreams of stepping back to consult, mentor young designers, and perhaps collaborate with Marcus on a small-scale, deeply personal design project\u2014a boutique hotel or a public garden. He wants to transition from shaping how people shop to shaping how they experience tranquility and beauty in their daily lives."

But his mother whispered, \u201cSee how it disappears? It\u2019s not a building, Julian, it\u2019s a piece of the sky.\u201d In that moment, the two opposing views\u2014structure and story\u2014fused inside him. He understood that the most brilliant design wasn\u2019t the object itself, but how it interacted with the world. It was a lesson that became his life\u2019s guiding principle.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in a cavernous Fifth Avenue stockroom, the air thick with the scent of perfume and defeat. Surrounded by mannequins, Julian felt like a fraud, just dressing plastic dolls. Then, arranging a simple cashmere scarf, he saw it: not an accessory, but a narrative shard. A woman waiting, a rushed goodbye, a hopeful beginning. He realized then that he wasn\u2019t selling clothes. He was building tiny, silent plays in glass boxes. That night, exhaustion gave way to purpose. He was a storyteller.\n\n3.\nThe final interview for the San Francisco job wasn't in an office but on a walk through the Mission in 2001. The founder didn't ask about sales figures; he pointed to murals, to the mix of taquerias and new galleries. \u201cThis is our customer,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cHow do you speak to them?\u201d Julian felt the East Coast cynicism peel away, replaced by the thrill of a new design language. Getting the offer felt less like a new job and more like being handed a key to the city itself.\n\n4.\nTheir Hayes Valley condo was an architectural void until Marcus arrived with the first piece of their life together: a single, towering fiddle-leaf fig. It was 2009. As Marcus positioned it in the corner where the afternoon light was best, the empty room gained a heart. It wasn't about furniture or art yet; it was about establishing a living, breathing anchor. Julian knew then their home wouldn't just be a place they decorated, but a sanctuary they would grow together, leaf by leaf.\n\n5.\nHe remembers adopting Apollo five years ago. At the shelter, the greyhound stood perfectly still, a sculpture of forgotten speed, his gaze distant. Driving him home, Julian felt the dog\u2019s quiet, trembling weight against the seat. That first night, Apollo unfurled onto his bed with a sigh that seemed to hold years of weariness. In that sound, Julian recognized a shared need for peace after a long race. In rescuing Apollo, he felt he was also claiming a piece of his own future tranquility."
