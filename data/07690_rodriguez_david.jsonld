The only son of Mexican immigrants, he grew up in Fresno, where his father\u2019s stoicism in the face of grueling farm labor and his mother\u2019s ingenuity in stretching a cannery paycheck taught him about systems\u2014how they could fail and how, with diligence, they could be optimized. David saw the world as a series of processes to be improved, from packing lunches to fixing the family\u2019s old pickup truck.\n\nThis innate logic propelled him to Cal Poly for a degree in Chemical Engineering and later to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Materials Science. He entered the Bay Area tech scene in the late 90s, just in time to ride the dot-com wave and brace for its crash. That early volatility taught him to value indispensability over hype. He dedicated himself to the unglamorous but critical work of process engineering, streamlining complex silicon wafer fabrication and becoming a sought-after expert in efficiency.\n\nThe relentless drive, however, came at a cost. A marriage to a fellow engineer in his late twenties dissolved under the weight of two demanding careers. By his late thirties, David faced a classic Silicon Valley burnout, realizing the life he\u2019d meticulously built was optimized for his company, not for himself. This was his turning point. He intentionally sought a senior role at a more established company that embraced remote work, trading a corner office for a quiet desk in his Cole Valley apartment.\n\nNow, his commute is a walk from his bedroom to his sunlit living room. His days are structured by his own design: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, focused work blocks, and afternoons punctuated by walks to the local cheese shop or bookstore. He finds community not in office happy hours, but with a small, tight-knit group of friends and through a mentorship program for young Latino students in STEM. David\u2019s ambition has shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to perfecting his own life\u2019s process. He dreams of extended travel and finding a partnership built on shared quiet moments rather than shared career goals\u2014a final, crucial optimization for a life well-engineered."
