The son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in the Richmond District, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of pragmatic diligence and the quiet hum of ambition. While his parents stacked oranges and managed inventory, David found his world in the glowing green text of an Apple IIe, learning BASIC in his bedroom while the fog rolled in outside. His path felt pre-ordained: a pipeline from Lowell High School to a UC education.\n\nHe completed his undergraduate degree in computer science at UC Davis, diving headfirst into the dot-com boom of the late 90s. The subsequent bust was his defining crucible. After being laid off from a promising startup, a shaken David realized that pure technical skill was volatile. He returned to school, pursuing a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction, focusing not just on how to build things, but *why* and *for whom*. This pivot from pure engineering to a more human-centric approach defined his career, eventually leading him into management where he excelled at translating between engineers and product teams.\n\nNow 48, David\u2019s life is one of comfortable routine. Divorced for nearly a decade, his primary connection is to his daughter, now a sophomore at UCLA, their relationship maintained through scheduled video calls and care packages. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to a spare bedroom converted into a sunlit home office, overlooking the quiet residential street. His days are a sequence of virtual meetings, code reviews, and mentorship sessions with younger engineers. In the evenings, he sheds his managerial skin, often taking long walks through Golden Gate Park or perfecting a complex recipe.\n\nDavid no longer dreams of founding the next unicorn. His aspirations are more grounded: to see his team thrive, to maybe buy a small cabin near the Russian River, and to finally have an uncomplicated, in-person conversation with his daughter about her future. He\u2019s a man who has built a successful life on the bedrock of his parents\u2019 hard work, forever tethered to the city whose fog is less a nuisance and more a familiar, comforting blanket."

He was 14, and his mind wasn't on the pyramid of fruit but on a single line of BASIC that had crashed his program. The contrast was stark: the messy, tangible world of inventory and the clean, logical world behind his monitor. That day, he didn't just feel a duty to his parents\u2019 hard work, but an overwhelming pull toward the elegant systems he could build, a world he could control completely.\n\n2.\nThe walk home from his SoMa office in 2001 felt impossibly long. He didn\u2019t take the N-Judah; he needed the punishing distance. His keycard hadn't worked, and the box with his mug felt heavier with each block. The dot-com dream had evaporated into the afternoon haze. It wasn't just a job loss; it was the gutting realization that his technical skill, his entire identity, was volatile and insufficient. That humiliation planted a seed of doubt that would redefine his career, pushing him to understand people, not just machines.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the worn-down chain of the swing set in Golden Gate Park. His daughter, Lena, was five, her laughter the only sound that mattered as he pushed her higher. \"More, Baba, more!\" she\u2019d yelled, her little legs kicking at the sky. In that simple, rhythmic moment, the complexities of code and deadlines dissolved into pure, uncomplicated purpose. The memory is an anchor now, a touchstone of pure joy he revisits during their structured video calls, a reminder of the \"why\" behind everything else.\n\n4.\nIt was a late night during his Master's program, staring at a case study of a technically perfect interface that users despised. A jolt went through him. He saw his old startup in the text\u2014brilliant engineers building for themselves, not for anyone real. It was a profound, validating click. His layoff wasn't just a personal failure; it was a systemic one. That single academic paper became his professional Rosetta Stone, giving him the language to bridge the gap between code and the chaotic, human world it was meant to serve.\n\n5.\nAbout two years after his divorce, the evening silence of his Inner Sunset home still felt unnervingly loud. He decided to tackle a complex Cantonese duck recipe, one he\u2019d only ever watched his parents make. The process\u2014the meticulous rendering of the fat, the precise timing\u2014demanded his entire focus. Taking that first bite, the flavor was a perfect echo of his childhood. It wasn't just dinner; it was the moment he realized he could find comfort and continuity entirely on his own terms. The quiet was no longer lonely."
