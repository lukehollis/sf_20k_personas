A native son, he was raised in the Sunset District by first-generation immigrant parents who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Irving Street. His childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the diligent, quiet ambition simmering in the city\u2019s public schools. His parents, valuing stability above all, pushed him toward a practical career, and he obliged, earning a computer science degree from UCLA.\n\nHe began his career as a software engineer, but quickly found himself more fascinated by the \u2018why\u2019 behind the product than the \u2018how\u2019 of the code. This realization was his first major turning point. Against his parents\u2019 cautious advice, he took on significant debt to enroll in UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. The MBA was his bridge from engineering to strategy, a deliberate pivot toward the rooms where decisions were made.\n\nThe gamble paid off. Kevin landed a product manager role at a burgeoning tech firm and began his steady ascent. Now, as a Senior Product Manager, he navigates the high-stakes world of product roadmaps and feature launches. His daily routine is a testament to the modern SF tech professional: an early morning run through Noe Valley, where he owns a condo, followed by the 6.5-mile company shuttle ride to the SoMa campus. His days are a marathon of meetings, his evenings often spent decompressing over takeout while reviewing market data.\n\nSocially, Kevin maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from high school, a grounding force amidst his ambitious tech colleagues. At 38, he is single and navigates the city's demanding dating scene with a mix of optimism and weariness. He is deeply connected to San Francisco, remembering a grittier, more accessible version of the city while simultaneously being part of the economic engine that transformed it. His dream isn't just a promotion to Director; it's to launch a product with a genuine social impact, and to find a partner to build a life with\u2014a modern version of the stable foundation his parents created for him, just a few miles and a world away."

His father, without looking up from the register, would just nod. That silent approval felt more valuable than any A+ on a report card. It was the first time he understood the quiet satisfaction of building something tangible and watching it stand on its own\u2014a lesson he now applies to product roadmaps, a world away from Irving Street.\n\n2.\nHe can still feel the heavy silence in his parents\u2019 Sunset kitchen when, at 26, he announced he was leaving his engineering job for business school. It was the first time he\u2019d ever truly gone against their wishes. The look of worried disappointment in his mother\u2019s eyes was a physical blow, but beneath it lay a thrilling, terrifying conviction. In that moment, he learned to trust his own 'why' over everyone else\u2019s 'how,' a choice that would define his entire career.\n\n3.\nThe night his first major feature went live, he sat alone in the office, watching the active user count on a huge monitor. As the number ticked past 10,000, then 50,000, a wave of pure, electric relief washed over him. The abstract strategy and endless meetings were made real in a single, climbing integer. It wasn't just code; it was connection. That intoxicating feeling of validation, earned in his early thirties, became the professional high he\u2019s been chasing ever since.\n\n4.\nLast year, on a date in Hayes Valley, she asked him \"What's your five-year product roadmap... for your life?\" He gave the practiced, ambitious answer. The cocktail was perfect, the conversation efficient, but he felt a profound loneliness. Driving home to his quiet condo, he realized his professional success had become armor. It made him a great catch on paper, but it masked the part of him that just wanted to share takeout and not have to strategize his own heart.\n\n5.\nRiding the gleaming white shuttle to SoMa, he often glides past the corner where his high school friend\u2019s family-run auto shop used to be. Now it\u2019s a kombucha taproom. A sharp pang of guilt and nostalgia always hits him. This moment, which happens often, crystallizes his internal conflict: he is a product of the old, gritty SF, but his success is an engine of the new. It's the feeling that fuels his deep desire to build something that serves the city that raised him, not just disrupts it."
