Born in Daly City to a pragmatic Filipina nurse who brought the warmth of Cebu and the flavor of lumpia to their home, and a logical German-American civil engineer who taught him the beauty of structure, Marco learned early to be a bridge. The hyphen in his name was a deliberate choice, a testament to the seamless blend of community-focus and disciplined thinking that would define him.\n\nHis educational journey mirrored this synthesis. He initially pursued engineering at UC Irvine, following in his father's footsteps, but found himself more fascinated by *why* people struggled with software than by the code itself. This revelation was a turning point, leading him to Stanford's prestigious Human-Computer Interaction program. He found his calling there, mastering the art of translating human desires into elegant, functional technology. He graduated just as the dot-com bubble was bursting, a trial by fire that taught him resilience and the value of sustainable, user-centric design over fleeting hype.\n\nMarco\u2019s career arc was a steady climb from a junior UX designer to his current role as Director of Product Strategy at a major SoMa tech firm. He built a reputation for being the person who could calm a room of agitated engineers and skeptical executives, using data and empathy as his twin tools.\n\nTen years ago, he met his husband, Julian, a landscape architect, at the SF Botanical Garden. Julian grounds him, pulling him away from screens and into the tangible world of soil, seasons, and sunlight. They bought a meticulously renovated Edwardian in Noe Valley, a neighborhood they cherish for its blend of families, quiet streets, and city access. Marco\u2019s 3.8-mile MUNI commute on the J-Church line is a cherished ritual\u2014a time to decompress with a podcast, disconnected from the demands of his job.\n\nNow at 46, with his career established, Marco dreams of a different kind of impact. He aspires to launch a pro-bono consulting arm at his company, helping non-profits improve their digital outreach. He also harbors a quiet ambition to mentor more young, diverse designers, ensuring the people building the future of technology reflect the world it serves."

To his left, his mother\u2019s hands, smelling of garlic and vinegar, moved with a rhythmic grace, folding lumpia wrappers. To his right, his father\u2019s precise blueprints for a new overpass were unrolled, smelling of sharp paper and graphite. He realized then that love and logic could share the same space, that structure and warmth could build a home. It was the first bridge he ever witnessed, and he learned he could be the span between them.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in a UC Irvine computer lab. Marco was debugging code, but he couldn\u2019t stop watching the history major across from him, whose shoulders slumped in defeat over a simple registration program. In that moment of shared frustration, the lines of code vanished. All he saw was the human. He didn\u2019t want to build the engine anymore; he wanted to design the dashboard, the manual, the experience. That night, his focus irrevocably shifted from the machine to the person using it.\n\n3.\nTen years ago, he met Julian near the Rhododendron Dell in the Botanical Garden. Marco was checking work emails, his mind tangled in wireframes and user flows. Then he saw Julian, hands deep in the soil, explaining the needs of a fern with a quiet reverence. Julian looked up and smiled, and Marco felt the digital noise in his head finally go silent. It was replaced by the scent of damp earth and living things. He was present, and he was completely seen.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the silence in the room after the announcement. He was 24, and the dot-com project he\u2019d poured his life into was suddenly gone, its funding vanished. The useless, \"disruptive\" features were now just digital ghosts. The sting of that failure never left him. It burned into him the difference between fleeting hype and lasting human value. That memory is why he now champions sustainable design and dreams of helping organizations that need technology to survive, not just to impress investors.\n\n5.\nHis daily MUNI ride is a moving sanctuary. He thinks of one rainy Tuesday last winter on the J-Church, his podcast a murmur in his ears. As the train rumbled past the darkened outline of Dolores Park, the city lights blurred into watercolor streaks on the fogged-up window. In that moment, he felt the distinct boundary between his SoMa work-self and his Noe Valley home-self. This commute isn't just travel; it\u2019s a deliberate transition, a 3.8-mile exhale that lets him arrive home."
