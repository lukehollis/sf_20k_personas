The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, her upbringing was a landscape of high expectations. Her parents, a pharmacist and an accountant, envisioned a stable, lucrative career for her, but Chloe was always drawn to the world of aesthetics, a trait she inherited from her late grandfather, a skilled calligrapher whose ink-stained brushes were her first toys.\n\nHer educational journey was a quiet rebellion. While her parents celebrated her acceptance into UC Berkeley, they were privately wary of her choice to major in Art History. Chloe thrived, immersing herself in theory and critique. A semester abroad in Florence, Italy, was her turning point. Standing before Donatello\u2019s *David*, she wasn\u2019t just observing art; she felt its power to communicate across centuries. This solidified her resolve, leading her directly to a Master's program in Museum Studies at the University of San Francisco. She chose to stay local, feeling an intense loyalty to the city's unique cultural fabric.\n\nNow, at 25, Chloe is an Assistant Curator at a small, contemporary gallery in SoMa. Her 0.0-mile commute is a subject of envy among her friends; she lives in a sleek, minimalist studio apartment in the same building as the gallery. Her days are a blur of artist liaisons, research for upcoming exhibitions, and the meticulous work of cataloging new acquisitions. She has found her niche championing emerging Bay Area artists, particularly those from underrepresented communities. Her social life blends seamlessly with her work, consisting of gallery openings, late-night talks with artists over cheap pho, and a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly from her graduate program.\n\nChloe\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound, a dialogue between her past and present. She still takes the N Judah train back to the Sunset every Sunday for dim sum with her parents, who are now quietly proud of her sophisticated world. Her dream is to one day curate a major exhibition that explores the intersection of traditional East Asian craft and modern technology in art\u2014a tribute to her grandfather and her city. She aspires not just to be a curator, but a storyteller who uses gallery walls to reflect the complex, ever-changing soul of San Francisco."
