She pursued this passion to college, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History, imagining a future spent curating exhibits in grand, silent museums. The reality, however, was a world with few openings and even lower pay. Pragmatism won out. She moved to San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by a friend's promise of opportunity during the first dot-com boom.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was accidental. Needing to pay rent, she took a job as an administrative assistant at a chaotic startup. There, amidst the frantic energy of engineers and ambitious founders, Sarah discovered an unexpected talent: she was a master of order. She thrived on creating systems, managing logistics, and being the calm, organizational center of the storm. The job title evolved from assistant to Office Manager, a role she has perfected over two decades and across four different companies.\n\nA key turning point was the pandemic, which shifted her company to a fully remote model. Now, Sarah manages a digital office from her meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is a 10-step walk from her kitchen to her desk. Her days are a blur of Slack messages, coordinating equipment shipments for new hires, and planning virtual team-building events.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but personal. She lives a deliberately contained life, finding solace in the fog-laced streets of her neighborhood and long walks through Golden Gate Park. Divorced for five years, her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends and her weekly pottery class\u2014a tangible link to the artistic world she once craved. On weekends, she\u2019s a regular at the de Young Museum, quietly observing the art she studied long ago. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day leave the city for a small town in Sonoma, where she hopes to open a tiny gallery and finally curate a space of her own."
