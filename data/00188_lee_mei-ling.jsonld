As the only child of hardworking Taiwanese immigrants, her world was defined by the rhythm of deliveries, the scent of produce, and the unspoken expectation that her mind, not her hands, would be her ticket to a different life. A precocious child, she excelled at Lowell High School, finding solace in the clean logic of math and science, a stark contrast to the beautiful chaos of her home life.\n\nHer path was a classic Bay Area trajectory: an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley followed by a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Stanford. She was fascinated by the bridge between human emotion and machine logic. Her early career was a blur of success at a major Silicon Valley firm, marked by long nights, collaborative sprints, and the intoxicating thrill of being at the industry's heart.\n\nThe turning point was silent and internal. Around age 35, after shipping a landmark project, she felt not pride, but a profound emptiness. The relentless pressure and performative \"on-campus\" culture had hollowed her out. This burnout became her catalyst for change. She leveraged her reputation to secure her current role as a Senior Research Scientist at a different company, negotiating a fully remote position\u2014a non-negotiable term.\n\nNow, her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a meticulously organized office in her NoPa condo. Her days are structured by her own design: a foggy morning walk in the Panhandle, hours of intense, uninterrupted research developing more intuitive AI systems, and evenings spent either cooking elaborate meals or with her small, tight-knit circle of friends. She has traded corporate synergy for intellectual solitude.\n\nDeeply connected to the city that raised her, Mei-Ling sees San Francisco not as a playground for disruption, but as a layered home. Her hope is no longer to climb a corporate ladder, but to achieve a genuine breakthrough\u2014to create technology that fosters connection, not isolation. She dreams of one day taking a sabbatical, not to launch a startup, but to travel the world and simply observe the people her work is meant to serve."
