At 45, he can tell the precise sweetness of a satsuma by the texture of its peel and the heft of a melon by the way it rests in his palm. His life story is rooted in the very soil of the produce he sells at \"Lam's Fine Produce,\" the family grocery store in San Francisco's Richmond District.\n\nHe arrived from Hong Kong at fifteen, a quiet teenager whose formal education ended the day he stepped onto American soil. His parents poured their life savings into the small storefront on Clement Street, and Wai\u2019s education became the pre-dawn chill of the wholesale market and the rapid-fire Cantonese of haggling with suppliers. While his younger sister, Mei, excelled in the American school system and eventually became a graphic designer in the Mission, Wai learned the family business. There was no discussion; it was a matter of duty and survival. He lives in the apartment above the store, the same one he moved into as a boy, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when his father had a heart scare. The weight of the business, once shared, settled squarely on Wai\u2019s shoulders. Any vague dreams he had of becoming a mechanic, of working with engines instead of endives, faded completely. He became the Produce Manager, a title that felt both official and deeply inadequate for a role that consumed his entire existence. His social life consists of brief chats with neighborhood regulars\u2014the elderly woman who only buys ginger for her tea, the young couple who marvel at his dragon fruit. He was briefly married in his late twenties, but his wife couldn\u2019t compete with the store's relentless demands.\n\nNow, his days are a familiar rhythm: waking before sunrise, arranging the day's offerings into a vibrant mosaic, and closing long after the fog has rolled in. His hope isn't for wealth, but for stability\u2014to keep the store thriving against the encroachment of grocery delivery apps. His most pressing dream is to afford a new, energy-efficient refrigeration unit. Wai Lam is an anchor in his community, a constant presence in a city of perpetual change. He doesn't just work in San Francisco; he is part of its essential, beating heart, one perfectly ripe nectarine at a time."
