The only son of Lebanese immigrants who fled civil unrest in the 1970s, Karim grew up straddling two worlds. At home, the air was thick with the aroma of kibbeh, the cadence of Arabic, and stories of a homeland he\u2019d never seen. Outside, he navigated the different, but equally strong, culture of a bustling Midwestern community. This dual existence fostered a deep empathy for those caught between cultures, a foundational stone for his future career.\n\nSeeking a more expansive identity, he moved west for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley in the early 1990s. He arrived in a Bay Area at the epicenter of the AIDS crisis. As a young gay man, this was a profound and formative turning point. Volunteering at a hospice, he witnessed not only immense suffering but also the fierce, compassionate power of community action. The experience solidified his calling; social work was not just a profession, but a personal mandate.\n\nFor over 25 years, Karim has dedicated himself to a single San Francisco non-profit that provides social and health services to students and their families. He started as a case manager, his calm demeanor and tireless advocacy earning him respect. Now, as Director, he manages budgets and mentors a new generation, but never loses sight of the individuals his work serves.\n\nKarim lives in a cozy Hayes Valley apartment with David, his partner of 18 years, a landscape architect whose love for native plants has filled their small balcony with life. His 1.8-mile commute on the MUNI is a daily ritual, a rolling cross-section of the city he both loves and worries for. He sees the staggering inequality and the mental health crises firsthand, fueling his drive at work.\n\nAt 51, Karim\u2019s ambition is no longer for promotion, but for legacy. He dreams of strengthening his organization's endowment to ensure its survival long after he retires. His hope is for a San Francisco that lives up to its progressive promise, a city where the systems of care are as robust and resilient as the people he\u2019s spent his life serving."

The man, barely older than Karim, whispered about wanting to see the jacaranda trees bloom one last time. Karim could only offer a cool cloth and a promise to sit with him. When silence finally filled the room, it wasn\u2019t peaceful; it was a furious, quiet call to arms. That night, social work ceased to be a career path. It became a vow, forged in grief and fierce, protective love for his community.\n\n2.\nHe first saw David at a raucous 2005 protest against budget cuts. Amid the chanting, Karim noticed him crouched down, gently touching a resilient dandelion growing through a crack in the plaza. David looked up, smiled, and said, \u201cEven here, life finds a way.\u201d In that moment, surrounded by righteous anger, David\u2019s quiet observation felt like the most profound truth. It was a moment of calm in the storm, a feeling Karim realized he\u2019d been searching for his entire life. He felt instantly, irrevocably grounded.\n\n3.\nKarim will never forget the day a high school senior named Maria finally told him about the eviction notice. For weeks, she\u2019d been silent and withdrawn in his office. After months of frantic work, he secured a housing voucher for her family. Ten years later, a young woman stopped him on Market Street. It was Maria, now a nurse. \u201cYou saw me when no one else did,\u201d she said. The memory is a touchstone, a powerful reminder that fighting for one person can change the course of a generation.\n\n4.\nIt was his 45th birthday. The scent of cumin and pine nuts from the kibbeh he\u2019d made\u2014his mother\u2019s recipe\u2014drifted from the kitchen to their small balcony. David was tending to a new manzanita plant. Looking out over the Hayes Valley rooftops, Karim felt a profound sense of integration. The smells of his Dearborn childhood were tangibly present in his San Francisco life, held within the home he\u2019d built. For the first time, he didn't feel caught between two worlds, but like he was the bridge connecting them.\n\n5.\nOn his first day as Director, he stood in his new, quiet office, watching his old MUNI bus roll down the street below. He felt a pang of dislocation, a sadness for the front-line work he was leaving behind. The problems of the city looked so abstract from this height. That feeling of distance was terrifying, but it also clarified his new purpose. He wasn't just helping one person at a time anymore; he now had to protect the entire ecosystem of care for decades to come."
