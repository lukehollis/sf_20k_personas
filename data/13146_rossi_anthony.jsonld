A third-generation San Franciscan, his narrative began not in a gleaming condo but in the flour-dusted air of his father's North Beach bakery. His Genoese grandparents had established the family here, and Anthony grew up hearing stories of a different city\u2014one of tight-knit communities and working-class grit.\n\nHis turning point came during the first dot-com boom. While his peers chased stock options, Anthony watched landlords evict lifelong neighbors and familiar shops close. This sense of loss, of a city\u2019s character being auctioned off, pushed him toward public service. He enrolled in UC Berkeley's Public Policy program, determined to understand the systems that governed urban life, not just profit from them.\n\nAfter graduation, he took a junior analyst position at the SFMTA, a choice his tech-focused friends found odd. For Anthony, it was a calling. He saw the city's transit system not as a collection of lines and vehicles, but as its circulatory system\u2014the key to equity, access, and environmental health. Over fifteen years, he methodically worked his way up to Program Manager, earning a reputation for being pragmatic and deeply knowledgeable.\n\nToday, Anthony lives in the Inner Richmond with his partner, Clara, a public school teacher. His 3.8-mile commute on the 5R-Fulton is a daily field study. He experiences every \"ghost bus,\" crowded car, and seamless transfer not as an anonymous commuter, but as a personal challenge. His weekends are spent walking through Golden Gate Park or exploring the restaurants on Clement Street, consciously supporting the local businesses that remind him of his father's bakery.\n\nAnthony\u2019s dream is deceptively simple: to help build a public transit system so reliable and respected that it becomes the undisputed lifeblood of the city. He harbors a quiet ambition to one day hold a director-level role, not for power, but for the scope to enact the bold, long-term changes he believes will preserve the soul of his hometown for generations to come."

He watched his father greet every customer by name, not just selling bread but weaving the fabric of the neighborhood with each transaction. That feeling of safety and purpose, of being an essential part of a community's daily ritual, became the bedrock of his identity. It was his first, and purest, taste of a city that truly worked for its people.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, during the first dot-com boom, he helped his parents\u2019 elderly neighbor, Mrs. Gagliano, pack her apartment after an Ellis Act eviction. He saw the shame in her eyes as she wrapped the ceramic figurines she\u2019d carried from Genoa. The new owner never said a word to her. That cold, silent transaction felt like a profound violence against the soul of North Beach. It was the moment his vague love for San Francisco sharpened into a fierce, protective instinct, pushing him toward public policy instead of private profit.\n\n3.\nFresh out of Berkeley and a junior analyst at SFMTA, he spent a night doing a ride-along on the \u201cowl\u201d service. He met a hotel cleaner who depended on the 2:00 a.m. bus to get home to her children in the Excelsior. When the bus arrived on time, the relief on her face was palpable. He realized his spreadsheets weren't just data; they were the invisible architecture of her life. The weight and honor of that responsibility settled in him, solidifying his career as a true calling.\n\n4.\nIt was a foggy Sunday with Clara, before they moved in together. They\u2019d walked from their separate apartments to meet in Golden Gate Park. As they watched the bison, she spoke about fighting for resources for her public school students with a familiar, weary passion. He saw a direct parallel to his own battles at the MTA. In her, he didn't just find a partner; he found an ally. That shared commitment to the city\u2019s unglamorous, essential work made him feel profoundly understood, and profoundly home.\n\n5.\nLast winter, waiting for the 5R on Fulton, he watched the \"next bus\" countdown clock on the shelter display a bus that never came\u2014a ghost. An elderly woman next to him, laden with groceries, let out a quiet, resigned sigh. Her small sound of defeat hit him harder than any angry complaint ever could. It wasn't just an operational failure; it was a broken promise. That moment of shared frustration wasn't an annoyance; it was fuel, hardening his quiet ambition into a non-negotiable mission."
