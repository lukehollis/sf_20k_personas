The son of a second-generation Chinese-American father who ran a small corner store and a mother of Irish and Mexican heritage who worked as a city administrator, David\u2019s identity was a microcosm of the city itself\u2014a blend of cultures that defied easy categorization. He was never one for formal education; school felt rigid and slow compared to the nascent digital world he discovered on his family's first computer.\n\nInstead of college, David dove into the city's burgeoning tech scene in the late 1990s. He was self-taught, learning HTML from online forums and marketing principles from trial and error. His first real job was for a dot-com startup that burned bright and flamed out, a crash that became his most valuable lesson. It taught him resilience and the importance of tangible skills over hype. He spent the next decade as a consultant, building a reputation for pragmatic, data-driven marketing strategies long before it was a buzzword.\n\nNow 45, David is a Senior Marketing Manager for a mid-sized B2B software company. His 0.0-mile commute is a cherished perk, allowing him to work from the sun-drenched living room of his Hayes Valley condo\u2014a world away from his foggy childhood home. His day begins not with a commute, but with a walk to a local cafe with his partner, Clara, a landscape architect whose work provides a welcome analog contrast to his digital world.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago, which prompted him to re-evaluate the relentless hustle. He\u2019s since cultivated a life centered on intention. While his days are filled with Zoom calls and campaign analytics, his evenings are intentionally screen-free, dedicated to cooking, reading, or catching a show in the neighborhood. As a native, David holds a complex love for San Francisco. He appreciates the opportunity it gave a scrappy kid without a degree but quietly mourns the loss of the city\u2019s unpretentious soul. His dream isn't another promotion, but to eventually start a small consultancy advising non-profits, trading breakneck growth for meaningful impact."
