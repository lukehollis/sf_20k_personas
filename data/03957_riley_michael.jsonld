Raised in a pragmatic Ohio suburb by an engineer father and a teacher mother, Michael was the family\u2019s resident dreamer. He baffled his parents by pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Architectural History, spending his twenties enthralled by the designs of Louis Sullivan and the Bauhaus movement.\n\nThe early 2000s recession, however, was a harsh dose of reality. Seeing his peers with arts degrees struggle, Michael made a calculated pivot. He earned an MBA and methodically built a career in finance, a field that rewarded his sharp, analytical mind. He moved to San Francisco a decade ago for a lucrative opportunity, drawn ironically by the city\u2019s stunning Victorian and Art Deco architecture\u2014a daily reminder of the path not taken.\n\nA key turning point was a painful breakup in his late thirties. His long-term partner, an artist, had lovingly called his career choice \"the great compromise,\" but eventually left, frustrated by a life she felt was governed by spreadsheets and risk aversion. The split coincided with his company\u2019s shift to permanent remote work, a change Michael embraced. His 0.0-mile commute solidified his world into a gilded cage of his own making.\n\nHis days are now a seamless loop: he wakes before dawn to analyze European markets, participates in a flurry of Zoom calls, breaks for a solitary run through the Panhandle, and orders dinner from a rotating list of upscale restaurants. He is a resident of San Francisco in name only; the city is an abstract backdrop viewed from his floor-to-ceiling windows. His social connections have dwindled to a few colleagues and an annual holiday card from his sister.\n\nAt 45, Michael has achieved the financial security his parents prized, yet he feels a profound sense of unfulfillment. His secret dream is to leave finance, buy a dilapidated Edwardian in the Inner Richmond, and spend years personally restoring it. It\u2019s a longing not just for a project, but for a tangible connection to the beauty he traded for a life of calculated returns."
