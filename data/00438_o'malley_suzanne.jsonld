Her father, a proud Irish-American firefighter, and her mother, a pragmatic homemaker, instilled in her a working-class sensibility and a deep, unspoken love for their city. Growing up, Suzanne was the dreamer, always with her nose in a novel, imagining worlds far beyond the Pacific coastline.\n\nThis love for stories led her to SF State, where she enrolled as an English major. For two years, she was alive with literature, dissecting poems and dreaming of a life surrounded by books. That dream shattered when her father suffered a career-ending injury in a warehouse fire. With his disability pay a fraction of his former income, the family\u2019s stability vanished. Suzanne, feeling the weight of responsibility, dropped out of college to find a steady job with good benefits. She found it at Muni.\n\nBecoming a bus driver was not her plan, but over the last 25 years, it has become her identity. Her first few years were a blur of training and navigating the city\u2019s notoriously difficult streets. Slowly, the rattling chassis of the bus became an extension of herself. From behind the wheel of the 1-California or the 38-Geary, she has watched San Francisco transform, one passenger at a time.\n\nSuzanne lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a short walk from the Presidio depot. Her personal life is quiet; a long-term relationship with a fellow city employee ended amicably a few years back, and she now values her independence. Her social circle is small, comprised of a few fellow drivers and a childhood friend who never left the neighborhood. Evenings are for reading\u2014a final, quiet link to her college days\u2014and long walks in Golden Gate Park.\n\nAt fifty, Suzanne is content. She doesn\u2019t dream of finishing her degree anymore. Instead, her aspirations are tangible: a comfortable retirement, and enough money saved to finally travel. She wants to see Italy and Ireland, to walk through the landscapes she once only read about in books, funded by a lifetime of safely navigating the city she calls home."

Seeing her father, always so large and invincible, looking small and defeated in the bed, broke something in her. When the doctor mentioned \u201cpermanent disability\u201d and her mother\u2019s face crumpled, the world of poems and prose dissolved. A new, heavier reality settled in its place. It was the moment her childhood ended and her duty began, the day she decided to trade her own dreams for her family\u2019s survival.\n\n2.\nHer first year driving, a rainy November night on the 38-Geary, she was terrified. Her knuckles were white on the enormous steering wheel, the hiss of the air brakes a constant taunt. She thought of her literature professors, of Keats and Woolf, and felt a wave of hopeless regret. Then, she nailed the hairpin turn at Masonic, smooth as anything, and a tiny spark of pride flickered. For the first time, the rattling machine felt less like a cage and more like a tool. It was a skill, hard-won and entirely hers.\n\n3.\nMrs. Chen, a tiny woman with a kind smile, rode the 1-California every Tuesday for years. One cold Christmas Eve, the old woman pressed a small, warm package into Suzanne's hand as she stepped off the bus\u2014a single, perfect, homemade almond cookie. In a job of anonymous transactions, it was a moment of profound connection. It wasn't about driving a bus anymore; it was about carrying people's lives for a little while. She felt a quiet, sturdy pride she had never expected to find.\n\n4.\nIt was the summer after her relationship ended, around age forty-seven. She was walking in Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in, sitting on a bench near the Dutch windmills with a book unopened in her lap. She felt no loneliness, only a deep, anchoring peace. The salty air and the muted sounds of the city were her companions. She realized then that her independence wasn't a void, but a space she had cultivated herself. She was her own quiet, comfortable home.\n\n5.\nJust last month, on a break near the Presidio depot, she saw a travel poster for the Amalfi Coast in a dusty window. For a second, she thought of the idyllic Italian landscapes from the novels she\u2019d once studied. But the image didn\u2019t bring the old, familiar ache of a life not lived. Instead, she felt a jolt of practical excitement, mentally calculating overtime shifts. The dream was no longer an abstract idea in a book; it was a destination, a tangible reward at the end of the line."
