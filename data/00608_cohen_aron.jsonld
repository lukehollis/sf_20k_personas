Raised in a sleepy New Jersey suburb, the only son of an accountant and a librarian, Aron\u2019s childhood was orderly and filled with books. He inherited his father\u2019s precision and his mother\u2019s love for the written word, a combination that would unexpectedly define his career.\n\nHe attended Rutgers, earning a Bachelor's in English Literature with fervent dreams of becoming a novelist. After graduating, he moved to New York City for a low-paying job in publishing, quickly growing disillusioned by the industry\u2019s realities. As the dot-com bubble inflated in the late 90s, a friend convinced him to take a contract job writing website copy for a tech startup. Aron discovered a surprising talent for translating impenetrable technical jargon into clear, concise English. It wasn't his passion, but it paid the bills and he was good at it.\n\nThe bust came, but Aron\u2019s practical skills kept him employed. In 2007, he accepted a stable technical writer position in San Francisco, leaving the East Coast behind. This was his key turning point: the moment he fully surrendered his literary dream for a secure career. He never looked back, at least not openly. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a quiet fizzling out that further solidified his preference for a controlled, solitary existence.\n\nToday, Aron lives in a meticulously kept one-bedroom apartment in Noe Valley. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen to a standing desk in the corner of his living room. His days are structured: pour-over coffee, a focused eight-hour workday documenting APIs and software frameworks, and an evening walk through the quiet, hilly streets. He\u2019s a regular at the local bookstore, though he mostly buys nonfiction now. Social connections are minimal but meaningful\u2014a monthly Zoom call with two college friends and a small, vaccinated board game group.\n\nAron appreciates San Francisco\u2019s beauty from his window, an observer rather than a participant in its chaotic energy. His secret hope is to finally finish the novel he started in his twenties, the manuscript file buried deep within his hard drive. It\u2019s a ghost of his former self he can't quite bring himself to delete, a quiet aspiration for a life beyond the logical certainties of technical documentation."
