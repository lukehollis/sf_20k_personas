Her father, a history professor, filled their home with conversations about ancient civilizations and societal structures. This environment cultivated in Naomi a deep curiosity not for what people did, but *why* they did it. She naturally pursued this path, earning a Bachelor's and then a Master's degree in Social Anthropology, focusing her graduate thesis on the ritualistic behaviors of online gaming communities.\n\nHer academic path, however, led to a dead end of adjunct positions and dwindling grant opportunities. A pragmatic friend, already in tech, pointed out the obvious: her entire skill set\u2014ethnographic studies, interviews, behavioral analysis\u2014was exactly what companies were hiring for in User Experience (UX) Research. The transition felt like a betrayal of her academic roots, but the allure of stability and a San Francisco salary was undeniable. She landed a job at a major tech firm, trading dusty archives for sleek, open-plan offices and user data dashboards.\n\nNow 32, Naomi works entirely from her cozy, book-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a life of curated routine. Mornings begin with a foggy run through Golden Gate Park, followed by brewing a pour-over coffee from a local roaster. Her days are a digital mosaic of Zoom interviews with users across the globe, analyzing feedback, and translating human needs into product-design recommendations for engineers.\n\nShe thrives in the Inner Richmond\u2019s quieter, neighborhood-centric atmosphere, a world away from the frantic energy of SoMa where her company is headquartered. She finds community not in tech happy hours, but at her weekly pottery class\u2014a tangible, grounding escape from her screen-based life\u2014and with a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow academics and creatives who understand her internal conflict. Naomi\u2019s greatest aspiration is to bridge the gap between her two worlds: to lead research on technology that is ethically designed and genuinely improves human connection, proving that her anthropological soul didn't get lost in the pivot to Silicon Valley."
