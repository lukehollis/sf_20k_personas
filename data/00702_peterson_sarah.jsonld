Growing up in a modest Sacramento suburb, she was the responsible older sister to her brother, Mark, who battled a congenital heart defect from birth. Her childhood memories are a collage of sterile hallways, the smell of antiseptic, and the forced cheerfulness of pediatric wards. While her parents focused on Mark\u2019s complex medical needs, Sarah became an expert in navigating the emotional labyrinth of a family shaped by chronic illness. She was the family\u2019s anchor, learning early how to offer comfort when she herself was scared.\n\nMark\u2019s death when Sarah was a sophomore at UC Davis was not a shock, but a profound turning point. It solidified her life\u2019s purpose. She funneled her grief into action, pursuing a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley with a laser-focus on pediatric healthcare. Her goal was to become the person she and her family had so desperately needed: a specialized advocate to help children and their families cope with the overwhelming reality of long-term medical care.\n\nNow 36, Sarah has achieved her goal. She landed a demanding but deeply fulfilling role as a school social worker within a major San Francisco hospital. Her commute is nonexistent because she lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, just a five-minute walk from the hospital\u2019s Parnassus campus. Her days are an intense cycle of mediating between doctors and terrified parents, running support groups for young patients, and helping children keep up with schoolwork from their beds. Her life is inextricably woven into the institution she serves.\n\nHer social circle is small and tight-knit, composed mostly of fellow nurses and therapists who understand the emotional toll of their work. They share knowing glances over after-work drinks at a Cole Valley pub. While she finds immense meaning in her career, Sarah dreams of creating a broader legacy\u2014perhaps a non-profit dedicated to supporting the siblings of sick children, a group she knows is often overlooked. Lately, she has felt a quiet yearning for a life beyond the hospital's shadow, wondering if it\u2019s finally time to build personal relationships that aren\u2019t defined by crisis, and to find a San Francisco that exists outside the sound of a distant siren."
