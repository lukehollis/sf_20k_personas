The only child of Korean immigrants who ran a small, perpetually steaming dry-cleaning business in Daly City, she grew up surrounded by the scent of pressing chemicals and the rustle of plastic-wrapped clothes. Her parents didn't pressure her towards a specific career, only towards stability\u2014a concept that felt as comforting and necessary as the fog rolling over the hills. For them, success was a steady paycheck and a job that didn\u2019t break your back.\n\nFollowing this path of practicality, Chloe attended UC Davis, choosing statistics not out of passion but for its clear career trajectory. She was good at it, finding a certain peace in the logic of numbers and the clean resolution of a dataset. Her turning point wasn't a dramatic epiphany but a fortunate internship. A scrappy health-tech startup took a chance on her, and for a year she learned to wrangle chaotic data into coherent narratives. When the startup was acquired by a major biotech firm in South San Francisco, Chloe was brought along, a small but valuable asset in a massive corporate transfer.\n\nNow 24, Chloe\u2019s world is largely contained within the walls of her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her commute is a ten-step shuffle from her bed to her desk. Her days are a blur of Slack notifications, SQL queries, and virtual meetings, her window looking out onto the fog-laced streets. To combat the isolation of remote work, she has built a life of deliberate ritual. Mornings start with a walk to a specific Clement Street bakery for coffee and a pastry, her one guaranteed daily interaction. Evenings are for long, meditative runs through Golden Gate Park, tracing the same paths until the trees feel like old friends.\n\nHer social life is a work in progress. She maintains a text thread with college friends and occasionally braves the exhausting world of dating apps, but her most meaningful connection is at a weekly pottery class\u2014the one place where she creates something tangible, messy, and imperfect with her hands. Chloe dreams of leading a project where her data directly contributes to a medical breakthrough, to feel the human impact behind the numbers. More deeply, she hopes to one day feel less like a resident and more like a part of San Francisco\u2019s fabric, her personal story woven into the city she now calls home."
