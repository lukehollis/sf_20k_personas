The son of Gujarati immigrants who built a life running a small motel in Fremont, he was raised on expectations of business school or engineering. But Rishi was drawn to the tangible, the immediate. He saw the stress etched on his parents' faces and wanted a career with a clear, direct impact, not one spent managing spreadsheets. He found his path not at a UC, but at Skyline College, earning an Associate's Degree in Respiratory Care\u2014a choice his parents initially saw as a step down, but which Rishi viewed as a step *toward* purpose.\n\nHis career began steadily at a major San Francisco hospital. For years, he was the calm presence in the room, the expert who managed ventilators and helped patients breathe easier. Then came 2020. The pandemic was not just a challenge; it was a crucible that forged the man he is today. It was a relentless tide of 12-hour shifts, of holding iPads for final goodbyes, of developing an intimate familiarity with grief and exhaustion. He saw the very worst of the crisis, and in doing so, solidified his own sense of duty, even as it left him with a deep-seated burnout.\n\nThis experience reshaped his entire world. To eliminate any friction from his life, he moved into a small apartment in the Inner Sunset, just a three-minute walk from the hospital. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate act of self-preservation. His life is hyper-local: coffee from the corner cafe, groceries from the small market, a late-night beer with other nurses and therapists at the neighborhood pub. His social circle is a tight-knit group of colleagues who understand the unspoken weight they all carry.\n\nAt 39, Rishi is single, his last relationship having buckled under the strain of his pandemic schedule. He doesn't dream of wealth or climbing a career ladder. His aspirations are quieter now. He dreams of taking a three-month sabbatical to trek through Patagonia, a place with no beeping machines. He hopes to finally learn to play the secondhand acoustic guitar that has sat in his closet for two years. More than anything, Rishi hopes for a future defined not by crisis, but by calm, steady breaths\u2014both for his patients and for himself."

In that moment, the path to an MBA his parents preached felt like a hollow abstraction. The only thing that mattered was the desperate, physical need for air. That night, Rishi looked up the Respiratory Care program at Skyline. It wasn't rebellion; it was a direct answer to the panic he saw on his father's face, a turn toward something tangible and real.\n\n2.\nHe was barely twenty-five, just a few years into the job. The patient was a grandmother with severe pneumonia, her family terrified. For days, he\u2019d managed her ventilator, tweaking every setting. He remembers the profound quiet after the tube was removed, followed by her first, raspy words: \u201cThank you.\u201d In that simple phrase, he felt a surge of purpose so powerful it eclipsed his parents' lingering disappointment. This was his impact, measured not in dollars, but in breaths. It was the first time he truly felt proud.\n\n3.\nApril 2020. The patient\u2019s name was Elena. He remembers holding the iPad steady as her family sobbed on the screen, their faces a pixelated mosaic of grief. He was the sole witness to her last breath, the only human presence in a room dominated by the hiss of the ventilator. He felt less like a healer and more like a grim conduit for final goodbyes. That night, something inside him hardened into a solemn resolve. His job was no longer a career; it was a heavy duty he couldn't set down.\n\n4.\nIt was after a brutal 12-hour shift in late 2020. He was stuck in traffic on the Bay Bridge, the memory of a patient coding still searing his mind. Around him, people were listening to podcasts, complaining about their day. The dissonance was unbearable\u2014the chasm between their normalcy and the hell he\u2019d just left. Right there, gripping the wheel, he decided. He wasn't just moving; he was amputating the friction from his life. He needed his world to be three minutes long: a straight line from bed to work.\n\n5.\nAbout a year ago, on a rare quiet evening, the fog thick outside his Inner Sunset window. He saw the secondhand guitar leaning in the corner, gathering dust. For two years, it had been a symbol of failure, of time he didn't have. But that night, he didn\u2019t feel guilt. He felt a quiet flicker of possibility. He imagined the feel of the strings, a sound that wasn't a beep or an alarm. It was the first seed of a future he wanted: one defined not by necessity, but by choice."
