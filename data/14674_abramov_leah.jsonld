Her mother, a fiery Black ceramicist and community activist, and her father, a quiet Jewish history professor, raised her on a diet of social justice, art, and intellectual curiosity. Growing up multiracial in the vibrant, often turbulent Bay Area of the 80s and 90s, Leah developed a keen awareness of the fault lines in society and a deep-seated desire to bridge them. This calling led her to San Francisco State University, where a Bachelor's in Social Work felt less like a choice and more like a confirmation of her identity.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches of direct service, working with homeless youth in the Tenderloin. The work was vital but emotionally grueling. The turning point came after a particularly devastating week where she felt helpless against systemic failures, watching a promising young client fall back into crisis. Burned out but not broken, she made a strategic pivot. She realized she could effect greater change by shaping the systems themselves. She transitioned into program management, leveraging her field experience to design more empathetic and effective community health initiatives.\n\nNow 43, Leah is the respected Program Manager for a non-profit serving marginalized communities. Her days are a blur of grant writing, staff management, and building partnerships. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose resilience and artistic spirit mirror her own. Her 2.5-mile commute on the J-Church MUNI is her time to decompress, listening to educational podcasts or simply watching the city wake up.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit chosen family\u2014friends met through work and activism\u2014with whom she shares dinners, hikes in the Marin Headlands, and debates over politics. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, but she remains open to connection. Leah dreams of securing funding to launch a preventative mental health program for immigrant teens. On a personal level, she aspires to finally use the pottery wheel her mother gave her years ago, a quiet ambition to reconnect with her artistic roots and find balance in a life dedicated to the well-being of others."

Her mom wasn't just making bowls; she was making them for a community fundraiser. Her strong hands shaped the earth with a fierce, focused love. Her father watched from the doorway, a quiet, supportive presence. It wasn't just art; it was action. In that moment, Leah understood that creating something beautiful could be an act of resistance, fusing her artistic and activist identities before she even knew the words for them.\n\n2.\nThe memory is a fluorescent buzz in her tiny Tenderloin office. She was 29. She\u2019d just gotten the call that Marco, a brilliant kid she\u2019d fought for, was back on the street after the shelter\u2019s funding was cut. A wave of ice-cold helplessness washed over her, so profound it was almost clarifying. It wasn't just Marco\u2019s loss; it was the system\u2019s victory. That single moment of rage and despair solidified her conviction: she had to stop trying to rescue people from the flood and start trying to build a dam.\n\n3.\nAt 36, three years into her Program Manager role, she remembers the email notification that lit up her screen. It was the approval for the city grant she\u2019d spent months fighting for\u2014a pilot program for mobile health clinics. The number had so many zeros it looked unreal. It was a feeling of pure, unadulterated triumph, a stark contrast to her years of burnout. This was it. This was the other side: not just helping one person, but creating a lifeline for hundreds.\n\n4.\nThe end came on a foggy evening at Ocean Beach, just after she turned 38. They sat on a damp bench as her long-term partner said, lovingly but with finality, \"There's no room for me in your mission, Leah.\" She knew he was right. Her work wasn't a job; it was a calling that consumed her. There was no fight, just a deep, quiet sadness. It was the moment she fully accepted that the life she chose might be one she walked, for the most part, with her chosen family instead of a partner.\n\n5.\nFor her 40th birthday, her mother had the old pottery wheel delivered to her Mission apartment. \"For balance,\" her mom had said, her hands, now softer with age, resting on Leah's. The gift felt heavier than its physical weight\u2014it was a legacy, a challenge, an invitation back to herself. It sits in her corner still, covered by a sheet. That quiet, hulking shape is a daily reminder of her roots and a promise of a future where she makes time not just to build programs, but to simply create."
