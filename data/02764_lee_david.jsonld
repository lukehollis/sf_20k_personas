Born and raised in the fog-dusted avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, he was the only son of first-generation Chinese immigrants. His parents ran a small, bustling grocery store, their lives dictated by inventory and thin margins. They instilled in David a powerful work ethic and a deep-seated pragmatism, encouraging a stable career over a passionate one.\n\nHe honored their wishes, pursuing a Master's in Urban Planning, a field that satisfied his analytical mind and promised security. His early career was spent at a large corporate firm, managing the development of soulless office parks in Silicon Valley. A turning point came at 35, overlooking a sea of beige cubicles he had helped create. The profound lack of beauty in his work was a sudden, jarring revelation. Within a year, he\u2019d taken a significant pay cut to join a boutique architectural design firm in the city, shifting his focus from pure logistics to the art of building.\n\nNow, at 47, David is a Senior Project Manager, the essential bridge between visionary architects and the unforgiving reality of budgets and city permits. He lives in a converted live/work loft in Dogpatch, his 0.0-mile commute a deliberate lifestyle choice. His days are a disciplined routine: pour-over coffee while reviewing schematics, video calls with clients and contractors, and solitary lunchtime walks to appreciate the industrial skeletons and modern infill of his neighborhood.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few industry friends and a younger sister who works in tech. He\u2019s been single for several years, comfortable in his solitude but not entirely closed off to connection. David\u2019s deepest wish is a secret he keeps on his personal hard drive: folders of his own designs, not for grand skyscrapers, but for small, elegant public spaces\u2014a cantilevered bench overlooking the bay, a pocket park with a water reclamation feature. His ultimate dream is to one day step out from behind the spreadsheets and build something of his own, a small, permanent mark of beauty on the city that has been his lifelong backdrop."
