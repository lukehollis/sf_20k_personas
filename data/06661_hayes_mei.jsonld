The daughter of a pragmatic history professor from Ohio and a first-generation immigrant from Guangzhou who ran an herbal medicine shop in the Richmond District, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of Western academia and Eastern tradition. She grew up translating for her grandmother at doctor's appointments, witnessing firsthand the cultural and linguistic chasms within the American healthcare system. This duality became the cornerstone of her identity.\n\nInitially, she pursued sociology at UC Berkeley, fascinated by the macro-level forces that shaped communities. However, a key turning point came during her senior year when her mother faced a serious health scare. Navigating the impersonal, often confusing hospital bureaucracy for her parents crystallized Mei\u2019s purpose. Theory wasn't enough; she needed to build practical bridges. This led her to pursue a Master's in Public Health at UCSF, focusing on community outreach and health equity.\n\nNow, at 40, Mei is a Senior Program Manager, working remotely from her quiet Inner Sunset apartment. Her \"commute\" is the few steps from her bedroom to her standing desk, where she spends her days on video calls and analyzing data, designing programs that help non-English-speaking seniors access preventative care or connect new mothers with mental health resources. Her work is her mission, an extension of her own story.\n\nHer life is intentionally local. Mornings start with a walk in Golden Gate Park, fog clinging to the eucalyptus trees, before settling into her focused work. Evenings often involve a small, tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of educators and artists\u2014for dinner at a favorite neighborhood spot or a quiet night in with a book. She finds solace in the city\u2019s rhythms, from the clang of the N-Judah streetcar to the scent of saltwater on the breeze. Mei\u2019s dream isn't about climbing a corporate ladder, but about legacy. She hopes to one day see a program she designed become a self-sustaining, community-led initiative, a permanent fixture in the city that shaped her, finally closing the gaps she saw so clearly as a child."
