Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her minimalist one-bedroom apartment down a flight of stairs to \u201cVessel,\u201d the curated home goods and lifestyle boutique where she works as the Assistant Store Manager. This seamless integration of work and home is both a comfort and a cage.\n\nRaised in a quiet Sacramento suburb by a high school principal and a city planner, Simone\u2019s upbringing was stable, structured, and loving. Her parents championed practical career paths, so they were cautiously supportive when she chose to study Art History at UC Davis. Simone dreamed of curating exhibitions, of living a life surrounded by priceless art. She moved to San Francisco after graduation, brimming with academic knowledge but little practical experience.\n\nThe reality of the city\u2019s art scene was a harsh awakening. Unpaid internships she couldn't afford and intense competition for junior gallery positions quickly soured her dream. Needing to pay rent, she took a part-time sales associate job at Vessel, drawn to its elegant aesthetics and considered design. She intended for it to be a temporary stopgap. However, her innate eye for composition, her calm demeanor with difficult customers, and her meticulous organizational skills did not go unnoticed. Within three years, she was promoted to Assistant Manager. It was a turning point, a moment of accepting that her passion for curation could be applied to objects people lived with every day, not just those hung on museum walls.\n\nNow 32, Simone is a fixture in her neighborhood. She knows the baristas by name, has a friendly nod for the dog walkers, and maintains a polite but firm relationship with the regulars at the bar next door. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends, a welcome contrast to the constant public-facing nature of her job. Recently out of a long-term relationship, she spends her evenings quietly, sketching designs for her own future store\u2014a dream that has evolved from managing someone else\u2019s vision to creating her own. Simone\u2019s life may not be the one she painted for herself in college, but she is slowly, deliberately building something new on a foundation she never expected to love."
