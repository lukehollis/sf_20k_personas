Born in San Jose to hardworking immigrants from Jalisco, Mexico, he grew up as the designated translator and cultural bridge for his family. His father was a landscaper, his mother a housekeeper, and their world was one of long hours and unspoken anxieties. David\u2019s empathy was forged early on, navigating school systems and medical appointments for his parents, witnessing firsthand the cultural and linguistic chasms that could make healthcare feel inaccessible and frightening.\n\nThe turning point came when his mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness. David, then a college student at San Jos\u00e9 State, saw the profound impact a single, culturally competent hospital social worker had on his mother\u2019s care. This experience illuminated his path. He changed his major and, after graduating, enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, determined to become the person his family had so desperately needed.\n\nHis early career was spent in the demanding environment of a large San Francisco hospital, where he specialized in palliative care. He supported patients and families through harrowing diagnoses, providing a steady, compassionate presence amidst the clinical chaos. After fifteen years, seeking a more sustainable work-life balance, David transitioned to a private telehealth practice.\n\nNow 44, David lives and works from his serene Inner Sunset apartment, which he shares with his partner of eight years, a graphic designer named Alex. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from the kitchen to his home office. His mornings begin with strong coffee and a walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that grounds him before a day of video sessions with clients grappling with illness, grief, and trauma. In the evenings, he and Alex cook together or explore the neighborhood\u2019s low-key restaurants.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but understated. He is not a tech disruptor or a headline-maker, but a healer who provides an essential service from the quiet heart of his community. His aspiration is to one day supervise and mentor a new generation of bilingual social workers, ensuring that more families like the one he grew up in have a trusted advocate in their corner."
