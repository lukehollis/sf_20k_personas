Her life unfolds within a few square blocks, centered on \u201cThe Jade Pen,\u201d the beautifully curated stationery and gift shop she manages. She lives in the apartment directly above it, making her commute a simple walk down a creaky flight of stairs.\n\nBorn to first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, Amanda grew up stocking shelves and running the cash register at her parents' original, more utilitarian convenience store. She was the quiet, dutiful daughter, absorbing their work ethic while dreaming of a more creative life. In her early twenties, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, tentatively pursuing a degree in graphic design. The campus felt like a different world, one filled with artistic possibilities far removed from the daily grind of the family business.\n\nHer college journey was cut short after two years. Her father suffered a major stroke, and without hesitation, Amanda put her studies on indefinite hold to run the store, allowing her mother to become his full-time caregiver. What was meant to be a temporary measure became her life\u2019s work. After her father passed away a few years later, she used her dormant design skills to lovingly transform the humble corner store into The Jade Pen, honoring her heritage while building something that was uniquely hers.\n\nNow 44, Amanda\u2019s routine is a comforting rhythm of unlocking the shop door, arranging displays of Japanese paper and German fountain pens, and chatting with regulars who have become her extended family. Her social life consists of weekly dinners with a small circle of friends and monthly visits with her aging mother. While content, she harbors a quiet restlessness. She dreams not of escape, but of expansion\u2014launching an online store to share her curated collection with the world. A deeper, more private hope is for a partner who understands her deep-rooted sense of duty and can see the vibrant, creative woman who lives and dreams just above the shop."
