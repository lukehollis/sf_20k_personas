The only son of a materials science professor and a librarian who immigrated from Hyderabad, India, Sanjiv was raised in a household where academic achievement was the highest virtue. He dutifully pursued an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, fulfilling his father\u2019s expectations, but felt a persistent lack of purpose.\n\nHis turning point came during his MBA program at the University of Chicago. It was the late 1990s, the dawn of the dot-com boom, but a single elective on environmental economics ignited a passion. He realized he could apply his analytical mind not just to maximizing profit, but to fostering sustainable growth. Armed with his new degree, he bypassed Wall Street and headed west to San Francisco, drawn by the convergence of technology and progressive ideals.\n\nSanjiv\u2019s early career was a grind, working for large tech firms trying to build out their first \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives. He witnessed firsthand the corporate world\u2019s slow, often reluctant, pivot toward renewables. The key life event that solidified his path was personal: an amicable divorce that left him re-evaluating his priorities. He left his corporate job and became an independent consultant, wanting more control over his time and impact.\n\nNow, from his modern home in Potrero Hill, his commute is a walk from the kitchen to his home office. His days are a mix of intense international video calls and quiet, focused work analyzing solar grid efficiency models. His social life is centered around a small circle of friends from his hiking club and professional peers. He takes immense pride in his daughter, now a junior at UC Berkeley studying environmental policy, seeing his own passion reflected in her.\n\nSanjiv\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder. He aspires to transition from consulting to a board position at a promising green tech startup, mentoring the next generation. He finds profound contentment in his routine: a morning espresso overlooking the Bay Bridge, a challenging day of work, and an evening walk through his quiet, hilly neighborhood, feeling a deep connection to the city that allowed him to build a life, and a career, of true purpose."

The professor, a man with chalk dust on his sleeves, was diagramming a carbon tax model on the board. For Sanjiv, it was like a light switching on in a dim room. The vague sense of duty that had guided him through his engineering degree dissolved, replaced by a thrilling clarity. He saw how his analytical mind could have a purpose beyond a balance sheet. That single lecture charted the course for the rest of his life.\n\n***\n\n2.\nShortly after moving to San Francisco in the early 2000s, a friend took him up to Twin Peaks at dusk. As the wind whipped around him, he stared at the grid of lights sprawling to the bay, so different from the flat, grey horizons of Michigan and Chicago. He felt a profound sense of arrival, a physical and emotional liberation from his past. This wasn't his father\u2019s dream or a corporate mandate; this glittering, progressive city was a choice he had made entirely for himself. It was home.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe decision came not with a bang, but in the sterile silence of his corporate office one night, around 2008. The divorce papers were signed, life felt stripped to its studs, and he was staring at a presentation about a marginal gain in corporate efficiency. He felt a sudden, overwhelming sense of suffocation. He realized he didn\u2019t just want a new apartment; he wanted a new life. He started drafting his resignation email right then, choosing the terrifying freedom of consulting over the comfortable cage of his job.\n\n***\n\n4.\nA few years ago, his daughter, then a high school senior, quietly asked him to read her college application essay. She wrote about growing up watching him work, seeing his passion for renewables not as a job but as a personal mission. He had to stop reading, overwhelmed. The academic path his own father had laid out for him was one of duty, but he saw in his daughter a passion she had found on her own, sparked by his example. It was the deepest validation of his life.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last week, on an evening walk through Potrero Hill, he paused at the top of a steep street. The downtown skyline was piercing through a low bank of fog, the Bay Bridge lights just beginning to glow. A complex modeling problem he\u2019d wrestled with all day suddenly untangled in his mind. He felt a wave of pure contentment\u2014the challenging work, the beauty of the city, the sense of purpose. This quiet moment, he thought, was the success he had been searching for all along."
