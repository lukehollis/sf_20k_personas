The only son of a materials science professor and a librarian who immigrated from Hyderabad, India, Sanjiv was raised in a household where academic achievement was the highest virtue. He dutifully pursued an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, fulfilling his father\u2019s expectations, but felt a persistent lack of purpose.\n\nHis turning point came during his MBA program at the University of Chicago. It was the late 1990s, the dawn of the dot-com boom, but a single elective on environmental economics ignited a passion. He realized he could apply his analytical mind not just to maximizing profit, but to fostering sustainable growth. Armed with his new degree, he bypassed Wall Street and headed west to San Francisco, drawn by the convergence of technology and progressive ideals.\n\nSanjiv\u2019s early career was a grind, working for large tech firms trying to build out their first \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives. He witnessed firsthand the corporate world\u2019s slow, often reluctant, pivot toward renewables. The key life event that solidified his path was personal: an amicable divorce that left him re-evaluating his priorities. He left his corporate job and became an independent consultant, wanting more control over his time and impact.\n\nNow, from his modern home in Potrero Hill, his commute is a walk from the kitchen to his home office. His days are a mix of intense international video calls and quiet, focused work analyzing solar grid efficiency models. His social life is centered around a small circle of friends from his hiking club and professional peers. He takes immense pride in his daughter, now a junior at UC Berkeley studying environmental policy, seeing his own passion reflected in her.\n\nSanjiv\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder. He aspires to transition from consulting to a board position at a promising green tech startup, mentoring the next generation. He finds profound contentment in his routine: a morning espresso overlooking the Bay Bridge, a challenging day of work, and an evening walk through his quiet, hilly neighborhood, feeling a deep connection to the city that allowed him to build a life, and a career, of true purpose."
