Born to a pragmatic Cantonese mother who immigrated in the 1970s and a second-generation Irish-American father with a poet\u2019s heart, Mei grew up navigating two distinct worlds. She was the family's de facto translator and cultural navigator, a role that planted the seeds of her future career. This constant code-switching between her mother\u2019s expectations and her father\u2019s idealism fostered a deep empathy and a keen understanding of unspoken needs.\n\nHer educational journey was a search for a way to channel this inherent skill. After completing her undergraduate degree, she pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, feeling an immediate connection to the field\u2019s principles of advocacy and support. Mei began her career at a large downtown hospital, working with patients facing sudden, life-altering diagnoses. While fulfilling, the relentless pace and bureaucratic limitations eventually led to burnout. The turning point came a decade ago when she decided to leave the hospital system and open her own private practice.\n\nNow, at 45, Mei lives and works out of her tranquil Inner Sunset apartment, her commute a few steps to a dedicated home office. Her practice is entirely telehealth-based, specializing in grief counseling and supporting adults navigating family complexities, particularly those from multicultural backgrounds. Her days have a gentle rhythm: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, often shrouded in fog; back-to-back virtual sessions with clients; and evenings spent cooking with her long-term partner, a landscape architect named Finn. Her social life is small but deep, centered around a bi-weekly book club and dinners with a handful of old friends.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of quiet permanence. She has witnessed the city\u2019s frantic transformations but finds solace in its constants: the sound of the foghorns, the view from Grandview Park, and the familiar shops along Irving Street. Her dream isn't fame or fortune, but to continue deepening her practice, perhaps by creating a therapeutic writing group for other bicultural individuals to share their stories. For Mei, success is measured in the quiet breakthroughs her clients achieve and the peaceful, integrated life she has carefully built for herself."

The doctor spoke of \u201cchronic migraines,\u201d and Mei had to find the right Cantonese words, ones that conveyed seriousness without causing alarm for her mother. In that moment, translating not just language but fear and hope, she felt the weight of being a bridge between her two worlds. It solidified a sense of duty that would later, thankfully, transform into a calling to help others navigate their own difficult translations of life.\n\n2.\nIt happened during her first semester pursuing her Master's. A professor used the term \"cultural brokerage,\" and the words landed with the force of a revelation. Suddenly, her childhood\u2014the constant mediating between her father\u2019s poetry and her mother\u2019s pragmatism\u2014had a name. It wasn\u2019t just a family quirk; it was a recognized skill. A wave of profound validation washed over her, legitimizing her entire path and transforming what felt like a private burden into a professional purpose.\n\n3.\nShe remembers the fluorescent glare of the hospital hallway, her plea for a specific dialect translator for a dying man's family repeatedly denied by protocol. She saw the family\u2019s grief curdle into confusion, their needs lost in bureaucracy. In that moment of profound powerlessness, her burnout crystalized into a quiet, firm decision. She could no longer work where the system obstructed true care. She had to build her own space, one centered entirely on the person, not the process.\n\n4.\nTen years ago, she sat in her Inner Sunset apartment, the silence a stark contrast to the hospital\u2019s din. She watched the little icon spin, waiting for her very first telehealth client to join the call. The fear was a knot in her stomach. But when the face appeared, and she began to listen\u2014truly listen, without a clock ticking on the wall or a pager on her hip\u2014an overwhelming sense of peace settled in her. It was the first day of her real work.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, walking with Finn through a foggy Golden Gate Park, she felt the weight of a difficult client session. He stopped and pointed to a gnarled Monterey Cypress, explaining how the constant wind shaped its growth, making it stronger. It wasn't broken, just adapted. The simple, profound metaphor landed deep within her. It became a touchstone for her practice: seeing the resilient beauty in a life shaped by persistent, challenging forces and finding solace in the city's constants."
