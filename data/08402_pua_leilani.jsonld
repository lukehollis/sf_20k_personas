Raised in Daly City, the daughter of a Filipino father who worked as a BART mechanic and a Native Hawaiian mother who taught hula, Leilani\u2019s home was a museum of its own. It was filled not with framed canvases, but with hand-carved *bulul* figures from the Philippines and the scent of plumeria from her mother\u2019s leis. Art, for her, was never a static object on a wall; it was heritage, movement, and a story whispered across generations.\n\nHer formal educational journey began at UC Santa Cruz, where she pursued Art History, feeling a constant pull to bridge the academic world with the living culture of her upbringing. The true turning point was a summer internship at the de Young Museum. There, amidst the vast collections, she realized her passion wasn't just in studying art, but in shaping the conversation around it. She went on to earn her Master's in Museum Studies from the University of San Francisco, focusing her thesis on contemporary Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander artists in the diaspora.\n\nToday, Leilani is the curator of \"The Loom,\" a small but influential gallery in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her immersive lifestyle; she lives in a modest loft apartment directly above the gallery space. Her days are a blur of caffeine from a local cafe, emailing with artists, meticulously planning exhibitions, and writing descriptive wall text that seeks to connect, not intimidate. Her social circle is an extension of her work\u2014a tight-knit group of artists, writers, and fellow creatives who often gather for late-night talks over Mission burritos after an opening.\n\nLeilani\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-specific. She feels the city\u2019s pulse not in its iconic landmarks, but in the murals of Clarion Alley and the creative energy humming through her gallery walls. Her dream is to elevate The Loom into a premier platform for emerging AAPI artists, giving them the visibility she feels they have long been denied. Her ultimate aspiration isn't for personal fame, but to one day see an artist she discovered acquired by SFMOMA, securing their story, and a piece of her own, into the permanent fabric of the city."
