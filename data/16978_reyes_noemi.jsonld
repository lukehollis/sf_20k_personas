Born to a Pueblo mother and a Mexican-American father, her early childhood was steeped in the traditions of her tribe, learning about generational resilience and the sacredness of community from her grandmother. When she was eight, her family moved to California's Central Valley, seeking better opportunities in agricultural work. There, Noemi witnessed firsthand the toll that systemic stress, financial hardship, and a lack of culturally competent care took on her community. This experience became the unshakable foundation of her life's purpose.\n\nDriven by a quiet determination, she excelled in school, earning a scholarship to UC Davis and later pursuing her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. It was during an internship at a community clinic in Oakland that she found her calling. She saw that helping individuals was vital, but supporting the systems and the people within them\u2014the teachers, nurses, and advocates\u2014could create a ripple effect of wellness. This led her to her current role as an Employee Assistance Program Counselor, where she provides crucial mental health support to healthcare and education professionals. It's a demanding job, listening to the burnout of the city's helpers, but she considers it a modern form of the community care her grandmother taught her.\n\nToday, Noemi lives in a small but sunny apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose vibrant murals and Latino heritage feel like a tangible link to her own roots. Her 2.5-mile commute on the MUNI bus is a time for reflection, listening to podcasts or simply watching the city wake up. Her home is decorated with art from Southwestern artists and pottery that reminds her of New Mexico. Her social life is a close-knit circle of friends, a chosen family of fellow BIPOC professionals who navigate the complexities of identity and ambition in the Bay Area.\n\nNoemi\u2019s dream is to one day open a wellness practice that integrates traditional Indigenous healing philosophies with clinical social work. She envisions a space that honors the whole person\u2014spirit, mind, and community. For now, she finds fulfillment in her work, building bridges between ancient wisdom and modern needs, one counseling session at a time."

Her grandmother didn\u2019t speak much, but hummed a low, steady song while they worked, shaping small pots under the New Mexico sun. The memory isn\u2019t about making pottery; it\u2019s about the quiet transfer of knowledge, the feeling of being held in a tradition that stretched back generations. It was her first lesson in how care could be communicated without a single word, a foundational sense of peace she now tries to offer her clients.\n\n2.\nAt ten, she learned that silence had a weight. She saw it in her father\u2019s shoulders after a brutal day in the Central Valley fields, an exhaustion that went deeper than muscle. He wouldn\u2019t talk about the foreman\u2019s disrespect or the unfair pay, but the injustice filled their small house. That feeling of helpless anger, of witnessing a good man worn down by a system that didn\u2019t see him, planted a seed of fierce resolve in her. She wouldn\u2019t just get by; she would learn the language of that system to one day dismantle it from within.\n\n3.\nThe turning point came during her master's internship in Oakland. A public school teacher, her first client of the day, broke down not because of a student, but because she couldn\u2019t afford her own child\u2019s daycare. In that moment, Noemi saw the whole ecosystem of care collapse. The helper was drowning. A profound clarity washed over her: to heal a community, you must first tend to its healers. It was then she knew her life\u2019s work wasn\u2019t on the front lines, but just behind them, holding them up.\n\n4.\nHer first Saturday morning in the Mission was foggy and grey, but then she turned onto 24th Street. The explosion of color from the murals felt like a physical shock. She saw faces that looked like her family, a defiant eagle, imagery of ceremony and resistance painted right onto the concrete. The scent of pan dulce drifted from a bakery. In that moment, the ache of disconnection she\u2019d carried since leaving New Mexico dissolved. This city wasn\u2019t just a career move; it was a place she could belong.\n\n5.\nLast month, crowded around her small dining table with her chosen family\u2014a lawyer, a doctor, a tech founder\u2014the conversation turned to code-switching. They laughed, sharing stories of shrinking parts of themselves for professional survival. In the easy flow of understanding and validation, Noemi felt the same profound security she\u2019d felt by her grandmother\u2019s side. This, she realized, was the modern form of community care. This was how they ensured their own resilience, together."
