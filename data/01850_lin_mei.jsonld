Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood was a symphony of Cantonese spoken over the hiss of a wok and the rumbling of the 38 Geary bus. Her father ran a small grocery on Clement Street, and her mother was a seamstress. They instilled in Mei a profound sense of duty and the expectation that she would pursue a prestigious, stable career like medicine or engineering.\n\nHer quiet rebellion began at SF State. While majoring in sociology, she volunteered at a community health clinic in the Tenderloin. It was there, listening to the stories of the city\u2019s most vulnerable, that she found her calling. The intricate puzzles of human struggle were more compelling than any textbook. Defying her parents' initial disappointment, she pursued a Master of Social Work, dedicating herself to understanding the systems that failed people.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when she accepted a position as a clinical social worker at a large, comprehensive care facility for seniors, located right in the Inner Richmond. The job came with a small, subsidized apartment on the campus grounds, and suddenly, her commute vanished. Her life became her work, and her work, her life. This immersion was both a blessing and a curse, blurring the lines between her professional and personal self.\n\nNow at 41, Mei\u2019s days are a structured blend of patient counseling, family mediations, and crisis intervention. She lives and breathes the concerns of the elderly residents, many of whom remind her of her own aging parents. Her social life is small but deep\u2014a weekly dim sum with her retired parents, who are now proud of her work, and drinks with a few trusted colleagues. She finds her solitude on foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, a necessary escape from the contained world of the care facility.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyper-local; she rarely leaves her two-square-mile radius. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder but to pioneer a program within her facility focusing on culturally-sensitive mental healthcare for elderly AAPI residents, helping them navigate the challenges of aging in a country that isn't always their own. She seeks not wealth, but a legacy of profound, quiet impact."
