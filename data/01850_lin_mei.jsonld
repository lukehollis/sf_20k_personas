Born to first-generation Chinese immigrants, her childhood was a symphony of Cantonese spoken over the hiss of a wok and the rumbling of the 38 Geary bus. Her father ran a small grocery on Clement Street, and her mother was a seamstress. They instilled in Mei a profound sense of duty and the expectation that she would pursue a prestigious, stable career like medicine or engineering.\n\nHer quiet rebellion began at SF State. While majoring in sociology, she volunteered at a community health clinic in the Tenderloin. It was there, listening to the stories of the city\u2019s most vulnerable, that she found her calling. The intricate puzzles of human struggle were more compelling than any textbook. Defying her parents' initial disappointment, she pursued a Master of Social Work, dedicating herself to understanding the systems that failed people.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when she accepted a position as a clinical social worker at a large, comprehensive care facility for seniors, located right in the Inner Richmond. The job came with a small, subsidized apartment on the campus grounds, and suddenly, her commute vanished. Her life became her work, and her work, her life. This immersion was both a blessing and a curse, blurring the lines between her professional and personal self.\n\nNow at 41, Mei\u2019s days are a structured blend of patient counseling, family mediations, and crisis intervention. She lives and breathes the concerns of the elderly residents, many of whom remind her of her own aging parents. Her social life is small but deep\u2014a weekly dim sum with her retired parents, who are now proud of her work, and drinks with a few trusted colleagues. She finds her solitude on foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, a necessary escape from the contained world of the care facility.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyper-local; she rarely leaves her two-square-mile radius. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder but to pioneer a program within her facility focusing on culturally-sensitive mental healthcare for elderly AAPI residents, helping them navigate the challenges of aging in a country that isn't always their own. She seeks not wealth, but a legacy of profound, quiet impact."

She watched an elderly woman, Mrs. Yee, count out her coins, her face tight with worry. As Mei\u2019s father bagged the vegetables, he turned his back for a moment and slipped in an extra orange, a silent act of grace. It wasn\u2019t charity; it was dignity. That quiet gesture became the foundation of her understanding of care, a lesson learned not in a classroom, but on the worn linoleum of Clement Street.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, volunteering in the Tenderloin, she sat with an elderly Vietnamese man who spoke in fractured English. He wasn\u2019t talking about his health, but about a small tin box of photographs he\u2019d lost\u2014his only link to his late wife. As he wept, Mei felt the abstract theories of sociology dissolve. This was the real work: not analyzing systems, but safeguarding the fragile, irreplaceable archives of a human heart. That day, she changed her major in her mind, choosing stories over statistics, a decision that would disappoint her parents for years.\n\n3.\nIt happened during their weekly dim sum, five years into her job. Mei was describing a difficult case, an aging Cantonese man refusing care. She expected her father\u2019s usual, weary sigh. Instead, he picked up the teapot and, breaking tradition, poured her tea before his own. No words were exchanged, but the clink of the porcelain cup was deafening. It was an acknowledgment, a passing of the torch. In that small, steamy restaurant, the weight of a decade of disapproval finally lifted from her shoulders.\n\n4.\nHer first year at the senior facility, she was assigned to Mrs. Chan, who had been silent since a stroke. Mei would speak to her in Cantonese, recounting neighborhood gossip, getting no response. One afternoon, exhausted, she hummed a lullaby her own mother used to sing. Mrs. Chan\u2019s eyes, cloudy and distant, focused on hers. Her fingers, frail and still, curled around Mei's hand. It was the first time she understood that connection wasn\u2019t just about language, but about accessing a shared, hidden world.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy Saturday afternoon, she was walking through the AIDS Memorial Grove, her one true escape. She saw Mr. Davies, one of her most challenging residents, sitting on a bench with his daughter, something they hadn't done in years. Mei's first instinct was professional\u2014to analyze, to file away the data point of progress. She quickly suppressed it, forcing herself to be a stranger in the park. This constant, internal negotiation between her role and her self was the quiet tax of living where she worked."
