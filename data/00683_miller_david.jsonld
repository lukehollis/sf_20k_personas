The son of an engineer and a high school librarian, he grew up in a home that valued logic and literature in equal measure. This duality defined his path. While his peers pursued MBAs, David earned a Master\u2019s in Philosophy, fascinated by ethics and systems of thought. However, the academic world felt too detached, and the dot-com boom of the late 90s beckoned with promises of practical application.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in 1998, a city crackling with manic energy. David discovered his philosophy background was surprisingly valuable; he could deconstruct complex business problems, identify flawed logic in strategies, and translate human chaos into streamlined systems. He thrived, riding the wave of the boom, surviving the bust through sheer competence, and slowly building a reputation as a brilliant, if intense, management consultant.\n\nHis relentless drive, however, came at a personal cost. A marriage that began with shared dreams of changing the world dissolved a decade ago under the weight of 100-hour workweeks and emotional distance. The divorce was a key turning point. Instead of reconnecting with the world, David retreated further into his work, the one area where the inputs and outputs were clear.\n\nNow, at 51, David lives a life of curated solitude in a modern SoMa condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to a meticulously organized home office overlooking the Bay Bridge. His days are a disciplined sequence of video calls, data analysis, and strategic reports. Evenings are for solo runs along the Embarcadero and quiet dinners with a glass of Napa Cabernet. He is professionally respected and financially secure, yet socially untethered.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of utility more than passion. He appreciates the city\u2019s innovation and access but rarely partakes in its vibrant, messy culture. His primary hope is no longer professional, but personal: to write a book bridging the gap between classical philosophy and modern tech ethics. He dreams of proving that the principles he once studied have more value than just optimizing a client\u2019s bottom line, hoping to finally merge the two halves of his own life."
