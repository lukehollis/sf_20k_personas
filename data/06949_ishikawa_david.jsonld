            "value": "David Ishikawa is the quiet pulse of the 300-unit SoMa high-rise he calls both home and office. Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, David is a third-generation San Franciscan. His parents, both Sansei (third-generation Japanese Americans), ran a small neighborhood nursery, instilling in him a respect for hard work and the subtle art of making things grow. They dreamed of him being the first in the family to get a four-year degree, pushing him towards a white-collar future.\n\nHe tried to meet their expectations, enrolling at San Francisco State University in the early 1990s to study industrial design. He had a good eye and steady hands, filling sketchbooks with sleek, ergonomic furniture. But the abstract theory of the classroom never fully clicked. When his father suffered a major heart attack during his sophomore year, David left school without a second thought to help run the nursery and support his mother. The design dream was shelved, a casualty of necessity.\n\nHe drifted into construction work, initially for the immediate income, but soon discovered a deep satisfaction in the tangible world of plumbing, electrical systems, and structural repairs. He found a new kind of creativity in problem-solving, in diagnosing the groans of an old building. His career became a slow, steady climb from apprentice to a trusted facilities maintenance lead. His personal life was similarly quiet; a brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably, leaving him with a cherished daughter, Maya, who now works in tech and lives across town in the Mission.\n\nDavid\u2019s entire world exists within the polished concrete and glass of his building. His commute is an elevator ride. His day begins before sunrise, walking the floors and checking the boiler rooms, greeting the early-rising residents by name. He is the building\u2019s memory, the keeper of its secrets and systems. His connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t through its trendy restaurants or cultural events, but through the intricate web of lives he supports. In the evenings, after the last repair ticket is closed, he works on his own project in the building\u2019s workshop: slowly restoring a vintage 1978 Honda motorcycle. It\u2019s his hope for the future\u2014a small, gleaming piece of freedom he\u2019s building with his own two hands."
