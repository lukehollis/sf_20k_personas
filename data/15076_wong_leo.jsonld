Adopted as an infant by a warm, second-generation Chinese-American couple, he grew up in the fog-kissed avenues of the Outer Richmond. He was Leo Wong, a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes who celebrated Lunar New Year with red envelopes, spoke halting Cantonese with his grandmother, and felt the deep, unspoken complexities of being an outsider within his own loving family. This unique upbringing, a constant navigation of identity and belonging, planted the seeds for his future career. While his parents, a pharmacist and an accountant, hoped he\u2019d pursue a more traditional path, Leo found himself drawn to understanding the invisible threads that hold families together\u2014or pull them apart.\n\nHis educational journey was a direct line from this childhood curiosity. After earning a psychology degree from UC Davis, he returned to the city to pursue his Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy at the University of San Francisco. A pivotal moment came during his internship when he counseled a teenager struggling with their biracial identity. Seeing a reflection of his own internal journey in someone else solidified his calling. Now, as an Associate MFT, he works for a community health agency, providing accessible therapy to low-income families and students. The work is demanding, leaving him emotionally spent but profoundly fulfilled.\n\nLeo\u2019s life is quintessentially San Franciscan. He shares a cramped but light-filled apartment in Hayes Valley with two roommates, a tech worker and a graphic designer. His day starts with a strong coffee from a local cafe before he catches the Muni for his 3.8-mile commute. Evenings are often spent decompressing with a run through the Panhandle or meeting friends for happy hour. He remains close with his parents, visiting them for Sunday dinners in the Richmond, a comforting ritual that grounds him.\n\nHis aspirations are deeply tied to his past. Leo\u2019s primary goal is to complete his clinical hours and become a fully licensed LMFT. He dreams of one day opening a small private practice specializing in transracial adoption and adolescent identity issues, creating a space for others to navigate the questions that have defined his own life. For Leo, San Francisco isn't just his home; it\u2019s the city that gave him his family, his name, and his purpose."

In the family photo, he stood between his cousins, a small, blonde-haired island in a sea of black hair. He held his red envelope tightly, smiling for the camera, but a quiet question echoed inside him. It wasn\u2019t sadness, but a confusing awareness of difference. That photo was the first time he understood that love and belonging could feel wonderfully, inexplicably complicated. The feeling would become the foundation of his empathy.\n\n***\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, a classmate squinted at him. \"Wong? But you're... white. Where are you *really* from?\" Leo just said, \"The Richmond District,\" but the boy pushed back, unsatisfied. In that moment, Leo felt a flash of hot frustration, the exhaustion of having to explain his own existence. It sharpened his resolve, not to fit in, but to understand the very nature of identity itself. He realized his life story wasn't just his own; it was a phenomenon he needed to explore.\n\n***\n\n3.\nDuring his USF internship, a 15-year-old client whispered, \"I feel like a ghost. Not really Filipino, not really white. Just... floating.\" The words struck Leo like lightning. It was the raw, unfiltered truth of his own childhood heart. In that therapy room, seeing his own reflection in the boy's struggle, his academic interest ignited into a life's mission. He wasn't just learning to be a therapist; he was finally learning how to use the map of his own painful journey to guide others home.\n\n***\n\n4.\nLast Sunday, after a brutal week at the clinic, he sat in his parents' kitchen. The scent of black bean sauce and the sound of his dad complaining about the 49ers filled the warm air. His grandmother patted his hand, asking in Cantonese if he was eating enough. He only understood half her words but felt all of the love. The anxieties of his youth had quieted, replaced by a profound gratitude for this unique, unshakable foundation. This was his anchor, the very definition of family.\n\n***\n\n5.\nHe remembers a specific run through the Panhandle just a few months ago. The weight of a difficult case pressed on his chest, but as the cool fog rolled in and the evening light filtered through the eucalyptus trees, his rhythm found the city's pulse. With each stride on the dirt path, he felt the emotional static of his day begin to fade. It was a simple, solitary moment that affirmed everything: San Francisco wasn't just his home; it was his sanctuary."
