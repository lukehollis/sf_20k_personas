Born in Busan, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by a boisterous, kind-hearted Irish-American couple, Fiona and Sean O\u2019Connell. He grew up in San Francisco's Sunset District, a a cultural bridge in a single body\u2014celebrating St. Patrick's Day with fervor and quietly cherishing the Korean pottery his parents filled their home with. His upbringing was filled with love, but also a gentle sense of being gracefully out of place, a feeling that would shape his life\u2019s trajectory.\n\nFollowing a well-intentioned push from his parents towards a \"stable\" career, Liam enrolled at San Francisco State University to study business. He lasted three semesters. The world of spreadsheets and marketing plans felt hollow and distant. The turning point came while volunteering at a community center\u2019s summer camp. Surrounded by the chaotic, unfiltered energy of young children, Liam felt a sense of purpose click into place. He discovered a talent for de-escalating tantrums, sparking imagination with simple stories, and being a calm anchor in a storm of feelings. He dropped out of college, a decision that initially worried his parents but ultimately earned their respect.\n\nHe spent the next decade working his way through various early childhood education centers, earning his Child Development Associate credential along the way. For the past eight years, he has been the beloved \"Mr. Liam\" at The Little Sprouts Cooperative, a small, play-based preschool housed in a converted Victorian in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a unique perk; he lives in the building's small garden apartment, his rent subsidized as part of his compensation.\n\nLiam's daily life is a gentle rhythm. Mornings are for circle time and art projects, afternoons for playground supervision and naps. His social circle is woven from the school\u2019s community\u2014the parents he advises and the teachers he calls friends. He is single, having ended a long-term relationship years ago with someone whose ambitions didn't align with his grounded life. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of depth. He hopes to one day become the school's lead teacher and, more personally, to save enough to finally visit South Korea, not to find a family, but to connect with a landscape that exists only in his imagination. For Liam, success is the sound of children's laughter through his apartment window and the profound sense of belonging he has built for himself, right here in his corner of the city."
