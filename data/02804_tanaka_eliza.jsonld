A third-generation San Franciscan, Eliza was raised in the lingering shadow of Japantown, her grandparents\u2019 unspoken stories of internment instilling in her a deep appreciation for stability. Her parents, a pragmatic grocer and a bookkeeper, encouraged a steady path, but Eliza was a dreamer. She lost herself in the halls of the de Young Museum and enrolled at SF State, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History with vibrant dreams of becoming a curator.\n\nLife, however, demanded pragmatism over passion. In her early twenties, her father\u2019s sudden illness required a reliable income and solid health insurance. Eliza set aside her museum aspirations and took an administrative position at a UCSF research lab. What was meant to be a temporary detour became a career. For nearly three decades, she has been the organized, indispensable force behind brilliant scientists, her life measured in grant deadlines and color-coded spreadsheets.\n\nThe 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a post-pandemic shift to remote work that has further condensed her world. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: coffee as the fog rolls over Mount Sutro, the hum of her laptop, and a quiet lunch in her small garden, where she meticulously tends to her succulents. Her social connections are cherished but few\u2014a weekly call with her brother in Sacramento, a monthly book club with two friends she\u2019s known since college. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, leaving her comfortably, if sometimes wistfully, solitary.\n\nEliza\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or trendy restaurants, but of a quiet, abiding love. She has watched the city convulse with change from her serene perch, finding solace in the constants: the scent of eucalyptus in Golden Gate Park, the historic streetcars clattering down Judah Street. Her old dream of a life in art hasn't died, but transformed. Recently, she began volunteering at the Japanese Cultural and Community Center, archiving old photographs. It\u2019s not the de Young, but in connecting her community to its past, she\u2019s finally curating a story that feels entirely her own."
