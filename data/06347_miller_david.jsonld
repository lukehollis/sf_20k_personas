            "value": "David Miller\u2019s world is a curated space of 3,000 square feet in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. Raised in a quiet Sacramento suburb, he was the son of a pragmatic CPA and a librarian mother who inadvertently nurtured his aesthetic sensibilities. While his father taught him the logic of numbers, his mother\u2019s world of ordered books and quiet contemplation instilled in him a love for form and narrative. This split influence defined his path.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree in Art History at UC Davis, but a post-graduation stint at a small, passionate but financially doomed San Francisco gallery during the 2008 recession was his true education. He watched idealism crumble against economic reality. This pivotal failure drove him to pursue a Master\u2019s degree in Museum Studies, arming himself with the business acumen he realized was essential to protect the art he loved.\n\nUpon graduating, David\u2019s blend of artistic passion and financial pragmatism made him a unique asset. He worked his way up, finally securing the funding to open his own space, Galerie V, ten years ago. His most critical decision was leasing a live/work loft, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of custom steel stairs from his minimalist apartment to the gallery floor below. His life and work are completely intertwined.\n\nAt 40, David is a respected figure in the SF art scene. His days are a routine of caffeine, emails, and conversations with artists and collectors. Evenings are for openings, industry dinners, or rare, quiet nights reading in his apartment, the faint smell of oil paint and wood polish a constant companion. His relationships have often been casualties of his devotion to the gallery; he is more comfortable with an artist\u2019s statement than a vulnerable conversation.\n\nHis primary aspiration is no longer just success, but legacy. David dreams of discovering an unknown Bay Area artist and launching their career, providing the stability he once saw evaporate. He is deeply rooted not in San Francisco as a whole, but in the specific, creative ecosystem of his neighborhood. He is the quiet curator, not just of his gallery, but of his own life, perpetually seeking the next masterpiece to give a home."
