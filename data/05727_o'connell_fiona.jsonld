Raised in the East Bay by a pragmatic teacher and a union electrician, Fiona developed an early fascination with the systems that held the Bay Area together\u2014the bridges, the BART lines, the seemingly chaotic ballet of traffic. She saw infrastructure not as concrete and steel, but as the connective tissue of a community, a belief that propelled her toward a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning.\n\nShe landed her dream job at the SFMTA right out of grad school, dedicating her twenties and early thirties to untangling the city\u2019s complex transit arteries. She was a true believer, a daily Muni rider who felt a surge of pride when a bus she helped reschedule arrived on time. Her life was measured in project deadlines and community outreach meetings. A passionate seven-year relationship ended amicably when her partner, an architect, chose the affordability and space of Portland over the constrained energy of San Francisco, a move Fiona couldn\u2019t bring herself to make.\n\nThe pandemic was the great pivot. Her vital, in-the-streets job flattened into a series of Zoom calls and data sheets. The 0.0-mile commute became permanent, a strange perk that disconnected her from the very systems she was paid to improve. Now, at 38, her days follow a quiet rhythm: coffee from the cafe on 9th Avenue, hours spent analyzing traffic flow models from her bay window, and long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park to decompress. Her social life is a small, tight circle of old friends who understand her deep, almost familial, bond with the city.\n\nFiona\u2019s greatest aspiration is to see her long-term projects for a more pedestrian-friendly Geary Boulevard or an expanded N-Judah line break ground. She dreams of a city that is more equitable and accessible for everyone. On a personal level, she quietly longs to feel less like an observer and more like a participant in her own life again, hoping to find a connection that makes her want to cross town for something other than a site inspection."
