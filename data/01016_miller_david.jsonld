Raised by a stoic mechanic father and a kind but emotionally reserved librarian mother, his childhood was stable yet lacked a language for feelings. This quiet void cultivated in him a deep curiosity about the inner lives of others, a curiosity that would later define his professional calling.\n\nHe drifted after high school, working odd jobs until a volunteer stint at a youth crisis shelter cracked his world open. Witnessing raw human struggle and resilience ignited a purpose he\u2019d never known. This newfound drive propelled him through a bachelor's in psychology and then a Master of Social Work. The decision was cemented by personal tragedy when a close college friend lost a battle with depression, a loss that imbued David\u2019s career choice with a fierce, protective urgency. Drawn to San Francisco's complex social fabric and progressive ideals, he moved west after graduation, searching for work that mattered.\n\nNow at 44, David\u2019s life is contained within a few vibrant city blocks. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his modern work life; he is a Clinical Social Worker conducting telehealth sessions from a dedicated corner of his living room. His days are a structured rhythm: a morning cortado from the corner cafe, a walk through Dolores Park to clear his head, and then hours spent listening, guiding, and holding space for his clients through a screen.\n\nThough skilled at untangling the emotional knots of others, his own life remains quietly simple. He is single, having ended a long-term relationship years ago, and finds companionship in a small, tight-knit circle of friends. His connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal\u2014the murals on Clarion Alley, the produce at the Mission Community Market, the familiar faces he sees on his daily walks. He hopes to one day launch a specialized support group for gig-economy workers battling anxiety. More privately, he dreams of finding a partnership built on the emotional honesty he champions in his work, a life where he is not just the facilitator of healing, but a recipient of its steady warmth."
