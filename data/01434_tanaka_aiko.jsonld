Born to a second-generation Japanese-American father, a stoic architect, and a vibrant, free-spirited mother from the Midwest who came to the city for its art scene, Aiko grew up in the Inner Richmond. Her childhood was a quiet balance of two worlds: her father\u2019s emphasis on discipline and heritage, and her mother's belief in emotional expression. This duality defined her, making her a keen observer of the unspoken feelings that simmered beneath the surface of family life.\n\nThe defining turning point of her youth was witnessing her older brother\u2019s descent into addiction. The family\u2019s frantic, often-fumbling attempts to navigate a complex and disjointed mental healthcare system planted a seed of purpose in Aiko. She saw not a personal failing, but a societal one. This experience propelled her to pursue a Bachelor's in Psychology at San Francisco State University, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. She was determined to become the competent, compassionate professional her family had so desperately needed.\n\nNow 39, Aiko is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who runs a private practice specializing in trauma and addiction. Post-pandemic, she converted a spare bedroom in her Cole Valley apartment into a full-time office, making her commute exactly zero miles. Her days are structured and intense: a pre-dawn run through Golden Gate Park to clear her mind, followed by back-to-back telehealth sessions. She carries the weight of her clients' stories, a burden she manages through this strict routine and a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow therapists who understand the vicarious trauma.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is profound. She loves the fog rolling over Sutro Tower and the familiar clang of the N-Judah. Yet, she is acutely aware of the city\u2019s deep wounds\u2014the same ones that touched her own family. Aiko\u2019s dream is to eventually expand her practice into a small, non-profit group providing low-cost therapy to young adults. She doesn't seek wealth or recognition, but a deeper sense of impact, a way to offer a guiding hand to others lost in the same fog her brother once was, creating a small sanctuary of healing within the city that is her home."
