Raised by a pragmatic engineer father and an idealistic teacher mother, her childhood was a blend of weekend hikes along the Columbia River Gorge and rigorous science fairs. This upbringing instilled in her a deep-seated belief that human ingenuity and respect for nature could, and should, coexist. This conviction led her to UC Santa Barbara, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies, drawn to the program's hands-on approach to coastal ecology.\n\nThe true turning point was a post-graduation internship with a Bay Area conservation non-profit. The energy of San Francisco\u2014its blend of technological innovation and fierce environmental activism\u2014captivated her. She landed a job as a junior consultant, and two years later, at 26, is a valued member of her firm. The pandemic normalized remote work, a structure she maintained, resulting in her 0.0-mile commute from her small but bright apartment in the Inner Sunset.\n\nSarah's days are a study in discipline. A foggy morning run through Golden Gate Park clears her head before she dives into data analysis and environmental impact reports. Without office chatter, her social life is self-curated. She met her boyfriend, Alex, a software engineer, through a mutual friend, and they bond over their shared love for the outdoors. Evenings are often spent at a Mission District rock climbing gym, a community that has become her urban tribe, or trying new dim sum spots on Irving Street.\n\nLiving in the Inner Sunset, she feels connected to the city's quieter, greener side. San Francisco, for her, is a city of beautiful contradictions\u2014a concrete jungle bordered by wild, scenic coastlines. While she dreams of one day leading a major habitat restoration project in Northern California, she also harbors a quieter aspiration: to own a small, sustainable home with Alex, perhaps north in Marin, with a garden that puts her ecological principles into practice, one compost pile at a time."
