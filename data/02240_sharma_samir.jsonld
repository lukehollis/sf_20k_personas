Raised in the manicured suburbs of Fremont, he was the son of a software engineer father and a pharmacist mother who envisioned a similar path of stable, lucrative success for him. They celebrated his acceptance into SF State, assuming he would major in computer science and join the tech boom that had defined their own immigrant journey.\n\nHowever, the city itself became his real education. A required volunteer placement for a sociology elective took him to a soup kitchen, where the stark realities of poverty and addiction dismantled the comfortable assumptions of his upbringing. He listened to stories of systemic failure and personal resilience, feeling a pull he\u2019d never experienced in a coding bootcamp. He quietly changed his major to Sociology, a decision that created a gentle but persistent friction with his parents, who struggled to understand his rejection of a secure future.\n\nAfter graduating, Samir took a job that baffled them completely: a live-in Case Manager at a nonprofit providing supportive housing for formerly unhoused individuals. His 0.0-mile commute means he wakes up and goes to sleep surrounded by the very work he does. His small studio apartment is on the third floor, while his clients live on the floors above and below. His daily routine is a relentless cycle of crisis intervention, connecting clients to services, navigating Byzantine paperwork, and offering a steady ear to those whom society has forgotten.\n\nHis social life is limited, often consisting of a shared beer with a fellow overworked colleague or late-night calls to his college friends. He sees his family on weekends, where conversations about his \u201cexhausting\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d job are met with his quiet insistence that it\u2019s meaningful. His connection to San Francisco isn't through its scenic vistas or trendy restaurants, but through the resilience of its most vulnerable people. Samir\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s the quiet victory of helping a client secure a permanent ID, the relief in someone\u2019s eyes after a successful detox referral. He aspires to one day move into policy advocacy, to fight the systemic issues he confronts daily, but for now, his entire world, his purpose, and his home are all under one roof."
