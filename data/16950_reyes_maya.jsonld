Raised in Daly City, her childhood was a vibrant mix of her father\u2019s Filipino heritage and her mother\u2019s Irish-American roots\u2014a world of bustling family parties where lumpia shared a table with corned beef. Her father, a pragmatic postal worker, instilled a strong work ethic, while her mother, a watercolor artist, nurtured her creative spirit. Maya spent her youth sketching in notebooks and exploring the city\u2019s diverse art museums, assuming she would follow her mother\u2019s path.\n\nHer turning point came during her first year at San Francisco State University. While enrolled in the fine arts program, she saw the burgeoning tech industry\u2019s demand for creatives who could understand systems. Fearing the \"starving artist\" trope, she made a pragmatic pivot to Interaction Design, discovering a passion for marrying human behavior with digital elegance. This decision defined her career, leading her from junior roles at small startups to her current position as a Senior Experience Designer for a major hospitality group. She now crafts the seamless digital journeys for high-end restaurants and entertainment venues, a job that perfectly blends her artistic eye with her structured thinking.\n\nToday, Maya lives in a cozy, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a strong coffee from a local cafe before she catches the 5R Fulton bus for her 3.5-mile commute to her SoMa office. She finds a strange comfort in the familiar rhythm of public transit, using the time to listen to design podcasts or simply people-watch. Evenings are often spent with her long-term partner, Liam, a software engineer, trying new restaurants or unwinding with a movie. Weekends are for connection: hiking in the Marin Headlands with a close circle of friends or helping at the community garden.\n\nDeeply connected to San Francisco's culinary soul, Maya dreams of leveraging her six-figure income and expertise for something more personal. Her ultimate aspiration is to launch her own design consultancy, specifically to help the small, immigrant-owned restaurants she grew up with build beautiful and accessible digital presences, ensuring they can thrive in the city that shaped her."

Her mother was showing her how to sketch the delicate floral patterns on a ceramic plate, a quiet moment of art amidst the chaos. Just then, her father sat down, explaining how he\u2019d mapped out the most efficient route to pick up three different cakes from three different bakeries. It was the first time she understood that beauty and logistics could be part of the same, wonderful design. This memory became the blueprint for her entire career.\n\n2. It was a rainy sophomore afternoon in an SF State computer lab. Frustrated by the clunky interface of a class registration site, Maya found herself sketching a more intuitive flow in her art notebook. A graduate assistant, peering over her shoulder, offhandedly mentioned a new program called \"Interaction Design.\" A jolt went through her. In that instant, she saw a path where her art wasn't just for a gallery wall, but could solve real, human problems. The fear of being a starving artist evaporated, replaced by a surge of purpose.\n\n3. Two years into her senior role, Maya took Liam to a Michelin-starred restaurant in SoMa whose digital experience she had helped build. As they savored dessert, she overheard a woman at the next table telling her partner, \"Booking this was the easiest part of our anniversary.\" The quiet pride she felt was immense. It wasn't about the code or the pixels anymore; it was about being an invisible, helpful hand in creating someone else\u2019s cherished memory. It solidified the human-centric core of her work.\n\n4. One Tuesday evening, the 5R Fulton was steamy and packed, crawling through the rain-slicked streets of the Richmond. Leaning her head against the cool glass, Maya watched the blur of neon signs and headlights reflect over the faces of her fellow commuters\u2014nurses, students, cooks. A profound, quiet feeling of belonging washed over her. She wasn't just on her way home; she was part of the city's circulatory system. This simple commute became a grounding ritual, a reminder of the shared, mundane beauty of San Francisco life.\n\n5. Last year, for her father\u2019s birthday, she took her parents to their favorite Filipino restaurant, a tiny, cash-only spot in the Excelsior. The food was divine, but she watched the elderly owner fumble with a takeout order over the phone, her reservation book a mess of scribbled notes. Maya felt a sudden, sharp clarity. Her six-figure tech salary felt distant from this reality. She realized her dream wasn't just to be successful, but to use her specific skills to help these essential, immigrant-run places she loved survive and thrive."
