The only child of Gujarati immigrants, he spent his youth watching the ceaseless flow of people and goods, observing the city's circulatory system from a ground-level perspective. He saw how a delayed bus could cost his neighbor a job interview and how his father\u2019s delivery routes were dictated by traffic patterns and scarce parking. These early observations planted the seed for his future.\n\nHe pursued a degree in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, where theory finally gave a name to his lived experiences. He was captivated by the power of infrastructure to shape lives, either by creating barriers or building bridges between communities. A pivotal moment came during an internship when he helped analyze data for a proposed bus route change in the Bayview. Seeing how a simple line on a map could drastically improve residents' access to healthcare and groceries solidified his career path.\n\nNow, at 35, Aaron is a Transportation Planner for a firm contracted by the city. His 3.8-mile commute from his apartment in the Mission District to his downtown office is a daily field study. He rides the J-Church line, notepad in hand, observing passenger loads, timing traffic signals, and noting the friction points he is actively working to solve. He lives his work, championing the public systems he designs.\n\nHis social life is a web woven from college friends and work colleagues, often gathering for beers at a Dogpatch brewery or joining a kickball league at Dolores Park. He\u2019s navigating the San Francisco dating scene with a mix of optimism and pragmatism. Aaron\u2019s connection to the city is deeply personal; he sees his parents' immigrant struggle in every resident trying to navigate its complexities. His greatest aspiration is to lead a project that makes San Francisco truly car-optional, creating a more equitable and efficient system for the next generation of dreamers who, like his parents, arrive looking for a better life."

The 14 Mission bus had just pulled away, its diesel groan fading down the street. She\u2019d missed it by seconds. He watched her shoulders slump, the hope draining from her face as she told his mother she\u2019d be late for the cleaning job interview. He felt a hot, useless anger. It wasn\u2019t just a bus; it was a chance. It was the first time he understood that a schedule could break a life.\n\n2.\nThe GIS map glowed on the screen in the drab Berkeley internship office. On the left, Bayview-Hunters Point, with dotted lines showing residents\u2019 long, convoluted paths to the nearest full-service grocery store. On the right, his team\u2019s proposed route change\u2014a simple, straight red line. He traced it with his finger, suddenly seeing not a line, but a grandmother getting fresh vegetables and a father picking up a prescription without a two-hour ordeal. Theory became reality. He knew, with absolute certainty, this was what he had to do.\n\n3.\nThe first time he rode the J-Church after they implemented his signal-timing fix at 18th and Church was terrifying. He stood, gripping the pole, stomach in knots. The train approached the intersection that always caused a five-minute bottleneck. But this time, it sailed through. A woman next to him, engrossed in her book, didn't even look up. For her, it was seamless. Invisible. That anonymity was his greatest victory\u2014a small knot of chaos he had quietly, painstakingly untangled for thousands of strangers. It was a shared, silent success.\n\n4.\nOn a third date, he suggested they take the F-Market streetcar to the Ferry Building for oysters. As they rattled along the Embarcadero in the restored vintage car, she looked at the seamless view of the bay and said, \u201cYou know this city like it\u2019s a part of you.\u201d He just smiled. For the first time, his obsession with transit patterns and headways didn\u2019t feel like a nerdy quirk. It felt like a language of care, a way he could offer someone the best version of the city he loved.\n\n5.\nLast year, driving his father to a doctor\u2019s appointment, they passed the chaotic intersection near the old produce market his dad used to frequent for the store. \"This turn, always a nightmare for the van,\" his dad mumbled. \"They fixed it,\" Aaron said quietly. \"I was on the team that designed that dedicated turn lane.\" His father just grunted and looked out the window, but Aaron saw the small, proud smile in his reflection. He hadn't just fixed a traffic problem; he'd eased a burden his father carried for thirty years."
