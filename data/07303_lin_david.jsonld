Born in Daly City to hardworking Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small grocery store, David was raised on the expectation that he would achieve a more stable, white-collar American dream. He was a dutiful son, enrolling in the Business Administration program at San Francisco State University, though the abstract theories of marketing and management never truly resonated with him.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. His grandmother, his beloved Ah-Ma, suffered a stroke that left her needing constant care. David, witnessing his parents\u2019 exhaustion from juggling their store and her needs, began spending his days at her side. He found a profound sense of purpose in the quiet rituals of care: preparing her meals, reading her the newspaper, and simply offering a comforting presence. He discovered a patience and empathy within himself that his business classes could never teach. After his grandmother passed away, returning to university felt hollow. He dropped out, earned his Home Health Aide certification, and formally entered the world that had chosen him.\n\nFor the past five years, David has been the live-in caregiver for Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but physically frail 86-year-old widow. His 0.0-mile commute means his life and work are one. His days are a gentle rhythm of medication schedules, preparing soft foods, assisting Eleanor with her correspondence, and listening to her stories of a bygone San Francisco. His social life is limited to his bi-weekly day off, when he meets a friend for dim sum in the Sunset or takes a long, solitary walk through Golden Gate Park, a stone's throw from Eleanor's flat. His relationship with his parents remains loving but tinged with their quiet disappointment.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyper-local, defined by the Clement Street Farmers Market and the specific aisles of the corner pharmacy. He dreams not of wealth, but of one day opening a small, compassionate residential care home\u2014a place modeled on the dignity and warmth he gave his Ah-Ma. At 38, he has found his meaning not in a bustling downtown office, but in the quiet, essential act of caring for another human being within the fog-laced streets of his city."
