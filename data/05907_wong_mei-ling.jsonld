A third-generation resident, her story began not in a high-rise, but in the cozy confines of her family\u2019s grocery store in the Richmond District. Her grandparents had established \"Wong's Fine Produce\" after immigrating, and it was the center of her world. She spent her childhood stocking shelves, listening to neighborhood gossip in Cantonese and English, and watching the city change block by block through the store\u2019s front window.\n\nThis intimate view of a community hub in flux shaped her path. Witnessing her parents struggle to keep the business afloat against rising rents and big-box competition ignited a passion not for commerce, but for the systems that govern it. She pursued an undergraduate degree at SF State and then a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA, determined to understand the forces she had only observed as a child.\n\nHer career has been a steady, dedicated climb within the San Francisco Planning Department. The true turning point came a decade ago when her parents finally sold the store. The building was demolished to make way for luxury condos. The loss was profound, solidifying her professional mission: to help steer development in a way that preserves the city's character and protects its legacy communities.\n\nToday, Mei-Ling lives in a meticulously kept apartment in Hayes Valley. Her commute is a ten-step walk from her kitchen to a second bedroom converted into an office, its walls covered in zoning maps and project blueprints. Her lifestyle is disciplined; mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe, observing the urban ballet she helps choreograph, followed by long hours navigating public feedback, environmental reviews, and political pressures.\n\nA private person, her social life consists of bi-weekly dim sum with her retired parents in Daly City and occasional drinks with a small circle of trusted colleagues. Her deepest connection remains with the city itself. Mei-Ling dreams of a San Francisco that balances innovation with equity. Her quiet, fervent aspiration is to see a landmark affordable housing initiative\u2014one she has championed for years\u2014break ground, creating a tangible anchor for future generations, much like the grocery store her family lost."
