A third-generation Japanese American, he was raised in the quiet suburbs of San Jose by a software engineer father and a high school math teacher mother. They instilled in him a profound sense of duty and a logical, methodical approach to life. For years, it was assumed he would follow a similar path into tech or engineering.\n\nThe turning point came in his teens, watching his grandmother (Obaachan) struggle to navigate the American healthcare system. Her limited English and the system\u2019s lack of cultural sensitivity created a barrier that no amount of love or logic could easily solve. Witnessing her frustration and feeling helpless ignited a new purpose in Kenjiro. He abandoned the path of coding for one of advocacy, eventually earning a Master of Public Health from UC Berkeley.\n\nHis career began at a small nonprofit in Oakland, providing direct support to immigrant families. While fulfilling, he realized he could have a greater impact by working within the system he sought to change. This led him to his current role as a Senior Program Manager for a large healthcare provider, where he designs and implements programs that aim to close the very gaps his grandmother once faced.\n\nNow 36, Kenjiro\u2019s life is centered in his sunny Castro apartment, which doubles as his office. His \"commute\" is a ten-foot walk from his bedroom to his standing desk, overlooking the bustling street below. His days are a mix of Zoom calls and data analysis, broken up by walks to Tartine for coffee or a lunch break spent running errands on foot. He shares his life with his partner, Alex, a landscape architect whose creative energy balances Kenjiro\u2019s structured nature.\n\nKenjiro\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate. He sees the city not just as his home, but as a living laboratory for the community health challenges he tackles daily. His aspiration is to develop a truly scalable model for culturally competent care that could be adopted nationwide. For Kenjiro, success isn\u2019t a promotion; it\u2019s building a world where no one\u2019s Obaachan gets left behind."
