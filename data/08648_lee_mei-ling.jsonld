The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the modest apartment above her parents' small grocery store on Irving Street. Her childhood was a symphony of inventory stocking, the clanging bell above the door, and the Cantonese chatter of neighborhood regulars. She witnessed her parents' tireless work ethic and their deep, quiet pride in the community they served.\n\nThe key turning point in her life came at sixteen when a staggering rent increase forced her parents to sell their store. Watching their American dream dissolve into a painful liquidation sale ignited a fire in Mei-ling. The abstract forces of economics and city policy became deeply personal. This experience drove her academic path, first to UC Berkeley for a degree in Sociology, and then to a Master of Public Policy, where she focused her thesis on urban displacement and small business preservation.\n\nNow 35, Mei-ling channels that early resolve into her work as a Policy Analyst for the City. From her Hayes Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her coffee maker to her laptop, where she spends her days analyzing housing data and drafting briefs on land use. Her work is her mission: to understand the levers of power that shape the city and, hopefully, to tilt them towards equity.\n\nHer personal life is an anchor. She lives with her long-term partner, Alex, a software engineer whose world of venture capital and tech sprints offers a stark but fascinating contrast to her own in public service. Evenings often involve walks through Patricia\u2019s Green, debating the merits of a new city initiative, or meeting friends for dinner in the Mission.\n\nMei-ling\u2019s dream is deceptively simple: to see her work translate into tangible good\u2014an affordable housing complex breaking ground, a program that helps a family business stay afloat. She wants to ensure that the San Francisco that raised her, a city of diverse neighborhoods and opportunity, doesn't become a museum piece accessible only to the wealthy. She is quietly fighting for the soul of the city, one policy recommendation at a time."
