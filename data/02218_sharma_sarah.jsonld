The only child of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont, she was raised in a household where meticulous order was a virtue. Her father, a stoic electrical engineer, and her mother, a pragmatic pharmacist, instilled in her a deep respect for education and tangible results. While they envisioned a future for her in medicine or software, Sarah found her calling in the physical world. She spent her childhood disassembling and reassembling everything from toaster ovens to her father\u2019s antique shortwave radio, fascinated not by what things did, but *how* they were made.\n\nThis passion led her to UC Berkeley for Mechanical Engineering and later to Stanford for a Master of Science in Advanced Manufacturing. She excelled, driven by a desire to optimize and perfect the complex ballet of industrial production. Upon graduating, she landed a coveted role as a Manufacturing Engineer for a cutting-edge robotics firm. The twist? The company\u2019s assembly lines are in Southeast Asia, and her job is entirely remote.\n\nHer life is now contained within the walls of her sleek Dogpatch apartment. The 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with a drive, but with a walk from her bedroom to her standing desk. From there, she orchestrates the creation of complex machinery thousands of miles away, troubleshooting robotic arms through video calls and refining assembly sequences in CAD simulations.\n\nA key turning point for Sarah was realizing the profound disconnect between her digital work and her physical reality. To counteract the isolation, she has built a life of intentional texture. After work, she takes long walks through Crane Cove Park, watching the ships and feeling the industrial history of her neighborhood. She\u2019s a regular at a local pottery studio, needing the tactile sensation of clay to ground herself after a day of virtual oversight. Her social life is a small, tight circle of college friends, supplemented by weekly calls with her parents, who still don't quite understand why she pays so much for an apartment she rarely leaves.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is twofold: professionally, she aspires to lead the design of an entire automated factory from scratch. Personally, she hopes to build a community in San Francisco that feels as real and reliable as the systems she designs, forging connections that are less efficient, perhaps, but infinitely more meaningful."
