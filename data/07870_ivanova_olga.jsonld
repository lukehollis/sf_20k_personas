Born in 1983 in Voronezh, Russia, her childhood was defined by the stark transition from communism to the chaotic capitalism of the 1990s. Her parents, a factory worker and a school cafeteria aide, struggled to adapt, instilling in Olga a deep-seated pragmatism and a yearning for stability over ambition. She completed her secondary schooling but saw no future in a collapsing economy, instead working a series of low-wage jobs to help her family.\n\nThe turning point came at 27. An acquaintance who had emigrated to the U.S. told her about the high demand for home caregivers. It wasn't a dream of fame or fortune that propelled her, but the promise of a steady paycheck and a life of purpose. After navigating the complex visa process, she arrived in San Francisco, her English functional but hesitant. She found her calling, and her living situation, in senior home care.\n\nFor the past eight years, Olga has been the live-in caregiver for Mr. Chen, an elderly widower with dementia. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within the walls of his modest house. Her days are a cyclical rhythm of administering medication, preparing soft foods, gentle bathing, and, most importantly, listening. She listens to the same stories of his youth in Chinatown, offering patient nods and soothing words. This house is her world; Mr. Chen, her surrogate family.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. It's the Russian grocery on Geary where she buys dark rye bread and smoked fish on her one afternoon off a week. It\u2019s a solitary walk in Golden Gate Park, the fog a familiar comfort. Her relationships are distant: fortnightly FaceTime calls with her aging mother in Voronezh, where she sends a portion of her income, and a small friendship with another caregiver she meets occasionally for coffee.\n\nOlga\u2019s dreams are not grand. She hopes to one day save enough for a small down payment on a condo in Daly City\u2014a place wholly her own. More immediately, she dreams of taking a full week\u2019s vacation to see the ocean at Santa Cruz. For now, her life is one of quiet duty, a universe of compassion contained within a single home, where she provides the stability she once craved for herself."
