Born and raised in the fog-dusted avenues of the Richmond District, she is a second-generation San Franciscan whose roots run deeper than the city\u2019s famous sourdough starters. Her parents, immigrants from Guangdong, China, poured their life savings and boundless energy into a small neighborhood grocery on Clement Street. Sarah grew up stacking produce and translating for elderly customers, a quiet observer of the tight-knit community that cycled through their doors.\n\nHer educational journey began with promise at San Francisco State University, where she tentatively explored business courses, assuming she would one day take over the family store. However, that path was cut short when her mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness. Without a second thought, Sarah left college to become her primary caregiver. For nearly a decade, her world shrank to the confines of their rent-controlled apartment and the increasingly frequent trips to doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nAfter her mother passed away, the grocery store was sold, and Sarah found herself adrift. The caregiving years had given her an intimate understanding of the healthcare system's gaps, particularly for non-English speakers. She found a position as a Clerical Assistant at the Richmond Area Community Health Center, just a ten-minute walk from her apartment. The work felt like a natural continuation of her life\u2019s role: helping her community navigate complex systems with patience and empathy.\n\nNow 46, Sarah\u2019s days follow a gentle rhythm. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk past familiar faces, the same bakeries and storefronts from her childhood. At the clinic, she is the calm, steady presence who knows patients by name, not just by their chart number. Her social life is a small, warm circle of colleagues and the elderly neighbors she checks in on. In quiet moments, she dreams of finishing her degree, not for a career, but for herself\u2014perhaps in art history. She imagines, one day, traveling to see the village her parents left behind, connecting the beginning of their story to the life she has built in their honor, one organized file and one kind word at a time."
