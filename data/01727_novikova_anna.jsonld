Born to a physicist father and a literature professor mother, Anna grew up in a world of whispered poetry and dissident art, developing an early appreciation for creative expression that pushed against state control. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was her defining turning point. At twenty, she and her family seized the opportunity for a new life, immigrating to the Bay Area where her father had a research opportunity at Stanford.\n\nWhile her parents navigated a new academic world, Anna found her footing in the vibrant, anarchic art scene of San Francisco. It felt like the antithesis of her constrained upbringing. She enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute, earning a Master's degree in Curatorial Studies. Her unique perspective, blending a deep knowledge of European art history with an immigrant\u2019s keen eye for the new, made her a sought-after intern and later, an assistant curator.\n\nHer career was a slow, deliberate build. For years, she worked for others, honing her skills and building a reputation for her quiet intensity and impeccable taste. A passionate but tumultuous long-term relationship with a brilliant, self-destructive painter in her thirties cemented her decision to champion artists from the business side, rather than be consumed by their chaos.\n\nNow, at 53, Anna\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. She is the respected manager of a contemporary gallery in Dogpatch, living in a minimalist loft directly above the exhibition space\u2014her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her days begin with strong coffee while she quietly observes the art downstairs before the public arrives, and often end with artist dinners or industry events. Her social circle is small and curated, much like her shows, composed of artists, writers, and academics.\n\nSan Francisco is the city that gave her freedom, and her neighborhood is her entire world. Anna\u2019s primary aspiration is no longer personal gain, but legacy. She dreams of discovering and launching the career of a truly visionary artist\u2014to curate one seminal show that will be remembered long after she is gone, securing a small but significant place in art history."
