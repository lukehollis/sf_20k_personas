Raised in the quiet, tree-lined suburbs of Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a librarian and a high school history teacher. Her childhood was steeped in the scent of pine and old paper, a world that encouraged curiosity and contemplation over competition. She naturally gravitated towards the humanities, earning a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the University of Oregon, with dreams of a life in publishing.\n\nAfter graduation, however, the reality of the job market hit hard. Publishing felt like a closed-off world, and after a year of dead-end internships, Michelle took a customer support job at a burgeoning tech startup in Portland simply to pay the bills. It was a turning point. While she wasn't writing code, she discovered an innate talent for understanding systems, documenting processes, and translating the complex needs of engineers to frustrated customers. Her calm demeanor and sharp organizational skills got her noticed. She was promoted to manage support documentation, then to coordinate release schedules, eventually finding her niche in production management.\n\nLured by a significant career opportunity eight years ago, she moved to San Francisco. Now 33, she is a Production Team Lead for a major software company. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is centered in her sunny two-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its quiet, residential feel. Her days are a structured rhythm of stand-up meetings via Slack, deep-focus work blocks, and a mandatory mid-afternoon run through the park to clear her head.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle formed from old jobs and neighborhood connections\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and friends who, like her, have passions outside their day jobs. While she values the stability and challenge of her career, she feels a pull back to her roots. Her deepest aspiration is to use her project management skills for something more tangible. She dreams of one day leaving the tech world to open a combination bookstore and community workshop space, a place that blends her lifelong love for stories with her hard-won ability to build something from the ground up."
