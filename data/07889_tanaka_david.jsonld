Born and raised in the quiet, tree-lined suburbs of Walnut Creek, he was the only son of a pragmatic engineer and a meticulous high school math teacher. His Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) parents instilled in him the values of stability, hard work, and a clear, predictable path to success. Initially, David rebelled quietly, finding solace not in formulas but in narratives. He enrolled at UC Berkeley as a History major, captivated by the rise and fall of empires and the intricate patterns of human behavior across time.\n\nThe key turning point came during his junior year. Watching the lingering fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, he saw how abstract economic forces could devastate concrete family plans. A deep-seated fear of instability, inherited from his parents, took root. He realized that understanding the history of money was just as critical as understanding the history of nations. Upon graduation, he abandoned plans for grad school and instead earned a series of financial certifications, teaching himself the language of markets and risk analysis.\n\nHe landed his first job at a large investment firm in San Francisco, a city he chose for its dynamic energy\u2014a stark contrast to his suburban upbringing. Now 31, David works as a financial analyst, his days spent staring at charts from the clean, minimalist desk in his Hayes Valley apartment. The 0.0-mile commute means his life requires deliberate structure. His mornings start with a pour-over coffee from a local cafe, a small ritual that gets him out the door. He works with intense focus until lunch, then forces himself on a run through the Panhandle to clear his head.\n\nHis social life is a curated defense against the isolation of remote work. He has a tight-knit group of friends from college and a standing Tuesday night basketball game at the Mission Rec Center. Though outwardly successful, David harbors a quiet dream: to save enough to leave the corporate world and write a book on the economic history of the 20th century, finally fusing the passion he abandoned with the pragmatism he embraced. He finds a sense of home not just in his apartment, but in the familiar faces at his local market and the rhythm of his weekly routines, grounded in the city he chose to build a life in."
