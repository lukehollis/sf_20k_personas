Born at a local hospital to parents who immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1980s, Mei's upbringing was steeped in pragmatism. Her parents ran a small, bustling laundromat on Clement Street, and their mantra was simple: work hard, save money, and secure a stable future. For them, stability meant a desk job, something with benefits and predictable hours\u2014a life far removed from the constant toil of their own.\n\nFollowing their wishes, Mei attended City College of San Francisco, dutifully earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration. She spent two years as an administrative assistant for a downtown financial firm, her days a blur of spreadsheets and sterile office chatter. The work was isolating and felt utterly disconnected from the vibrant, multigenerational community she called home. The turning point came during her lunch breaks, when she\u2019d find herself walking, not to a trendy cafe, but to a nearby playground, just to hear the sound of children laughing.\n\nThe preschool was on the ground floor of the very building her family owned and where she still lived in a small apartment upstairs. On a whim, she started volunteering there after work. The chaotic, joyful energy was a balm to her soul. Within six months, she had quit her office job, taken the necessary child development courses, and accepted a position as a teacher\u2019s aide. Her commute became a single flight of stairs.\n\nNow at 35, Mei's life operates within a ten-block radius. Her daily routine is a comforting ritual: waking to the rumble of the 38 Geary bus, helping small hands learn to hold crayons, sharing stories during circle time, and knowing the names of every parent and grocer on her block. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of childhood friends and regular family dinners. While her parents were initially disappointed by her career change, they now see the quiet contentment she radiates.\n\nMei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to leave, but to dig her roots deeper. She hopes to one day become a lead teacher, perhaps even take over the preschool when the current director retires. Her deepest aspiration is to remain a stable, loving presence in a city of constant change, a quiet anchor for the next generation of San Franciscans."
