Born in San Francisco to first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, her entire world has been contained within the bustling, sensory-rich blocks of Chinatown. Her parents poured their life savings and boundless effort into opening \"Golden Dragon Palace,\" a modest restaurant that became both their American dream and their daughter\u2019s inheritance.\n\nGrowing up in the apartment above the restaurant, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty. She did homework at a corner table while listening to the clang of spatulas and the cadence of her parents taking orders. Resenting the relentless demands of the family business, she dreamed of escape. At eighteen, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, vaguely pursuing a degree in Communications, driven more by the desire for a different life than by any specific passion.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year. Her father suffered a major heart attack, leaving her mother unable to manage the restaurant alone. Mei dropped out of college to help, promising herself it was only temporary. But temporary became permanent. The rhythms of the restaurant\u2014managing suppliers at dawn, placating difficult customers, balancing the books late at night\u2014settled into her bones. She discovered a surprising aptitude for it, a sharp mind for business, and a deep-seated pride in upholding her family\u2019s legacy.\n\nNow 39, Mei is the undisputed matriarch of the Golden Dragon Palace. Her 0.0-mile commute is the short walk down a flight of creaking stairs. Her life is a disciplined routine dictated by opening hours and delivery schedules. Her social connections are the elderly neighbors who play mahjong on the sidewalk, the loyal waitstaff who have become her surrogate family, and the generations of customers she knows by name.\n\nWhile proud of preserving her parents\u2019 creation, a quiet restlessness simmers within her. Mei dreams not of escaping Chinatown, but of redefining her place in it. She aspires to subtly modernize the restaurant\u2019s menu, introducing new dishes that blend tradition with a modern Californian sensibility. Her ultimate hope is to create a legacy that is not just inherited, but thoughtfully and lovingly her own."
