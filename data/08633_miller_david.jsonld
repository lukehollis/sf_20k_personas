A sensitive, bookish child, he felt perpetually out of place, escaping into novels that promised a bigger, more accepting world. He pursued that promise, moving to San Francisco in the early 1990s to earn a Bachelor's degree in English Literature from SF State. He was captivated by the city's energy and found his chosen family in the Castro, believing he had finally found his story\u2019s proper setting.\n\nThe AIDS epidemic of the mid-90s brutally rewrote that story. The loss of his first serious partner to the disease shattered David\u2019s youthful idealism, replacing it with a profound, aching need for purpose. The abstract narratives of literature felt hollow against the stark reality of grief and community devastation. Seeking a way to contribute, he began volunteering at a small community health clinic in the Mission District, initially just to feel useful.\n\nHis quiet competence, organizational skills, and innate empathy didn't go unnoticed. He moved from volunteer to a paid front desk position, then to an administrative role. He never pursued a different degree; his education happened in the trenches\u2014learning medical billing, patient advocacy, and grant-writing on the fly. Over two decades, he became the bedrock of the institution, eventually being promoted to Clinic Manager.\n\nToday, David\u2019s commute is zero miles; he lives in a modest apartment situated above the very clinic he manages. His life is his work. His mornings start early, reviewing patient loads and staff schedules before the doors open. His social connections are deeply intertwined with his profession; his closest friends are the doctors and nurses he\u2019s worked with for years. He is single, having never found a relationship that resonated as deeply as the one he lost so long ago. His dream is no longer personal but institutional: he hopes to secure enough funding to expand the clinic\u2019s mental health and housing support services. David\u2019s youthful dream of writing stories has been sublimated into a life spent preserving them, one patient at a time."
