Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset, her childhood was defined by the rhythm of her immigrant parents' small laundromat on Taraval Street. She watched the neighborhood fabric evolve from her perch on a folding chair, observing which businesses thrived and which faded, listening to the multilingual gossip that was the true currency of the community. For Jessica, the city wasn't a postcard; it was a living, breathing organism of interconnected systems.\n\nThis innate curiosity led her to a B.A. in Sociology at UC Davis, followed by a Master of Urban Planning from UCLA. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a more traditionally lucrative career, Jessica was captivated by the power of policy to shape physical space and social equity. A key turning point came during a college break when a beloved, quirky neighborhood hardware store in the Sunset was demolished for a block of generic condos. The loss felt deeply personal, cementing her resolve to ensure new development could honor a neighborhood's soul, not erase it.\n\nNow, at 34, Jessica is a respected City Planner, ironically living in a sleek Mission Bay condo\u2014the very type of development she critically analyzes. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the principles she advocates for: dense, walkable, mixed-use communities. Most days begin with a run along the Embarcadero, followed by hours spent in her home office, poring over zoning codes, environmental impact reports, and community feedback for projects spanning the entire city.\n\nHer partner, Marcus, an architect, shares her passion for urban design, and their evenings often involve spirited debates over blueprints or exploring new restaurants in Hayes Valley. Weekends are a study in contrasts: visiting her parents in the familiar quiet of the Sunset, then returning to the vibrant, modern hum of her own neighborhood. Jessica\u2019s dream is to spearhead a landmark public project\u2014one that bridges the gap between the old San Francisco of her youth and the innovative city of the future, ensuring that progress doesn\u2019t leave behind the communities that gave the city its heart."
