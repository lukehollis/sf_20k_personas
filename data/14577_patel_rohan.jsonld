Born in Fremont to first-generation Indian immigrants, he grew up surrounded by the hum of Silicon Valley ambition. His father, a software engineer, envisioned a similar path for Rohan, mapping out a future in computer science from a young age. Rohan, however, spent his childhood filling notebooks with intricate drawings, his heart set on a creative life that felt worlds away from the tidy logic of coding.\n\nHis rebellion was quiet but firm: enrolling in the Graphic Design program at San Francisco State University. The city was an immediate inspiration, a vibrant canvas of art and architecture. Yet, the pressure from his family, combined with the mounting cost of living and a growing sense of creative inadequacy, became overwhelming. After three semesters, feeling adrift, he dropped out\u2014a decision that caused a significant rift with his parents.\n\nThe turning point came from a place of necessity. Needing work, he took a job as an administrative assistant at a small architectural visualization studio in SoMa. Here, amidst the chaos of deadlines and demanding clients, Rohan discovered an unexpected talent: organization. He thrived on creating order, managing workflows, and translating the abstract needs of artists into concrete project plans. He was the calm center of the creative storm. His innate knack for logistics and empathy for the creative process saw him quickly promoted to Studio Manager.\n\nNow 25, Rohan lives in a bright apartment in the Inner Richmond he shares with a friend from his brief college days. His daily 2.8-mile bike commute, often cutting through the misty Panhandle, is a cherished ritual. While his parents are relieved by his stable $78,000 income, they still struggle to understand his career. Rohan finds fulfillment in empowering other artists, though a part of him still yearns to create. On weekends, he works on personal digital art projects, slowly building a portfolio. His dream is no longer to be the star artist, but to one day open a small, collaborative studio\u2014a place built on the supportive foundation he never had, proving that sometimes the most creative act is building a space for others to thrive."

His father glanced over, smiled thinly, and said, \"Very nice, Rohan. Have you finished your math homework?\" The praise felt hollow, a polite dismissal. In that moment, Rohan learned that his art was a private language, something not meant for the world his father understood. He started keeping his best drawings hidden in a separate notebook, a silent rebellion that came to define his teenage years.\n\n2.\nIt was a foggy Tuesday at SF State, age nineteen. After a design critique left him feeling talentless, he called his mom from a bench near the library. He tried to explain the pressure, the feeling of drowning, but the line was filled with the static of her disappointment and questions about tuition. He hung up, looked at the city lights blurring through the mist, and knew he was done. It wasn't relief, but a cold, terrifying emptiness. That phone call was the sound of him letting go.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-one, just an admin assistant. The studio was in chaos over a huge project; three artists were arguing, and the lead designer was panicking. Rohan quietly took a pack of sticky notes and mapped the entire workflow on a whiteboard, color-coding dependencies. Suddenly, everyone stopped. The lead designer stared at the board and just said, \"Oh. That makes sense.\" In that silence, Rohan felt a click\u2014a powerful, grounding satisfaction he'd never felt in a design class. He wasn't the artist, but the architect of their peace.\n\n4.\nThere was a morning last spring, biking through the Panhandle. The fog was thick, muting the city's sounds into a gentle hum. Eucalyptus scent filled the air. As he pedaled, he saw other commuters\u2014a chef, a nurse, a student\u2014all moving through the mist on their own paths. He wasn\u2019t racing towards a future his father designed or running from a past failure. He was simply moving, present and content in his own lane. That feeling of quiet, anonymous belonging was everything.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, late on a Sunday, he finished a personal digital piece. He felt that familiar creative spark, but for the first time, it wasn't tinged with loneliness or the pressure to be great. He looked at the art and thought not of a gallery, but of the talented, stressed-out artists at his studio. The dream crystallized then: not to be the single name on a poster, but to build the room where many names could be hung. To create a space so no one else would have to hide their notebooks."
