Born in San Francisco to parents who had emigrated from Guangdong, China, Mei grew up in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District. Her parents ran a small laundromat, their lives a testament to grueling hours and the hope for a stable future for their only child. They instilled in Mei not a desire for lofty ambition, but for security and a steady hand.\n\nForegoing the uncertainty of a four-year university, Mei chose the pragmatic path of a Medical Assisting associate's degree from City College. It was a direct line to a respectable, necessary profession. Her career began with a few years at a larger clinic, but her key turning point came fifteen years ago. She found a position at a small, private family practice on the ground floor of a residential building in the Inner Richmond. When an apartment opened up on the third floor of that same building a year later, it felt like destiny. She and her aging mother moved in, shrinking Mei\u2019s world to the size of an elevator ride.\n\nHer commute is zero miles, a fact that defines her existence. Her day begins with making congee for her mother before she walks downstairs to the clinic. She is the familiar, calming face patients have seen for over a decade, preparing them for Dr. Chen, organizing charts, and translating complex medical terms into comforting Cantonese for elderly neighbors. Lunch is often spent back in her own apartment, checking on her mother before returning to work.\n\nMei\u2019s social life is woven into her routine. Her colleagues are her closest friends, and her connection to San Francisco is not through its iconic landmarks, but through the generations of families she\u2019s cared for. She knows who has a new grandchild, whose son just got into Lowell High School, and who needs a little extra time to explain their symptoms.\n\nHer dreams are modest. She hopes to one day take her mother on a real vacation, perhaps to Hawaii, a place she\u2019s only seen on postcards. For herself, she secretly yearns to take a watercolor painting class at the community center, a small act of creation just for her. For now, she finds contentment in her vital role, a steady presence in the heart of her neighborhood, her life a quiet, essential service within the walls of a single building."
