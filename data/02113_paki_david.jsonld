Raised in a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, by two public school teachers, his upbringing was one of modest means, intellectual curiosity, and Midwestern earnestness. He was instilled with a belief that the goal of education was not just to acquire skills, but to become a more thoughtful human being.\n\nHe pursued this belief academically, earning a BA in Sociology before completing a Master's in Social Work (MSW) at the University of Michigan. He initially planned to work in community mental health but was drawn to San Francisco during the first dot-com boom in the late 1990s, fascinated by the cultural upheaval. He took a corporate HR job, a pragmatic choice, but felt deeply unfulfilled.\n\nThe turning point came when the bubble burst. David witnessed brilliant, passionate people, whom he\u2019d hired just months before, break down after being laid off. He saw the immense psychological toll of a culture that preached changing the world but offered little support for the humans doing the work. It was then he found his calling. He quit HR, obtained his clinical license, and started a private practice. He referred to himself, with a touch of irony, as a \"School Counselor in Technology.\"\n\nNow, from his home office in Cole Valley, David\u2019s commute is a walk across the hall. His days are a series of virtual sessions with burned-out software engineers, ethically conflicted founders, and product managers questioning their life\u2019s purpose. He helps them navigate the pressures of imposter syndrome, toxic work environments, and the moral ambiguity of creating world-altering products.\n\nHaving lived in the city for over two decades, David has a long-term, almost paternal relationship with San Francisco. He\u2019s seen it evolve and gentrify, and while he misses some of its old grit, he finds peace in his quiet neighborhood routines\u2014a morning walk in Sutro Forest, coffee from his local cafe, and a quiet dinner with his partner, a landscape architect. At 50, his ambitions have shifted from career-building to legacy. He hopes to write a book on the emotional architecture of the tech industry, a guide for the next generation on how to build a career without losing their soul."

Below, parties raged with manic energy, conversations buzzing about IPOs and changing the world. It felt less like a city and more like a massive, chaotic experiment. His Midwestern earnestness felt completely alien here. In that moment of overwhelming awe and alienation, he realized it wasn't the technology that fascinated him; it was the raw, untethered humanity at its core.\n\n2.\nThe day the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. He\u2019ll never forget the face of a brilliant graphic designer he'd championed, now holding a small cardboard box. She wasn't angry, just hollowed out. \"I thought we were building something important,\" she whispered. The corporate jargon evaporated, and he saw only the profound human cost. His HR career felt like a lie. It was a moment of sickening clarity that ignited the conviction to be on the other side of that desk.\n\n3.\nIt was 2004, his first official week in private practice. His first client, a celebrated founder, sat in the worn armchair and confessed, \"I feel like a complete fraud.\" The admission was so simple, so vulnerable. In that moment, David felt a profound click of alignment. This was it. Not community health, not HR, but this specific intersection of ambition and anxiety. He wasn't just using his degree; he was finally home professionally, having found his true calling.\n\n4.\nA foggy Tuesday morning, just a few years ago. He was walking through Sutro Forest, the eucalyptus scent thick in the damp air, his partner beside him. No one spoke. The city's noise was a distant, muted hum. In that quiet, shared moment, he felt the deep, settled peace he now craved more than any success. It was the antidote to the frantic energy of his clients' lives\u2014and a reminder of what was truly worth building and sustaining.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a session with a young engineer wrestling with the ethics of her AI project, David stared out his window at the Cole Valley rooftops. He saw her story overlaying hundreds of others he\u2019d heard\u2014a blueprint of anxieties and moral compromises. The phrase \"emotional architecture\" landed in his mind, fully formed. It wasn't just a career; it was a system. In that instant, his ambition shifted from helping individuals to mapping the system for the next generation."
