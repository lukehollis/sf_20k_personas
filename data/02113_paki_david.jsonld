Raised in a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, by two public school teachers, his upbringing was one of modest means, intellectual curiosity, and Midwestern earnestness. He was instilled with a belief that the goal of education was not just to acquire skills, but to become a more thoughtful human being.\n\nHe pursued this belief academically, earning a BA in Sociology before completing a Master's in Social Work (MSW) at the University of Michigan. He initially planned to work in community mental health but was drawn to San Francisco during the first dot-com boom in the late 1990s, fascinated by the cultural upheaval. He took a corporate HR job, a pragmatic choice, but felt deeply unfulfilled.\n\nThe turning point came when the bubble burst. David witnessed brilliant, passionate people, whom he\u2019d hired just months before, break down after being laid off. He saw the immense psychological toll of a culture that preached changing the world but offered little support for the humans doing the work. It was then he found his calling. He quit HR, obtained his clinical license, and started a private practice. He referred to himself, with a touch of irony, as a \"School Counselor in Technology.\"\n\nNow, from his home office in Cole Valley, David\u2019s commute is a walk across the hall. His days are a series of virtual sessions with burned-out software engineers, ethically conflicted founders, and product managers questioning their life\u2019s purpose. He helps them navigate the pressures of imposter syndrome, toxic work environments, and the moral ambiguity of creating world-altering products.\n\nHaving lived in the city for over two decades, David has a long-term, almost paternal relationship with San Francisco. He\u2019s seen it evolve and gentrify, and while he misses some of its old grit, he finds peace in his quiet neighborhood routines\u2014a morning walk in Sutro Forest, coffee from his local cafe, and a quiet dinner with his partner, a landscape architect. At 50, his ambitions have shifted from career-building to legacy. He hopes to write a book on the emotional architecture of the tech industry, a guide for the next generation on how to build a career without losing their soul."
