Born in San Francisco to a Russian father and a mother of mixed Uzbek and Ukrainian heritage, he grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Outer Sunset. His parents, who met in a language class after immigrating, carried the unspoken weight of their pasts. Their home was filled with love but also a quiet, persistent melancholy, a cultural and generational gap Alexei struggled to understand. He was a quintessential C-student, drifting through school with no clear direction, feeling disconnected from both his parents\u2019 world and the ambitions of his peers.\n\nAfter high school, Alexei fell into a pattern of working dead-end jobs\u2014a barista at a perpetually damp cafe, a stocker in a warehouse, a food delivery cyclist battling the city's hills. He felt aimless until a family crisis became his turning point. His father, after losing his job, fell into a severe depression, and the family was lost trying to navigate the complex American mental healthcare system. The breakthrough came via a compassionate, Russian-speaking social worker who not only connected them with resources but helped translate the family's silent pain into a language of healing. For the first time, Alexei saw a path forward.\n\nInspired, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, aggressively pursuing the education he had once dismissed. He transferred to San Francisco State University, earning his Bachelor's and then Master's in Social Work. The journey was a grind of student loans, late-night study sessions, and part-time work, but it was fueled by a newfound purpose.\n\nNow, at 27, Alexei is an Associate Clinical Social Worker for a non-profit serving low-income and immigrant families in the Tenderloin. He lives in a small, rent-controlled studio in the Inner Richmond, where his official commute is zero; his days are a hybrid of telehealth sessions from his desk and field visits across the city. His apartment overlooks a quiet street, a peaceful refuge from the intense emotional labor of his job. He decompress es by running in Golden Gate Park or exploring the city\u2019s myriad noodle shops. His relationship with his parents has transformed; he now possesses the tools to help them navigate their trauma. Alexei\u2019s dream is to one day open a small practice focused on culturally-competent therapy for immigrant and first-generation residents, creating a space for healing for families like his own, right in the city that forged him."
