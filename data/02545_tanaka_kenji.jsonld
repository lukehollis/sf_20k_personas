            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is the quiet pulse of a building he calls both work and home. Raised in the Outer Richmond, he is the son of a Japanese gardener and a seamstress who taught him the value of patient, methodical work. While his peers chased dreams of coding and venture capital, Kenji was fascinated by the tangible world. He preferred taking apart a toaster to studying for his SATs, finding more logic in a wiring diagram than in a line of poetry. This inclination led him not to a four-year university, but to an Associate's degree in HVAC and Applied Technology from a local community college, where he thrived.\n\nHis career began with apprenticeships, learning the guts of commercial buildings across the Bay Area. Five years ago, he landed his current role as the sole Facilities Maintenance Technician for a major tech company in SoMa. The true prize wasn't the salary, but the perk that came with it: a small, modern apartment on a residential floor of the same mixed-use tower. His commute is the length of an elevator ride.\n\nThis proximity gives Kenji a unique, almost anthropological perspective on the industry he serves. He\u2019s the ghost in the machine, the man who gets the call at 3 AM when a server room\u2019s cooling unit fails, threatening a million-dollar project. He sees the frantic sprints of coders fueled by free kombucha with a quiet, craftsman\u2019s amusement. He knows the building\u2019s secrets\u2014the leaky pipe on the seventh floor, the corner of the rooftop deck with the best view of the Bay Bridge.\n\nHis social life is small but steady. A long-term relationship ended a few years back, his ex-girlfriend frustrated by a life she felt was too contained. Now, Kenji finds companionship in a weekly pool league at a dive bar and with the baristas at the corner caf\u00e9 who know his order by heart. His dream is decidedly analog: he\u2019s diligently saving to buy a small house in a quieter part of the Bay Area, a place with a garage where he can spend his weekends restoring a vintage Datsun 240Z, finally building something just for himself."
