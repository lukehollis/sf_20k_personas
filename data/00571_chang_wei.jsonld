He arrived in America at sixteen with his parents, landing in the vibrant, overwhelming maze of San Francisco's Chinatown. The American dream felt distant; survival was immediate. Formal education was a luxury his family couldn't afford, so his high school equivalency was pieced together through night classes long after his formal schooling in China had ended.\n\nHis early career was a mosaic of grueling jobs: washing dishes in bustling restaurants, stocking shelves in neighborhood markets, and hauling construction debris. Each job taught him the language of hard work and the currency of reliability. The turning point came a decade ago when his father's declining health demanded a steadier income. Wei secured a position as a Warehouse Operations Associate for a major tech company. It wasn't the glamorous side of tech, but it was stable. He wasn't writing code; he was moving the physical building blocks of the digital world\u2014servers, laptops, and prototypes\u2014with precision and care.\n\nThis pragmatic choice led him to his current life in Dogpatch. He lives in a small, tidy studio apartment, a literal stone's throw from the massive logistics warehouse where he works, making his commute non-existent. His daily routine is a tight, predictable loop: the short walk to the warehouse before dawn, a physically demanding ten-hour shift, and the walk home. He is an integral but invisible part of the tech boom he sees transforming the city around him.\n\nSocially, Wei is reserved. His life allows for few deep connections beyond a handful of coworkers and his aging parents, whom he visits in the Richmond District every Sunday, bringing groceries and speaking in their shared dialect. His dreams are not of stock options or a corner office. He hopes to save enough to ensure his parents have a comfortable retirement, free from worry. He dreams of one day taking a trip, perhaps to see a national park, a quiet reward for a life of relentless effort. Wei Chang is a pillar of the unseen San Francisco, his story a quiet testament to a life built on resilience and duty, not riches."
