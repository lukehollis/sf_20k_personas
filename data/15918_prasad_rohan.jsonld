Born into an Indo-Fijian family, his upbringing was defined by pragmatism and resilience, traits inherited from grandparents who were indentured laborers. The political instability of the 1987 Fijian coups pushed his family to seek a new life, and they landed in the fog-laced hills of Daly City when Rohan was sixteen. He finished his general diploma at a local high school, feeling more at home tinkering with car engines and electronics than he ever did in a classroom.\n\nCollege was never part of his plan. His path was forged on the ground floor of the nascent tech boom. In his early twenties, he took a job as a \"rack and stack\" technician at a data center, a purely physical role installing servers. While others saw it as manual labor, Rohan saw a complex, living system. He was meticulous, observant, and spent his breaks reading technical manuals and asking engineers questions. He earned certifications\u2014CompTIA, Cisco\u2014on his own time and dime, slowly climbing from technician to shift lead. When the dot-com bubble burst, his deep, practical knowledge of the physical infrastructure made him indispensable, and he survived the layoffs that gutted his department.\n\nThe key turning point was his promotion to Operations Manager a decade ago. It was the formal recognition of a truth everyone already knew: Rohan was the one who kept the lights on. He understood the building\u2019s power, cooling, and network cabling on a level no software engineer ever could.\n\nNow 49, Rohan lives a life of quiet success in the Outer Sunset. His 8.5-mile commute against traffic to a data center in South San Francisco is a calm bookend to his demanding days. He and his wife, Priya, raised their daughter there; she now attends SF State. His life isn't about flashy startups or IPOs; it\u2019s about providing the foundational stability he never had as a child. His social circle is small, centered on family and a few old colleagues. Weekends are for barbecues in his small backyard or long walks along Ocean Beach, watching the cargo ships that remind him of his own journey across the Pacific. His dream is simple: to see his daughter graduate debt-free and to one day retire with the satisfaction of having built a vital, successful life from the ground up, with his own two hands."

Sixteen years old, he stared from the car at endless rows of houses veiled in a thick, grey fog that swallowed the sun. The vibrant greens and blues of Fiji felt a world away. It wasn\u2019t sadness he felt, but a hardening\u2014a silent vow that he would not let this new, colorless world break him. This was the beginning of his resilience.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-one, surrounded by the deafening hum of the data center, he gripped his first server. It was heavy, solid. As he guided it into the rack, the metal runners screeched before it locked into place with a deeply satisfying *click*. For the first time, technology wasn\u2019t an abstract idea in a book; it was a physical thing he could build. In that moment, he felt a powerful sense of purpose. He wasn't just racking a server; he was setting a foundation stone. This was work his hands understood.\n\n3.\nDuring the dot-com bust, the office grew quiet. He watched engineers with expensive degrees pack their boxes. When his boss called him in, he expected the end. Instead, he was told, \u201cRohan, we can\u2019t run this place without you.\u201d Walking back to his post, the weight of that statement settled on him. It wasn\u2019t about hype or stock options; it was about indispensable, practical skill. That day solidified his belief in real, tangible work, a lesson that would guide his life and career.\n\n4.\nStanding on Twin Peaks with his young daughter, Priya, she asked what he did at his job. He pointed down at the sprawling grid of city lights twinkling in the dusk. \u201cYou see all those lights, all those buildings?\u201d he said, his arm around her small shoulders. \u201cI help make sure they stay on.\u201d He felt a surge of quiet pride, connecting his unseen labor with the living pulse of the city. He wasn't just a technician; he was a guardian of the stability he worked so hard to provide for her.\n\n5.\nLast Sunday, walking with his wife along Ocean Beach, they watched a massive cargo ship pass under the bridge. The foghorns echoed. He saw his own story in its slow, steady journey across the vast Pacific\u2014leaving one world, arriving in another, heavily laden with the responsibility of family. He squeezed Priya\u2019s hand, a profound sense of peace washing over him. He had made it to a safe harbor, a life built not on a grand design, but with his own two hands, piece by painstaking piece."
