The son of immigrants from Guangdong, he was raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. His childhood memories are threaded with the rumbling of the L Taraval streetcar, the vehicle that ferried his mother, laden with grocery bags from Chinatown, back to their small apartment above a laundromat. He saw early on how public transit was not an amenity but a lifeline, the circulatory system for the city\u2019s working families.\n\nThis intimate understanding of urban mobility propelled him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning. While his peers were drawn to private development or abstract theory, David was obsessed with the practical, messy reality of moving people. He joined the city\u2019s transportation agency straight out of grad school, starting as a junior analyst and methodically working his way up over three decades. His career became his life's work, a fact that contributed to an amicable but lonely divorce ten years ago. His proudest professional achievement was his instrumental role in the Central Subway project, a grueling, decade-long battle of budgets, engineering, and politics he saw as a generational investment.\n\nNow, as Director of Transit Planning, David\u2019s days are a whirlwind of meetings, data analysis, and long-term strategic planning. He lives alone in a meticulously tidy apartment in Cole Valley, his 5.5-mile commute on the N Judah a daily ritual of observation. He notes rider patterns, train cleanliness, and delays with a professional eye. His social life is quiet, consisting of occasional dinners with colleagues and weekly video calls with his daughter, a software engineer in Seattle.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to see the groundwork laid for a new, city-spanning subway line before he retires\u2014a legacy project that would reshape San Francisco for the next century. He feels the immense weight and privilege of his role, seeing himself not just as a planner, but as a steward of the city that gave his family a foothold. In his quiet moments, he hopes to one day write a book on the history of SF\u2019s transit, a final love letter to the buses and trains that have defined his life."

He\u2019d watch the headlight of the L streetcar emerge from the grey mist, his stomach tightening with anticipation. The best moment was seeing his mother through the window, her arms looped through plastic bags heavy with bok choy and the faint, greasy scent of roast duck. Her tired smile as she stepped onto the pavement was his definition of home. It wasn\u2019t a train; it was the vessel that brought his world back to him.\n\n2.\nHe remembers his first public meeting as a junior analyst, around 1995. He came armed with charts on ridership data and stop optimization. But an elderly woman with a cane silenced the room, her voice trembling as she described missing doctor's appointments because the 38 Geary was too crowded for her to board. In that moment, his numbers and theories felt hollow. He understood then that his job wasn't about efficiency, but about dignity. That night, he mentally tore up his purely academic approach to planning.\n\n3.\nThe Central Subway breakthrough was not a public ceremony but a moment deep underground, thick with the smell of wet earth, chalk dust, and sweat. When the massive boring machine head finally chewed through the last wall into the Yerba Buena/Moscone station cavern, a raw cheer echoed off the concrete. David felt a profound, bone-deep satisfaction that had nothing to do with politics or budgets. It was the physical, visceral feeling of connecting two parts of the city. He had helped create a new artery for San Francisco.\n\n4.\nTen years ago, he sat with his wife at their dining table, his project blueprints for the subway expansion spread out like a barricade between them. She wasn\u2019t angry, just weary. \"Your heart is in those tunnels, David,\" she\u2019d said, her voice soft with resignation. He couldn\u2019t deny it. Their amicable separation wasn\u2019t a bitter fight but a quiet casualty of his singular devotion. The loneliness that followed was immense, but it cemented his understanding of the personal cost of building a public legacy.\n\n5.\nLast month, on his N Judah commute, he saw a young father patiently explaining the route map to his small daughter, her face full of wonder. David thought of his own daughter in Seattle, and then of this child\u2019s future. He felt an intense, paternal wave of responsibility, not just for the train they were on, but for the one this girl might ride in thirty years. It solidified his quiet dream\u2014to lay the first plans for a new line, a gift to a generation he would never meet."
