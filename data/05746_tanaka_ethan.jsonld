Raised in Daly City by third-generation Japanese American parents, his home was one of practicality, not academic pressure. While his friends chased acceptance letters from prestigious universities, Ethan was happier taking apart the family\u2019s old VCR or trying to coax a dial-up modem into working faster. His father, a logistics manager, and his mother, a bank teller, encouraged his hands-on curiosity. A four-year degree felt abstract; a circuit board felt real.\n\nThis led him to Skyline College, where he earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Electronics Technology. After a few years working for big-box stores and small repair shops, he landed a coveted role as a Field Technician for a major smart home company. This was his turning point. The job offered autonomy, a company van, and the financial independence to finally move into San Francisco proper.\n\nNow 29, Ethan lives in a tidy studio in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a technicality; his apartment is his command center. Each morning begins with coffee and a tablet, reviewing a queue of installation and repair tickets that will take him to a different corner of the city\u2014from a sleek SoMa loft to a sprawling Pacific Heights Victorian. He sees the real San Francisco, the one behind the front doors.\n\nHis social life is small but solid, revolving around a few old friends and regular ramen dinners with his younger sister, an SF State student. A year out from a long-term relationship, he\u2019s cautiously navigating the dating world, finding it more complex than any network he\u2019s ever had to troubleshoot.\n\nEthan feels a deep, quiet connection to the city's texture. He loves the Richmond\u2019s foggy calm and the easy access to Golden Gate Park. He dreams of one day starting his own high-end home automation business, a venture that would blend his technical skill with a craftsman's touch. For now, he finds satisfaction in solving problems, in making things work, and in knowing the intricate, hidden wiring of the city he calls home."
