The only child of a Korean ceramicist mother, Ja-Young, and an American literature professor father, David, Chloe grew up in the quiet suburbs of the East Bay. Her childhood was a fusion of her mother\u2019s precise, minimalist aesthetic and her father\u2019s love for sprawling narratives. From her mother, she learned the power of a single, perfect object to define a space; from her father, she learned how to build a compelling story around it.\n\nThis dual heritage guided her educational path. After a practical business degree from UC Davis, she felt her career stalling in an entry-level marketing role. This frustration became her turning point. Recognizing the need to merge her creative instincts with sharp business acumen, she pursued an MBA in Brand Management at USC. The degree was her key, unlocking a path into the competitive world of retail buying. She started as a junior buyer, quickly distinguishing herself with her keen eye for trends and shrewd negotiating skills, leading to her current role as a Senior Buyer.\n\nNow, Chloe\u2019s life is firmly rooted in her Hayes Valley apartment, a space that doubles as her personal sanctuary and professional laboratory. Her days begin with a 2.8-mile bicycle commute, a bracing ride that cuts through the city\u2019s morning rush and clears her head for a day of analyzing sales data and meeting with vendors. Her evenings are for pilates, exploring new restaurants with a tight-knit group of friends, or simply unwinding by rearranging a corner of her apartment until it feels just right.\n\nChloe\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both practical and emotional. The city\u2019s dynamic blend of tech-driven ambition and artistic spirit mirrors her own personality. While she\u2019s proud of her professional achievements, she aspires to one day launch her own boutique brand of sustainable, artisan-crafted home goods. This dream is her north star\u2014a future where she is not just the buyer, but the ultimate curator of her own story."

Ja-Young was glazing a single porcelain bowl, her movements a quiet meditation. \u201cIt must be perfect,\u201d her mother whispered, more to the bowl than to Chloe, \"because it has to hold the empty space.\" Chloe understood then that an object\u2019s power wasn't in its function, but in the story it contained. That quiet moment became the foundation of her entire aesthetic philosophy, teaching her to value intention and form above all else.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent lights of her first marketing job felt like they were shrinking her world. Trapped in a beige cubicle at 24, she reviewed another spreadsheet and felt a deep, physical ache of misplaced potential. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic outburst, but a quiet, internal rebellion. That afternoon, she walked out, sat in a Mission District coffee shop, and for the first time, sketched out a life where her father\u2019s stories and her mother\u2019s objects could coexist. The MBA application was the first concrete step towards building it.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHer boss had called the minimalist, hand-thrown ceramic lamp collection a \"niche risk.\" Two years into her buyer role, Chloe pushed for it anyway, crafting a narrative around the artisan for the marketing team. She remembers the exact moment the weekly sales report landed in her inbox. They hadn't just sold well; they sold out. It was a surge of pure, unadulterated vindication. For the first time, she knew her instincts\u2014that curated blend of art and commerce\u2014were not just a part of her, but her greatest professional asset.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHer first solo bicycle ride from her new Hayes Valley apartment felt like claiming territory. Pushing up the slight incline on Page Street, the morning chill on her face, the city felt raw and immediate. It wasn't about exercise; it was about momentum. This daily 2.8-mile journey became a ritual, a physical manifestation of her own forward drive. The burn in her legs was proof of her effort, and the view of the city unfolding before her was the reward she gave herself each day.\n\n***\n\n5.\nIt was last spring, unwinding after a long week by rearranging the shelves in her living room. She placed a single, rough-hewn wooden vase against a stack of her father's classic novels. In that simple composition, her past and present clicked into place, and her future suddenly became clear. This\u2014this act of curating, of telling a story with objects\u2014wasn't just her job. It was her calling. The idea for her own sustainable home goods brand was no longer a dream, but an inevitability."
