            "value": "David Cohen\u2019s life is a study in quiet pragmatism, a story he files away as neatly as the insurance claims that define his days. Raised in the predictable comfort of Walnut Creek, he was the son of a CPA and a librarian, a background that promised stability. Yet, in a youthful act of intellectual rebellion, David pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature at SF State, immersing himself in poetry and deconstructionism, dreaming of a life in academia or publishing.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was the turning point that rerouted his life\u2019s trajectory. With his idealistic career path crumbling and the security his parents championed looking more appealing than ever, he took a job as a claims processor. It was meant to be temporary. Thirteen years later, David is a senior claims adjuster, working remotely from his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bed to a small desk overlooking a fog-shrouded courtyard. The job, which involves methodically assessing others\u2019 misfortunes, has molded him into a cautious, detail-oriented man.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate but contained. He eschews the city\u2019s frantic energy for the quiet routines of his neighborhood. His days are punctuated by the rumble of the N-Judah line, walks through the Presidio to clear his head after a difficult claim, and picking up pork buns from a Clement Street bakery. His social life is similarly curated, consisting of a bi-weekly board game night with two friends from college and occasional calls with his parents. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and he has since found a solitary rhythm he is reluctant to disrupt.\n\nDavid\u2019s dreams are filed away, but not forgotten. He harbors a quiet aspiration to one day write a novel, a small, character-driven story unlike the grand tragedies he assesses for work. For now, he finds solace in the precision of his job and the predictable serenity of his neighborhood, a man who chose a secure harbor over the uncertain seas he once longed to explore."
