For Kai, 25, his commute is a 0.0-mile journey from his small studio on the building's fourth floor down to the social services office on the first. He is a residential case manager for a supportive housing non-profit, and the line between his personal and professional life is perpetually blurred.\n\nThe only son of immigrants from Guangdong, Kai grew up amidst the fragrant chaos of his parents' small grocery store in the Excelsior district. They instilled in him the values of hard work and filial piety, hoping he would pursue a lucrative business degree at SF State. For a time, Kai followed that path, dutifully studying economics. The turning point was a mandatory service-learning course that placed him in a shelter just a few blocks from where he now lives. The raw, unfiltered need he witnessed there rewired his ambitions. He saw families like his own, but without the safety net of community or luck.\n\nHe abruptly changed his major to sociology and, after graduating, enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program. His parents, though proud of his graduate degree, still quietly worry about his career choice, a sentiment expressed through the extra servings of dim sum they press on him during their weekly Sunday lunches.\n\nKai's daily routine is a cycle of crisis management, paperwork, and small, hard-won victories. He helps residents navigate bureaucracy, access mental health services, and find employment. His social circle is small, mostly composed of fellow social workers with whom he shares cynical jokes and genuine camaraderie. For escape, he runs\u2014long, punishing jogs along the Embarcadero, trading the claustrophobia of his building for the wide-open expanse of the bay.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and fierce. He sees both its brutal inequalities and its resilient spirit daily. Kai\u2019s dream isn\u2019t about a bigger apartment or a higher salary; it's about systemic change. He hopes to one day transition into policy work, to fight for the funding and legislation that could make his current job obsolete, creating a city where everyone has a place to truly call home."
