Born in Concord to an Iranian immigrant father and a white American mother from the Central Valley, Cody grew up straddling two very different worlds. His father, an auto mechanic who preached the gospel of a stable trade, and his mother, a supermarket manager, envisioned a straightforward path for him: community college, then a degree from a Cal State.\n\nCody, however, found the structure of school stifling. He was bright but restless, more interested in people than textbooks. At 17, he took a job as a barback at a local restaurant. It was a revelation. He was mesmerized by the theater of it all: the clatter of shakers, the precise pour, the alchemy of turning simple liquids into complex experiences, and the easy confidence of the bartenders. This was a craft.\n\nForsaking college, much to his father\u2019s initial disappointment, Cody dedicated himself to bartending. He moved to San Francisco at 20 with meager savings, talking his way into a job at a bustling North Beach bar. He absorbed everything, spending his days off reading cocktail histories and experimenting with infusions. His talent for flavor balance and his calm, engaging demeanor soon got him noticed.\n\nA key turning point was landing a position at an acclaimed, almost-hidden cocktail lounge in Hayes Valley. There, his creativity flourished. He was promoted to Lead Bartender within two years, his high income a direct result of his skill, leadership, and the city\u2019s high-end clientele.\n\nNow 24, Cody lives a life inverted from the city\u2019s tech-driven pulse. He lives in a small studio just a 0.8-mile walk from work, often stopping at a local market for fresh herbs for the bar. His social circle is a tight-knit group of industry friends\u2014chefs, servers, and fellow bartenders who understand the nocturnal rhythm. His relationship with his parents has improved; his success, tangible and hard-won, has finally earned his father\u2019s grudging respect. Cody\u2019s ambition now extends beyond mixing drinks. He dreams of owning his own place one day\u2014a small, intimate bar in a neighborhood like the Mission, showcasing his unique take on classic cocktails and proving that a different kind of ambition can thrive in San Francisco."

The careful muddle, the slow stir, the expressive zest of orange peel over the flame. It was performance, chemistry, and conversation all at once. In that moment, beneath the low lights of the restaurant, the path his parents had laid out for him vanished. He felt a profound certainty that this\u2014this craft, this theater\u2014was his. It was the start of everything.\n\n2.\nHe stood in his first San Francisco studio at 20, the fog pressing against the cheap window. His savings were almost gone, but he'd talked his way into the North Beach bar job that very afternoon. He ate stale saltines from the box for dinner, the exhaustion of the hustle warring with pure adrenaline. The city hummed around him, indifferent and electric. He felt terrifyingly alone but also, for the first time, completely free. This tiny, empty room was paid for by his own nerve, a foundation he was building himself.\n\n3.\nHis father finally came to his bar last year. Dressed in his work khakis, he looked out of place against the polished wood and hushed clientele. Cody made him his signature Sazerac. His dad, a man of few words, held the heavy crystal glass in his calloused mechanic\u2019s hands, took a slow sip, and nodded. \"It's good,\" he said, looking at Cody directly. \"You built a good thing here.\" In that simple, quiet approval, years of unspoken disappointment dissolved, replaced by a hard-won, grounding respect that Cody had been chasing all along.\n\n4.\nIt was the first drink he felt was truly his creation. At the Hayes Valley lounge, he\u2019d been infusing gin with cardamom and rosewater, a subtle nod to his Iranian heritage. He served it to a regular, a notoriously tough food writer. She took a sip, closed her eyes for a second, then looked at him and said, \u201cCody, this has a point of view.\u201d That validation was a lightning strike. It was the moment he realized he wasn\u2019t just a good bartender; he was an artist with a story to tell.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, on his late-night walk home, he saw a dusty, vacant corner spot in the Mission. Suddenly, the vague dream of \"owning a place\" became a blueprint in his mind. He could see the warm lighting, the 10-seat bar, the short, perfect menu. He stood on the pavement for five minutes, heart pounding with a feeling that was part fear, part absolute purpose. The next day, he opened a separate savings account labeled \"The Bar.\" The dream was no longer a cloud; it was a destination."
