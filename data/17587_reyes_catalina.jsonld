Born and raised on 24th Street, her childhood was a vibrant soundtrack of cumbia music, the smell of fresh pan dulce, and the constant, comforting hum of her community. Her parents, immigrants from El Salvador, worked tirelessly\u2014her father in construction, her mother as a housekeeper\u2014to provide for Catalina and her younger brother. Their work ethic was her inheritance, a lesson learned more deeply than any textbook could teach.\n\nSchool was a means to an end for Catalina. Pragmatic and restless, she knew the traditional college path wasn\u2019t for her. After graduating from high school, she jumped straight into the workforce, landing a job as a receptionist at a bustling real estate agency in Noe Valley. For two years, she answered phones and filed paperwork, absorbing the language of escrows, contingencies, and commissions. She watched agents, some barely older than her, closing deals that eclipsed her parents\u2019 annual income. A quiet fire was lit.\n\nThe turning point was saving a deal that was falling apart due to a Spanish-speaking client\u2019s misunderstanding. Catalina stepped in to translate, calming frayed nerves and clarifying the terms with a familiarity and warmth the agent lacked. In that moment, she understood her value. She spent the next year working full-time while taking night classes, studying relentlessly for her real estate license. Passing the exam was the single proudest moment of her life.\n\nToday, Catalina is a successful agent, specializing in the neighborhoods she knows best: the Mission, Bernal Heights, and a bit of Noe. Her used Lexus is her mobile office, a symbol of a hard-won success that feels both triumphant and complicated. She navigates the city\u2019s complex housing market with a unique empathy, guiding first-time buyers while also working with investors who are transforming the very streets she grew up on. This internal conflict is her constant companion.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is profound and deeply personal. She lives in a small one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond, a quiet escape from her work life, but her heart remains in the Mission, where she attends Sunday dinner at her parents\u2019 rent-controlled apartment without fail. Her dream isn\u2019t to sell the most expensive mansion; it\u2019s to save enough to buy a multi-unit property in the Mission, to provide a stable home for her own family and another, keeping one small piece of the neighborhood in the hands of the people who built it."

The scent of sugar and warm bread was the smell of safety. Her mother bought her a slice of pineapple *semita*, its familiar sweetness melting on her tongue. That specific warmth is what she searches for in every home she shows, the feeling of a place that holds you. It\u2019s the anchor of her entire world, a taste of belonging she guards fiercely.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the agent\u2019s impatient sigh. An elderly couple, terrified of signing the English papers, were about to lose their deposit. Catalina, then nineteen, stepped forward. Speaking in the soft, respectful Spanish her parents used, she explained the contingency clause. She saw the relief wash over their faces, a blooming trust the agent could never earn. In that instant, she wasn't just a receptionist; she was a bridge. Her heritage became her power, and the quiet fire roared to life.\n\n3.\nAt twenty-one, she sat in her parents\u2019 living room, the laptop screen glowing. After months of working full-time and taking night classes, her finger trembled over the mouse. The word \u201cPASS\u201d materialized, and a sob of pure, unadulterated relief escaped her. It wasn\u2019t a diploma, but something more. It was proof that her father\u2019s calloused hands and her mother\u2019s tired feet had built a foundation strong enough for her to launch from. It was a victory entirely her own.\n\n4.\nHer first six-figure commission came from a two-unit building on Folsom, sold to an investor who spoke of \"maximizing potential.\" Holding the check, which was more money than her parents saw in a year, felt like a betrayal and a triumph all at once. She bought her Lexus that week. Driving it through the Mission, she saw the ghosts of the families who used to live in buildings just like that one. It was the moment success became heavy, a weight she carries into every deal.\n\n5.\nLast Sunday, watching her father laugh from his armchair, she looked out their apartment window. She saw the new condo building where a favorite mural used to be. The view held her entire life: the rent-controlled stability her parents clung to and the gentrification she profited from. In that moment, her ambition crystallized. It wasn't just about owning property. It was about buying back a piece of this view, securing a deed that said 'Reyes' on it, ensuring one small corner of the Mission belonged to them."
