The son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Richmond District, David grew up understanding the language of hard work long before he mastered English. His parents valued diligence over academic accolades, a lesson he took to heart. While his friends aimed for Berkeley or Stanford, David found his place at City College of San Francisco, earning a practical associate\u2019s degree in industrial technology.\n\nHe started on the floor of a large-scale artisan bakery in the Dogpatch over 30 years ago, packing loaves for delivery. David wasn\u2019t the fastest worker, but he was the most observant. He learned the rhythm of every conveyor belt and the temperament of every oven. His turning point came during a massive equipment failure on a holiday weekend; while managers scrambled, David diagnosed the mechanical issue and organized a manual workaround, saving a crucial shipment. That initiative set him on a path from line worker to lead hand, and eventually, to Production Supervisor.\n\nThis dedication came at a cost. His life became the factory, a reality that contributed to an amicable but lonely divorce a decade ago. His primary connection is now with his crew\u2014the men and women he advocates for and manages daily. His greatest pride is his daughter, Chloe, a tech project manager who lives in a world of startups and algorithms he barely understands.\n\nDavid\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his current life. He lives in a small, functional apartment built into the factory\u2019s second story, a remnant of an older industrial era. His days are governed by production schedules. He wakes before dawn, walks downstairs to the factory floor, and spends his day troubleshooting, managing personnel, and ensuring quality. He is a fixture in the Dogpatch, a ghost of its industrial past walking among the new condos and hip breweries. His dream is simple: to see his daughter happy and to one day retire, perhaps finally taking a trip to Korea to see the country his parents left behind. He hopes the factory, his life\u2019s work, can withstand the city's relentless change."

In his parents\u2019 Richmond District store, his father would wordlessly adjust a crooked stack, offering only a small, satisfied nod. That silent approval meant more than any report card. It was a lesson in diligence learned amidst the scent of produce and mothballs, teaching him that the reward for good work was simply the work itself, done right. This became his lifelong pursuit, ingrained in him since boyhood.\n\n2.\nThe air was thick with panic and burning rubber on that Thanksgiving weekend. While managers shouted, the main proofer\u2019s shrieking halt was a language David understood. A strange calm settled over him as he traced the mechanics, his hands knowing the machine\u2019s anatomy by heart. In that moment of chaos, diagnosing the fault and organizing the crew, he felt his purpose click into place. He wasn't just a worker anymore; he was the one who listened to the factory when it was in pain.\n\n3.\nHe brought Chloe to the factory once, when she was eight. He wanted her to see his world\u2014the powerful ovens, the dancing loaves on the line. He watched her small face, expecting awe, but saw only wary confusion in the overwhelming heat and noise. She held his flour-dusted hand tightly but kept her eyes on the exit. In her polite silence, he understood. This place, his kingdom, was not for her. He vowed then that her life would be built of quiet keyboards, not this beautiful, grinding chaos.\n\n4.\nHe and his wife sat at their kitchen table, the low hum of the factory below vibrating through the floorboards. \"It's always here, isn't it?\" she\u2019d said, not with anger, but with a tired finality. It wasn\u2019t an accusation, just a fact. The factory was the third person in their marriage, the one he always came home to because he never truly left. In that quiet moment of shared understanding from a decade ago, he knew his choice had been made years ago, and loneliness was its price.\n\n5.\nA young packer, new and nervous, miscalibrated a slicer, costing them a small batch. Corporate wanted him fired. David stood in the sterile front office, flour still on his collar, and refused. He described the boy\u2019s diligence, his willingness to learn, taking the blame himself for insufficient training. He won. Seeing the immense relief in that young man's eyes the next day was a greater victory than hitting any production target. It affirmed his real job: he wasn\u2019t just a supervisor, he was a shield."
