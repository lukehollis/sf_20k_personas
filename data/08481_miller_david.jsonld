            "value": "Born in Busan, South Korea, David was adopted at six months old by a loving, academically focused couple in Minneapolis. The Millers provided him with every opportunity, but he grew up acutely aware of being one of the few Asian faces in his predominantly white suburban community. This fostered a quiet, intense drive to excel, to prove himself worthy of the life he\u2019d been given. He channeled this pressure into academics, becoming a star student who always aimed for the most prestigious path available.\n\nHis educational journey was a straight line to success. After an undergraduate degree in economics, he was accepted into the MBA program at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, which first brought him to the Bay Area. The vibrant, diverse culture of Northern California was a breath of fresh air. Upon graduating, he secured a coveted position at a top-tier management consulting firm. For years, he was a road warrior, living out of suitcases and solving complex problems for Fortune 500 companies. A key turning point came during a six-month project in Seoul. Immersed in his birth country for the first time as an adult, he felt an unexpected and profound connection, sparking a dormant curiosity about his roots.\n\nNow 35, David lives a life of calculated efficiency in a sleek Hayes Valley condo. The pandemic shifted his work permanently remote, reducing his commute to the few steps from his bedroom to his standing desk. His days are a disciplined sequence of Zoom calls with international clients, data analysis, and crafting PowerPoint decks. His social circle consists mainly of other ambitious professionals, meeting for cocktails at Absinthe or dinner in the Mission.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of professional convenience and aesthetic appreciation, yet he often feels like an observer. He walks through his bustling neighborhood but feels more connected to the colleagues on his screen. His greatest aspiration is no longer climbing the corporate ladder. Quietly, he spends his evenings on language apps, learning Korean. He dreams of taking a sabbatical, not for a vacation, but a pilgrimage\u2014to return to Busan, walk its streets, and perhaps, begin the search for the family that gave him up, hoping to finally integrate the two disparate halves of his identity."
