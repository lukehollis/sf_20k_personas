The son of an accountant and a librarian, his childhood was one of structured quietude. While his parents hoped for a stable engineering career, David was compulsively drawn to form and space, spending hours sketching impossible buildings and deconstructing household objects to understand their structure. This artistic inclination was a source of gentle friction, a puzzle his practical family couldn't quite solve.\n\nHe initially pursued a traditional architecture degree but felt constrained by the focus on commercial and residential buildings. A transformative guest lecture on temporary public art installations ignited a new passion. He pivoted, ultimately earning a Master of Fine Arts in Environmental Design, a degree that merged his love for structure with a desire for pure expression.\n\nDavid arrived in San Francisco in the mid-90s, drawn by its reputation as a haven for creators. He secured a raw, cavernous live-work loft in SoMa, back when the neighborhood was still a gritty enclave for artists and industry. It was here he built his career and his life, with his drafting tables and model-making tools bleeding into his living space. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this fusion.\n\nHis professional life flourished as he became the go-to designer for projects that required architectural thinking but artistic execution: immersive museum exhibits, complex stage designs for experimental theater, and large-scale installations for city festivals. A key turning point was a decade-long partnership that dissolved under the weight of his devotion to his work, a painful event that left him more solitary but also more intensely focused.\n\nToday, David\u2019s life is a disciplined rhythm. Mornings start with strong coffee and sketching, followed by hours of digital modeling. He is a familiar, quiet presence in his evolving neighborhood, a remnant of its bohemian past amidst the newer tech-driven sheen. Now 52, David feels the pull of legacy. He dreams of creating one definitive, permanent public art piece for the city\u2014a work that captures its transient beauty and relentless spirit, a final, perfect structure born from a lifetime of shaping space."
