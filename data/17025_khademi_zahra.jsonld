Born in Berkeley to Iranian parents who fled Tehran in the early 1980s, her childhood was filled with stories of a homeland lost to revolution and the frustrating, paper-strewn process of building a new life in America. Her father, a former engineer, and her mother, a teacher, navigated a tangle of immigration forms and public services that seemed designed to confuse rather than help. It was these dinner-table conversations that planted the seed of Zahra\u2019s career: a deep-seated desire to fix broken systems from the inside.\n\nShe pursued a degree in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, driven by pragmatic idealism. Her early career in the non-profit sector was rewarding but frustrating; she could help dozens, but the systemic problems affecting thousands remained. The turning point came a decade ago when she saw the Bay Area's tech boom transforming private industries. She realized the same user-centric design principles could be applied to government. This revelation led her to her current role as a Digital Services Product Manager for the City of San Francisco, where she spearheads projects to make essential services\u2014like applying for small business permits or accessing housing support\u2014intuitive and accessible online.\n\nToday, Zahra lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a walk to a local bakery for coffee before catching the 5-Fulton bus downtown. The 4.7-mile commute isn\u2019t a chore; it\u2019s her direct line to the city she serves, observing the diverse cross-section of residents who will use the tools she helps build. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends, a chosen family of fellow civic-minded professionals and artists she hosts for potlucks and game nights.\n\nAt 42, Zahra\u2019s ambition is not for wealth or status, but for impact. She dreams of a San Francisco where interacting with the city government is as seamless as ordering a car service. Her hope is to leave behind a legacy not of policies, but of functional, elegant digital infrastructure that empowers the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents, ensuring no one feels as lost as her parents once did."

An brilliant engineer who designed complex systems was defeated by a government form, his shoulders slumped in a way she\u2019d never seen. The sight of her strong, capable father looking so small and lost in a sea of baffling bureaucracy ignited a quiet, protective anger in her. It wasn't just paper; it was a wall. That moment planted the seed of her life's work: to tear down those walls, one form at a time.\n\n2.\nAbout fifteen years ago, while working at a housing non-profit, she spent an afternoon helping an elderly Russian woman navigate a benefits application. The woman finally clasped Zahra\u2019s hand, her eyes wet with gratitude. The warmth of the moment was quickly replaced by a profound sense of futility. She had helped one person, but thousands more were still lost in the same maze. This memory cemented her shift from direct aid to systemic change, realizing compassion wasn't enough without better tools.\n\n3.\nThe revelation came a decade ago, not in a policy meeting, but in a Divisadero coffee shop. Frustrated with her work, she ordered lunch on a new app. The process was seamless, elegant, and user-focused. The contrast between that simple transaction and the civic systems she battled daily was a physical shock. Why, she thought, can ordering a burrito be more dignified than applying for housing? That question became her new mission, sparking her move into civic tech.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, weeks after her team launched a simplified online portal for small business permits, she received an unsolicited email. It was from a new cafe owner in the Mission, a woman who said she\u2019d been dreading the process but found it surprisingly easy. She attached a photo of her newly issued license taped proudly to her counter. Zahra saved the email. It wasn\u2019t a data point; it was proof. It was the moment her abstract goal felt tangibly, beautifully real.\n\n5.\nJust last autumn, on her morning commute on the 5-Fulton, she watched a young man trying to use his phone to access a city service website. She saw his brow furrow in confusion, the quick, frustrated taps, the sigh as he gave up. She didn't feel smug; she felt a quiet, urgent sense of responsibility. He wasn't an anonymous commuter; he was her user, her neighbor. The 4.7-mile ride became a reminder that her work wasn\u2019t in an office, but right here, on this bus."
