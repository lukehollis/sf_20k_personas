Growing up in Fresno, the son of a meticulous auto mechanic, Ryan spent his childhood not on sports fields, but in the garage, surrounded by the organized chaos of tools and machinery. He was fascinated by how things fit together, spending hours disassembling old VCRs and building elaborate Lego structures far beyond the instructions. This innate curiosity for mechanics and design led him to pursue a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where the university's \"learn by doing\" philosophy felt like a natural extension of his upbringing.\n\nUpon graduation, a prestigious offer from a Bay Area tech company to be a Manufacturing Design Engineer pulled him north. The transition from the Central Valley to San Francisco was a culture shock, but he found his niche not in the city's nightlife, but in its creative undercurrent. His key turning point came during his first major project: translating a sleek, conceptual product from a digital render into a manufacturable reality. The challenge of sourcing materials, refining tolerances, and solving physical puzzles ignited a passion that solidified his career path.\n\nToday, Ryan lives a quiet, focused life in a one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to a corner of his living room, now a dedicated workstation with dual monitors displaying complex CAD models and a 3D printer humming as it produces prototypes. His days are a disciplined cycle of deep work, broken up by long walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head.\n\nHis social circle is small but tight-knit, composed mostly of fellow engineers and a few friends from the Dogpatch Boulders climbing gym where he unwinds twice a week. Ryan isn't chasing a VP title; his dream is more tangible. He aspires to launch his own small company, designing and manufacturing elegant, durable everyday objects\u2014a perfectly weighted pen, a minimalist wallet\u2014that honor the principles of quality craftsmanship his father instilled in him. For Ryan, success isn't just a concept; it\u2019s something he can hold in his hand."
