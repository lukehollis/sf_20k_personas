The daughter of a high school history teacher and a registered nurse, she grew up in a home where dinner conversations revolved around civic duty and the quiet dignity of public service. Her path felt pre-ordained: solid, sensible, and aimed at contribution, not disruption. She pursued a Political Science degree at UC Davis, fascinated by the mechanics of systems that govern people\u2019s lives.\n\nHer turning point came during graduate school. Enrolled in the Master of Public Policy program at UC Berkeley, an internship with the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development threw her into the city\u2019s most intractable problem. The staggering gap between policy intention and on-the-ground reality galvanized her. Instead of feeling cynical, Sarah felt a pull\u2014a deep-seated need to be on the inside, untangling the knots of bureaucracy to effect real change.\n\nUpon graduating, she secured a coveted role as a Policy Analyst for the City and County of San Francisco, specializing in affordable housing initiatives. Now 35, her life is a testament to that commitment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice; she lives in a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, just a short walk from the golden dome of City Hall. Her days are a hybrid of working from her sunlit living room, surrounded by stacks of reports, and walking to the office for in-person strategy meetings.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle, mostly fellow policy wonks and friends from grad school who work at local non-profits. Evenings are often spent decompressing over a glass of wine at a neighborhood bar, debating zoning laws and the merits of a new transit proposal. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; she doesn\u2019t aspire to be mayor. Her hope is to one day stand at a ribbon-cutting for an affordable housing complex she helped shepherd from a dense policy brief into tangible brick and mortar. For Sarah, putting down roots in a city defined by transience means helping build a foundation where others can, too."
