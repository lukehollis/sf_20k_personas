            "value": "Kenji Miller is a man who knows the secret language of buildings. Born in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District to a Japanese immigrant mother who worked as a nurse and a second-generation Irish-American father who was a union plumber, Kenji grew up between cultures. He was a quiet, observant child, more fascinated by the intricate workings of the family toaster than by playground politics. While his father hoped he\u2019d follow him into plumbing, Kenji found his calling in the more complex choreography of electrical and ventilation systems.\n\nSchool was a means to an end. Uninspired by academia, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, finding his stride in the practical, hands-on coursework. He earned his Associate's degree in HVAC and Building Maintenance Technology and began working as a technician for a city-wide property management company. Kenji was reliable, methodical, and had an uncanny ability to diagnose problems others missed.\n\nThe major turning point in his life came sixteen years ago. After a brief and amicable divorce in his late twenties left him feeling unmoored, the senior technician at a large, pre-war apartment building in the Inner Richmond announced his retirement. Kenji, who had filled in there several times, was offered the live-in position. He took it, moving into the modest ground-floor unit that came with the job. Suddenly, his commute was zero and his life gained a new, solid center.\n\nToday, Kenji\u2019s existence is intimately woven into the fabric of the building he maintains. His day starts with a walk-through, checking the boiler room and listening to the hums and clicks that tell him the structure\u2019s health. He knows every tenant, from the elderly woman in 4B who needs her radiator bled every autumn to the young couple in 2A who always lock themselves out. His social life is small but sturdy: weekly calls with his mother, a beer with a fellow technician on Thursdays, and conversations with residents in the lobby. He doesn't dream of wealth or fame; his quiet aspiration is to save enough to buy a small, used fishing boat to take out on the Bay, a solitary escape from the city he so diligently serves. Kenji Miller found his purpose not in changing the world, but in ensuring one small, vital corner of it runs perfectly."
