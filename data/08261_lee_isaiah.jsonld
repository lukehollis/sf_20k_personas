Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Sacramento, his father was a small-scale contractor and his mother a high school teacher. They instilled in him a solid work ethic, but Isaiah always felt a pull toward the glamour and energy of the city just a couple of hours west. He enrolled at Sacramento State to study business, but found the lectures dry and disconnected from the real world of commerce he craved. After two years, he dropped out and followed a friend to San Francisco, initially just for a summer.\n\nThe city captivated him. He worked a series of service jobs, bartending in the Marina and waiting tables in North Beach, absorbing the city's frantic pace. It was during this time, pouring drinks for tech millionaires and old-money families, that he saw where the real power lay: property. In his mid-twenties, he cashed in his meager savings to get his real estate license. His first few years were a grind, learning the market\u2019s brutal dynamics during a downturn. His turning point came when he successfully brokered the sale of a dilapidated Victorian in Hayes Valley, seeing its potential long before the neighborhood\u2019s boom. The commission from that single deal changed his life.\n\nNow 41, Isaiah is a polished, successful agent specializing in high-end residential properties. He lives and works out of a sleek, minimalist condo in Noe Valley, his commute a walk from his bedroom to his home office. His days are a blur of client calls, staging consultations, and strategic lunches. Socially, his life is a revolving door of clients and industry contacts; deep, lasting relationships have been a casualty of his ambition, including a long-term partnership that ended two years ago.\n\nWhile he projects an image of utter success, Isaiah privately yearns for something more than the next commission. He dreams of moving from agent to investor, buying and restoring classic San Francisco properties himself\u2014a nod, perhaps, to his father\u2019s trade. He has an intricate relationship with the city; he loves its beauty and dynamism but is acutely aware of how he facilitates the very changes that push out its soul. His future aspiration is to build a legacy, not just a list of sales, in the city that allowed him to become who he is."
