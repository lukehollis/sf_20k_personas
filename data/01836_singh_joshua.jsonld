Born in Fremont to Punjabi immigrants who ran a small grocery store, he was the first-generation son tasked with fulfilling a familiar dream. While his younger sister dutifully pursued medicine, Joshua charted a different course. At UC Berkeley, he veered away from a prescribed engineering track, captivated by the elegant logic of language and data. This pivot led to a Master's in Computational Linguistics, a field his parents struggled to understand but whose financial rewards they eventually came to appreciate.\n\nHis career began in the chaotic dot-com era, but his calm, analytical nature helped him navigate the industry\u2019s booms and busts. Now a Principal Data Scientist, he\u2019s a respected veteran in his field, having earned the seniority to negotiate a fully remote position. This 0.0-mile commute defines his current existence. His world is largely contained within the walls of his meticulously organized Hayes Valley condo, where he lives alone.\n\nA difficult breakup in his late thirties, followed by his father\u2019s passing a few years later, solidified his introspective tendencies. His social life is small but deep, comprising a handful of old friends and his sister\u2019s family in the South Bay. His days follow a predictable rhythm: analyzing complex data sets from his home office, breaking for a midday run through the Panhandle, and ending with either a gourmet meal cooked for one or a foreign film.\n\nHe loves San Francisco for its intellectual energy, even if he often observes it from a distance. Living in Hayes Valley allows him to feel connected to the city's cultural heart without having to be in the center of it. At 43, Joshua feels a growing pull towards a different future. He dreams of applying his skills to climate change research or a social justice non-profit, seeking a legacy more meaningful than optimizing ad revenue. He hopes to find a lasting partnership and, one day, to finally use his vacation days for something other than just recharging for the next project."
