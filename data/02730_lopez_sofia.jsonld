The daughter of Salvadoran immigrants who arrived in San Francisco in the 1990s, Sofia\u2019s childhood was scored by the rhythm of her parents\u2019 small variety store on 24th Street. They poured their life savings and relentless labor into \"La Peque\u00f1a,\" a community hub selling everything from Goya beans to Muni passes. Sofia spent her youth stacking shelves and translating for elderly customers, absorbing the language of commerce and community by osmosis.\n\nShe pursued a different path initially, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications from San Francisco State University. Sofia envisioned a life in a sleek downtown office, far from the familiar scent of cardboard boxes and pan dulce. However, a turning point came during her senior year when her father had a health scare. Stepping up to manage La Peque\u00f1a wasn't a choice but a necessity. To her surprise, she found a deep sense of purpose in the work she\u2019d once tried to escape. The spreadsheets and inventory logs felt more real and impactful than any apathetic marketing campaign she had studied.\n\nNow, at 28, Sofia is the store\u2019s official manager. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a flight of stairs from the apartment where she grew up. Her days are a blur of placing orders, managing two part-time employees, and chatting with regulars who have known her since she was a child. The line between her personal and professional life is beautifully blurred; her neighbors are her customers, and her family\u2019s legacy is her career. While her college friends discuss corporate ladders and relocation packages, Sofia\u2019s ambitions are rooted in her neighborhood. She dreams of modernizing the store\u2014launching a local delivery service and featuring products from other Latino artisans\u2014without losing the essential character her parents built. She is an anchor in a rapidly changing city, a quiet steward of a community\u2019s heart."
