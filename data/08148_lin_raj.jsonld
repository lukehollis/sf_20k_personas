The son of an Indian engineer and a Singaporean Chinese accountant who met in graduate school, he grew up in a quiet, studious Chicago suburb where his family\u2019s home was a fusion of scents\u2014turmeric and star anise\u2014and expectations. Pushed towards practical sciences, Raj harbored a secret passion for poetry and storytelling, a world far removed from his parents' pragmatism.\n\nHe pursued this passion, earning an MFA in Creative Writing and moving to San Francisco in the early 1990s, drawn to the city's vibrant literary and queer scene. He found his chosen family in a shared apartment in the Haight, writing feverishly and soaking in the city's rebellious energy. But this idyllic chapter was brutally cut short by the AIDS epidemic, which claimed his closest friend and mentor. The profound loss rendered his art hollow; words felt powerless against such a tangible, devastating health crisis.\n\nThis was his turning point. Raj pivoted, channeling his grief into action. He began volunteering at a local clinic, discovering a talent for organizing people and resources. He found a new calling, not in creating fictional worlds, but in improving the real one. He eventually landed a role in the city\u2019s public health sector, working his way up to Program Manager. His writing skills proved invaluable in drafting grant proposals and communicating complex health initiatives to diverse communities.\n\nNow 50, Raj lives a life of disciplined compassion. He and his partner of fifteen years, a landscape architect named David, share a meticulously kept condo in Hayes Valley. Since his work is remote, his daily routine is anchored in his neighborhood: a morning Americano from his favorite local caf\u00e9, hours of Zoom calls managing city-wide health programs from his spare-bedroom office, and a lunchtime walk through Patricia\u2019s Green to clear his head.\n\nHis youthful dream of being a celebrated novelist has been replaced by a more grounded aspiration: to build a public health program so effective it becomes a national model. Yet, late at night, after David is asleep, Raj sometimes opens a long-neglected manuscript on his laptop. He came to San Francisco seeking artistic expression but found a deeper purpose in its survival. Perhaps, he muses, there's still time to honor both."
