The second of two children, he watched his younger sister, Sarah, grapple with a severe anxiety disorder that the family, stoic and Midwestern, struggled to understand. David became her fierce, if amateur, protector and advocate, a role that shaped his future. This experience planted a seed: a deep-seated need to understand and dismantle the systems that fail vulnerable people.\n\nHe attended Ohio State for his undergraduate degree, but it was the move to the West Coast for his MSW at UC Berkeley that truly defined him. The Bay Area\u2019s vibrant, progressive culture was a world away from Ohio, and he embraced it fully. After graduating, he began his career as a frontline school social worker in Oakland, witnessing daily the intersection of poverty, trauma, and educational disparity. He was effective and empathetic, but grew frustrated by the limitations of his role. This frustration fueled his ambition, driving him to climb the ladder from therapist to supervisor, and eventually to his current position as a Director, where he can shape policy and secure funding for programs across the city. His sister\u2019s eventual recovery, aided by the kind of robust support he now champions, stands as the quiet, personal validation of his life\u2019s work.\n\nNow 44, David lives a deliberately structured life in the Inner Richmond. His day begins with a 3.8-mile bike ride to his office near the Civic Center, a ritual that clears his head before a day of meetings and high-stakes decisions. He finds solace in the fog-laced tranquility of his neighborhood, often spending weekends walking through Golden Gate Park or exploring the diverse restaurants on Clement Street. He is amicably divorced after a long-term relationship ended three years ago and maintains a close circle of friends, mostly fellow non-profit professionals.\n\nWhile proud of his career, David aspires to influence public health policy on a larger scale. Personally, he hopes to find a lasting partnership built on shared values and mutual support. He is a man who came to San Francisco seeking knowledge and found a home\u2014a city whose complex, often-troubled, yet deeply compassionate spirit mirrors his own."

He found her curled behind the old furnace, a knot of silent trembling. He didn\u2019t know the right words, so he just sat on the cold concrete beside her, not speaking, until her shivering subsided. That immense, helpless silence was where his purpose began\u2014not to speak for her, but to build a world where she wouldn\u2019t have to hide. This memory is the bedrock of his empathy.\n\n2.\nHis first week at UC Berkeley, then 24, he walked through Sproul Plaza. A student group passionately debated housing rights while another handed out flyers for a rally. The air smelled of eucalyptus and possibility. Back in Ohio, his convictions had always felt like an argument; he was constantly defensive. Here, for the first time, they felt like a conversation, a starting point. It was a profound, soul-deep exhale. He wasn\u2019t just Sarah\u2019s brother anymore; he had found his own cause, and his people.\n\n3.\nAs a frontline social worker in Oakland in his late twenties, he fought for months to get a bright nine-year-old boy into a specialized therapy program. He finally succeeded, only to learn the family couldn't afford the bus fare to get him there. David bought them bus passes himself, a tiny bandage on a gaping systemic wound. Driving home that night, a cold rage settled in his gut. Empathy wasn\u2019t enough. He knew then he had to climb the ladder, not for ambition, but for leverage.\n\n4.\nA year after his divorce, around age 42, he took a solo walk around Stow Lake on a particularly dense, foggy Sunday. He\u2019d expected to feel a sharp loneliness, but instead felt a profound calm. The quiet wasn't an absence of his ex-partner, but a presence of his own thoughts. The muffled sounds of the park felt like a buffer from the world. He realized he hadn't lost half of himself; he had simply rediscovered the quiet, steady rhythm of being one whole person.\n\n5.\nLast fall, Sarah called him from Ohio, her voice clear and steady. She described, with calm passion, how she\u2019d helped a new colleague navigate the company\u2019s intimidating mental health resources. She wasn't asking for help; she was *giving* it. David leaned his head against his office window, looking out at City Hall, the weight of decades of worry dissolving into quiet, overwhelming pride. The fierce protector could finally stand down. The work was worth it. She was okay."
