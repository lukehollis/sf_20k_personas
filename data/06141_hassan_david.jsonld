The only son of a meticulous Lebanese mechanical engineer and a pragmatic Midwestern mother, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of meticulous design and no-nonsense practicality. He inherited his father\u2019s mind for systems and his mother\u2019s quiet determination.\n\nHis path was linear and logical. An undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan led him west to Stanford, where he earned a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering, fascinated by the puzzle of making complex systems efficient. He cut his teeth at Hewlett-Packard in the 90s, surviving the dot-com bust by sticking to the tangible world of hardware and supply chains while others chased fleeting software fortunes. His ascent was steady, built on a reputation for being the man who could get anything built, anywhere in the world, on time.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was not a career triumph, but a personal rupture. His marriage crumbled under the weight of 2 a.m. calls to Shenzhen and a perfectionism that left little room for spontaneity or emotional connection. His divorce, a decade ago, coincided with his promotion to Director of Manufacturing Operations. He poured his energy into his work, overseeing global production lines from a corner office, and became a distant but proud father to two children who are now grown and have left the Bay Area.\n\nToday, David lives alone in a tastefully renovated Victorian in Noe Valley. The pandemic made his 0.0-mile commute permanent, transforming his second-floor office into the global command center for a massive tech firm. His days are a disciplined cycle of global time zones: pre-dawn video calls with Asia, a mid-day walk for coffee on 24th Street, and evening meetings with European partners. He knows his baristas by name but few of his neighbors. His connection to San Francisco has shrunk to the borders of his neighborhood; he appreciates the city more as a beautiful, fog-laced backdrop seen from his window than a place to explore.\n\nHis professional ambitions are fulfilled, but a quiet unease has settled in. David dreams not of a new product launch, but of reconnecting with his daughter in Portland and his son in Austin. He aspires to find a hobby that isn\u2019t about optimization\u2014perhaps finally learning to sail on the Bay, embracing the unpredictable wind rather than trying to control it."
