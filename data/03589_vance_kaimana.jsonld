His father, a native Hawaiian fisherman, taught him the rhythms of the tide and the sacredness of a fresh catch. His mother, a painter from Mill Valley, taught him about color, composition, and a world beyond the islands. When Kaimana was 14, the family chased a different dream to the Bay Area, settling in Daly City. The fog-chilled air was a shock, but the proximity to the vast Pacific felt like a familiar promise.\n\nHe enrolled at SF State with a vague notion of studying business, a practical path his parents encouraged. But his heart wasn't in textbooks; it was in the steaming, chaotic kitchens where he worked to pay his tuition. He found a mentor in an old-school Japanese chef in the Fillmore who taught him precision and respect for ingredients. This was a language that resonated deeper than any lecture. At 21, Kaimana dropped out of college, trading his student ID for a full-time apron\u2014a decision that caused a deep rift with his parents that took years to mend.\n\nHe spent the next decade honing his craft in kitchens across the city, absorbing techniques and developing his own distinct voice. The turning point came after his father\u2019s passing. With a small inheritance and a powerful desire to honor his heritage, Kaimana took the ultimate risk. He found a small, neglected space in the Outer Sunset, blocks from Ocean Beach, and poured his life into creating \"Pono,\" a restaurant dedicated to modern Hawaiian soul food.\n\nNow, at 49, Kaimana\u2019s life is his restaurant. He lives in the small apartment directly above it, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to his dedication. His marriage dissolved under the pressure years ago, but he maintains a loving, if sometimes distant, relationship with his teenage daughter, who lives with her mother in the East Bay.\n\nHis days are a ritual: a pre-dawn surf at Ocean Beach, followed by trips to the farmer\u2019s market and talks with his fish suppliers. He runs his kitchen with a calm intensity, his staff a tight-knit family. Kaimana\u2019s dream isn\u2019t expansion or fame; it\u2019s sustainability. It's serving food that tells a story of the islands and the California coast, creating a community hub in his chosen foggy corner of San Francisco, a place where everyone feels welcome."

His father\u2019s voice, usually a warm tide, was a sharp reef: \u201cYou\u2019re throwing it away, Kaimana.\u201d It was a wound that would fester for years, cementing a stubborn resolve in him. He wasn't just choosing a job; he was choosing a language, and he would have to prove its worth to them and, most of all, to himself.\n\n2.\nIn the Fillmore kitchen, around age 20, Chef Tanaka placed a whole tai snapper before him. \u201cListen to it,\u201d he said. Kaimana remembers the weight of the *yanagiba* knife, Tanaka guiding his hand to make the first precise incision behind the gills. It wasn\u2019t about butchery; it was a conversation with the fish. In that silent, focused moment, cooking ceased to be a job. It became an act of profound respect, a principle that would become the foundation of his entire career.\n\n3.\nIt was a few months after his father\u2019s funeral, age 41. He was alone in the pre-dawn grey at Ocean Beach, the cold Pacific biting his skin. As he paddled out past the break, he heard his father\u2019s voice teaching him to read the currents back in Honolulu. The grief was a physical weight, but so was the board beneath him. In that moment, the idea for Pono crystallized from a vague dream into a necessary tribute\u2014a way to bring his father\u2019s ocean back to the shore for good.\n\n4.\nHis daughter was 14, perched on a stool at the counter while the restaurant was closed. He served her a small bowl of his ahi poke, a recipe he'd been perfecting. She took a bite, closed her eyes, and said, \u201cTastes like Grandpa\u2019s stories.\u201d Her casual, perfect observation both filled his chest and broke his heart a little. It was a rare, quiet moment of connection that reminded him his legacy wasn\u2019t just in the food he served, but in the memories he passed on to her, even from a distance.\n\n5.\nPono had been open for six months, the debt a constant worry. On a foggy Tuesday, an elderly woman sat alone, eating a plate of his Kalua pig. As she paid, she looked at him with misty eyes. \u201cI grew up in K\u0101ne\u02bbohe,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you for bringing me home.\u201d In that instant, the years of sacrifice, the fight for his dream\u2014all of it felt validated. He wasn\u2019t just running a restaurant; he was building a sanctuary, a landmark for misplaced souls in the fog."
