Raised in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, Ben was a thoughtful, introspective child. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable career, he was drawn to life\u2019s bigger questions, eventually enrolling at Ohio State to study Philosophy. He loved the intellectual rigor, but graduation brought a jarring reality: a degree in metaphysics wasn\u2019t in high demand.\n\nThe turning point came during a soul-crushing year working at a call center. Frustrated, Ben discovered the world of UX/UI design online. It was a revelation\u2014a field that applied philosophical principles of logic, ethics, and human experience to tangible, practical problems. He immersed himself in a self-directed education, spending nights and weekends learning design software, building a portfolio, and freelancing for pennies. His hard work paid off when a San Francisco-based tech firm, impressed by his unique perspective, offered him a junior designer role.\n\nNow 29, Ben has carved out a comfortable life in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his living room desk provides a calm start to his day, usually involving a strong coffee and a walk through the morning fog in Golden Gate Park just blocks away. He finds the neighborhood\u2019s residential pace a welcome antidote to the frantic energy of the tech industry. His life is anchored by his long-term partner, Maya, a landscape architect whose work with physical spaces provides a grounding contrast to his digital world. Their social circle is small but tight, preferring brewery trivia nights and hikes in Marin over the downtown club scene.\n\nWhile financially secure, the philosopher in Ben remains. He aspires to one day lead a design team focused on accessibility or non-profit work, believing that technology\u2019s greatest purpose is to create more equitable human experiences. For now, he finds fulfillment in perfecting the flow of an app, knowing that even small, elegant solutions can bring a bit more order to a chaotic world."
