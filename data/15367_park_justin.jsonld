The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Daly City, Justin grew up surrounded by the scent of steam and the pressure of high expectations. His parents envisioned a clear path for him: a four-year degree from a UC school, followed by a lucrative career in Silicon Valley.\n\nHe started down that path, enrolling in the Information Technology program at San Francisco State University. However, during his sophomore year, his mother was diagnosed with a serious illness, and the family\u2019s modest savings were quickly depleted by medical bills. Justin made the difficult choice to drop out of college and take a full-time, entry-level help desk job to support his family. This decision became the defining turning point of his life, trading the prescribed path for one of necessity.\n\nThough he never returned to finish his degree, Justin discovered a natural talent for troubleshooting and a genuine satisfaction in helping people navigate complex systems. He methodically worked his way up, earning certifications and building a reputation for patience and competence. Now, as a Senior Technical Support Specialist for a non-profit consortium serving community health clinics and after-school programs, he feels his work has purpose. He is the calm, reassuring voice that fixes the network so a clinic can access patient records or an educational program can run smoothly.\n\nJustin lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset. His daily routine begins with a strong coffee and a Muni ride on the N-Judah, where he listens to tech podcasts. After work, he enjoys long walks in Golden Gate Park or trivia nights with a close-knit group of friends at a local pub. He remains close with his parents, visiting his now-healthy mother every Sunday. Though a long-term relationship ended a few years ago, he\u2019s cautiously open to finding a partner. His dream isn\u2019t to found a startup, but to finally finish his bachelor\u2019s degree online\u2014not for his career, but for himself\u2014and one day, perhaps, buy a small condo in the city he quietly helps keep running."

His father stared at his hands; his mother\u2019s face was drawn with worry. The words felt like stones in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll stop school,\u201d Justin said, \u201cI can work full-time.\u201d The quiet that followed wasn\u2019t disappointment, but a heavy, shared resignation. In that moment, he traded his parents\u2019 dream for his own duty, forging a man defined by responsibility, not degrees. This happened his sophomore year of college.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM when the clinic\u2019s server whirred back to life. He was exhausted, running on vending machine coffee. The next morning, the clinic director called, her voice thick with relief. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Justin.\u201d He hung up and stared out his office window. For the first time, he felt a profound sense of purpose, a validation deeper than any transcript could offer. His work wasn\u2019t just code; it was a lifeline that kept his community healthy. This was just a few years into his career.\n\n3.\nYears after her illness, he was visiting on a Sunday. They sat in comfortable silence watching a Korean drama, afternoon sun warming the room. His mother, her health restored, reached over and simply patted his hand. She didn't say \u201cthank you\u201d for his sacrifice. She just squeezed his fingers and murmured, \u201cYou are a good son.\u201d It felt like a pardon. The guilt he\u2019d carried for leaving school finally lifted, replaced by a quiet, unshakeable peace between them. This was in his mid-twenties.\n\n4.\nAfter the breakup, his Inner Sunset apartment felt cavernous. He walked to Golden Gate Park, needing air. Standing by Stow Lake, he watched the fog swallow the trees, the silence echoing the new emptiness in his chest. His hand felt for keys in his pocket\u2014just his own set now. That walk didn\u2019t cure the loneliness, but it taught him how to carry it. He learned the park could be a quiet companion when there was no one else. This was a few years ago.\n\n5.\nThe N-Judah rattled out of the tunnel, coasting toward home after a trivia-night victory. He leaned his head against the window, watching the city lights blur past. On his phone, he didn\u2019t scroll social media. Instead, he pulled up the SFSU online course catalog and browsed the IT requirements. It wasn\u2019t for a promotion or for his parents anymore. It was a quiet promise he was finally ready to make to himself. This was just last week."
