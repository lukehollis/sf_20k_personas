The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, he spent his childhood amidst the hum of his father\u2019s small electronics repair shop. While his parents pushed for a stable career in medicine or engineering, Daniel was more captivated by the societal ripple effects of the technology his father fixed. He remembered vividly how the dot-com bust strained his family and neighbors, cementing an early understanding that innovation had human consequences.\n\nThis fascination led him away from the prescribed path to UC Berkeley, where he studied Political Science. To bridge the gap between his passion and his parents' desire for pragmatism, he pursued a Master of Public Policy. This degree became his key, unlocking a way to work within the tech industry he grew up alongside, but as a navigator and a conscience rather than a coder.\n\nNow, as a Policy Analyst for a mid-sized tech firm, Daniel works from his apartment in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute gives his life a hyperlocal rhythm. Mornings start with an oat milk latte from a cafe on the corner, followed by hours at his standing desk, drafting briefs on AI ethics and data privacy. He is the internal voice of caution, the one who asks \"should we?\" instead of just \"can we?\".\n\nA recent breakup has turned his focus inward. Evenings once spent with his partner are now for solo runs through Patricia\u2019s Green, calls with his parents in Daly City (who are proud, if confused by his job title), and attempts to replicate his mother\u2019s noodle soup recipes.\n\nDaniel feels the city\u2019s contradictions intimately. He loves its relentless drive but worries about those left behind. His ultimate aspiration is not to climb a corporate ladder, but to eventually take a role in public service, shaping tech legislation that protects the communities like the one he grew up in. For him, a successful life means ensuring the future his company is building is one that is equitable and just for all San Franciscans."
