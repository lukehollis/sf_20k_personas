Born to a Filipino mother, a nurse with a love for vibrant fabrics, and a white father, an architect from Marin with a minimalist sensibility, her childhood was a masterclass in creative fusion. She spent weekends navigating two aesthetics: the warm, intricate patterns in her Lola\u2019s (grandmother's) home in Daly City and the clean, structural lines of her father\u2019s blueprints. This duality became her native language.\n\nAfter finishing her B.A., Kaiya felt a pull toward something more profound than a standard design job. She enrolled in the MFA program at California College of the Arts (CCA), determined to explore retail not as commerce, but as a form of applied anthropology\u2014telling stories through objects and space. Her thesis project, a deconstruction of fast fashion\u2019s visual language, caught the eye of a recruiter from a high-end, sustainable lifestyle brand. She started as an associate, her talent for creating compelling, narrative-driven displays quickly earning her a promotion to Director.\n\nHer daily routine is a ritual of observation. She leaves her rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a space filled with ceramics from local artists and inherited Filipino textiles, and catches the 38 Geary. This 3.8-mile MUNI commute is her creative incubator, a time to sketch ideas inspired by the city\u2019s chaotic harmony. At work, she orchestrates everything from flagship store layouts to the precise fold of a cashmere sweater, ensuring every element communicates the brand\u2019s story.\n\nRecently out of a long-term relationship, Kaiya has poured her energy into her work and her tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of designers, chefs, and writers she meets for gallery openings in the Mission or dim sum on Clement Street. San Francisco isn't just her home; it\u2019s her primary artistic medium. Her ultimate dream is to launch a small design consultancy, helping local artisans and businesses tell their own unique stories. For Kaiya, life is about curating a meaningful existence, one beautifully arranged detail at a time."

Her father walked in, a roll of crisp blueprint paper under his arm, revealing a world of sharp, clean lines. She felt a quiet click in her mind, a sense of two beautiful, opposing languages. It was the first time she understood she didn't have to choose. That feeling of holding two complete, yet different, worlds in her hands became the foundation of her entire aesthetic.\n\n2.\nHuddled under a desk lamp at CCA at 2 AM, surrounded by cheap, pilled sweaters and glossy fashion magazines for her thesis. A wave of clarity washed over her: this was the story. She photographed a frayed seam from a $10 shirt with the same reverence as a couture gown, juxtaposing the lie and the truth. It wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about ethics and narrative. That night solidified her mission to use design to reveal, not just sell, telling truer stories through objects.\n\n3.\nThe first Saturday after her partner moved out, the silence in her Inner Richmond apartment was absolute. She walked to the window and picked up a heavy, earth-toned ceramic pot, moving it from the bookshelf to the windowsill. In that small, deliberate act, the space transformed. It wasn\u2019t half-empty; it was hers to fill. It wasn't a loss, but a blank canvas. This quiet moment of curating her own solitude fortified her resolve to build a life entirely of her own design.\n\n4.\nShe was adjusting a display of hand-dyed scarves, arranging them to mimic the gradient of a sunset over Ocean Beach. A woman stopped, not touching, but just tracing the fabric with her eyes. \u201cIt feels like a story,\u201d the woman whispered, more to herself than to Kaiya. A jolt of profound satisfaction went through her, warmer than any sales report. It was the ultimate validation: that a well-told story, even in the fold of a scarf, could create a moment of genuine, human connection.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy morning last winter, the 38 Geary was its usual chaotic symphony. As the bus lurched, she saw the grey light hit an elderly woman\u2019s wool coat, its texture softened and worn like felt. It looked exactly like the misty silhouette of Sutro Tower against the sky. She grabbed her Moleskine, her pen flying. The city wasn\u2019t just a backdrop; it was a textile, a living material. That sketch, born from a fleeting MUNI reflection, became the direct inspiration for a new flagship collection."
