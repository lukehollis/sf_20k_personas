He was born not in the pristine heights he now inhabits, but in the foggy, working-class avenues of the Sunset District. His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small neighborhood grocery store, a world defined by the scent of produce and the rustle of paper bags. David spent his youth stocking shelves and doing homework behind the counter, quietly resolving that his life would be different. He saw their sacrifice not as a burden, but as fuel. Excelling at Lowell High School, he earned a scholarship to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate studies in economics.\n\nHis educational journey was a deliberate climb. After Berkeley, he was accepted into Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business for his MBA, where he became fascinated by the manic energy of the dot-com boom. He started his career as an analyst, learning the brutal lessons of the subsequent bust. Instead of scaring him off, the crash taught him resilience and the true nature of risk. He joined a fledgling venture capital firm, distinguishing himself with a sharp eye for sustainable tech and a calm demeanor that steadied founders. Over two decades, he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a managing partner at his own successful firm.\n\nThe key turning point in his life wasn't a billion-dollar exit, but a health scare at 48. The relentless stress manifested in dangerously high blood pressure, forcing him to re-evaluate everything. With his wife, Elena, a landscape architect, he made a conscious decision to downshift. This led to his current 0.0-mile commute. He now works from a sleek, minimalist home office in their Pacific Heights brownstone, overlooking the Bay.\n\nHis days begin not with a commute, but with a brisk walk with Elena through the Presidio. His work is now a curated series of video calls with entrepreneurs and partners, punctuated by lunch in his own kitchen. His two children are in college, leaving the house quiet. This new pace has ignited a different ambition. Having achieved financial success, David now dreams of legacy. He finds himself drawn to mentoring first-generation founders and is searching for a \u201cfinal act\u201d investment\u2014not one driven by ROI, but by a profound desire to fund a company that solves a tangible, human problem, bringing his life\u2019s journey full circle from the small neighborhood store to a global stage."
