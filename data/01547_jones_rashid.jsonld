Born to a Black father whose family arrived during the Great Migration to work the shipyards, and a Filipina-American mother from a long line of Daly City nurses, Rashid grew up a microcosm of the Bay Area\u2019s diversity. His childhood in the Outer Mission was a collage of cultures, languages, and foods, yet he rarely felt he fit neatly into any single box. School was a place of quiet frustration; while his peers studied textbooks, Rashid learned the language of spray cans and stencils, finding his voice on the city\u2019s concrete canvases.\n\nHis educational journey was unconventional. After barely graduating high school, Rashid drifted, taking odd jobs and sinking deeper into the street art scene. The turning point came not in a classroom, but in a courtroom. A minor vandalism charge resulted in community service at a small, independent gallery in SoMa. The owner, a pragmatic older artist named Lena, saw past the charge and recognized his innate understanding of composition and space. She offered him a job sweeping floors, which soon became helping with installations. He learned curation through osmosis, mastering the intricate dance of lighting, placement, and storytelling without a single art history credit to his name.\n\nToday, at 28, Rashid is the gallery\u2019s Exhibitions Coordinator. His commute is zero miles; he lives in a small live-work loft directly above the gallery space. His days are a blur of coordinating with artists, building temporary walls, and ensuring each piece is displayed with intent. His social life is inextricably linked to his work, consisting of a tight-knit circle of artists, musicians, and makers who gather for late-night project critiques or cheap pho in the Tenderloin.\n\nRashid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is his lifeblood. He sees the city not as a tech hub, but as a sprawling, chaotic, and beautiful gallery in its own right. His ultimate dream is to curate a major show dedicated to the city\u2019s unsung artists\u2014the street muralists and neighborhood talents who, like him, found their education on the city\u2019s walls. He hopes to one day return to his own art, but for now, he finds purpose in creating space for others, building the very world that once saved him."

He watched his cousins laugh in Tagalog while his aunts and uncles spoke with the deep cadence of the South. Rashid floated between them, a quiet ghost in his own home, belonging to both worlds but fully anchored in neither. It was the first time he understood he was a collage, a space between things. That quiet ache of observation would later become his greatest tool and his deepest comfort.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, the back of a laundromat on Mission Street became his canvas. It was past 2 AM, the air cold and sharp. With a stencil and a can of black spray paint, he found a silence school could never offer. The quiet hiss was the only sound in the world. As the image appeared\u2014a hand opening to release a flock of Muni buses like birds\u2014a jolt of pure creation shot through him. For the first time, he wasn't just taking up space; he was making it mean something.\n\n3.\nThe court-ordered community service felt like a brand. He was nineteen, sweeping the gallery floor with his head down, when Lena stopped him. She didn't ask about his charge. Instead, she pointed to a collection of photos hung too close together. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this?\u201d she asked. He mumbled something about them needing space to breathe, that they were crowding each other\u2019s stories. She just nodded, a spark of recognition in her eyes. It was the first time someone had valued his eye over his rap sheet.\n\n4.\nLena was home with the flu, trusting him, at 24, to hang an artist\u2019s centerpiece. Panic warred with a fierce sense of duty. He spent three hours on a single spotlight, adjusting it by millimeters until it grazed the canvas just right, making the oil paints vibrate with life. When he stepped back, exhausted but buzzing, he understood. This was his art now: not making the image, but creating the perfect, reverent silence around it for someone else\u2019s voice to be heard. It was a profound, selfless power.\n\n5.\nLast month, after a draining install, he walked through the Tenderloin for pho. Under a flickering streetlamp, a fresh wheatpaste mural\u2014raw, brilliant, and anonymous\u2014covered a boarded-up window. He stopped, not as a gallery coordinator, but as that kid from the Outer Mission. He saw the direct line from that desperate, beautiful wall to the pristine ones he now curated. His entire life suddenly felt like an act of translation, ensuring no voice from the street was ever lost."
