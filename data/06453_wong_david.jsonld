Born in the Richmond District to parents who emigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s, his childhood was a quiet study in contrasts. His father, a tireless cook in a Chinatown restaurant, and his mother, a seamstress working from their foggy Richmond flat, instilled in him the values of hard work and filial piety. They envisioned him becoming an engineer or a doctor, a path of tangible success. But David was a quiet observer, more attuned to the unspoken anxieties in his community\u2014the elderly struggling with confusing medical forms, the families grappling with mental health stigma behind closed doors.\n\nHis turning point came at seventeen when his grandmother suffered a stroke. David became the de facto translator and advocate, navigating a labyrinthine hospital system. It was there he met a hospital social worker, a compassionate woman who not only secured resources for his grandmother but also eased his family\u2019s fears. He saw a different kind of strength, not in building bridges of steel, but of understanding. This experience solidified his path. He defied his parents\u2019 expectations, earning his undergraduate degree from SF State and then a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley.\n\nHis career as a Clinical Social Worker has been spent almost entirely within one of San Francisco\u2019s largest hospital systems. For over two decades, David has been the calm presence in the storm for patients and families facing life-altering diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. His work is emotionally demanding and contributed to the amicable end of his marriage years ago. He maintains a warm, long-distance relationship with his daughter, now a grad student in Chicago.\n\nToday, David lives a deliberately simple life in a modern Mission Bay condo, just blocks from the hospital campus. The \"0.0-mile commute\" is a recent, welcome change; he now conducts most of his sessions via telehealth from a small, dedicated home office. His days are structured: a morning walk along the waterfront, a full slate of virtual patient calls, and evenings spent with a good book or cooking a meal that reminds him of his father. His dream is no longer about climbing a ladder, but about finding balance. He hopes to one day start a small fund to provide translation services for elderly Cantonese-speaking patients, a quiet tribute to the journey that started it all."
