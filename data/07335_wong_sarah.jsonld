A third-generation resident, her story began not with code, but with the scent of dried herbs and ginseng in her grandfather\u2019s Chinatown shop. Growing up in a bustling family that valued tradition and community, Sarah was a quiet observer, more fascinated by the faded photographs on the wall than the chatter of the mahjong table. This inclination toward the past guided her academic path, leading her from a history degree at San Francisco State to a Master of Library and Information Science at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer career started traditionally, in the hushed, climate-controlled stacks of a university library. However, as the dot-com boom reshaped her city in the late \u201890s, Sarah had a pivotal realization: an entire era\u2019s history was being written in code, emails, and ephemeral digital media, and almost no one was saving it. She pivoted, applying the meticulous principles of archiving to the chaotic world of technology. Today, as a Senior Archivist for a major tech firm, she is a digital historian, tasked with preserving the company's institutional memory\u2014from landmark source code to the internal memos that launched world-changing products.\n\nSarah lives and works in a lovingly restored Edwardian flat in Cole Valley, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her bedroom to a sunlit home office overlooking her small, verdant garden. Her days are a study in contrasts: she sips artisanal coffee while sifting through terabytes of data from the 1990s. Divorced a decade ago, she treasures her independence and maintains a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow native San Franciscans and old colleagues.\n\nHer deepest aspiration is to prevent a \"digital dark age.\" She fears that the human stories behind the technological revolution\u2014the failures, the rivalries, the sparks of genius\u2014are more fragile than the paper records of her grandfather\u2019s generation. She dreams of one day curating a public-facing digital archive that tells the messy, human story of Silicon Valley. For Sarah, living in a historic home while preserving digital history isn't an irony; it's a mission to ensure that the future has a past it can understand."
