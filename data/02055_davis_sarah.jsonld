Raised in a quiet suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, by a history professor father and a landscape architect mother, her childhood was one of books, thoughtful debate, and carefully tended gardens. This grounded upbringing instilled in her a deep appreciation for structure and human-centered design, which would later define her career.\n\nShe pursued an undergraduate degree in computer science, but found the pure code sterile. It was at Stanford, earning a Master\u2019s in Organizational Psychology, that she found her calling: bridging the gap between brilliant but chaotic engineers and the rigid demands of corporate strategy. She joined a top-tier consulting firm in the late 90s, just as the dot-com boom was cresting. For twenty years, her life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and hotel suites. She was instrumental in landmark acquisitions and a trusted advisor to CEOs, but the relentless travel took its toll, leading to the painful dissolution of a long-term relationship in her early forties\u2014a turning point that forced a major life re-evaluation.\n\nFive years ago, Sarah negotiated a senior, fully-remote role. Her commute shrank from 5,000 miles a week to the ten steps between her kitchen and her home office in her meticulously restored NoPa Victorian. Her days are now a disciplined blend of intense focus and personal ritual. She starts with a foggy morning walk in the Panhandle, coffee from a local cafe in hand. From 8 AM to 6 PM, she\u2019s a formidable force on Zoom, dissecting operational inefficiencies for clients in London and Singapore.\n\nWhen the laptop closes, she is fiercely present in her own life. She has a small, tight circle of friends\u2014a chef, a lawyer, a gallery owner\u2014with whom she shares wine and unfiltered conversation. San Francisco is no longer just a strategic hub; it\u2019s her sanctuary. She knows the best stalls at the Ferry Building farmer\u2019s market and volunteers at a local youth coding bootcamp. Her future ambition isn't another promotion, but to write a book on humane leadership in the tech industry, hoping to guide the next generation away from the burnout she knows so well. Sarah has successfully consulted on her own life, architecting a career that funds her high-end lifestyle without consuming her soul."
