While his parents hoped he\u2019d inherit their pragmatism, David spent his childhood building impossible cities from LEGOs and sketching fantastical structures in the margins of his math notebooks. For them, stability was paramount; for David, it was about form and vision.\n\nArchitecture became the perfect compromise: a discipline of art grounded in physics and math. He pursued it with relentless focus, eventually earning a Master of Architecture with a focus on arts integration. In his first few years as a junior designer, a key turning point arrived. David realized his true talent wasn't in solitary genius but in orchestration\u2014translating a wild artistic concept into a buildable, budgeted reality. This discovery guided him away from pure design and into project leadership.\n\nThis path led him to his current role at \"Vanguard Forma,\" a boutique firm in the Dogpatch specializing in museums, galleries, and public art installations. His life is a study in hyperlocal efficiency; he lives in a minimalist loft on the third floor of the same converted warehouse where his firm occupies the ground floor. His 0.0-mile commute means his days blur seamlessly. A sunrise run along the waterfront gives way to coffee at a local roaster before he heads downstairs to lead meetings on a new sculpture garden for a winery or a gallery renovation in Hayes Valley.\n\nHis social circle is a tight-knit group of designers, curators, and chefs met through work and neighborhood proximity. A long-term relationship recently ended, a casualty of his intense focus on a particularly demanding gallery project. Now, at 34, David is looking beyond individual projects. His dream is to lead the design and construction of a new, permanent community arts center in a neglected San Francisco neighborhood, a structure that doesn't just house art but actively fosters creation. For David, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's the ultimate canvas, and his life's work is to help build the frames that hold its most daring visions."
