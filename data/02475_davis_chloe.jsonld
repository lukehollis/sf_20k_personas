Raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, Chloe was encouraged to pursue her love for the humanities. She devoured books on Renaissance painters and Impressionist masters, a passion that led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History. She chose a California university, drawn by the romantic notion of San Francisco\u2019s vibrant arts scene and counter-culture legacy.\n\nHer college years were a dream, spent interning at small galleries and losing herself in the de Young Museum. The turning point came a few months after graduation. Armed with her degree, she faced a harsh truth: the art world in one of the world's most expensive cities offered mostly unpaid internships and low-wage assistant jobs. With student loans looming and rent due, a sense of panic set in. Watching her computer science peers land stable careers, she made a pragmatic pivot. Chloe enrolled in an intensive six-month IT support certification program, trading talk of Caravaggio for CompTIA.\n\nNow, at 24, Chloe\u2019s world is the one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond she works and lives in. Her 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse. Her days are a blur of Slack notifications and headset-clad conversations, patiently guiding frustrated users through the endless fog of password resets and software glitches. The job is a foothold, a means of survival, but it feels disconnected from the city she came here to love.\n\nTo combat the isolation of remote work, Chloe forces herself into a routine. She takes long, foggy walks through Golden Gate Park, picks up dumplings on Clement Street, and maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow art history grads and bootcamp comrades who understand her unique trajectory. Her dream hasn't died, but it has adapted. She spends her evenings teaching herself UX/UI design, hoping to eventually merge her artistic eye for composition and beauty with her practical tech skills. For Chloe, San Francisco is no longer just a museum; it's a complex system she\u2019s learning to navigate, hoping to one day design her own place within it."
