Born in Oakland, she was the pragmatic child of an African American union bookkeeper and a charismatic, if unreliable, musician of Italian and Puerto Rican descent. From her mother, she learned the value of a steady hand and a balanced ledger; from her father, she inherited a love for jazz and an understanding that not all beautiful things are practical.\n\nChoosing stability, Zaria attended Cal State East Bay, pursuing a degree in Logistics. While her peers in the 90s were chasing the nascent dot-com boom, she was fascinated by the tangible world of movement: container ships gliding under the Golden Gate, the complex dance of trucks and warehouses that kept the city running. She started her career as a dispatch coordinator and methodically worked her way up over three decades. Now a senior manager, she orchestrates the flow of goods with an expert\u2019s calm, a vital part of the city\u2019s unseen machinery.\n\nHer one major deviation from her carefully planned life was a marriage in her late twenties to a kind-hearted architect. The union was loving but ultimately fractured by their different life philosophies. They divorced amicably after a decade, leaving her with a grown son who now lives in Chicago and a deep-seated sense of her own self-sufficiency.\n\nToday, Zaria's life is a testament to resilience and routine. Her 6.5-mile commute on the Muni bus from her cozy Inner Richmond apartment is a cherished ritual, a time to read and observe the city waking up. She knows the names of the baristas at her local coffee shop and the best stalls at the Clement Street Farmers' Market. Her social life is a small, tight circle of old friends who share her love for dim sum, walks in Golden Gate Park, and quiet evenings.\n\nLooking ahead, Zaria doesn't dream of revolution, but of refinement. She hopes to travel to Italy and Puerto Rico to connect with the roots of her hyphenated name. More importantly, she aspires to mentor young women, especially women of color, entering her field, ensuring the steady, essential work she has dedicated her life to is passed into capable hands."

Her father, bathed in a single amber spotlight, made his saxophone weep and sing. She felt a profound, aching pride in him, but also saw the frayed cuffs of his shirt and the sparse weeknight crowd. In that moment, she understood the thrilling, precarious nature of his art. It was a beautiful, unstable thing, and she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she would build her life on firmer ground.\n\n2.\nDuring a college field trip to the Port of Oakland in \u201895, her classmates were distracted, chattering about dial-up and nascent websites. But Zaria was mesmerized. She watched the towering cranes lift containers from a massive ship with a balletic grace. It wasn't abstract code; it was a tangible, global pulse. The sheer, orderly scale of it all\u2014the movement of real things that people needed\u2014clicked into place. This was the world she wanted to understand and command, a complex, vital system hidden in plain sight.\n\n3.\nFor their tenth anniversary, her husband unrolled a blueprint across their dining table. It was a house, but a fantastical one of sweeping glass curves and impossible cantilevers he\u2019d designed just for them. Zaria traced the beautiful, impractical lines with a deep, quiet sadness. He built castles in the air, while she thought only of load-bearing walls and a solid foundation. She loved him for his dreams, but in that moment, she knew their two philosophies could never truly build a life under one roof.\n\n4.\nHer son, then seven years old, threw his Lego instruction booklet down in a fit of frustration. Instead of building it for him, Zaria sat on the floor and gently smoothed the crumpled pages. \u201cIt\u2019s a system,\u201d she told him, her voice soft. \u201cFirst this piece, then this one.\u201d She guided his small hands, patiently showing him how the complex whole was just a series of simple, logical steps. It was the first time she realized her professional mind was not separate from her heart; it was how she loved.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, on her usual 38R Muni bus, she saw a young woman, no older than twenty-two, intently highlighting a dense textbook on supply chain management. Zaria felt a surprising jolt of recognition, a kinship with the woman's quiet focus amidst the city's morning chaos. She saw herself in that determination. The vague idea of mentorship suddenly became a clear, pressing purpose\u2014a need to ensure the baton she hadn\u2019t realized she was carrying was passed on securely."
