The only child of a meticulous high school chemistry teacher and a stoic accountant, David\u2019s upbringing was predictable and emotionally muted. He excelled in school as an escape, drawn to the logic of human behavior, which seemed far more complex and interesting than his own placid home life. This fascination led him to pursue a Master\u2019s in Industrial-Organizational Psychology from Northwestern, a degree that perfectly blended his analytical mind with an interest in the human psyche.\n\nHe began his career in Chicago, quickly making a name for himself by helping legacy corporations streamline their bloated management structures. In the early 2000s, a burgeoning San Francisco investment bank, struggling with the chaotic human fallout of rapid growth, made him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse. He arrived not for the culture, but for the challenge. His career soared, but his personal life buckled under the 70-hour workweeks. His marriage to a fellow professional, once a partnership of ambition, dissolved into a series of scheduled appointments and resentful silences, ending in an amicable but hollow divorce a decade ago.\n\nToday, David\u2019s world has shrunk to the confines of his immaculate Noe Valley condo. The 0.0-mile commute is a choice he embraced long before the pandemic made it a norm. His days are a testament to routine: up at 5:30 AM for coffee and market reports, a series of international video calls, a precisely calibrated lunch, and a solitary late-afternoon run through the quiet, tree-lined streets. He is a resident of San Francisco in the most literal sense; he appreciates the fog rolling over Twin Peaks from his picture window and the world-class groceries delivered to his door, but he rarely engages with the city\u2019s vibrant, messy pulse.\n\nAt 53, David feels the first stirrings of a system failure\u2014his own. The promotions and bonuses no longer provide the same satisfaction. His secret hope is to break his own rigid programming; to travel somewhere without a schedule, to learn to play the cello that sits untouched in his spare room, or to simply have a conversation that isn\u2019t about optimizing performance. He yearns for a human connection that can\u2019t be diagrammed on a whiteboard."
