The only child of parents who emigrated from Lucknow, India in the late 1970s, she was raised in the quiet, aspiring suburbs of Fremont. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a librarian, instilled in her a dual appreciation for methodical problem-solving and the human stories that give data its meaning. While her peers were learning to code, Sarah was fascinated by *why* people clicked where they did.\n\nHer path wasn't a direct line to tech. She pursued an undergraduate degree in Psychology at UC Davis, driven by a desire to understand human motivation. It was during the first dot-com bubble she realized her calling. She saw the digital world being built by engineers for engineers, and recognized a critical gap. This led her to a Master's program in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon, a then-niche field that perfectly fused her interests. Her career began in the ashes of the dot-com bust, forcing a resilience that would define her professional life. She climbed the ladder not as a coder, but as a translator\u2014the person who could bridge the gap between brilliant, esoteric engineers and the real-world users they served, eventually becoming a Senior Project Manager.\n\nA key turning point was the end of her twelve-year relationship five years ago. The quiet heartbreak prompted her to move from a shared condo in SoMa to her current apartment in Cole Valley. It was a conscious choice for a neighborhood that felt more like a village, a place to heal and rediscover herself. Her life now operates on a hyperlocal rhythm. The 0.0-mile commute means her day starts with a walk to La Boulangerie for coffee, followed by hours of leading global teams from a bay window overlooking Cole Street. Evenings are for unwinding with walks on the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park or hosting small dinner parties for a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of tech veterans and neighbors.\n\nAt 44, Sarah feels a familiar restlessness. The promotions and stock options have lost their luster. Her dream is no longer an executive title, but a pivot toward civic tech. She aspires to use her project management expertise to improve San Francisco itself, perhaps working on public transit systems or digital access for underserved communities. Her hope is to transform her deep connection to the city from a residential one to a legacy of tangible, positive change."
