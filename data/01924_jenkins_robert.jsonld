            "value": "Robert Jenkins is the quiet king of a concrete and steel castle on Nob Hill. His commute is a short elevator ride from his basement apartment to whatever floor has a crisis, a reality that has defined his life for the past eighteen years. Raised in Bakersfield, Robert grew up with grease under his fingernails, the son of an auto mechanic who taught him that anything could be understood if you were willing to take it apart. He had no patience for abstract theory, finding solace in the tangible logic of machines and systems.\n\nHe earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Building Engineering Technology from a community college, a practical choice that felt more like a credential than an education. He moved to the Bay Area in his late twenties, chasing better pay as a maintenance technician. He was good at his job\u2014methodical, patient, and able to diagnose a building\u2019s ailments like a seasoned doctor. The supervisor position in the elegant Nob Hill co-op, which included a residence, felt like hitting the jackpot.\n\nThat jackpot, however, came at a cost. His marriage frayed under the constant on-call demands. His ex-wife, Lisa, longed for a home that wasn\u2019t also his workplace, a life that didn\u2019t revolve around burst pipes and late-night alarm checks. Their divorce a decade ago was the turning point that cemented Robert\u2019s identity to the building. He became its permanent fixture, the ghost in its machine.\n\nNow, at 50, his life is a rhythm of routines. He knows the residents not by their professions, but by their habits: the third-floor lawyer who runs the dishwasher at 2 AM, the elderly woman on the tenth floor whose radiator always needs bleeding. He is a polite, professional presence, privy to the intimate dramas of the wealthy but never part of them. His social life consists of a weekly beer with another building supervisor from down the street. His dream isn't grand; it's a small house in coastal Oregon with a workshop, where he can finally fix things for himself, on his own schedule, with no one to call but the quiet sea. He loves San Francisco from his rooftop perch, watching the fog swallow the bay, but he remains an outsider looking in, maintaining the engine of a city he doesn't quite belong to."
