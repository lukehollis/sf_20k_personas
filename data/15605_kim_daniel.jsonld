Born in Busan, South Korea, he was adopted as an infant by two loving, White public school teachers in Portland, Oregon. His upbringing was a happy one, filled with books, nature, and a deep-seated appreciation for civic responsibility, though the cultural threads of his birthplace remained a distant, abstract part of his identity.\n\nHis path wasn't initially aimed at tech. He pursued an undergraduate degree in psychology, fascinated by human motivation and behavior. However, he grew frustrated with the gap between academic theory and real-world impact. This led him to a graduate program in Human-Computer Interaction, where he discovered his calling: UX research. For Daniel, it was the perfect fusion of empathy and engineering\u2014a way to understand people\u2019s needs and build tools that genuinely help them.\n\nA key turning point came during an internship where he worked on a frustratingly complex hospital billing portal. He saw firsthand how poor design could compound the stress of people already in crisis. From then on, he vowed to use his skills for social good exclusively, turning down lucrative offers from fintech and social media giants.\n\nNow, at 33, Daniel lives in a modest but bright one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His life is structured and intentional. His 3.5-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa office is a daily ritual, a chance to feel the city\u2019s pulse before diving into user interviews for projects like simplifying access to mental health services or designing educational platforms for low-income students. Evenings are often spent at a local climbing gym, followed by cooking a simple meal at home.\n\nHis social circle is tight-knit, a mix of fellow \"tech-for-good\" advocates and friends from his climbing community. While he\u2019s dated, he remains introspective, quietly navigating the complexities of his identity. His dream is to one day lead a non-profit design studio focused on civic tech. He\u2019s also saving for a trip to South Korea\u2014not a search for his birth family, but a personal pilgrimage to connect with the culture on his own terms. For Daniel, San Francisco isn't just a career hub; it\u2019s a place where he can build bridges for others, slowly designing a life as intuitive and purposeful as the systems he hopes to create."

That evening, his mom explained adoption with a simple story about a family puzzle finding its final, perfect piece. The memory isn't of alienation, but of quiet understanding. It taught him that some questions don't need complicated answers, just loving ones, and that his own identity was a story he would get to help write.\n\n2.\nAt 25, during his internship, he watched through one-way glass as an elderly woman wept, unable to navigate the billing portal to pay her late husband\u2019s final medical expense. The tangle of menus and jargon wasn't just inconvenient; it was cruel. In that moment, the abstract theory of HCI vanished and was replaced by a profound, clarifying anger. Design wasn\u2019t about efficiency; it was about dignity. He vowed then that his work would never again be a source of someone\u2019s pain.\n\n3.\nSix months after moving to SF, he was cycling down Market Street. The morning sun hit the Salesforce Tower as he passed a man sorting cans and a family waiting for the F-line. The city\u2019s immense contrast\u2014its dazzling wealth against its deep-seated challenges\u2014struck him not with cynicism, but with clarity. This wasn\u2019t just a commute; it was a daily reminder of the gaps he was meant to bridge. He felt a quiet click of belonging. This was his work. This was his home.\n\n4.\nHe was stuck. Three weeks trying the same bouldering problem at Dogpatch Boulders, his frustration mounting. A woman he\u2019d only seen around offered a single piece of advice\u2014a different foot hold. It worked. The shared exhale of success, the easy conversation that followed\u2026 that was the moment his San Francisco loneliness finally broke. He learned that the strongest bonds weren't just found in shared missions, but in the simple, supportive act of helping someone reach a little higher.\n\n5.\nLast year, wandering the aisles of a Korean market in Daly City, he saw a grandmother show her grandson how to pick the best persimmon, her words a soft, familiar-unfamiliar rhythm. He felt no sense of loss, but a simple, profound curiosity. This culture wasn't a missing piece of him, but an undiscovered room in a house he already lived in. That day, the abstract idea of a trip to Korea solidified into a tangible goal: a pilgrimage to furnish that room for himself."
