Raised in Daly City by Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling garment workshop, she grew up amidst the rhythmic hum of sewing machines and the organized chaos of production deadlines. While her parents saw fabric and thread, Vivian saw systems\u2014bottlenecks in the cutting process, inefficiencies in shipping. She spent her teens rearranging supply shelves and creating color-coded order forms, finding deep satisfaction in making things run smoother.\n\nThis innate drive led her to Cal Poly SLO for Industrial Engineering, a degree that felt like a formal validation of her lifelong passion. She thrived, her practical upbringing giving her an edge over purely theoretical peers. Her first job was at a sustainable packaging manufacturer in San Francisco's Dogpatch, where her sharp insights and calm demeanor quickly earned her a promotion to Production Operations Manager. She orchestrates the complex dance of materials, machinery, and people, ensuring everything from sourcing recycled pulp to shipping the final product happens on schedule.\n\nA key turning point came three years ago when her father had a health scare. Vivian spent her weekends overhauling her parents\u2019 workshop-turned-business, implementing a new inventory system and workflow that reduced stress and increased their output. Seeing the tangible relief on her parents\u2019 faces solidified her purpose; her skills weren't just for corporations, but for people.\n\nToday, Vivian lives in a tidy studio in the Inner Richmond. Her mornings begin with a steaming bowl of congee before she boards the T-Third Muni line for her 4.5-mile commute. Her social life is a small, close-knit circle, often meeting for hot pot on Clement Street or trivia nights at a local pub. Though recently out of a long-term relationship, she finds comfort in her routine and the quiet independence of her life.\n\nHer dream isn't fame or fortune, but a refined version of her current reality: to one day launch her own consulting firm, helping small, family-run businesses like her parents\u2019 to thrive. For Vivian, success is a perfectly executed system, and San Francisco, with its blend of innovation and neighborhood grit, is the ideal factory floor for building her own."

While he stepped out, Vivian grabbed colored tape and tagged each roll\u2014blue for denim, red for silk. When he returned, he just stood there for a moment before giving her a single, slow nod of approval. That silent acknowledgment felt more profound than any praise. It was the first time she understood that creating order was a form of care, a way to make someone\u2019s world a little lighter.\n\n2.\nIn a sophomore lab at Cal Poly, her group debated a complex supply chain flowchart. They were lost in theory. Vivian, remembering the logjams at her family's workshop, erased the board and drew how her mother would organize fabric for the cutters. It was simple, practical, and it worked. A wave of quiet confidence washed over her; her lived experience wasn't a liability, it was her greatest asset. She wasn't just learning the language of systems, she was already fluent.\n\n3.\nThree years ago, after redesigning her parents\u2019 workflow, she found her father not working, but sitting calmly with a cup of tea. He watched the organized hum of the machines for a moment, then looked at her. \"Now,\" he said in Mandarin, \"there is room to breathe.\" The weight of those words landed deep in her chest. This was the true output\u2014not more garments, but peace of mind. Her purpose crystallized then: her skills were meant to give people back their breath.\n\n4.\nA few months ago, rattling along on the T-Third after her breakup, the world felt chaotic. But then she looked out at the Dogpatch shipyard, watching the massive cranes move in a slow, coordinated ballet. Their predictable, powerful grace was a balm. The city itself was a system she could trust, a reliable machine that kept running even when her own personal world had stalled. In that mechanical rhythm, she found a strange and solitary comfort.\n\n5.\nLast month, crowded around a bubbling hot pot with friends on Clement Street, she felt a profound sense of rightness. The orderly chaos of everyone dipping their own ingredients, the plates of neatly sliced meat, the shared rhythm of the meal\u2014it was a perfect, self-regulating system. This, she realized, was her version of happiness. Not a grand design, but a small, efficient, warm circle of people she loved. It was the blueprint for the life she was building."
