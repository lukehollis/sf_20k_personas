The son of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Fremont, he was raised on the twin pillars of hard work and high expectations. His father, a meticulous accountant, instilled in him a love for order and efficiency. David channeled this into an undergraduate engineering degree, a practical choice that pleased his parents, before veering slightly to earn an MBA, a choice that was purely for his own ambition.\n\nHis career was a methodical ascent through the ranks of Bay Area manufacturing firms. He became known as the man who could streamline any process, finding elegance in a well-oiled supply chain. This laser focus, however, came at a cost. His 20-year marriage frayed under the strain of his ambition, culminating in a divorce a decade ago, a turning point that left him successful but solitary.\n\nSeeking a change, David took a position as Operations Director for a high-tech machining company and bought a spacious live-work loft in Dogpatch. The building, a converted warehouse, mirrored his own nature: industrial, functional, and rich with a history of making things. His commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs to his home office, where digital dashboards give him a god's-eye view of the factory floor across the bay. His days are structured: a 6 AM start with strong black coffee, hours spent optimizing production schedules, and a quiet evening often spent with a book on manufacturing theory.\n\nLately, however, a new desire has taken root. At 53, David feels the pull of the imprecise and the artistic. He\u2019s begun exploring the city not as a series of efficient routes, but as a subject. With a recently purchased camera, he wanders the post-industrial landscapes of his own neighborhood, capturing the beauty in rust, steel, and decaying infrastructure. His aspiration is no longer just about optimizing systems, but about finding a new, more personal blueprint for the rest of his life, one that has room for both polished efficiency and beautiful, unplanned imperfections."
