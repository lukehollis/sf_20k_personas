Born on a US naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, to a Korean mother and a white American father, her early years were a blur of new schools and temporary homes. The name \u201cWilliams\u201d was a passport to one world, while her face tethered her to another. This duality fostered a quiet, observant nature and a deep yearning for a place to call her own.\n\nWitnessing the struggles of military families navigating medical crises, particularly her own mother\u2019s difficulty with the complex healthcare system, ignited a sense of purpose. She pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, specializing in healthcare. Her goal was clear: to be the calm, capable guide she wished her family had.\n\nSan Francisco was a conscious choice. After a lifetime of being the perpetual newcomer, she was drawn to a city built by transplants, a place where her mixed-race heritage didn\u2019t require an explanation. She landed a demanding role as a medical social worker at a large hospital and, in a move that defined her new life, found a small rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, just across the street.\n\nHer commute is a 300-step walk. Sarah\u2019s days are a whirlwind of empathy and bureaucracy\u2014counseling grieving families, arranging end-of-life care, and fighting with insurance companies. Her apartment is a sanctuary from the emotional tumult of the hospital. Evenings are for quiet decompression: a run through Golden Gate Park, tea on her small balcony overlooking the hospital campus, and calls with her small-but-fierce circle of friends, mostly fellow healthcare workers. She finds a profound connection to San Francisco in these quiet moments, feeling the city's pulse from her small, anchored corner of it.\n\nNow 37, Sarah dreams of breaking her self-imposed stillness. She fantasizes about taking a sabbatical, not to move, but to travel on her own terms\u2014a long, slow journey through South Korea to finally connect with the roots she only knows through her mother\u2019s stories. It\u2019s a future she\u2019s building, one stable day at a time."

Her mother, phone pressed to her ear, tried to navigate Tricare for a specialist appointment. The frustration in her voice, a quiet tremor Sarah had never heard, made her feel small. Papers were spread on the table, a language of codes and denials. In that moment of her mother\u2019s helplessness, Sarah felt a fierce, protective resolve harden inside her. She would learn this language. She would never let her family feel that small again.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe apartment was tiny, smelling of old paint and fog. The landlord handed her the keys, and the first thing she did was walk to the window. Below, the sprawling hospital campus looked like a map of her future. The N-Judah train rattled past, a rhythmic, grounding sound. After a lifetime of packed boxes and temporary addresses, this small space felt vast. She unpacked her kettle first, a silent declaration. This was it. She was finally, profoundly home. An anchor had found its seabed, just after her thirtieth birthday.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt wasn't the grief that broke her, but the paperwork. A few years into her job, an elderly man's son, eyes red-rimmed, sat buried under hospice admission forms he couldn't comprehend. Sarah sat with him, calmly explaining each line, her pen a small light in his fog of sorrow. When he finally signed, he just whispered, \u201cThank you. I couldn\u2019t see.\u201d Walking her 300 steps home that night, she understood her job wasn't just managing sorrow; it was holding the chaos at bay so others could simply breathe.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday, running deep into Golden Gate Park as dusk settled, the fog began to swallow the cypress trees. The air grew damp and smelled of eucalyptus. She stopped near the bison paddock, watching their ancient, steady forms fade into the grey. No sirens, just the muted hum of the city beyond the trees. In that quiet, she felt her roots finally sink into the sandy soil. She wasn't a transplant anymore; she was part of the landscape, as present and constant as the fog itself.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, her mother, on the phone from Virginia, described the taste of hotteok from a street vendor in Busan, her voice soft with a nostalgia Sarah couldn\u2019t share. The disconnect felt like a physical pang. All her life, she had sought stillness; she had it now. But her mother's stories were a part of her home she\u2019d never visited. That evening, looking at a map of South Korea online, the vague fantasy of travel became a concrete plan. Stillness wasn\u2019t the destination; it was the foundation from which she could finally move."
