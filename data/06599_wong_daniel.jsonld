Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he was the quiet son of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who ran a neighborhood hardware store. His childhood was spent not with video games, but with the disassembled guts of toasters and radios spread across the family workbench. His father taught him that everything could be understood if you just looked at its parts. Practicality was the family religion.\n\nHe followed this path of least resistance to City College, earning an Associate's in Electronics Technology. It was a sensible degree that led to sensible, soul-crushingly dull jobs repairing commercial HVAC systems. For years, Daniel felt like a ghost in his own life, a skilled but invisible cog in a machine he didn't care about.\n\nThe turning point came via a temp gig: fixing a notoriously finicky kinetic sculpture at a SoMa gallery. The artist, a whirlwind of paint-splattered energy, didn't just give him a schematic; she explained the *feeling* she wanted the piece to evoke. For the first time, Daniel wasn't just fixing a machine, he was restoring a vision. It was a revelation.\n\nHe leveraged that experience into a niche career, becoming the go-to technician for San Francisco's installation artists. Now, at 37, he lives in a sprawling live/work loft in the Dogpatch, a space that is part apartment, part workshop, and part repository for monumental art pieces. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his Murphy bed to a half-finished metallic beast that whirs and clicks with a life he helps sustain.\n\nAn introvert by nature, his deepest connections are with the artists who rely on his quiet expertise. His social life consists of gallery openings where he stands in the back, watching people interact with a sculpture he spent the last 72 hours coaxing back to life. He is a native son who has watched his city transform, but he remains tethered to its industrial, creative core. His secret dream is to one day build his own piece from the sketches in his notebook\u2014to finally be the artist, not just the man who makes the art work."
