His parents, immigrants who ran a small dry cleaning business, instilled in him the values of hard work and community.  Weekends were a blur of folding laundry and helping customers, formative years that taught him empathy and the importance of serving others.\n\nEducation was David\u2019s escape and his calling. A bright student, he flourished at Lowell High School, the city\u2019s competitive public school, where a dedicated history teacher ignited his passion for understanding people and systems. He pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, initially considering law, but a summer job counseling at a local youth program shifted his focus. He witnessed firsthand the transformative power of education on young lives. This led him to a Masters in Educational Leadership, driven by a desire to shape supportive learning environments.\n\nHis career began as a social studies teacher in the East Bay, where he honed his skills in engaging diverse student populations. A turning point came when he was offered a vice-principal position at a struggling SOMA high school. The challenge energized him. He implemented new mentorship programs and fostered stronger parent-teacher relationships. His success in turning the school\u2019s performance around led to his current role as principal of a large public high school, a demanding but deeply rewarding position.\n\nDavid\u2019s personal life is grounded. He was married for fifteen years, a relationship that ended amicably. He has a close relationship with his two college-aged children, who live out of state but visit during breaks, filling his quiet apartment with laughter. He maintains a small but loyal circle of friends, fellow educators, and former colleagues, often meeting for coffee or a walk in Golden Gate Park.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm: rising early, catching BART from the Outer Sunset, arriving at school before sunrise to prepare for the day. Evenings are often filled with school events, administrative tasks, or simply decompressing with a book. His connection to San Francisco is visceral. He appreciates its complexity, its beauty, and its persistent inequalities, the latter of which fuels his dedication to his students. His hopes for the future are centered on his school \u2013 ensuring every student has the opportunity to thrive. He dreams of seeing the next generation of San Franciscans flourish, knowing he played a part in their journey."

Finding that worn copy of \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States\u201d in the musty corner of the Lowell High School library, feeling a jolt of revelation that history wasn't just dates, but stories of struggle and resilience, igniting a lifelong fascination with understanding the human experience.\n\n2. Watching a shy ninth-grader, who arrived withdrawn and struggling, confidently lead a class discussion he\u2019d facilitated, feeling a profound sense of purpose and the quiet magic of seeing potential unlock, a memory that reaffirmed his path in education.\n\n3. The bittersweet walk through Golden Gate Park after his divorce was finalized, feeling a mix of sadness and a strange lightness, the fog rolling in like a silent companion, a moment of accepting change and finding strength in solitude.\n\n4. The warmth of his adult children's laughter filling his living room during a holiday visit, a simple moment of shared joy that reminded him of the enduring love of family, a grounding force amidst the demands of his work.\n\n5. Standing in the bustling SOMA school hallway, the cacophony of young voices a vibrant hum, and realizing that despite the challenges, this chaotic energy was the pulse of the city\u2019s future, a powerful, humbling reminder of the responsibility he carried."
