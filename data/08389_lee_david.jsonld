The son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in the Outer Sunset, his childhood was a soundtrack of rumbling N-Judah streetcars and the rhythmic clang of the shop\u2019s bell. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped he would pursue medicine or law, but David was a quieter, more observant child, drawn to the stories hidden in the city's architecture and history.\n\nHe stayed local for college, earning a Bachelor's degree in History from SF State. Graduating in the late 90s, he felt adrift, his degree seemingly at odds with the dot-com gold rush exploding around him. He took a temp job as an office assistant at a scrappy tech startup south of Market simply to pay rent. There, amidst the chaos of ambitious coders and grandiose ideas, David discovered an unexpected talent: he could organize the chaos. He translated engineering jargon into client-friendly language and kept complex projects on track.\n\nWhen the bubble burst, his practical skills an-chored him while others washed out. He steadily built a career as a project coordinator, a vital, non-technical cog in the city's relentless tech machine. The key turning point was his decision to stay. While friends decamped for Portland or Austin, David clung to his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a quiet bastion against the city\u2019s frantic evolution.\n\nNow 45, his 0.0-mile commute defines his life. His workday is a series of Zoom calls from a spare bedroom overlooking a neighbor\u2019s carefully tended garden. His mornings begin with a walk to a favorite bakery on Clement Street for coffee; evenings are for long, meditative strolls through Golden Gate Park. He is single, maintaining a close circle of friends who share his nostalgia for a pre-boom San Francisco. His deepest hope is to eventually apply his coordination skills to a local arts non-profit, reconnecting his work with the tangible, historic city he loves, not just the digital one that pays his bills. He remains a quiet chronicler of his hometown, a man who measures his life not in stock options, but in the familiar comfort of his neighborhood blocks."
