Raised in a quiet suburb of Columbus, Ohio, her childhood was filled with blueprints on the kitchen table and meticulously organized bookshelves. This blend of form and function led her to Carnegie Mellon University, where she pursued a degree in Industrial Design, fascinated by how everyday objects could be made both beautiful and intuitive.\n\nHer career began at a large consumer goods company in the Midwest. While she learned the fundamentals of manufacturing and supply chains, she felt creatively stifled. A key turning point came during a business trip to San Francisco; she was captivated by the city's vibrant design scene and entrepreneurial energy. Within a year, she accepted a position at a Bay Area firm specializing in sustainable home goods and moved west. Now a Product Development Manager, she thrives on the challenge of transforming a designer\u2019s sketch into a tangible, ethically-sourced product ready for market.\n\nSimone\u2019s life is anchored in her Potrero Hill apartment, chosen for its sunny microclimate and manageable 2.8-mile bike ride to her office in the Design District. Her daily routine is a productive hum: a morning ride, a day of coordinating with international factories and local designers, and an evening spent either at a pottery class, jogging through the neighborhood\u2019s steep streets, or meeting her close-knit group of friends for dinner in the Mission.\n\nThough professionally fulfilled and socially connected, Simone aspires for more. She dreams of launching her own brand\u2014a line of thoughtfully designed, minimalist products for small living spaces. This ambition is her quiet engine, pushing her to save diligently and sketch ideas in her notebook on weekends. San Francisco, for Simone, is no longer just a city; it is the canvas and the catalyst for a future she is determined to build with her own hands."

Huddled in a Hayes Valley design shop to escape a sudden downpour, she saw it: a simple, elegant pour-over coffee set, handmade in Oakland. In the Midwest, she managed products made by the million. Here was an object with a story, with soul. It wasn't just beautiful; it was proof that her a path existed outside of corporate spreadsheets. This quiet conviction was the catalyst for her move west three years ago, a memory that still feels like a jolt of pure possibility.\n\n2.\nHer first morning in Potrero Hill, the apartment was empty except for a few boxes and her bike. The sun, a phenomenon she\u2019d chased, poured through the bay window, illuminating a perfect, hazy view of the downtown skyline. She felt a profound sense of rightness, a quiet exhale she hadn't realized she\u2019d been holding. This small, bright space wasn't just a home; it was her blank canvas. It was here, in that golden light, that San Francisco stopped being a destination and started being the foundation for her future.\n\n3.\nA new line of recycled glassware was about to be scrapped. The factory in Mexico reported a flaw; the delicate lip of the glass was too fragile. Panic rippled through her team. Simone remembers silencing the noise, taking a pen, and sketching a slight, almost imperceptible curve to reinforce the edge\u2014a trick of structural integrity her father would have appreciated. It worked. That moment, two years ago, cemented her role not just as a manager, but as a pragmatic problem-solver, the bridge between an artist's vision and physical reality.\n\n4.\nDuring a pottery class last year, a cylinder she was throwing on the wheel kept collapsing. Frustrated, she was about to give up when she remembered her mother organizing dusty library archives, finding order in chaos. She closed her eyes, slowed her breathing, and focused only on the pressure of her palms against the spinning clay. It centered. In that moment of tactile focus, she understood that her brand wouldn\u2019t just be about minimalism, but about this feeling: a deliberate, calming interaction between person and object.\n\n5.\nSix months ago, jogging up the punishing incline of 20th Street, she had to stop to catch her breath. Leaning against a railing, she watched the city lights ignite as dusk settled over the Mission. She felt the burn in her legs and a surge of defiant joy. This city demanded effort\u2014the hills, the rent, the hustle. But the reward was this view, this feeling of earning her place. It mirrored her ambition: the climb was hard, but the future she was building for herself was worth every steep step."
