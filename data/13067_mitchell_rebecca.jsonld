Her childhood was comfortable but emotionally reserved, a world of unspoken rules and managed expectations. The placid surface of her family life was shattered during her adolescence when her younger brother began a long and difficult battle with severe depression. Witnessing her parents\u2019 loving but helpless response became Rebecca\u2019s defining turning point; she felt an overwhelming pull to understand the forces that were tearing her family apart.\n\nInitially an English major at Ohio State University, she switched to psychology after her sophomore year. This new path led her to pursue a Master of Social Work at the University of Michigan, where she found her calling. She came west to San Francisco for an internship and never left, captivated by the city's raw honesty and the profound need she saw in its communities.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Rebecca has worked as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for the San Francisco Unified School District. Her 5.1-mile commute on the Muni N Judah line takes her from her cozy Inner Sunset apartment to the turbulent inner worlds of students across the city. She navigates family crises, learning disabilities, and the pervasive trauma of poverty, offering a steady, empathetic presence in chaotic lives.\n\nNow 44, Rebecca\u2019s life has a settled rhythm. Her days are demanding, but she decompresses with long walks in Golden Gate Park and weekly dinners with a tight-knit group of friends, mostly fellow therapists and educators. A brief marriage in her early thirties ended amicably, leaving her dedicated to her career and personal growth. Though she occasionally misses a deeper partnership, she finds fulfillment in her work and her chosen community.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is one of a caregiver; she loves the city not for its glamour, but for its resilience and its people. Her dream is to one day open a small private practice focused on adolescents, creating a safe harbor for the kinds of kids she wished she could have helped all those years ago, including her own brother."

He was just a shape under the covers, and her parents whispered in the hall, their love a cloud of helpless anxiety. In that silence, she didn't feel sadness, but a fierce, desperate need to find the words, the tools, the *key* to unlock whatever had taken him. It was the moment her life's work began.\n\n***\n\n2.\nShe was 24, exhausted after a long day at her SFUSD internship. The N Judah lurched out of the tunnel into the Inner Sunset fog. Looking out at the rows of houses, each with its own unseen struggles, she didn't feel overwhelmed. She felt a profound sense of place. This wasn't a temporary stop; it was a field hospital of the soul, and she had just been handed her post. The Midwest felt a million miles away. She knew then she was home.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe end of her marriage wasn't a storm, but a quiet conversation at their kitchen table when she was 33. He wanted a different life\u2014a house, kids, a move out of the city. As he spoke, she pictured her students, their chaotic lives, her small office. She realized her life was already immense, just filled differently. There was no blame, only a sad, clean break. It wasn't a failure, but a choice to remain anchored to the work that truly owned her heart.\n\n***\n\n4.\nSeven years into her job, there was a boy who hadn\u2019t spoken a word at school all year. They\u2019d spent months just sitting together. Then one Tuesday, he slid a drawing across the table: two stick figures under a crooked sun. He pointed to one, then to himself, then to the other, and then to her. It was the loudest thing she\u2019d ever heard. That small piece of paper reminded her that healing doesn\u2019t always have a voice, but it always needs a witness.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a walk through Golden Gate Park last autumn, she sat on a bench near the Conservatory of Flowers. A group of teenagers passed, loud and messy and full of fragile bravado. A few years ago, she might have just smiled. But this time, she saw her brother. She saw her students. And she saw a clear vision of a small, safe office\u2014her own. The dream wasn't just an idea anymore; it was a promise she was making to them, and to her younger self."
