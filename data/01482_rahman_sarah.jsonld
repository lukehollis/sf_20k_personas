            "value": "Sarah Rahman\u2019s life has been an exercise in curation, not just for the independent design brands she represents, but for herself. Born to a Moroccan father and an Irish-American mother, both academics who moved frequently, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was a tapestry of different cultures and university towns. She never felt rooted in a single ethnic identity, instead absorbing a bit of everything. When her family finally settled in Berkeley during her high school years, she felt more at home in the Bay Area\u2019s eclectic energy than anywhere before.\n\nForegoing a traditional university path, which felt rigid and unnecessary to her, Sarah\u2019s real education began in the stockroom of a nascent San Francisco design collective. With a keen eye for texture, form, and what people truly wanted, she quickly moved from inventory to assisting the lead buyer. She learned on the job, absorbing knowledge about supply chains, material sourcing, and trend forecasting with an instinct that couldn't be taught. Her career turning point came when her boss, overwhelmed before a major trade show, let Sarah take the lead on a small category. Her picks sold out in a month, cementing her future.\n\nNow 45 and a Senior Buyer, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her sunny Mission District apartment, which also serves as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her desk, a space meticulously organized with fabric swatches and product samples. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a painful but clarifying event that prompted her to build a life of satisfying independence. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few colleagues and neighbors she hosts for intimate dinners.\n\nHer days follow a comfortable rhythm: a morning walk to a local cafe for an oat latte, hours spent on video calls with artisans from around the world, and evenings spent testing recipes or walking through Dolores Park. Having achieved professional stability, Sarah dreams of something more personal: launching a small, curated line of home goods herself. She loves San Francisco for its acceptance of the self-made, for the way it honors craft and expertise, regardless of pedigree. Her life here is the ultimate curated collection\u2014deliberate, beautiful, and entirely her own."
