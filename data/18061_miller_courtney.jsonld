The daughter of a meticulous carpenter and a pragmatic high school teacher, she grew up understanding the inherent value of things that were well-made and processes that were well-managed. This practical upbringing led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Industrial Design, where she honed her eye for form and function.\n\nAfter graduation, she was lured to San Francisco by a role at a boutique furniture manufacturer. While she loved the creative process, she discovered her true talent was in orchestrating the complex dance of production. A key turning point came when a major project was on the brink of failure due to supply chain chaos. Courtney stepped in, untangling the logistical knots and reorganizing the workflow, saving the launch. This event revealed her natural aptitude for leadership and set her on a new career path toward management.\n\nNow, at 37, she is the Production Manager for a high-end audio equipment company in SOMA. Her days are defined by a rhythm of her own making. The 5.5-mile bike commute from her sunny Potrero Hill apartment is a non-negotiable ritual, a time to process the day\u2019s challenges against the backdrop of the city\u2019s hills. The ride solidifies her connection to San Francisco\u2014not as a tourist or a tech utopian, but as someone who navigates its physical reality every day.\n\nRecently single after a long-term relationship ended amicably, Courtney channels her energy into a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow makers, cyclists, and former colleagues. Weekends often involve gallery visits in the Dogpatch or long bike rides across the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nHer ultimate aspiration isn\u2019t a corporate ladder, but a workshop of her own. Courtney dreams of launching a small company focused on sustainable, locally sourced home goods. She envisions a business that embodies her core values: thoughtful design, ethical production, and lasting quality. For Courtney, life is a process to be refined\u2014one well-made product, and one challenging hill climb, at a time."

On a dusty whiteboard, she sketched a new production flow, the squeak of the marker the only sound in the quiet workshop. It wasn\u2019t a moment of genius, but of profound clarity. The adrenaline rush felt more right than any design she\u2019d ever created. That night, she stopped seeing herself as a maker of things and started seeing herself as a maker of systems.\n\n2.\nHer first solo bike commute to her new Potrero Hill apartment, about seven years ago, was brutal. The final block of 18th street felt vertical, her lungs burning with every pedal stroke. Cresting the hill, gasping, she saw the downtown skyline laid out before her, a grid of glittering possibility. A fierce, breathless pride washed over her. It wasn\u2019t just a hill; it was a challenge she had physically beaten. From then on, the daily climb became a ritual that cemented her place in the city\u2019s tough, beautiful landscape.\n\n3.\nThe conversation that ended her relationship, just last year, took place on their shared couch. There were no raised voices, just a bottle of wine and the quiet, mutual acknowledgment that their blueprints for the future no longer aligned. The sadness was immense, but it was clean, without frayed edges. It felt like the respectful completion of a long, well-built project. That amicable end taught her that even loss could be managed with care, leaving not a wreck, but a clear foundation for what came next.\n\n4.\nAt twelve, she stood in her father\u2019s workshop, the air thick with the scent of sawdust. He was showing her how to make a dovetail joint, his large, calloused hands moving with incredible precision. When he let her fit the two pieces of oak together, they slid into a perfect, seamless connection. The feeling of that flawless joint under her small fingertips was a revelation. It wasn't just wood; it was integrity. That moment became her internal compass for quality, a standard she\u2019s sought ever since.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, during a long ride in the Marin Headlands, she stopped to look back at the city across the bay. Wind-whipped and content, she saw a piece of weathered driftwood on the shore below, its form shaped by time and tide. In a sudden, crystalline flash, the idea for her own business arrived, fully formed: sustainable, locally sourced goods. The vague dream became a tangible plan. It was immense and intimidating, but it felt like coming home\u2014the start of a new, deliberate process she was born to manage."
