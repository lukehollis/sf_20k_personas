Her childhood was a symphony of rumbling N-Judah streetcars, the scent of fresh produce, and her parents\u2019 unyielding belief in education as the path to a better life. They pushed her toward business, a practical and profitable field, and Mei-Lin dutifully enrolled in economics at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year while volunteering at a youth shelter in Oakland. Witnessing the complex trauma and systemic barriers faced by teenagers, she found a calling that economics could not answer. It was a difficult conversation, but she convinced her parents that her definition of a \u201cbetter life\u201d was about service, not salary. She returned to the city to earn her Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 40, Mei-Lin is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a public high school just 2.8 miles from her rent-controlled apartment in the Richmond District. Her days are a triage of student crises, from academic anxiety and family conflict to food insecurity. Her commute on the 38-Geary bus is her quiet time, a moment to brace for the emotional weight of her work.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of the city. As a native, she feels the shifts in San Francisco acutely\u2014the displacement, the rising costs\u2014and it fuels her advocacy for the students she serves. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of fellow educators and healthcare workers. Weekends are for dim sum on Clement Street, hiking the coastal trails of Lands End, and decompressing over shared frustrations and triumphs.\n\nMei-Lin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s grounded. She aspires to move into a supervisory role where she can mentor the next generation of social workers, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds. She wants to ensure that the city\u2019s most vulnerable youth will always have someone to turn to, someone who understands that San Francisco is more than a postcard\u2014it\u2019s a home worth fighting for."

Mei-Lin watched her father listen patiently before slipping an extra orange into Mrs. Chen's bag, a silent gesture of care. It wasn't about business; it was about community. That quiet act of kindness became the blueprint for her own definition of a \u201cbetter life,\u201d a foundation she would build her entire career upon, long before she knew what social work was.\n\n2.\nAt the Oakland shelter, a boy named Marcus, who hadn\u2019t spoken for weeks, finally showed her a drawing. It was of a lighthouse, surrounded by a storm. He quietly said, \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d In that moment, her economics textbooks felt hollow. The raw, vulnerable trust of that teenager was a more powerful currency than any she had studied. She was twenty, and for the first time, she knew with absolute clarity that her purpose was to be a light for kids like Marcus, not just analyze the systems that failed them.\n\n3.\nShe was twenty-one, back at her parents\u2019 kitchen table where they prized practicality over passion. When she said the words\u2014\u201cI\u2019m leaving economics for social work\u201d\u2014her mother\u2019s teacup stilled. She braced for disappointment but saw a deep, worried love in their eyes instead. Their hesitant nod was not just permission, but an acknowledgment of her own path. In that terrifying moment of honesty, she claimed her own dream, learning that her integrity was a non-negotiable part of who she was.\n\n4.\nHer first year at the high school, she attended graduation just to see one student, Analisa, cross the stage. Analisa\u2019s family was being displaced, and finishing school seemed impossible. After the ceremony, Analisa found her and pressed a folded note into her hand. It just said, \u201cYou saw me.\u201d Reading it under the bleachers, Mei-Lin felt a profound sense of rightness, a quiet click of purpose. This was her city, these were her kids, and this was the only work that mattered.\n\n5.\nLast spring, hiking the path to Sutro Baths, the wind whipped her hair as her friend, a UCSF nurse, recounted an impossible ER shift. They all vented\u2014about overwhelming caseloads, rent hikes, a city that felt like it was forgetting them. Then, someone cracked a joke, and their laughter echoed over the crashing waves. In that moment of shared exhaustion and resilient humor, she felt profoundly home. This chosen family, this weekly ritual of release, was the anchor that allowed her to keep fighting."
