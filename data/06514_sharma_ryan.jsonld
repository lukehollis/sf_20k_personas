The only son of a software engineer and a high school math teacher, Ryan grew up with the implicit expectation that he would follow a stable, lucrative path. He was a dutiful son, but his heart was captured not by code, but by the past. To his parents\u2019 gentle bewilderment, he enrolled at UC Davis and pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History.\n\nUpon graduating, the romance of the past collided with the reality of the present. A history degree didn\u2019t pay Bay Area rent. Pragmatism won out. Ryan took an entry-level customer support job at a burgeoning tech startup. He was organized, a clear communicator, and adept at seeing the long view of a problem\u2014skills honed by studying historical timelines. Within a few years, he leveraged this into an internal transfer, becoming a Junior Project Coordinator.\n\nThe key turning point was his move, two years ago, from his parents\u2019 home to a small one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. It was his declaration of independence. His 0.0-mile commute means his apartment is also his office, a world defined by Slack notifications and video calls. His daily routine is a quiet one: a morning coffee from a local cafe, a long walk through Golden Gate Park during his lunch break to escape the screen, and evenings spent decompressing not with colleagues, but with classic films or historical documentaries.\n\nHis social life is small but solid, consisting of a few college friends and a weekly online gaming session. While he\u2019s grateful for the financial security his tech job provides, he feels a persistent disconnect. The Jira boards and sprint planning that structure his days feel transient. His dream is to eventually pivot, to find a way to merge his project coordination skills with his passion\u2014perhaps working on digital archival projects for a museum or a historical society. For now, Ryan lives a life of quiet contradiction, a historian coordinating the future, saving his tech salary to one day fund a return to the past."
