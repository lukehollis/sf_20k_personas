The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up in the back of her parents\u2019 small, fragrant bakery on Irving Street. Her world was defined by the L Taraval Muni line, the persistent whisper of fog, and the tight-knit community of fellow second-generation kids. She watched firsthand as rents climbed and beloved neighborhood businesses were replaced by trendier, less personal storefronts, an observation that planted a seed of civic-minded curiosity.\n\nThis curiosity propelled her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree in Sociology, where she became fascinated by the systems that shape urban life. It was a visiting lecture on inclusionary zoning that served as her turning point. She realized she didn't want to just study the city; she wanted to help build it. She pursued a Master of Urban Planning at UCLA, focusing on equitable development and public transit. Returning to San Francisco wasn't just a career move; it was a calling. She secured a coveted role as an Associate Planner for the city, a position that felt like coming full circle.\n\nNow 31, Mei lives in a modern, compact apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her urbanist ideals; her office at the Planning Department is a short walk from her front door. Her days are a mix of poring over zoning codes, attending community feedback sessions, and conducting site visits. She is single but maintains a close circle of friends\u2014a mix of high school friends and fellow policy wonks\u2014with whom she explores the city\u2019s culinary scene on weekends.\n\nMei is deeply connected to San Francisco, feeling both the pride of a native and the burden of its challenges. She carries the memory of her parents\u2019 bakery, which they sold upon retirement, as a constant reminder of what\u2019s at stake. Her dream isn\u2019t grand but deeply personal: to contribute to policies that allow families like her own to continue calling San Francisco home, ensuring the city retains the soul that raised her."
