The only daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, beloved Cantonese bakery, her childhood was a blend of fragrant egg tarts and the formidable work ethic of her parents. They hoped she would pursue a stable career in medicine, but Sarah, drawn to human connection over biology, chose a different path. She earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications from UC Davis, a decision that initially worried her family.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was almost accidental. A post-grad internship in marketing at a small startup exposed her to the frenetic energy of software development. While she didn't write code, she discovered a rare talent for translating the chaotic passion of engineers and the abstract vision of designers into actionable plans. She was a natural conductor, and her career as a Project Manager was born.\n\nThe true turning point came six years ago. Tired of the draining commute, she moved into a bright, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, determined to fully immerse herself in the city's pulse. A year later, a punishingly failed project at a previous startup became her crucible. The experience, while humbling, forged a more resilient and empathetic leadership style that ultimately propelled her career forward.\n\nNow 32, Sarah\u2019s commute is a ten-step walk from her coffee maker to her laptop. Her days are a structured rhythm of Zoom calls, navigating Slack channels, and managing development sprints for a mid-sized software company. Her life is defined by this hyper-local existence; she knows the baristas at her favorite cafe by name and considers her evening yoga class a non-negotiable part of her routine. Her social life is her chosen family\u2014a tight-knit group of friends met through work and rock-climbing gyms.\n\nThough successful, Sarah aspires to more than just managing timelines. She dreams of leading a project that creates something with tangible social good. On a personal level, her quiet goal is to save enough for a down payment on a condo, to finally trade her lease for a deed and plant permanent roots in the complex, frustrating, and beautiful city that has truly become her home."
