Raised in a practical, middle-class suburb of Chicago, the son of an engineer and a high school math teacher, his early life was a landscape of sensible right angles and predictable outcomes. Art was a frivolous mystery to his parents. For Jasper, a high school field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago was a profound awakening; he was captivated not by the paintings themselves, but by the way the museum\u2019s architecture guided his emotion and attention through its spaces.\n\nThis fascination led him not to art history, but to a graduate program in Architectural Theory at UC Berkeley. He moved to San Francisco and fell hard for the city's chaotic, inventive spirit. His turning point came during an internship at a once-prominent but now-floundering gallery in SoMa. The aging owner had a brilliant eye but no spatial sense. Jasper, applying his academic principles, began re-hanging shows and redesigning the gallery\u2019s flow, dramatically improving visitor experience and sales. When the owner retired, Jasper used a small inheritance from a supportive grandmother and a business loan to take over the lease, rebranding it as \"Juxtapose Gallery.\"\n\nNow, at 38, Jasper\u2019s life and work are seamlessly integrated. He lives in a minimalist loft directly above the gallery, his 0.0-mile commute a testament to his dedication. His days begin with strong black coffee and emailing European collectors before the city wakes, and often end late, hosting openings or sharing whiskey with the artists he represents. His circle is a tight, eclectic mix of artists, venture capitalists who have become collectors, and a few old friends from his Berkeley days.\n\nLiving and working in Dogpatch, Jasper feels a deep connection to the neighborhood\u2019s industrial bones and its modern, creative resurgence. He is a fixture at the local coffee shop and a passionate advocate for public art installations. His ultimate dream isn't just to sell art, but to create a sustainable ecosystem for emerging Bay Area talent. Jasper aspires for Juxtapose Gallery to become an institution that doesn't just reflect the city's culture, but actively shapes it for decades to come."
