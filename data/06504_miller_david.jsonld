            "value": "David Miller\u2019s path to social work began in the quiet, unpredictable household of his Cleveland childhood. The second of three children, he grew up as the unwilling interpreter of his mother's emotional storms, later understood as undiagnosed bipolar disorder. He became an expert observer, learning to read the subtle shifts in tone and expression that signaled a coming crisis. This intuitive empathy, born of necessity, became the foundation of his professional life.\n\nDrawn by San Francisco's promise of acceptance and its vibrant counter-culture, David moved west after completing his undergraduate degree in psychology at Ohio State in the early 1990s. He felt an immediate connection to a city that didn't shy away from its complexities. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning his Master of Social Work. His first job was at a major San Francisco hospital, where he spent two decades on the front lines, navigating the raw intersection of poverty, addiction, and acute mental illness. The work was vital but corrosive, contributing to the amicable end of his 15-year marriage; he and his ex-wife, a landscape architect, simply couldn't bridge the gap between their daily realities.\n\nThe major turning point came five years ago. Facing profound burnout, David left the hospital system to establish a private telehealth practice from his home. Now, at 54, his world is contained within his modest Inner Sunset flat, overlooking a foggy corner of Golden Gate Park. His commute is a walk across the hall to a small office filled with books and soft light. His days are structured by back-to-back virtual sessions with clients grappling with anxiety, tech industry burnout, and relationship issues.\n\nHis life is intentionally quiet. Mornings begin with a long walk through the park, a ritual of decompression before absorbing the day\u2019s trauma. Evenings are for cooking simple meals, reading historical fiction, and maintaining a small, cherished circle of friends, most of whom also work in healthcare. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer to save the world, but to offer a steady, non-judgmental presence within it. He dreams of one day writing a series of essays, not as self-help, but as a reflection on the resilience and fragility he witnesses every day."
