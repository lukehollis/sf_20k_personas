Fifteen years ago, she arrived in San Francisco from a bustling, humid Guangzhou, carrying a high school diploma and a fierce determination to build a life that could support her parents and younger brother back home. The initial years were a blur of restaurant kitchens and cleaning jobs, her Mandarin a barrier to the office work she\u2019d once imagined.\n\nA turning point came when a friend suggested caregiving. Mei Ling discovered a quiet aptitude for it\u2014a deep well of patience she hadn\u2019t known she possessed. After getting her certification, she began working as a home health aide. For the past five years, she has been the live-in caregiver for Eleanor Vance, an 88-year-old woman with advancing dementia. Her commute is zero miles, but her freedom is measured in hours, not days.\n\nHer life is a cycle dictated by Eleanor\u2019s needs: the 6 AM alarm for medication, the careful preparation of soft foods, the slow walks to Golden Gate Park, and the gentle, repetitive conversations. Mei Ling\u2019s primary relationship is with a woman who often doesn't remember her name but feels her absence keenly. Her own family exists as voices on WeChat, their lives unfolding an ocean away, funded by the money she diligently sends. Her friendships are with other caregivers she meets at the park, their conversations a rapid exchange of shared frustrations and small victories during their clients\u2019 naps.\n\nHer San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or Michelin-starred restaurants, but of the produce markets on Clement Street, the specific bench that catches the afternoon sun, and the hushed quiet of a home where she is both essential and invisible. Mei Ling\u2019s dream is not grand; it is the radical hope of one day having her own small apartment, a quiet room with a door that locks from the inside, a space where she is no one\u2019s caretaker but her own."
