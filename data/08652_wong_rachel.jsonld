The only daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood bakery, Rachel grew up amidst the comforting smells of pineapple buns and the persistent expectation that she would pursue a stable, predictable career. She obliged, earning a bachelor\u2019s in sociology from UC Davis before obtaining a Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), a field that satisfied both her methodical nature and her parents\u2019 desire for a respectable profession.\n\nHer career as an archivist was cut short by the 2008 recession, a key turning point that left her unemployed and disillusioned. Watching the tech boom reshape her city, Rachel saw a parallel between her skills in organizing vast amounts of information and the burgeoning field of data science. In a pivot that defined her thirties, she used her severance to pay for bootcamps, teaching herself SQL and Python late into the night. She started as a junior analyst at a struggling startup, slowly but surely building a reputation for finding the narrative hidden within the numbers.\n\nNow 41, Rachel is a Senior Data Analyst for a major tech firm, working entirely from her meticulously organized Noe Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a structured, solitary lifestyle. Mornings begin with a walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte, followed by hours translating complex datasets into actionable insights for product teams.\n\nSocially, she maintains a tight circle of friends\u2014a mix of old college pals and a few former colleagues. A long-term relationship ended amicably two years ago, leaving her comfortably independent. While she is proud of her career, Rachel dreams of applying her skills to a cause, perhaps analyzing data for a climate change non-profit. She feels a deep, evolving connection to San Francisco, having witnessed its transformation from the city of her childhood to the tech hub that forged her second act. Her future aspiration isn't about climbing higher up the corporate ladder, but about finding a way to make the data tell a story that truly matters."
