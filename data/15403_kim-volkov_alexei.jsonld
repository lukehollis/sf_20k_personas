The only child of a Korean linguist and a Russian software engineer who met at a conference in Seoul, he was raised in the sprawling suburbs of San Jose. His childhood was a canvas of contrasts: the sharp, savory flavors of his mother\u2019s kimchi-jjigae and the dense, dark rye bread his father favored. He grew up watching Silicon Valley boom, but he mostly saw the consequence: endless traffic on Highway 101, where his father lost hours of his life each week. This formative experience, witnessing the human cost of car-centric design, planted the seed for his future.\n\nRejecting the tech path laid out before him, Alexei pursued a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley. It was there he found his calling, not in code, but in the complex, human systems of a city. He saw urban planning as a form of social justice, a way to build more equitable, sustainable, and connected communities. Upon graduating, he made a deliberate choice to live a life that reflected his principles: he moved to San Francisco and sold the car he'd had since college.\n\nNow, at 38, Alexei is a Senior Transportation Planner for the city. From his apartment in NoPa, his 2.5-mile commute is a daily embodiment of his work\u2014a brisk bike ride through the Panhandle, followed by a short Muni trip to his office near City Hall. His life is a quiet rebellion against his suburban upbringing. He and his long-term partner, Lena, a landscape architect, spend weekends exploring neighborhoods on foot, frequenting farmers' markets, and volunteering for park cleanups.\n\nAlexei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city as a living laboratory, a place of immense potential hampered by legacy challenges. His dream is to spearhead the city\u2019s transition to a truly transit-first future, creating a network of protected bike lanes and rapid bus corridors so seamless that car ownership becomes an afterthought. More than a career, for Alexei, it is a mission to give back to the city he loves, ensuring that no child has to watch their parent disappear into traffic for hours on end."

The man who walked in was a deflated version of his dad, smelling of asphalt and exhaust, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Seeing his father\u2019s vitality drained away by Highway 101 wasn\u2019t just sad; it felt like a theft. That night, a quiet, protective anger took root\u2014a vow to fight the systems that stole time and spirit from the people he loved.\n\n2.\nIt was a lecture during his first semester at UC Berkeley, in a stuffy room in Wurster Hall. The professor wasn't talking about code or startups, but about the social fabric of neighborhoods, how a well-placed bus stop could change a life. For Alexei, it was an epiphany. This was the answer to the quiet anger he\u2019d held since childhood. He walked out of that class knowing he would never follow his father\u2019s path into tech. He had found his own language, written not in Python, but in bike lanes and crosswalks.\n\n3.\nHe was 26, standing on a corner in the Mission, the Craigslist buyer counting cash into his hand. He handed over the keys to his old Honda, the car that had once symbolized freedom. As it drove away, he felt a surprising wave of relief, not regret. It was a baptism. He was unburdening himself from the past, from the traffic, from the very machine that had defined his father's life. Standing on that curb, with only a Muni pass in his pocket, he felt truly, weightlessly, a San Franciscan.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a bitter community meeting three years ago for the new protected bike lane on Fell Street. After an hour of angry drivers, a woman in her seventies stood up. She spoke haltingly about how the lane now allowed her to safely bike to her grandchild\u2019s preschool. In that moment, the hostile shouts and bureaucratic red tape faded. Her simple story was the entire point of his work. It was the data made human, a quiet victory that has fueled him through a dozen more political fights since.\n\n5.\nLast summer, standing with Lena on Twin Peaks as dusk settled over the city. The grid below was a circuit board of light and life. She pointed out the green corridors connecting parks, her professional passion, while he saw the pulsing arteries of transit, his own. They weren't just observing a landscape; they were looking at their shared life's work and their home. In the cool air, holding her hand, he felt a profound sense of peace. This was what he was fighting for: not just efficiency, but moments of breathtaking beauty."
