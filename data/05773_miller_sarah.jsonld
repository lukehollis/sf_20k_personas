Her family prized stability and the well-trodden path of a state college degree followed by a sensible career. Sarah dutifully enrolled at SF State, vaguely intending to major in communications, but found the abstract world of academia paled in comparison to the vibrant, immediate reality of her part-time job waiting tables at a bustling trattoria in North Beach. It was there, amidst the clatter of plates and the symphony of orders, that she found her true calling.\n\nAfter two years, she made the pivotal decision to drop out of college, a move that caused quiet friction with her parents. She poured her energy into the restaurant world, quickly moving from server to shift lead, her natural talent for orchestrating nightly chaos and managing diverse personalities becoming obvious. Her career was forged in the demanding fires of San Francisco's hospitality scene. The COVID-19 pandemic was her crucible; as a newly minted manager, she navigated shutdowns, staff furloughs, and the chaotic pivot to takeout, solidifying her reputation as a resilient and indispensable leader.\n\nToday, at 40, Sarah\u2019s life is intrinsically woven into the fabric of \"The Clementine Bistro,\" the Hayes Valley restaurant she manages. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this fact; she lives in a small apartment directly above the restaurant. Her days begin with the smell of baking bread from the kitchen below and often end long after the last table has been cleared. Her social life is a constellation of staff who have become her found family, loyal regulars who greet her by name, and other industry veterans she meets for late-night drinks.\n\nWhile proud of the life she\u2019s built, Sarah harbors a persistent dream. She feels the pull of ownership, the desire to see her own vision come to life. Her aspiration is to one day transform a neglected neighborhood spot into \"Miller's,\" a place built on the principles of good food, warm community, and fair treatment for its staff\u2014a true testament to the life she has so passionately crafted for herself in the city."
