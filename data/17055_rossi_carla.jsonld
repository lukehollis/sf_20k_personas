While the Rossi family roots were sunk deep in North Beach, her childhood was spent in the foggy, modest avenues of Daly City. The daughter of a pragmatic butcher and a deeply empathetic mother, Carla grew up straddling two worlds: the stoic practicality of her father and the boundless compassion of her mother. This duality would come to define her.\n\nHer path to social work wasn't an academic decision but a personal one. It was cemented by watching her younger cousin struggle with undiagnosed learning disabilities, where Carla witnessed firsthand the profound impact of a single, compassionate school counselor. Inspired, she enrolled at San Francisco State University, working her way through school to earn her Bachelor's in Social Work. The city, once a weekend destination, became her home. She then spent years gaining the grueling clinical hours required to become a Licensed Clinical Social worker (LCSW), specializing in supporting students within the public school system.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. The end of a 12-year relationship was a painful fracture, but it forced an unmoored Carla to find her own anchor. She found it in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood she loves for its quiet stability and proximity to Golden Gate Park. This apartment became her sanctuary, a place entirely her own.\n\nNow at 49, Carla\u2019s life has a steady rhythm. Her commute on the 5-Fulton bus is a cherished buffer between her personal life and the emotionally demanding work of navigating crises for students and their families. Evenings are for decompressing: long walks through the park, exploring the restaurants on Clement Street with a tight-knit group of friends who, like her, have weathered the city\u2019s many changes, or simply reading by her bay window.\n\nCarla feels a deep, protective love for San Francisco, not the sanitized tech version, but the gritty, resilient city that raised her. Her quiet dream is to eventually transition into a small private practice, offering sliding-scale therapy for adolescents. It\u2019s not about escaping her current role, but about building something lasting\u2014a final, independent chapter in a life dedicated to helping others find their footing."

Her cousin Marco, usually withdrawn and frustrated, burst in from school, clutching a piece of paper. He\u2019d been with his school counselor. He didn't just show her his drawing; he explained the story behind it, his words finally unknotted. In that instant, Carla felt a profound clarity. It wasn't just relief; it was awe at the power of one person\u2019s focused compassion. It set the entire course of her life.\n\n2.\nThe first night in her Inner Richmond apartment was terrifyingly quiet. The 12-year relationship was over, its ghost living in the echo of her footsteps on the bare wood floors. She sat by the large bay window, watching the fog curl around the streetlights on 6th Avenue. It was the first space that was entirely hers. A wave of loneliness washed over her, followed by a fierce, surprising thrill of independence. This wasn't an ending. This was the foundation she would build entirely for herself.\n\n3.\nShe was twenty, walking through North Beach on a Sunday with her father. He rarely spoke of the past, but that day he stopped outside a deli. \u201cMy father,\u201d he said, pointing with his chin, \u201cwas a butcher, right there. Hard life. Good life.\u201d He then bought them both warm focaccia from the bakery next door. The bread was salty, the moment understated. Carla felt the weight of her family\u2019s pragmatic, resilient history settle into her bones, grounding her in a city of workers, not just dreamers.\n\n4.\nIt had been a brutal week with a withdrawn high school freshman who wouldn't speak. Exhausted, Carla was staring out the window of the 5-Fulton when her phone buzzed. It was a text from the student\u2019s mother. The image was a shaky photo of a drawing the boy had just made: a simple sketch of Carla at her desk. It was the first thing he had created in months. The weariness of her day evaporated, replaced by a fierce, protective resolve. This was why she endured it.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a long day, her friends intercepted her on her way home. They walked into Golden Gate Park as the thick fog rolled in, silencing the city. Huddled together on a bench near the Conservatory of Flowers, they shared a thermos of tea, their laughter misting in the cold air. There were no big pronouncements, just the easy comfort of shared history. In that quiet, foggy moment, Carla felt a profound sense of peace. This resilience, this chosen family\u2014this was the San Francisco she fought for."
