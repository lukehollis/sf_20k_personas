Raised in a Sacramento suburb, he was the son of a state civil engineer and a high school history teacher. His upbringing was stable and instilled a belief in public service, though he didn't initially see it as his own path. After completing his undergraduate degree at UC Davis, he felt adrift, spending two unfulfilling years in corporate logistics, a world of efficient systems that felt disconnected from human impact.\n\nThe turning point came during the fallout of the dot-com bust. Witnessing the stark economic disparities and housing instability affecting friends in the Bay Area, David felt a call to action. He redirected his life, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy. It was there he found his purpose, diving into the complex data and human stories behind urban policy. San Francisco, with its beautiful contradictions, became his laboratory and his home.\n\nNow 43, David is a Senior Policy Analyst for the city, working on the perpetually tangled issue of housing. His 0.0-mile commute is a modern reality; his office is a corner of his tidy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are a disciplined routine: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, a strong coffee from a favorite Clement Street caf\u00e9, and then hours immersed in spreadsheets, zoning codes, and impact reports. He is a man who knows the city not just by its landmarks, but by its census tracts and housing waitlists.\n\nSocially, David maintains a close-knit circle of friends from grad school and former city hall colleagues. After a long-term relationship ended five years ago, his focus has been primarily on his work. He\u2019s a familiar face at neighborhood meetings, more an engaged observer than a vocal participant. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s specific. He wants to be instrumental in a single piece of policy that demonstrably creates a few hundred units of stable, affordable housing. For David, success is measured in the lives he can improve, one data point, one policy brief, one quiet day at a time in the city he is devoted to serving."

Mark, a brilliant designer, was priced out, another casualty of the dot-com bust. David felt a hot surge of anger, not at anyone, but at the system itself\u2014a cold, indifferent algorithm. That feeling of helplessness galvanized him. It was the moment the abstract problem of the economy gained a human face and a personal mission was quietly born.\n\n2.\nIt was a Tuesday night in the Goldman School library, around 2005. He was staring at a color-coded map showing eviction rates in the Tenderloin, the data points bleeding into each other. Suddenly, the numbers weren't just statistics; they were families, life stories, slammed doors. He felt a profound sense of clarity, a click in his brain. This was it. This was the work. The data was a language, and for the first time, he felt truly fluent. It was the night his pragmatism found its idealism.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the silence after Sarah said, \u201cYour work is your real partner, David.\u201d They were standing in the living room of their old Noe Valley apartment five years ago. It wasn\u2019t an accusation, just a quiet, devastating truth. He looked out at the city lights, feeling a profound loneliness but also a strange sense of recognition. She was right. The breakup wasn't a failure of love so much as a confirmation of his life\u2019s true, demanding focus. Work became his refuge and his purpose.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, he sat in the back of a stuffy community room in the Mission, an anonymous face in the crowd. A housing proposal he\u2019d spent months modeling was being presented. A single mother stood up, her voice trembling slightly, and spoke about what a stable, affordable home would mean for her kids. In that moment, the zoning codes and density bonuses vanished. He saw only her face. It was the purest form of validation he\u2019d ever felt, reaffirming his choice to work quietly in service of such moments.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, on a run through Golden Gate Park. The fog was so thick it felt like a soft, gray room, muffling the city's noise. The damp scent of eucalyptus and earth filled his lungs. He stopped near the Conservatory of Flowers, alone in the quiet mist. It wasn't a grand vista, but a moment of profound peace and belonging. The feeling cemented his devotion to the city\u2014not just as a problem to be solved, but as a home to be protected, one foggy morning at a time."
