The Bay Bridge is a string of diamonds he barely notices anymore. His 0.0-mile commute is an elevator ride down to his law firm\u2019s satellite office in the same building, a testament to a life optimized for efficiency.\n\nHe is the son of the Richmond District, born to parents who fled Canton in the late 1960s. Their American dream was humble and smelled of starch: a small laundromat on Clement Street where David spent his youth folding strangers' clothes and poring over library books. They saw in their quiet, studious son the promise of a life without calloused hands. The pressure was immense, but unspoken.\n\nHe never considered anything but the most direct path to stability. Political Science at UC Berkeley transitioned seamlessly into a Juris Doctor from the same esteemed institution. He was recruited by a prestigious downtown firm, specializing in intellectual property law just as the first dot-com bubble began to inflate. His work ethic, forged in the humid back room of the laundromat, made him a star associate.\n\nThe key turning point was making partner at 38. It was the culmination of two decades of relentless ambition, but the celebration was muted. The cost had been his marriage to Elena, a professor who tired of competing with his billable hours. His relationship with their daughter, Maya, now studying art history in New York, is maintained through polite, bi-weekly phone calls that feel more like status updates.\n\nNow, at 50, David\u2019s days are a familiar rhythm: a 5 AM workout in the building\u2019s gym, a twelve-hour workday negotiating multi-million dollar tech mergers, and a quiet dinner of gourmet takeout. He is a pillar of San Francisco's legal community, yet feels disconnected from the city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic soul. He sometimes drives through his old Richmond neighborhood, a tourist in his own past. His aspiration is no longer to acquire more, but to feel more. He dreams of mentoring a first-generation law student, or perhaps finally taking that trip to trace his family\u2019s roots in Guangdong\u2014not as a partner or a lawyer, but simply as a son."
