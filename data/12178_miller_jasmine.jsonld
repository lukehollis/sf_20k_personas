Born in Daly City to a Filipino immigrant mother, a hardworking nurse, and a white American father, a pragmatic mechanic, Jasmine grew up navigating the space between two cultures. Her childhood was a blend of boisterous family parties filled with lumpia and adobo, and quiet afternoons learning how to diagnose a sputtering engine in her father\u2019s garage. This upbringing instilled in her a deep-seated empathy and a no-nonsense approach to problem-solving.\n\nDrawn to helping others, she enrolled in San Francisco State\u2019s Social Work program. For two years, she thrived, but her path was irrevocably altered when her mother was diagnosed with a degenerative illness. Jasmine left school without a second thought, becoming her primary caregiver. The sterile scent of hospitals and the bureaucracy of healthcare became her new curriculum. It was a grueling, heartbreaking education that a classroom could never provide.\n\nAfter her mother\u2019s passing, returning to formal education felt hollow. Instead, Jasmine found her calling in the non-profit sector. She started by answering phones and eventually worked her way up to Program Coordinator at a community arts organization in the Mission District. Here, she fuses her social work instincts with her belief in art as a tool for healing, organizing workshops for at-risk youth and isolated seniors.\n\nNow 45, Jasmine\u2019s life is one of routine and purpose. Her day begins with a coffee and the rumbling of the 38-Geary bus, which takes her the 5.5 miles from her rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond to her bustling office. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of colleagues and neighbors she\u2019s known for years. She has found contentment in her independence. Jasmine\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status, but of legacy. She hopes to secure enough funding to make her programs self-sustaining for decades to come, ensuring the community she loves always has a colorful, safe place to connect and create. She is, in every sense, a builder and a caregiver for her chosen city."
