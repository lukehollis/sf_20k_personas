Her parents, immigrants from Punjab, ran a small contracting business, and Reena grew up learning the language of load-bearing walls and property potential. While her peers stressed over SATs, Reena saw a more direct path. For her, college felt like an expensive detour from the tangible world of assets and equity she already understood.\n\nAt nineteen, foregoing higher education, she took an entry-level job as a receptionist at a downtown San Francisco real estate firm. She was a sponge, absorbing every detail from the agents she supported\u2014their negotiation tactics, their client management, their market analyses. She soon realized her practical knowledge of construction gave her an edge; she could spot a money pit or a hidden gem in ways they couldn't. At 22, she earned her real estate license, and by 30, her broker\u2019s license, a milestone she achieved through sheer grit and late-night study sessions after grueling workdays.\n\nNow 37, Reena is a formidable presence in the SF real estate scene. Her life is headquartered in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, a world away from her upbringing. Her commute is a short, stress-free rideshare to her SoMa office, a daily luxury she feels she has earned. Her routine is relentless: a 6 a.m. market check, back-to-back client calls, and evenings spent at networking events or poring over new listings.\n\nHer social life is a curated mix of a few loyal friends from her early days who keep her grounded and a broader circle of industry contacts. While she enjoys the fruits of her labor\u2014fine dining and designer clothes\u2014her ambition remains unsated. Reena\u2019s ultimate dream is to leverage her success and launch her own boutique firm, \"Singh Estates.\" She envisions a brand known for its integrity and deep, intuitive understanding of the city she has made her own, moving from selling homes to building an empire, one perfectly matched property at a time."

Know the spine, and you know the real value.\" It wasn't about drywall or paint; it was about strength and foundation. That lesson became the bedrock of her entire career, the ability to see past the superficial to what truly holds a home\u2014and a deal\u2014together.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, she was answering phones when two top agents fretted over a \"cursed\" Victorian. Reena knew the faint, sweet smell of decay they described\u2014dry rot in the joists, a simple fix for her dad\u2019s crew. In that moment, a quiet power settled in her. Their prestigious education missed what her working-class childhood saw instantly. She wasn't just support staff; she was a secret weapon. That surge of confidence fueled her decision to get licensed immediately.\n\n3.\nThe night she passed her broker's exam at thirty, she didn't go out. Exhausted in her tiny Nob Hill studio, she sat on the floor with her oldest friend, Anika, and shared a cheap bottle of prosecco. The relief was so profound it felt like grief for all the sleep and life she\u2019d sacrificed. That raw, simple celebration cemented her loyalty to those who knew her before the success, a grounding force she vowed to always protect.\n\n4.\nHer first million-dollar sale, around age 28, was a Noe Valley home from an elderly man moving into assisted living. After closing, he handed her a small, potted rose bush from his garden. \"This house was good to us,\" he\u2019d said, his eyes welling up. The commission felt insignificant next to the trust he\u2019d placed in her. It solidified her resolve that she wasn\u2019t just selling assets; she was a custodian of people's lives and memories.\n\n5.\nHer first night in the Hayes Valley condo, at 35. She stood at the floor-to-ceiling window, not looking at the skyline, but at the reflection of herself against the glittering city lights. The ghost of a girl covered in sawdust, the tired receptionist, the broker studying at 2 a.m.\u2014they were all there. A quiet, profound sense of arrival washed over her. It wasn't just a home she'd bought; it was a promise she had finally kept to herself."
