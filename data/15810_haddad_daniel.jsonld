The son of a pragmatic Lebanese immigrant father who ran a successful auto repair shop in San Jose and a literature-loving mother from Ohio, Daniel grew up straddling two worlds: the tangible mechanics of engines and the limitless landscapes of fiction. His childhood was spent devouring sci-fi novels and taking apart old VCRs, equally fascinated by both narrative and technology.\n\nHe initially tried to follow his father\u2019s practical path, earning a Communications degree from UC Davis. However, a subsequent two-year stint in corporate marketing felt hollow and creatively bankrupt. The turning point came at 26; rejecting a safe career, he poured his savings into an MFA in Digital Media. It was there he discovered his true calling: not just creating art with technology, but using technology to build entire, inhabitable worlds.\n\nDaniel moved to San Francisco in the late 2000s, landing a job as a digital artist for an ambitious but short-lived startup. He spent the next decade honing his craft, moving from interactive design agencies to experiential marketing firms. He became known for his ability to blend physical space, augmented reality, and compelling narrative. Now, as Director of Immersive Experiences, he masterminds everything from multi-sensory pop-up restaurants to interactive exhibits for art museums, earning a salary that affords him a comfortable life in a city he adores.\n\nHe lives alone in a meticulously organized apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood he loves for its vibrant art and culinary scenes. His 3.8-mile commute on the J-Church MUNI is his time to observe, sketchbook and tablet always in his bag. His social life is a tight-knit circle of chefs, artists, and programmers. He\u2019s been single for three years since the amicable end of a long-term relationship, and while he enjoys his independence, he quietly longs for a partner who shares his passion for thoughtfully crafted experiences.\n\nDaniel\u2019s primary aspiration is to create a permanent, large-scale immersive installation in San Francisco\u2014a landmark that blends the city's history with its technological future. He dreams of building a legacy not of code or profit, but of shared wonder."

His father\u2019s hands, stained with grease, pointed into the guts of a Toyota. \u201cThis is where it breathes, Dani.\u201d That night, his mother read him Asimov. Lying in bed, he realized the engine and the spaceship were the same: a system with a story, a mechanism with a soul. He understood then that his fascination wasn't a choice between the tangible and the imagined, but a need to see how they fit together, how one gave life to the other.\n\n2.\nAt 26, he sat in his beige cubicle, staring at the marketing slides he\u2019d perfected. The clever tagline felt hollow, an elegant lie. He closed his laptop, walked to the window overlooking the Peninsula, and saw the traffic on 101 not as cars, but as data streams, as narrative potential. He didn't feel fear when he quit the next day to apply for his MFA; he felt like he was finally plugging himself into the correct power source.\n\n3.\nThe startup failed spectacularly. On the last day, he and the founder stood in their empty SoMa warehouse as the projectors were packed away. Their grand vision\u2014an AR story mapped across the city\u2014was just dismantled hardware. It wasn't a bitter moment, but a clarifying one. He learned that the technology was disposable; the only thing that truly lasted was the fleeting memory of the shared dream in the minds of the team who built it.\n\n4.\nThe end with Chloe wasn\u2019t a fight, but a quiet Sunday afternoon sorting books in their Mission apartment. They were unconsciously curating separate libraries for future, separate lives. \"You build entire worlds,\" she said, not unkindly, \"I just want to live fully in this one.\" The sadness was immense, but clean. He learned then that a perfectly crafted experience for one isn't always a shared home for two, a lesson he carries in his quiet independence.\n\n5.\nLast year, at his pop-up dining experience in the Dogpatch, he watched from a shadowed corner. A couple, on their first date by the looks of it, interacted with a projection that changed based on the spices in their dish. The tech worked, but that wasn't it. The magic was in the way they forgot the interface and simply looked at each other, laughing. In that shared glance, Daniel saw his true work: not building the illusion, but engineering the wonder that connects people within it."
