He grew up not in San Francisco\u2019s dense grid, but in the sprawling, sun-baked landscape of the San Fernando Valley. The son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his childhood was defined by tract housing, wide boulevards, and a creeping sense of placelessness. The pivotal moment came in 1994 with the Northridge earthquake; as a teenager, David witnessed firsthand how a city\u2019s infrastructure could fail, and how communities could be fractured or united in the aftermath. This visceral lesson in urban fragility ignited his passion.\n\nHe pursued this passion to UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Urban Planning. San Francisco, with its complex beauty and intractable problems, was the ultimate challenge. He joined the City Planning Department as a junior analyst two decades ago and never left, slowly ascending the ranks through methodical, diligent work. His career became his anchor, especially after his marriage to a corporate attorney dissolved under the weight of two demanding professions. The amicable divorce left him with a quiet sadness and an even deeper devotion to his work.\n\nNow a manager, David lives a life of contained precision in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his belief in walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods. His apartment, filled with zoning maps and architectural monographs, doubles as his office. His days are a disciplined routine: an espresso from a local cafe, hours of Zoom meetings debating setbacks and variances, and afternoon walks to observe the urban life he helps shape. He sees the city not just as a resident, but as a complex organism he is tasked with stewarding.\n\nDavid\u2019s social life is small but solid, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and old friends from grad school. They share a gallows humor about the city\u2019s bureaucracy but also a genuine belief in public service. His aspiration isn't a higher title, but legacy. He dreams of seeing the Central Subway fully integrated into the city\u2019s transit fabric and of championing a new model of affordable housing that actually gets built. He is a pragmatist, acutely aware of San Francisco's deep flaws, yet he remains driven by the quiet, enduring hope of leaving the city\u2019s blueprint just a little more equitable and resilient than he found it."
