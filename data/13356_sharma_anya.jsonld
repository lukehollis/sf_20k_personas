Born in Sacramento and adopted as an infant by a loving, academically focused Indian-American couple, she grew up in Fremont as the only fair-skinned, blonde child in her extended family. This loving dissonance\u2014belonging yet being visibly different\u2014sparked her early fascination with identity, family systems, and the unspoken narratives that shape a person. Her parents, both engineers, supported her curiosity, filling their home with books on every subject, though they were initially perplexed by her gravitation toward human sciences over hard sciences.\n\nHer path was solidified during her undergraduate years at UC Santa Cruz. While volunteering with a program for foster youth, she saw her own quiet questions about belonging mirrored in the children she mentored. This experience was the catalyst for pursuing a Psy.D. at The Wright Institute in Berkeley, where she specialized in adolescent psychology and trauma-informed care. After licensure, she deliberately chose a path away from lucrative private practice, accepting a role as a clinical psychologist for the San Francisco Unified School District. She felt a profound calling to support students navigating the complex social and emotional landscapes she knew so well.\n\nNow 30, Anya lives a life of intentionality in Hayes Valley. Her 0.7-mile walk to the student services building she works from is a cherished daily ritual, taking her past Patricia's Green and the bustling cafes where she sometimes grabs her morning coffee. Her day is a challenging mix of student sessions, teacher consultations, and crisis intervention, work that is emotionally taxing but deeply fulfilling. She de-stresses with evening yoga classes and long walks with her rescue dog, Buster, through Alamo Square.\n\nAnya\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school and work who share her values. After a long-term relationship ended last year, she is cautiously re-entering the dating world. Her deepest aspiration is to eventually open a small, specialized practice focused on identity formation in adopted and multicultural youth, creating the resource she wishes she\u2019d had. For now, she finds deep contentment in her work, her vibrant neighborhood, and the quiet satisfaction of building a life that truly aligns with the person she decided to become."

A grand-auntie, smelling of cardamom and kindness, gently touched her blonde hair and asked, \"But where are you *really* from, dear?\" Anya felt her mother\u2019s hand instantly find her back, a silent, steady comfort. It wasn't malice, just a question that echoed her own quiet dissonance. In that moment, she didn't feel hurt, but profoundly curious. It planted the seed of a lifelong mission to understand how love, not blood, truly defines a family.\n\n2.\nIt was a stuffy multipurpose room at UC Santa Cruz. She sat with a 10-year-old boy in foster care who had been silent for an hour. He finally looked up from his drawing and asked, \"Do you ever feel like you're a guest in your own life?\" The question struck her with the force of a bell ringing. It was *her* question, spoken aloud. In that instant of profound connection, her academic interest in psychology became a vocational fire. She knew she had to dedicate her life to children navigating that exact feeling.\n\n3.\nThe breakthrough came after six weeks of patient silence. The high school sophomore, referred for chronic truancy and aggression, slid a piece of paper across her desk. It was a detailed, delicate drawing of a bird trapped in a cage made of musical notes. It was the first time he had communicated anything. Looking at it, Anya felt not a rush of victory, but a wave of deep, affirming peace. This fragile, beautiful act of trust was why she had chosen this difficult path over a lucrative practice. This was the work.\n\n4.\nThe last conversation with her long-term partner happened on a bench at Patricia's Green. There was no shouting, only a shared, heartbreaking sadness. He wanted a life of upward mobility, a bigger house in the suburbs\u2014a path she couldn't walk. When she finally walked home alone, the key to her small apartment felt both incredibly heavy and purposefully light. The grief was immense, but it was edged with the clarifying strength of choosing to be fully, uncompromisingly herself, even if it meant being alone for a while.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, after a draining day, she was walking Buster through Alamo Square as the fog rolled in. The Painted Ladies were fading into the grey, and the city lights began to blur. Buster nudged his head against her hand, and Anya paused, breathing in the cool, damp air. She felt a simple, grounding contentment wash over her. This life\u2014this specific, intentional life she had painstakingly built\u2014was hers. It wasn't perfect, but it was real and deeply satisfying. She was exactly where she was supposed to be."
