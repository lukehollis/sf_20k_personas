Adopted as an infant from South Korea by two passionate community organizers, Nia grew up Black, Asian, and profoundly aware of the systems that shape society. Her last name was a legacy from her father, her sense of justice a gift from both parents. Weekends were spent not at the mall, but at neighborhood council meetings and food drives, experiences that planted the seeds of a future in public service.\n\nThis foundation led her to UC Berkeley, where she majored in sociology before pursuing a Master of Public Policy. It was during a graduate internship, mapping eviction patterns in the Bay Area, that her path crystallized. The cold data points represented families she recognized, stories she had heard her entire life. This turning point transformed her academic interest into a fierce, personal mission: to dismantle inequitable housing systems from the inside.\n\nNow 32, Nia is a Senior Policy Analyst for the city. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a meticulously organized desk in her Hayes Valley apartment, where she spends her days immersed in zoning codes, demographic data, and policy briefs. Her work is her anchor. Mornings are for deep focus, fueled by coffee from a local roaster. Afternoons are often broken up by a walk to Patricia's Green, a necessary reset from the intensity of her screen.\n\nHer social life is intentional. Having ended a long-term relationship just before moving across the bay, she relies on a small, tight-knit group of friends from grad school. They meet for wine nights or hikes in the Presidio, providing a crucial balance to her solitary work life. She visits her parents in Oakland every other Sunday, recharging in the familiar warmth of her childhood home.\n\nNia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is professional, but her love for it is growing. She sees the city not just as a place to live, but as a complex puzzle she is helping to solve. Her dream is to one day see her name on legislation that creates thousands of new affordable housing units. She is driven and deeply fulfilled by her work, yet quietly hopes that while building a better city for others, she can also build a more deeply connected personal life for herself within it."

A woman with tired eyes took a bag of groceries from her mother, then turned to Nia and said, \u201cThank you, sweetie. You\u2019re doing good work.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just a simple thank you; it was a transfer of weight, of gratitude. In that moment, Nia understood that \u201ccommunity\u201d wasn't a place, but an action. It was the first brick in her foundation.\n\n2.\nAt thirteen, a standardized test asked her to check only one box for race. Black? Asian? She stared at the bubbles, feeling split in two. That night, her mother held her hand and said, \u201cThey want you to choose, but you are a bridge. You don\u2019t fit in a box, and that's your power.\u201d The quiet defiance in her mother\u2019s voice became her own. It taught her to reject simple categories and see the complex, overlapping truths in people and policies, a perspective that would define her work.\n\n3.\nIt was 2 AM in the Berkeley library, age 24. A fluorescent-lit screen showed her eviction map of Alameda County. Suddenly, she froze. A dense, angry cluster of red dots wasn't just data\u2014it was three blocks from her childhood home. She could picture the houses, the families. The abstract numbers became a visceral gut punch, a wave of protective anger. Her academic interest died that night, replaced by a fierce, personal mission. She wasn't studying a problem anymore; she was fighting for her home.\n\n4.\nHer first month in San Francisco, overwhelmed by a dense zoning report, she fled her apartment. She walked to Patricia\u2019s Green, sinking onto a bench. The twisted, metal forms of the sculpture felt like the tangled policies in her head. But then she heard kids laughing and saw a dog chasing a ball. For the first time, the city felt less like a complex puzzle and more like a neighborhood. That small pocket of green became her sanctuary, a place to breathe and remember the humanity behind the data.\n\n5.\nJust last month, her friends were crammed into her apartment for a wine night. Laughter echoed off the walls as one friend recounted a disastrous date. Looking at their faces, illuminated by the city lights through her window, a profound warmth spread through Nia\u2019s chest. For years, her driving purpose had been building a better city for others. In that moment, surrounded by her chosen family, she felt a quiet, hopeful spark: she was finally, slowly, building a home in it for herself."
