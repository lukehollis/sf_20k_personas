Born on a naval base in Rota, Spain, to a career Navy father and a civilian mother, his childhood was a peripatetic blur of new schools and temporary homes. He learned to pack a life into two suitcases and say goodbye without attachment. His father\u2019s long deployments left a quiet void, filled by his mother\u2019s own unaddressed struggles with depression. David became an expert at reading emotional undercurrents, a silent observer navigating his family\u2019s unspoken anxieties. This rootless upbringing fostered in him a deep-seated need for stability he wouldn't recognize until much later.\n\nAfter high school, David drifted. He worked as a bartender in New Orleans, a bike messenger in Portland, and a roadie for a struggling band. He was searching for a sense of place but found only fleeting connections. The turning point came at 28, during a particularly isolating winter in Chicago. Staring out at a frozen Lake Michigan, he saw a reflection of his own emotional landscape\u2014vast, cold, and disconnected. He realized he was replicating the very emotional avoidance he\u2019d witnessed growing up. This stark recognition was the catalyst he needed.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a city for reinvention, and enrolled at City College before transferring to SF State. It was there he discovered social work, a field where his innate empathy and observer\u2019s intuition became professional tools. He earned his Master of Social Work, focusing on trauma and family systems.\n\nNow 44, David runs a private teletherapy practice from his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute gives his days a gentle rhythm. Mornings begin with a run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear his mind before a day of holding space for others' pain. His clients, logged in via video, bring the world\u2019s chaos to his serene office. He is a steadfast presence for them, a role he cherishes. His social life is small but deep, centered around his partner, Clara, a landscape architect, and a few close friends. His hope is not for wealth or recognition, but to a create a small, in-person men\u2019s support group in his neighborhood\u2014a way to foster the very community and rootedness he spent a lifetime searching for. David finally found his anchor, not in a place, but in a purpose."
