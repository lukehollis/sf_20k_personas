Born on a naval base in Rota, Spain, to a career Navy father and a civilian mother, his childhood was a peripatetic blur of new schools and temporary homes. He learned to pack a life into two suitcases and say goodbye without attachment. His father\u2019s long deployments left a quiet void, filled by his mother\u2019s own unaddressed struggles with depression. David became an expert at reading emotional undercurrents, a silent observer navigating his family\u2019s unspoken anxieties. This rootless upbringing fostered in him a deep-seated need for stability he wouldn't recognize until much later.\n\nAfter high school, David drifted. He worked as a bartender in New Orleans, a bike messenger in Portland, and a roadie for a struggling band. He was searching for a sense of place but found only fleeting connections. The turning point came at 28, during a particularly isolating winter in Chicago. Staring out at a frozen Lake Michigan, he saw a reflection of his own emotional landscape\u2014vast, cold, and disconnected. He realized he was replicating the very emotional avoidance he\u2019d witnessed growing up. This stark recognition was the catalyst he needed.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a city for reinvention, and enrolled at City College before transferring to SF State. It was there he discovered social work, a field where his innate empathy and observer\u2019s intuition became professional tools. He earned his Master of Social Work, focusing on trauma and family systems.\n\nNow 44, David runs a private teletherapy practice from his quiet apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute gives his days a gentle rhythm. Mornings begin with a run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear his mind before a day of holding space for others' pain. His clients, logged in via video, bring the world\u2019s chaos to his serene office. He is a steadfast presence for them, a role he cherishes. His social life is small but deep, centered around his partner, Clara, a landscape architect, and a few close friends. His hope is not for wealth or recognition, but to a create a small, in-person men\u2019s support group in his neighborhood\u2014a way to foster the very community and rootedness he spent a lifetime searching for. David finally found his anchor, not in a place, but in a purpose."

            "value": "1.\nAt nine, packing was a ritual. He remembers seeing his own tidy pile of clothes next to his father's precise military folds. But what he truly remembers is looking up and seeing his mother in the doorway, her gaze lost somewhere over his shoulder. In that silence, he felt the weight of her unspoken sadness and learned a profound lesson: the heaviest things in a home are the ones you can't pack. It was his first, instinctual act of emotional observation, a skill he would later professionalize.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the 3 a.m. quiet of a New Orleans bar after the last tourists stumbled out. The air, thick with stale beer and faint perfume, felt lonelier than silence. Wiping down the sticky bar top, he\u2019d listened to so many stories that night but shared none of his own. He was a ghost in other people\u2019s lives, a temporary fixture. This hollow feeling of being surrounded but unseen sharpened his hunger for genuine connection, a place where he wasn\u2019t just a passing character.\n\n3.\nThe wind off Lake Michigan cut through his coat, but the cold he felt was internal. Staring at the endless, frozen expanse at 28, he saw not water, but a perfect mirror of his own life: vast, static, and profoundly disconnected. He wasn't just observing his family's emotional avoidance anymore; he was living it, perfectly. That brutal clarity was a shock to his system. It wasn't a choice to change so much as an admission that he couldn't survive another winter like this, internally or externally.\n\n4.\nHe was 32, sitting in a stuffy lecture hall at SF State, when a professor diagrammed a family system on the board. The arrows of communication\u2014and non-communication\u2014looked exactly like the silent tensions in his childhood home. For the first time, the quiet anxieties and unspoken rules of his past had a name and a structure. It felt less like learning something new and more like being handed a map to a land he had always inhabited. In that moment, his life\u2019s biggest wound began to feel like a potential strength.\n\n5.\nLast autumn, he watched Clara, his partner, kneeling in a bed at the SF Botanical Garden, her hands deep in the soil as she mapped out a new planting. The late afternoon sun lit the dust motes around her. There was no grand declaration, just a quiet, profound realization. Her patient, deliberate connection to the earth was everything he had ever craved. He had spent his life packing suitcases, and here was someone expertly putting down roots. He felt, finally and completely, at home."
