Born in Fremont to parents who had emigrated from Shanghai, he was raised on a steady diet of high expectations and the scent of the silicon chip factories that dotted the landscape. His parents, an engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a straightforward path for him: Berkeley, a practical degree, and a stable, high-earning career. Michael obliged with Berkeley but diverged on the degree, choosing History, drawn more to the narratives of the past than the logic of code.\n\nHe graduated in the early 2000s, directly into the smoking crater of the dot-com bust. His \"impractical\" degree felt like a liability. Needing work, he took a technical support job at a small software firm, a humbling start he never mentioned to his parents. It was there, however, that he found his calling. He had a unique talent for translating the esoteric world of developers to frustrated clients and back again. He wasn't the builder; he was the bridge. This skill propelled him upward, from support to QA, and eventually to Project Manager, a role where his ability to craft a coherent story out of chaos was invaluable.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce five years ago. The split was amicable but gutting, leaving his meticulously planned life feeling suddenly empty. It coincided with his company\u2019s shift to permanent remote work. Now, his world is his two-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute has blurred the lines between work and life. His days are a disciplined routine: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, eight hours of managing timelines and personalities over Slack and Zoom, and an evening run in Golden Gate Park to decompress.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful\u2014a weekly dim sum with his sister\u2019s family and a handful of old friends from his Berkeley days. Michael\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about the frenetic tech scene and more about the fog rolling over the park and the quiet hum of his neighborhood. He dreams not of launching a startup, but of taking a three-month sabbatical to finally trace his family\u2019s history in China, a personal project long overdue. He hopes to one day manage a life, not just projects."
