Raised by a practical-minded city planner father and a high school teacher mother, his upbringing was one of stability, public schools, and a clear expectation to be self-sufficient. Drawn by the magnetic pull of the first dot-com boom, he moved to the Bay Area for college, earning an economics degree from UC Davis while dreaming of the burgeoning digital world just across the bridge.\n\nHis first foray into tech was a trial by fire. He joined a promising startup in 1999, only to see it evaporate in the 2001 crash. This failure became his most crucial turning point. Humbled and seeking a more strategic foundation, he enrolled at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. The MBA was his reset button, transforming him from a wide-eyed dot-com hopeful into a calculated business leader. His career since has been a steady, methodical climb through the ranks of established tech firms, culminating in his current role as a Director of Product Management, where he guides teams with a calm authority born from experience.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is one of structured comfort. He lives in a meticulously kept condo in NoPa, a neighborhood he chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its vibrant, yet mature, atmosphere. His days begin with a 6 AM run through the Panhandle, followed by coffee from a local cafe before catching the 7:45 AM company shuttle for the short ride to his SOMA office. An amicable divorce five years ago, a mutual decision after he and his ex-wife grew into different people, has left him single. His social life consists of a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other industry veterans, with whom he shares dinners and weekend trips to wine country.\n\nHe\u2019s seen San Francisco transform and feels a complex connection to it\u2014he\u2019s both a beneficiary and a contributor to the changes he sometimes laments. His future aspirations have shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to achieving more balance. He finds deep satisfaction in mentoring younger product managers but secretly dreams of one day cashing out and opening a small, unpretentious wine bar in Sonoma, leaving the world of product roadmaps and quarterly earnings behind for good."

The once-vibrant space, with its now-mocking foosball table, was a monument to their collective na\u00efvet\u00e9. The humiliation felt cold and sharp. Walking away that afternoon, he wasn't just leaving a failed startup; he was leaving behind a version of himself. It was the day he swapped blind enthusiasm for deliberate strategy, a lesson that would define his entire career.\n\n2.\nHe was at a Peet\u2019s Coffee in late 2002, compulsively refreshing his email on a clunky laptop. When the subject line \"Congratulations from Berkeley Haas\" appeared, his breath caught. It wasn't just an acceptance letter; it was an anchor. After feeling adrift post-crash, this was proof he could rebuild\u2014this time with a blueprint. That single email represented his second chance, a formal invitation to become the measured, pragmatic man he needed to be.\n\n3.\nThe end of his marriage wasn\u2019t a fight, but a quiet conversation on their NoPa sofa five years ago. They were looking at plans for a kitchen remodel, and he realized they were designing a future for two people who no longer existed. The admission came out without anger, just a deep, shared sadness. Acknowledging the end felt less like a failure and more like respectfully closing a chapter. It taught him that some things, even good things, simply reach their natural conclusion.\n\n4.\nDuring a run through the Panhandle last fall, he saw an old, peeling mural of the \"Summer of Love\" just blocks from a new, glass-walled luxury apartment building. In that single view, he saw the city he\u2019d romanticized and the one he\u2019d helped create. A sharp pang of guilt mixed with a fierce, protective love for the place hit him. He was both the beneficiary and the cause of the change, a contradiction that defined his bittersweet, two-decade relationship with San Francisco.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, on a dusty patio at a small Sonoma winery, the owner, a man with wine-stained hands, explained the simple challenges of his day. There were no quarterly reviews or product roadmaps, just soil, sun, and grapes. David held a glass of Zinfandel, the afternoon light warming his face, and felt a profound sense of peace he never found in a boardroom. The thought landed then: this felt more like success than anything his tech career could offer."
