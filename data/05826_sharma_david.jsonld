Born in Daly City to Indian immigrants who ran a small grocery store, David\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the values of diligence and pragmatism. His parents, having left Delhi for a life of grueling work, saw success not in grand ambition but in steady, reliable security. David internalized this, showing more aptitude for careful process than for abstract academics.\n\nWhile friends chased degrees at Berkeley or Stanford, David found his calling at City College of San Francisco. He was fascinated by the unseen world under a microscope, the precise mechanics of biology. An Associate\u2019s degree in Medical Laboratory Technology felt like a perfect fit\u2014a tangible skill for a vital industry. He landed an entry-level position at UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus in his early twenties and never left. For thirty years, he has been a constant presence in the humming, sterile labs, working his way up to Senior Technician through sheer competence and reliability.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce fifteen years ago. His ex-wife, an ambitious marketing executive, found his quiet, routine-driven life stifling. The separation was amicable but left David more insular. He sold their larger home in the Richmond District and moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, just blocks from the hospital. The 0.0-mile commute became the foundation of his new life.\n\nDavid\u2019s daily routine is a comforting ritual. He walks to work through the morning fog, a familiar chill on his face. His day is a sequence of precise actions: analyzing blood counts, preparing tissue samples, and calibrating machines that others take for granted. He is a vital, if unseen, cog in the great machine of healing. Socially, his connections are warm but shallow; he shares polite conversations with colleagues and knows the baristas at his local coffee shop by name.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. He is an Inner Sunset man, his life mapped by walks in Golden Gate Park and grocery runs on Irving Street. He holds a quiet dream of one day visiting the Himalayas, to see the mountains his parents described. But for now, he finds purpose in the microscopic landscapes on his glass slides, knowing each sample he processes is a story, a question, a potential answer for someone whose life depends on his careful, steady hands."
