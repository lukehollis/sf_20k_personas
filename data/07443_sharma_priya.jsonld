Her commute is zero miles; her office is a sunlit room overlooking a garden where she manages the complex circulatory system of San Francisco. The daughter of immigrants from Delhi who settled in Hayward, Priya\u2019s passion for transportation was born from frustration. She vividly remembers chilly mornings spent waiting for an unreliable AC Transit bus, a daily gamble that determined whether her father made his factory shift on time. That childhood experience planted a seed: a conviction that mobility was a lifeline, a matter of equity.\n\nThis conviction drove her east for a Master's in Urban Planning, where she studied the anatomy of great cities. She returned to the Bay Area in the late 90s, taking a junior analyst position with the city. She was there for the dot-com boom\u2019s strain on MUNI, the rise of ride-sharing, the fierce battles over bike lanes, and the existential crisis of post-pandemic public transit. Over three decades, Priya didn\u2019t just witness the city\u2019s evolution; she helped chart its course, rising to Transportation Planning Manager through a combination of data-driven pragmatism and a deep-seated empathy for the daily traveler.\n\nNow 54, her life has found a comfortable rhythm. With her two children grown and forging their own paths, the house she shares with her husband, an architect, is quieter. Her work-from-home routine allows for long walks in Golden Gate Park and dinners with a close-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow policy wonks and artists. A key turning point was an anniversary trip to Tokyo, where the sublime efficiency of the rail system reignited her professional fire. Priya\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing the career ladder but about leaving a tangible legacy. She hopes to see at least one of her major projects\u2014a more accessible and streamlined bus network for the city\u2019s underserved southeastern neighborhoods\u2014fully realized before she retires, finally putting the ghost of that unreliable bus from her childhood to rest."
