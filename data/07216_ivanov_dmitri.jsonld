His commute is a simple walk down a flight of creaky stairs from his small apartment to the bustling Italian restaurant he manages. He arrived in San Francisco from St. Petersburg as a teenager, a quiet boy overwhelmed by the city\u2019s cacophony. His parents, a seamstress and a cab driver, settled in the Richmond District and pushed him towards a stable future, enrolling him in a business program at San Francisco State University.\n\nDmitri lasted three semesters. He found no passion in spreadsheets and marketing theory. The real education was happening during his nights and weekends, working as a busboy at \u201cVesuvio\u2019s Trattoria.\u201d He gravitated toward the controlled chaos of the kitchen, the rhythm of service, and the familial bond of the staff. The turning point came when he dropped out of college to accept a full-time server position, a decision that strained his relationship with his parents but felt like the first truly authentic choice he had ever made.\n\nOver two decades, Dmitri worked his way up\u2014from server to bartender, then to assistant manager, and finally to the manager who now holds the keys. His life is woven into the restaurant\u2019s fabric. His social circle consists of his loyal staff, the produce vendor he greets at 7 a.m., and the neighborhood regulars who have watched him grow up. Past romantic relationships have fizzled, unable to compete with the 80-hour workweeks and his unwavering dedication.\n\nNow 42, Dmitri\u2019s routine is set. He wakes to the sounds of delivery trucks, shares an espresso with the chef while reviewing inventory, and ends his night long after the last customer has left, sharing a quiet drink at the bar with his closing bartender. His dream is no longer just to run the restaurant, but to own it. The current owner is nearing retirement, and Dmitri is meticulously saving every dollar, hoping to one day put his own name\u2014Ivanov\u2014on the establishment that gave him not just a career, but a home and an identity in the city that once felt so alien."
