Raised in a quiet, leafy suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school principal father and a librarian mother, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and steeped in the value of knowledge for its own sake. This led him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in History, a subject he loved for its grand narratives and complex human dramas. His parents were supportive, if quietly concerned about his job prospects.\n\nUpon graduating, their concerns seemed prescient. The academic path felt isolating, so David followed a friend to San Francisco, lured by the energy of the tech boom. He landed a scrappy customer support job at a small startup, a world away from his studies. Yet, it was here his History degree proved its unlikely worth. He excelled at understanding user problems as narratives, documenting processes with clarity, and organizing chaotic information into coherent systems. His knack for seeing the \"big picture\" of a project's lifecycle got him noticed, leading to a promotion, and eventually, his current role as a Project Coordinator.\n\nNow 35, David\u2019s life is contained within a few city blocks. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bed to a standing desk in the corner of his Hayes Valley apartment. His days are a blur of Slack notifications, video calls, and digital Gantt charts, coordinating teams scattered across time zones. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal: the baristas at his corner coffee shop know his order, he plays pickup basketball at the nearby park, and he relies on a small, tight-knit group of friends, remnants from his early, less-structured years in the city.\n\nDespite his professional success, David feels a persistent sense of being slightly out of place. He\u2019s proficient in the language of sprints and deliverables, but he\u2019s not passionate about it. His dream isn't to climb the corporate ladder but to reconnect with his original passion. He spends his evenings reading historical non-fiction and fantasizes about using his project management skills for a museum or a historical preservation society\u2014a future where he isn't just coordinating a product launch, but helping to shepherd a piece of the past."
