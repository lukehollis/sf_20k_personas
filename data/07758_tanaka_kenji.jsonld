He was born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, the only child of a precise landscape gardener and a patient seamstress. From them, he inherited an appreciation for form, patience, and the silent dignity of craftsmanship. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a stable profession, Kenji was drawn to the stories objects tell. He pursued a Master's degree in Curatorial Studies at SF State, nurturing a passion for provenance and aesthetics over profit.\n\nHis early career began as he\u2019d dreamed, as a junior curator at the de Young Museum. He loved the work but grew disillusioned by the slow pace and academic politics. The turning point came during a museum gala. While explaining the history of a Faberg\u00e9 egg to a donor, Kenji\u2019s passion caught the attention of a senior executive from a Swiss luxury brand. Impressed by Kenji's ability to sell not just an object but its soul, the executive offered him a position. Kenji traded the hushed halls of the museum for the polished marble of high-end retail, finding he could apply his curatorial eye to a world of haute horlogerie and bespoke leather.\n\nToday, at 42, Kenji is the Regional Manager for the brand\u2019s West Coast operations. His 0.0-mile commute is an elevator ride from his minimalist apartment on the 35th floor of a Yerba Buena high-rise down to the regional office in the same building. His life is one of controlled elegance: morning workouts in the building\u2019s gym, days spent analyzing sales data and visiting flagship stores, and evenings hosting dinner for valuable clients.\n\nHis social circle is small, comprised mostly of professional contacts. He is respected and successful, yet a subtle loneliness permeates his panoramic city views. Kenji is a native San Franciscan who barely touches its streets anymore, viewing the city he grew up in as a beautiful, distant landscape. His deepest aspiration is no longer to climb higher in the corporate world, but to one day open a small, independent gallery in a neighborhood like Hayes Valley\u2014a space where he can curate objects based purely on their beauty and story, reconnecting with the passion that started his journey, free from the demands of a price tag."
