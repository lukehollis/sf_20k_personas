Born in the Sunset District to a Danish-American architect father and a pragmatic mother who immigrated from Hong Kong, her childhood was a blend of foggy ocean air and the aroma of her mother's cooking. Her father instilled in her a love for form and aesthetics, while her mother taught her the value of a balanced ledger and a strong work ethic. This duality would come to define her entire life.\n\nShe pursued her father\u2019s passion, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History from SF State. Her dream was to become a museum curator, to spend her days among masterpieces. But life intervened. In her mid-twenties, her mother fell seriously ill, and Mei made a quiet pact with practicality. She took a retail job at a high-end home goods boutique in Hayes Valley to stay close to home and ensure a steady income. The job, meant to be temporary, became her world.\n\nThe key turning point was when the store\u2019s original owner, seeing Mei\u2019s innate talent for display and her quiet efficiency, offered her the Store Manager position and the keys to the small apartment upstairs. For fifteen years, this has been her reality. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a creaking wooden staircase into \u201cThe Gilded Finch,\u201d her curated world of artisanal ceramics, imported linens, and handcrafted jewelry. Her Art History degree isn't gathering dust; she uses it every day to tell stories with objects, turning the shop into a gallery of beautiful, useful things.\n\nMei\u2019s life is contained but not small. She has a close circle of friends, mostly other local shop owners, with whom she shares wine and worries after closing. Her deepest connection is to her neighborhood\u2014she\u2019s a fixture, greeting regulars by name and watching the city evolve from her storefront window. Her quiet dream is to one day buy The Gilded Finch from its now-aging owner, finally merging her father\u2019s aesthetic sensibilities with her mother\u2019s hard-won pragmatism. Until then, she remains the steadfast heart of her small corner of the city, a curator of a life she didn\u2019t plan but has learned to deeply cherish."
