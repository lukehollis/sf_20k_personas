The son of immigrants from Guangzhou, he was born and raised in the Sunset District, where the fog felt like a constant, quiet companion. His father, a line cook, and his mother, a garment factory seamstress, instilled in him a profound respect for tangible work and unwavering reliability. While his friends chased tech dreams across the Bay, Brandon was drawn to the physical world of how things were made. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Industrial Technology, finding more satisfaction in the logic of machinery than in abstract theories.\n\nHe started on the production line at a legacy food packaging plant in the Dogpatch over 25 years ago. Young and diligent, Brandon learned every machine, every process, and every person's role. His turning point came twelve years into his career when the aging owner, preparing for retirement, offered him the position of Production Line Supervisor. The offer included a unique perk: residence in the small, second-floor caretaker's apartment above the factory floor. For Brandon, who valued stability above all else, it was an irresistible proposition. He accepted, and his commute became a single flight of stairs.\n\nNow 48, Brandon\u2019s life is governed by the rhythm of the factory. He wakes to the low hum of the conveyor belts warming up and ends his day with the scent of cardboard and machine oil lingering in the air. His work is his life, a fact that contributed to a brief, amicable divorce years ago; he simply couldn't separate himself from the facility. His crew is his de facto family; he knows their children\u2019s names and their weekend plans. His social life is modest, consisting of weekly dim sum with his elderly parents and a quiet beer at a nearby pub where he\u2019s a familiar, stoic presence.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not one of glittering skylines but of its working-class soul. He watches the neighborhood gentrify around his industrial island, seeing luxury condos replace old warehouses. Brandon\u2019s quietest hope is simply for the factory to endure, to outlast the relentless push of development. He dreams of one day retiring and buying a small, quiet condo in Daly City, where he can finally learn what it feels like to lock a door behind him and leave work for the day."
