The only son of Vietnamese refugees who settled in San Jose in the early 1980s, David grew up surrounded by stories of loss and resilience. His parents, who ran a small electronics repair shop, instilled in him a deep respect for tangible history\u2014faded photographs, brittle letters, and the physical objects they\u2019d managed to carry to a new world. While he excelled in the burgeoning tech scene of his Silicon Valley childhood, he felt a stronger pull toward the stories behind the objects his parents cherished.\n\nHis path became clear during an undergraduate internship at UC Davis\u2019s special collections library. He discovered the nascent field of digital humanities and realized he could unite his tech-savvy nature with his passion for preservation. This led him to pursue a Master of Library and Information Science, specializing in digital archiving. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted role at a prominent San Francisco arts foundation, leaving the South Bay suburbs for a life in the city he had always admired from afar.\n\nA key turning point was the pandemic, which accelerated his institution's move toward digital access. David became indispensable, leading the charge to digitize vast collections and make them accessible to a global audience locked indoors. His success solidified his position as Digital Collections Manager and made his role permanently remote, erasing his commute entirely.\n\nNow 37, David lives in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are structured but peaceful. A morning walk through Golden Gate Park is followed by hours spent managing metadata, overseeing digitization projects, and corresponding with researchers from around the world, all from his standing desk. His social life is a small, close-knit circle of friends who share his appreciation for board games, film photography, and exploring the city\u2019s lesser-known museums. His connection to San Francisco is less about its bustling nightlife and more about its cultural soul, which he works to preserve every day. His deepest aspiration is to spearhead a major project documenting the Bay Area's Southeast Asian refugee experience, a digital archive that would honor his parents' journey and ensure that stories like theirs are never lost."
