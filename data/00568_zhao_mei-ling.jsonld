They had immigrated from Guangzhou, instilling in their daughter a profound sense of diligence and a quiet appreciation for the city\u2019s intricate systems. Growing up, Mei-ling didn\u2019t see traffic; she saw patterns. The N-Judah streetcar wasn\u2019t just a ride; it was the city\u2019s circulatory system, pulsing with life, often inefficiently. This fascination led her to UC Berkeley, where she earned a Master's in Urban Planning, determined to untangle the knots of her hometown.\n\nHer career started predictably at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). For over a decade, she analyzed traffic flows and planned bus routes, finding satisfaction in small, tangible public service victories. The turning point came at age 38. A burgeoning autonomous vehicle company, impressed by her deep knowledge of the city\u2019s infrastructure, offered her a position. She agonized over the decision, ultimately swapping the stability of public service for the volatile promise of technological innovation.\n\nNow 46 and single after a long-term relationship ended around the time of her career change, Mei-ling lives a life of digital precision. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to the standing desk in her sleek Hayes Valley condo. Her days are spent not on streets, but in simulations, designing the logic for fleets of self-driving cars and delivery bots. She is shaping the future of the very streets she once rode on her bike as a child.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is layered. She visits her aging parents in the Sunset every Sunday, the trip a stark reminder of the city\u2019s changing character. Her social circle consists of a few close friends\u2014a mix of old SFMTA colleagues and new tech peers. Mei-ling\u2019s core aspiration is to ensure the frictionless future she designs doesn't leave behind the San Francisco of her parents. She dreams of a city where technology serves not just the affluent downtown core, but also the grocers, families, and elders in the foggy outer neighborhoods she will always call home."
