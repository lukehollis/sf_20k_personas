The son of South Korean immigrants who ran a small, perpetually steaming dry-cleaning business in Daly City, David grew up understanding that security was paramount. While his parents ironed shirts, he lost himself in library books about Roman legions and dynastic China, a passion that felt like a secret luxury.\n\nHe indulged this passion by earning a history degree from UC Berkeley, but the reality of his parents\u2019 weary faces and his own desire for a life free from financial precarity steered him toward a more practical path. This was his first major turning point: shelving his love for the past to secure his future. He enrolled in an MBA program, swapping historical narratives for financial models. He excelled, his mind for detail finding a new, lucrative application in the world of finance.\n\nNow 43, David is a successful financial analyst. His career has afforded him a life his parents could only dream of: a sleek, minimalist apartment in Russian Hill with a commanding view of Alcatraz and the bay. His commute is a ten-step walk from his espresso machine to the dual monitors in his home office. His days are a disciplined rhythm of market analysis, client calls, and complex spreadsheets. He has achieved the stability he craved.\n\nHis social life is similarly curated. It consists of a tight-knit group of friends from his MBA cohort and his younger sister, a graphic designer in Oakland. Relationships have been a casualty of his focused ambition; a serious partnership ended in his late thirties when his partner tired of competing with his career.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is often through the pristine glass of his apartment window. He appreciates its beauty from a comfortable distance, his main engagement being his evening runs along the Marina. Lately, a quiet yearning has surfaced. He uses his evenings not just for running, but for reading the history books he once abandoned. His ultimate dream is not to escape his life, but to merge his two worlds: to become successful enough to fund historical documentaries or archaeological digs, finally using the language of finance to give voice to the stories of the past."
