A third-generation resident, he grew up in the Outer Richmond, the only child of parents who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Clement Street. His childhood was a symphony of beeping scanners, the crisp snap of produce boxes, and his parents\u2019 gentle admonitions in Cantonese to study something useful, like engineering or business. But Liam found his true language not in numbers, but in the quiet, expansive halls of the de Young Museum, where school trips offered a dazzling escape into color, form, and history.\n\nThis quiet rebellion defined his educational path. Against his parents\u2019 well-meaning advice, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, pursuing a degree in Art History. He fell in love with the theory behind the canvas, the socio-political currents that shaped artistic movements. Graduation, however, brought the harsh reality of an arts degree in an expensive city. After months of searching, he landed a coveted gallery assistant position at \"Cerulean Contemporary,\" a chic, minimalist gallery in Hayes Valley.\n\nThe job came with a unique arrangement that solved his biggest problem: a 0.0-mile commute. He lives in a small studio apartment directly above the gallery, a deal that makes his low wages viable. This blessing is also his cage. Liam\u2019s days are a blur of handling priceless art, managing inventory, speaking with aloof collectors, and sweeping the polished concrete floors after closing. His life is confined to a few city blocks, a stark contrast to the sprawling city of his youth.\n\nHis social life consists of late-night drinks with a small circle of fellow arts and humanities graduates, where they collectively bemoan their rent and dream of creative breakthroughs. Liam's personal aspiration is to become a curator. He spends his precious free time in his small apartment, devouring art theory and scouting emerging artists online, hoping to one day shape the conversations he currently only facilitates. He feels the weight of his family\u2019s practical legacy, yet he is driven by the belief that contributing to the city\u2019s cultural soul is a worthy inheritance of its own."
