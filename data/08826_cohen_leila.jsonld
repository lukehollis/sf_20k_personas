Raised by a pragmatic lawyer father and a passionate high school history teacher mother, her upbringing was a stable blend of intellectual curiosity and fiscal responsibility. She was encouraged to follow her interests, as long as they led to a viable career. At Tufts University, she found her calling not in a traditional field, but in Urban Studies, fascinated by the invisible systems\u2014transit, housing, public space\u2014that governed city life. Her bachelor's degree explored how cities breathe and evolve.\n\nAfter graduation, Leila discovered the planning jobs she envisioned were mired in bureaucracy. The real, fast-paced evolution of cities was happening in tech. This was her pivotal realization. Seeing companies like Uber and Lyft fundamentally reshaping urban mobility, she taught herself data analysis and SQL, pivoting from theoretical planning to practical application. A San Francisco tech firm, impressed by her unique blend of social science understanding and analytical skill, hired her as a Transportation Operations Analyst.\n\nNow 32, Leila\u2019s world is largely contained within her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, the source of her 0.0-mile commute. Her days are a disciplined rhythm of coffee from a corner cafe on Clement Street, deep dives into datasets to optimize delivery routes, and midday walks through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park to clear her head. Living and working in the same space has made her deeply connected to her neighborhood; she knows the grocers by name and has strong opinions on the best local dim sum.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit circle\u2014a mix of fellow East Coast transplants and work friends\u2014with whom she unwinds through weekend hikes in Marin or exploring the city's vibrant restaurant scene. Though her work is intellectually stimulating, Leila hopes to eventually lead projects focused on public good, using technology to create more equitable and sustainable transportation systems, not just more efficient ones. She dreams of feeling truly rooted in San Francisco, a city whose chaotic energy and progressive spirit she loves, and perhaps one day, finding a life here that extends beyond the glow of her laptop screen."
