Adopted from South Korea as an infant by a loving, white middle-class couple, he grew up in the quiet suburbs of Walnut Creek. His parents, the Millers, provided a stable, supportive home, but Joshua always felt a subtle sense of being out of sync, a feeling he couldn't articulate amidst the backdrop of manicured lawns and homogenous culture.\n\nPressured by a well-meaning desire for him to have a secure future, his parents encouraged him to study computer science. Joshua enrolled at UC Davis, but the abstract world of coding felt as foreign as the heritage he knew nothing about. Overwhelmed and disconnected, he flunked two semesters before quietly dropping out, a decision that created a rift with his disappointed parents. He fled to San Francisco, seeking the anonymity of a large city.\n\nHis turning point came not in a tech office, but in front of a colorful, hand-painted \"Assistant Wanted\" sign at the Little Sprouts Preschool in the Inner Richmond. He took the job out of desperation, but found an unexpected calling in the chaotic, honest world of four-year-olds. The children didn't care about his grades or his future prospects; they cared about whether he could tie a shoe, reach the blue crayon, or make a convincing dinosaur roar. For the first time, Joshua felt fundamentally competent and needed.\n\nNow 33, Joshua\u2019s life is defined by a deliberate smallness. He lives in a small in-law unit attached to the preschool, making his commute a simple walk through a garden gate. His days are a whirlwind of circle time, art projects, and playground diplomacy. His social life is woven into his community; he\u2019s on a first-name basis with the parents of his students and the vendors at the Clement Street Farmers' Market. His closest friend is the school\u2019s lead teacher, a woman in her fifties who encourages his gentle rapport with the kids.\n\nJoshua\u2019s dream is no longer about fulfilling someone else's expectations. He\u2019s slowly taking online courses toward an early childhood education credential, aspiring to one day become a lead teacher himself. He hopes to finally visit South Korea, not to find his birth parents, but to connect with a piece of himself he is finally ready to understand."
