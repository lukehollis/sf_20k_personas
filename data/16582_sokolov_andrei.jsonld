His family arrived in the early 90s, leaving a collapsing Soviet Union for a Bay Area shimmering with promise. His parents, an engineer and a teacher, found their credentials meant little; they cleaned offices and drove taxis to provide for Andrei and his younger sister. Andrei, a quiet and perceptive child, quickly became the family\u2019s primary translator and cultural navigator, witnessing firsthand the systemic barriers that thwarted his parents\u2019 ambitions.\n\nThis early responsibility shaped his path. While his parents pushed for a lucrative career in tech or finance, Andrei was drawn to the human element of struggle. During his undergraduate years at SF State, he volunteered at a youth center in the Mission District, which solidified his calling. He saw reflections of his own family\u2019s journey in the faces of new immigrant teens. He pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, focusing on adolescent mental health.\n\nNow, as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a diverse public high school, Andrei is the calm, steady presence he wished he\u2019d had. His key turning point was helping a young Ukrainian refugee navigate the trauma of displacement and the complexities of the American school system\u2014a moment that felt like closing a circle that began with his own arrival.\n\nAndrei\u2019s life is woven into the city\u2019s fabric. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, surrounded by the familiar sounds and smells of Russian bakeries. His daily routine is anchored by the 38 Geary Muni bus, which carries him to and from work. He de-stresses with long walks through Golden Gate Park or meets his partner, a landscape architect named Ben, for dinner in their neighborhood. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow public service workers who share his commitment and dark humor.\n\nAndrei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but impact. He hopes to one day establish a small non-profit providing mentorship and mental health resources for first-generation students. He wants to remain a fixture in the city that raised him\u2014a testament to the idea that helping others build a life is the most profound way to honor the one you were given."

His mother, her face tight with anxiety, pointed to a box on the form. Andrei had to translate the cold, bureaucratic English, \u201cCountry of Origin,\u201d knowing the answer, \u201cUSSR,\u201d was already a ghost. He felt the weight of their future settle on his small shoulders. It was the first time he understood his role: to be the bridge, to carry the words his parents could not.\n\n2.\nDuring his sophomore year at SF State, he sat with a new student at the Mission youth center, a silent girl from El Salvador who hadn't spoken in weeks. He didn't push. He just drew pictures with her. One rainy afternoon, she picked up a crayon and wrote one word under a drawing of a house: *Abuela*. Andrei felt a jolt of pure recognition, a profound click of purpose. In that moment, he knew he wouldn't be a programmer; he would work with kids like her.\n\n3.\nIt was the first date with Ben. They were walking near Stow Lake as the fog rolled in, dampening the sound. Ben, a landscape architect, stopped and gently touched a fern, explaining how it thrived in the shade and damp. Andrei felt a profound sense of calm, of being understood without having to explain his own story of growing up in the city\u2019s shadows. He saw in Ben a man who, like him, appreciated the beauty in resilience. It was the moment he knew he was home.\n\n4.\nHe can still picture the Ukrainian boy, Luka, who he\u2019d been counseling for months. The teenager had been withdrawn, his trauma a silent wall. One day, Luka wordlessly unlocked his phone and showed Andrei a photo of a simple two-story apartment building on a leafy street. \u201cMy home,\u201d he whispered in broken English. In that instant, Andrei saw his own six-year-old self, lost and terrified. Helping Luka find his voice felt like finally comforting the boy he used to be, closing a circle thirty years in the making.\n\n5.\nRiding the 38 Geary home after a grueling day, he\u2019ll often look out the window as it rumbles down the boulevard. He sees the Russian grandmothers with their shopping bags, the tech workers staring into phones, the restaurant staff heading to their shifts. A quiet, fierce love for this cross-section of the city washes over him. This bus, with its mundane, everyday rhythm, is his lifeline. It reminds him exactly who he is fighting for and why he would never dream of leaving."
