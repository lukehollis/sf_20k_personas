The 0.0-mile commute affords him a sense of integrated calm he never knew growing up. Born and raised in the shadow of Akron\u2019s defunct tire factories, David\u2019s upbringing was pragmatic and blue-collar. His father was a mechanic, his mother a waitress, and the expectation was for David to learn a trade and earn a steady living. He followed that path without question, becoming a skilled carpenter by his early twenties, his identity shaped by the grain of wood and the satisfaction of building something tangible.\n\nThe turning point came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow, agonizing unraveling. His younger sister became ensnared in opioid addiction, a crisis that left his practical, problem-solving family feeling utterly helpless. For years, David tried to fix her life the way he\u2019d fix a warped joist\u2014with force, logic, and sheer will. It never worked. Witnessing her struggle, and the system\u2019s failure to adequately support her, ignited a profound shift within him. The helplessness he felt was the catalyst. At 35, he sold his tools, enrolled in a community college, and began the long journey toward understanding the human mind rather than mastering physical materials.\n\nThis new path led him to San Francisco, a city that felt like a sanctuary for reinvention. He completed his Master of Social Work at SF State, drawn to the city's complex tapestry of need and resilience. Now, at 53, his days are structured and purposeful. Mornings are for case notes and coffee from the corner cafe, followed by a steady stream of clients grappling with anxiety, grief, and trauma. He finds solace in the city's green spaces, often clearing his head between sessions with a walk through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park. His social life is small but deep\u2014a weekly dinner with a couple of old friends, a quiet appreciation for the neighborhood\u2019s stability. His greatest hope is simple: to remain a steady presence for those adrift, offering the kind of knowledgeable compassion he so desperately wished his own family had found all those years ago."
