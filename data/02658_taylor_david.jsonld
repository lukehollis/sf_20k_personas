The 0.0-mile commute affords him a sense of integrated calm he never knew growing up. Born and raised in the shadow of Akron\u2019s defunct tire factories, David\u2019s upbringing was pragmatic and blue-collar. His father was a mechanic, his mother a waitress, and the expectation was for David to learn a trade and earn a steady living. He followed that path without question, becoming a skilled carpenter by his early twenties, his identity shaped by the grain of wood and the satisfaction of building something tangible.\n\nThe turning point came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow, agonizing unraveling. His younger sister became ensnared in opioid addiction, a crisis that left his practical, problem-solving family feeling utterly helpless. For years, David tried to fix her life the way he\u2019d fix a warped joist\u2014with force, logic, and sheer will. It never worked. Witnessing her struggle, and the system\u2019s failure to adequately support her, ignited a profound shift within him. The helplessness he felt was the catalyst. At 35, he sold his tools, enrolled in a community college, and began the long journey toward understanding the human mind rather than mastering physical materials.\n\nThis new path led him to San Francisco, a city that felt like a sanctuary for reinvention. He completed his Master of Social Work at SF State, drawn to the city's complex tapestry of need and resilience. Now, at 53, his days are structured and purposeful. Mornings are for case notes and coffee from the corner cafe, followed by a steady stream of clients grappling with anxiety, grief, and trauma. He finds solace in the city's green spaces, often clearing his head between sessions with a walk through the Panhandle or into Golden Gate Park. His social life is small but deep\u2014a weekly dinner with a couple of old friends, a quiet appreciation for the neighborhood\u2019s stability. His greatest hope is simple: to remain a steady presence for those adrift, offering the kind of knowledgeable compassion he so desperately wished his own family had found all those years ago."

His hands, calloused and sure, had fit the dovetail joints so perfectly they felt like a single, seamless piece of wood. In that moment, he believed all problems could be measured, cut, and hammered into submission. This absolute faith in tangible, forceful solutions was the core of his identity, a conviction that would later be shattered by a problem he couldn't build his way out of.\n\n2.\nHe remembers standing in his sister\u2019s bleak Akron apartment when he was thirty-three. He'd come to \"fix things\" with a carpenter's certainty, but found only a burnt spoon on the counter and a hollow look in her eyes. He tried to lay out a logical plan for her recovery, his voice sounding loud and useless. She just stared past him. In that silence, he felt the utter failure of his entire way of being. This crushing helplessness was the foundational crack that broke his old life apart.\n\n3.\nAt thirty-five, he watched a young, eager carpenter load his tools into a truck. He felt a phantom ache in his hands as his well-maintained planer was lifted away. Selling them was an amputation. He was severing himself from the only identity he\u2019d ever known\u2014the man who builds, the man who fixes. It was the most terrifying and freeing act of his life, trading the certainty of wood and nails for the uncertain hope of understanding the human heart, including his own broken one.\n\n4.\nHis first week in San Francisco, around age thirty-eight, he walked into the Panhandle as the cool fog rolled in. It wasn\u2019t the oppressive gray of Akron\u2019s industrial sky, but a soft blanket that muted the world and made him feel anonymous. No one knew his past, his failures, or his family's pain. The city didn't demand he be anything. This quiet, environmental acceptance was his sanctuary, the first moment he truly felt he could build a new self without old blueprints.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young client sat in his office, voice trembling as he described his family\u2019s suffocating silence around his brother's addiction. David didn\u2019t offer a solution. He simply sat with the man, then named the unspoken grief with quiet compassion. He saw the client's shoulders relax, a dam of held-back emotion finally breaking. In that moment, David wasn't a carpenter trying to fix a faulty structure, but a guide holding a steady light. He was finally providing the knowledgeable presence he once desperately wished his own family had found."
