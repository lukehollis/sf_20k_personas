Born in Daly City to an Irish-American father, a stoic union carpenter, and a Filipina mother, a warm and vibrant nurse, Ethan\u2019s upbringing was a blend of pragmatism and community. He inherited his father\u2019s methodical nature and his mother\u2019s deep-seated desire to care for and protect others.\n\nHis academic path was unconventional. Drawn to the structure and preservation of knowledge, he pursued a Master\u2019s in Library and Information Science. His goal was to become a digital archivist, a guardian of history. The turning point came during an internship at a university library when a sophisticated ransomware attack crippled their servers. Watching the frantic, hopeless effort to recover decades of digitized records, Ethan realized his calling wasn't just to organize information, but to defend it. He pivoted, earning certifications in cybersecurity and quickly finding his place as an Information Security Analyst.\n\nNow at 42, Ethan\u2019s life is a study in controlled routines. His 0.0-mile commute means his day begins with coffee and a view of the fog rolling down from Golden Gate Park before he logs on to become a digital sentinel. He spends hours hunting for ghosts in the machine\u2014vulnerabilities, threats, and breaches\u2014a silent guardian for a company\u2019s digital lifeblood. After work, he consciously unplugs. He walks the length of Clement Street, deciding which restaurant to patronize, or loses himself for an hour on the trails of the park, trading the glow of the screen for the filtered light through cypress trees.\n\nHis social life is small but strong, consisting of a few friends from his rock-climbing gym and a former colleague with whom he shares a love for complex board games. He is content in his solitude but aspires to build something lasting. His dream isn't a promotion, but to use his skills to help a non-profit or activist group secure their data pro bono, protecting the vulnerable in the real world as he does in the digital one. For Ethan, San Francisco is not a city of disruption, but a place of anchorage, its fog a comforting blanket for a life built on securing the vital, unseen walls around us all."
