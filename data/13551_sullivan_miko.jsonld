Growing up, her world was a blend of two cultures: Obon festivals at the Japantown Buddhist Church and lively St. Patrick's Day parades downtown. A studious, observant child, Miko was always more interested in the stories behind objects than the objects themselves.\n\nHer path wasn't always clear. She started as a history major at SF State, but felt adrift. The turning point came while helping her grandmother sort through boxes after her grandfather passed. Uncovering faded photographs from the internment camps and brittle letters from his time as a dockworker, Miko felt the profound power of tangible memory. This experience propelled her to pursue a graduate degree in Library and Information Science, finding her calling not just in history, but in its preservation.\n\nShe began her career in the basement archives of the San Francisco Public Library, her meticulous nature and deep respect for overlooked narratives earning her a steady ascent. Now, as Chief Archivist for the city\u2019s Historical Records, she is the guardian of San Francisco\u2019s collective memory, from Gold Rush ledgers to Harvey Milk\u2019s campaign flyers.\n\nMiko lives in the same rent-controlled Inner Richmond apartment she found in her late twenties. Her daily 4.8-mile commute on the Muni 38R is a cherished ritual of reading and people-watching. Her personal life is quiet but full; a long-term relationship ended amicably a decade ago, leaving her with a comfortable sense of independence. Her friendships are few but deep, forged over years of shared work and a mutual love for the city's hidden corners.\n\nHer evenings are spent with books, tending to her small collection of bonsai, or practicing kintsugi\u2014the art of mending broken pottery with gold. It\u2019s a perfect metaphor for her life's work: honoring the fractures and histories that make an object, or a city, whole. Miko\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth, but of securing funding to digitize a fragile collection of Barbary Coast diaries, ensuring the city\u2019s most vulnerable stories are never lost to time."
