Her father, a civil engineer, preached the logic of grids and highways, while her mother, a librarian, fostered a love for the complex stories of people within those systems. A high school trip to Chicago, however, was Chloe's turning point. Standing beneath the rattling roar of the 'L' train, she was mesmerized not by the architecture, but by the intricate web of human movement\u2014how steel tracks could knit disparate neighborhoods together or, just as easily, reinforce their divides.\n\nThis fascination led her to pursue a Master's in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, focusing on urban analytics. The Bay Area was an intentional choice, a living laboratory of transit innovation and inequality. After graduating, she spurned lucrative tech offers for a role as a Transportation Planner at a Bay Area non-profit, the \u201cEquitable Mobility Collective.\u201d Her 0.0-mile commute is a core tenet of her current life; from her second-bedroom office in her Inner Richmond apartment, she analyzes datasets, models traffic flow, and writes policy briefs advocating for communities often overlooked by city planners.\n\nChloe has woven herself into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her days begin with a foggy walk to a local bakery on Clement Street and end with long runs through Golden Gate Park, her constant backyard. She shares her life with Liam, a landscape architect she met through a mutual friend at a park cleanup event. He grounds her data-driven world with talk of soil and native plants. While she finds deep satisfaction in her work, Chloe\u2019s ultimate dream is tangible: to one day ride a bus rapid transit line through a historically underserved neighborhood and know her research helped lay its foundation. For her, San Francisco is not just a home; it's a complex, frustrating, and beautiful puzzle she\u2019s determined to help solve, one bus route at a time."
