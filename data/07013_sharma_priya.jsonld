Raised in Cupertino by parents who emigrated from Delhi, she grew up steeped in the burgeoning culture of Silicon Valley. Her father, an early software engineer, and her mother, a homemaker, envisioned a linear path for her: a top-tier engineering degree followed by a lucrative, stable tech career. Priya, however, was more fascinated by the people and systems around the technology than the code itself.\n\nShe pursued a B.A. in Sociology from UCLA, a choice her parents found perplexing but tolerated. Her real passion emerged in graduate school, where she earned a Master's in Urban Planning from Columbia. She was captivated by how data could reveal the hidden narratives of a city\u2014migration patterns, resource allocation, and social inequity. For a few years, she worked for a municipal consulting firm, but found the pace bureaucratic and the impact limited. The turning point came during a project analyzing public transit usage; she realized the data modeling was more compelling than the policy reports. On her own time, she taught herself Python and advanced statistical analysis, pivoting her career with focused determination.\n\nNow a Senior Data Scientist at a major tech firm, Priya lives a life that is both a fulfillment and a gentle mockery of her parents\u2019 original dream. She works from her serene Cole Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her bedroom to her standing desk. A major breakup three years ago prompted her move to the neighborhood, and she has since cultivated a deliberate, peaceful existence. Her days start with a foggy run in Golden Gate Park and a coffee from the local cafe on Cole Street. Her work is demanding, but she unplugs completely at 6 PM, often heading to a pottery class or meeting her small, close-knit circle of friends.\n\nPriya feels deeply connected to San Francisco's tangible, human scale. She sees the city not just as a tech hub, but as a complex organism she once studied and now calls home. Her ultimate aspiration is to leave the corporate world and launch a consulting practice called \"Urban Lens,\" using her unique blend of skills to help non-profits and city planners build more equitable communities. She\u2019s saving, planning, and waiting for the right moment to make her next deliberate pivot."
