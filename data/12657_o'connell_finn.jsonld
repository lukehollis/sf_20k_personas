Raised in a working-class Boston suburb, he was the youngest of three, the quiet observer in a boisterous Irish-American family. The pivotal moment of his youth was watching his mother, a fiercely proud woman, struggle to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucracy to get disability benefits for his father after a construction accident. That experience of systemic helplessness planted a seed: Finn wouldn\u2019t build structures like his father, but he would learn to navigate the ones that governed people's lives.\n\nHe pursued a degree in Social Work at UMass, feeling a pull towards cities where social issues were most concentrated. Post-graduation, San Francisco, with its reputation for progressive ideals and stark inequality, called to him. He arrived at 25, initially overwhelmed by the cost and pace, but found his footing in a shared apartment in the Mission District. He landed a job at a community non-profit just a few blocks away, and for the past decade, that has been his world.\n\nNow 36, Finn is a senior Case Manager. His days are a triage of human need: connecting recently immigrated families with healthcare, guiding at-risk youth toward educational programs, and advocating for clients facing eviction. The work is emotionally taxing, and the $84,000 salary requires a frugal lifestyle, but the small victories fuel him. A key turning point was a long-term relationship that ended two years ago; his partner couldn't reconcile Finn\u2019s demanding, low-paying career with their own ambitions for a more comfortable life. The breakup solidified Finn\u2019s commitment to his path, even if it meant walking it alone for a while.\n\nHis life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission. His 0.6-mile walk to work is a daily immersion, past an ever-changing gallery of murals, the smells of taquerias, and the faces of his clients. His social circle consists of fellow non-profit workers who decompress over cheap beers at a local dive bar. Finn dreams not of a tech buyout, but of one day leading a new mentorship program at his organization. He hopes to find a partner who shares his values and a deeper sense of stability, but for now, his purpose is found in his short walk to work and the community he tirelessly serves."

The Muni bus roaring past, the sizzling from taqueria griddles, the vibrant, almost aggressive murals. Leaning against a lamp post, Boston felt a world away and failure felt imminent. Then he saw a mother guiding two small kids, speaking rapid-fire Spanish, and in her determined face, he saw his own mom. The fear didn\u2019t vanish, but it suddenly had a purpose. He knew he was in the right, difficult place. This was at age 25.\n\n2.\nThe day the eviction was officially halted for Mrs. Flores, she gripped his hand, her knuckles bony but strong, and said, \"God bless you, mijo.\" For weeks, Finn had felt like he was drowning in paperwork alongside her. In that moment, the exhaustion vaporized. He wasn't just pushing documents; he was holding the line. It was the first time, at age 28, he truly felt the echo of his father\u2019s work\u2014building something sturdy enough to keep a person safe from the storm.\n\n3.\nThe words still hung in the air of their small apartment: \"Is this it, Finn? Is this all you want?\" His partner wasn't being cruel, just honest about a life he couldn't provide. Looking out at the Mission lights, Finn knew he couldn't trade the small, crucial victories for a bigger floor plan. The quiet 'yes' he spoke was the loneliest word he\u2019d ever uttered, but it was also the truest. The heartbreak, two years ago, was a forge, hardening his commitment into something unbreakable.\n\n4.\nLast spring, after a brutal week of budget cuts, he sat at the 500 Club with his colleagues. No one needed to explain the specific weight they were all carrying. They just shared a pitcher of cheap beer, the silence punctuated by tired jokes. Looking at their faces in the bar's dim light, Finn felt a profound sense of peace. This was his tribe\u2014people who understood that wealth wasn't measured in dollars, but in the stability you could offer someone else. He felt rich in that moment.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his walk to work, he saw the teenage son of a family he'd helped secure housing years ago. The boy, once sullen and withdrawn, was now confidently helping his father unload produce at their corner store. He gave Finn a quick, knowing nod. It wasn't a grand victory, just a quiet moment of continuity. But that single nod was more validating than any promotion. It was a living mural on his daily commute, proof that the seeds he planted in the cracks were growing."
