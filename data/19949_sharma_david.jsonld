Born in San Jose, the son of an immigrant engineer from Delhi and a third-generation Californian librarian, he grew up between two worlds. While he identified as White, his surname was a constant reminder of a heritage he experienced mostly through his father\u2019s cooking and stories of a distant family. He was a methodical, observant child, more interested in organizing his baseball cards than playing the sport, finding comfort in systems and order.\n\nThis disposition led him not to the volatile dot-com boom of his youth, but to the steadier field of Health Information Management. Graduating in the late 90s, David began his career digitizing paper medical records, a task others found tedious but which he saw as building the foundational grammar of a new language in healthcare. His turning point came in the mid-2000s, when he championed an early, clumsy patient portal at a regional hospital. While his superiors were skeptical, David saw the future: technology not as a repository for data, but as a conduit for connection.\n\nThis vision defined his career. He moved to San Francisco for a role at a major medical center, steadily climbing from a project manager to his current position as Director of Patient Engagement Technology. He spearheads the development of apps and telehealth platforms that simplify communication between patients and their providers. His days are a blur of strategic meetings and troubleshooting, all powered by a 3.8-mile Muni ride from his Hayes Valley apartment to the Mission Bay campus.\n\nAt 49, David\u2019s life is comfortable but contained. A serious relationship ended five years ago, and he has since settled into a quiet routine of work, jogs through Golden Gate Park, and dinners with a small circle of friends. He feels a deep, abiding connection to San Francisco\u2019s blend of innovation and humanism. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder, but about legacy. He aspires to one day leverage his expertise for a global health non-profit, hoping to build systems that connect the world's most vulnerable patients to the care they deserve, finally bridging the biggest divide of all."
