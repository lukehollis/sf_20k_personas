Born in the Bayview district to Chinese immigrants, her earliest memories are of the rhythmic hum of sewing machines. Her parents ran a small garment workshop on the ground floor of their building, living in the apartment directly above. Mei Ling was a quiet, observant child who learned the language of production\u2014efficiency, quality control, and the steady pace of piecework\u2014long before she learned algebra.\n\nHer escape was meant to be San Francisco State University. For two semesters, she was enthralled by graphic design, a world of color and form far removed from the grey concrete of her neighborhood. But when her father\u2019s health declined rapidly, duty called her home. She dropped out to help her mother run the workshop, her dreams of logos and layouts packed away like old patterns. After her father passed, they could no longer sustain the business and leased the workshop space to a small electronics assembly company.\n\nSeeing her innate understanding of production flow, the new owner hired Mei Ling to work the line. She was quick, precise, and her quiet authority earned her colleagues' respect. Within five years, she was promoted to Assembly Line Supervisor. Her career wasn't a choice but a circumstance she mastered.\n\nNow, at 43, Mei Ling\u2019s commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs. Her days are a structured rhythm of pre-shift meetings, monitoring output, and solving logistical puzzles on the factory floor. She knows the personal stories of every worker on her line\u2014their kids\u2019 birthdays, their money worries. After her shift, she returns upstairs to the same apartment, now shared with her aging mother. Her social life is limited to weekly dim sum with a few former neighbors and the camaraderie she shares with her crew.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco isn't found in cable cars or tech campuses, but in the unyielding brick of her building and the legacy of work it contains. The dreams of being an artist are faded, replaced by pragmatic hopes: keeping her line efficient to avoid layoffs, saving enough to replace the building\u2019s old windows, and maybe, one day, taking a real vacation with her mother, someplace quiet where there are no machines."
