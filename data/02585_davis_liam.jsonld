Raised in the comfortable, predictable suburbs of Petaluma, Liam was the son of a practical contractor and a caring elementary school teacher. They encouraged stability, so he pursued a Communications degree from Sonoma State University\u2014a choice born more from uncertainty than passion. To pay for books and beer, he took a part-time job at a popular home goods chain, discovering a natural talent for customer service and inventory management.\n\nUpon graduation, with a diploma in hand and no clear career path, Liam drifted. The retail job offered a promotion, then another. Seeing an opening for an Assistant Manager in San Francisco, he seized the chance, viewing it as his grand escape from suburban malaise. He envisioned a life of artistic discovery and vibrant social scenes, a narrative he had sold himself for years.\n\nThe reality proved more contained. The only affordable housing attached to the job was a small studio apartment directly above the store. His 0.0-mile commute became the defining feature of his life. Now 24, his daily routine is a short loop: wake to the sounds of the city, walk downstairs to manage staff and shipments, and end the day in his apartment, the faint scent of the store\u2019s lavender soaps clinging to the air.\n\nLiam is well-liked but not deeply known. His social life consists of surface-level chats with coworkers and occasional, unfulfilling dates arranged through apps. His deepest connection remains the weekly Sunday call with his parents, where he artfully dodges questions about finding a \u201creal career.\u201d\n\nTrapped in a gilded cage of convenience, Liam yearns for the creative life he sees just outside his window. He dreams of being a photographer, his laptop filled with online tutorials he never finishes. He feels like a ghost in his own life, an observer of the dynamic city he technically inhabits. His greatest hope is to one day find the courage to walk past his own storefront and not return, finally starting a life that feels truly his own."
