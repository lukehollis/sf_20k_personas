Born in San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District to a stoic Russian engineer father who chased the first dot-com boom and an expressive, warm Filipina mother who worked as a caregiver, Alexei grew up in a quiet storm of conflicting expectations. He was surrounded by the Cyrillic alphabet and Tagalog lullabies, but felt fluent in neither. In school, he was the quiet boy in the back, filling notebooks not with lecture notes, but with intricate sketches of his classmates' hidden anxieties and fleeting joys. For Alexei, drawing was his native tongue.\n\nHis father pushed for a practical education in engineering or computer science, a path Alexei dutifully attempted at City College. The experience was hollow. The rigid structures of academia felt alien compared to the intuitive flow of charcoal on paper. He dropped out after a year, a decision that created a deep rift with his father. Adrift in his early twenties, Alexei worked a series of dead-end jobs, his art becoming a private, almost shame-filled sanctuary. The turning point came when he joined a community grief circle after his mother's sudden passing. Unable to articulate his sorrow, he began to draw it. He sketched the shared pain in the room, capturing the group\u2019s collective heart on a stark white page. This act of non-verbal empathy was a revelation; art wasn\u2019t just for him, it was for them.\n\nLacking a formal degree, Alexei forged his own path. He devoured books on psychology and therapeutic arts, volunteering at a community center in the Mission. He started a small, donation-based workshop, guiding others to process their own trauma through painting and sculpture. His practice grew organically through word-of-mouth.\n\nNow 31, Alexei lives and works in a small live/work studio in Dogpatch, his commute a ten-step shuffle from his bed to his easel. He is not a licensed clinician, but a community healer. His clients are those who, like him, fall through the cracks of traditional therapy. His days are a quiet rhythm of personal meditation, one-on-one sessions, and preparing materials for his group workshops. His life is spare but full. He is a familiar, gentle presence in his neighborhood, known for his thoughtful silence. Alexei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of wealth, but of securing a permanent, public space for his work\u2014a sanctuary where anyone in the city that raised him can find a voice, not with words, but with their hands."
