Born in Buenos Aires to Korean immigrants who ran a small textile shop, his childhood was a blend of Korean discipline, the lingering scent of asado, and the passionate hum of Argentinian life. The family immigrated to a Korean enclave in Los Angeles when David was 12, adding another layer to his complex sense of self. He felt perpetually \"other,\" a status that fostered a keen sense of observation and an ability to see systems from the outside in.\n\nA scholarship to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate studies in biology was his escape from LA's sprawl. It was on a backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevada that his purpose crystalized. Staring at a glacial lake, he realized he didn't just want to study nature; he wanted to protect it. This led him to a graduate program in a more applied field: Environmental Management. There, he met his wife, Elena, a sharp-witted urban planning student.\n\nHis career began in the trenches of compliance, but David\u2019s talent was in seeing the bigger picture. He rose through the ranks, moving from field analyst to a strategic consultant who could speak the language of both ecologists and CEOs. He convinced corporations that sustainability wasn't just good ethics, it was good business. He and Elena moved to San Francisco 20 years ago for a job offer, falling for a city that married technological ambition with progressive environmental values.\n\nToday, David lives a comfortable, purposeful life in Noe Valley. His mornings begin with a strong coffee before he catches the J-Church line downtown, a 2.5-mile commute that affirms his commitment to public transit. His days are spent advising tech and finance giants on reducing their carbon footprints. At 54, with his daughter now at college, his aspirations have shifted from climbing the ladder to building a legacy. He dreams of mentoring young environmental leaders and, upon retirement, buying a small plot of land in Sonoma to restore its native ecosystem\u2014a tangible, personal project to cap a career spent on strategy. San Francisco, with its proximity to wild coastlines and forward-thinking ethos, remains the only place he can imagine calling home."

Surrounded by the granite silence of the Sierra, the sterile facts of his biology textbooks dissolved. This wasn't a system to be studied; it was a living thing to be defended. The thought struck him with the force of a physical blow, a sudden, piercing clarity that set the course for the rest of his life. He wasn\u2019t just an observer; he would be a guardian.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 a.m. in the architecture library. David was explaining ecological corridors, and Elena was sketching them onto a city map with a red pen, arguing for zoning density. She looked up, her eyes sharp with fatigue and passion. \u201cIt\u2019s the same system, David. One for people, one for peregrines. We\u2019re just negotiating the terms.\u201d In that moment, he felt a profound click of recognition. He wasn\u2019t just falling for her; he was falling for a shared worldview that would become the blueprint for their entire life together.\n\n3.\nTwenty years ago, their first weekend in Noe Valley was foggy and disorienting. They walked through Glen Canyon, the screech of a red-tailed hawk echoing off the chert rock face, the city\u2019s hum a distant bassline. Standing there, between urban grid and wild canyon, Elena squeezed his hand. \u201cWe\u2019re home,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t a question. He felt a deep sense of settlement, a feeling that this contradictory, beautiful city was the only place that could hold all the different parts of who he was.\n\n4.\nThe CEO was stonewalling, staring at the carbon offset data with utter boredom. David abandoned his slides. He talked instead about the steelhead trout struggling in a creek near the company's new campus, a creek he\u2019d personally surveyed. He saw a flicker of something in the man\u2019s eyes\u2014not a financier, but a fisherman. The deal was approved an hour later. That day, David learned true influence wasn\u2019t about data; it was about finding the hidden language that connects a balance sheet to a riverbed, and a CEO to the world.\n\n5.\nHe stood with his daughter, then ten, at the base of a redwood in Muir Woods. Her head was tilted all the way back, her mouth a small \u2018o\u2019 of wonder. \u201cThis tree was already a giant when Abuelo was a little boy in Korea,\u201d he told her softly. Her hand tightened in his. It wasn't about global strategy anymore. In that quiet moment, his life's work became intensely personal: to ensure this specific, breathtaking awe would still be here for her, long after he was gone."
