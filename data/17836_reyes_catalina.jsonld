            "value": "Catalina Reyes is a product of two distinct Bay Area cultures. Raised in Daly City, her childhood was a vibrant mix of her mother\u2019s Filipino heritage and her father\u2019s Mexican-American roots. Her mother, a registered nurse, and her father, a master auto mechanic, instilled in her a profound work ethic and the importance of community. Watching them navigate the complexities of life as first and second-generation Americans, Catalina developed a keen sense of empathy and a sharp eye for systems that helped or hindered people.\n\nInitially studying psychology at UC Santa Cruz, she was fascinated by human motivation. The turning point came during her junior year when she watched her parents struggle to use a poorly designed online healthcare portal. In that moment of frustration, she saw her future: she could apply her understanding of the human mind to make technology intuitive and accessible. This led her to pursue a master\u2019s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nNow 28, Catalina is a successful UX Researcher for a major tech firm in SoMa. She acts as the translator between user needs and product development, a role she considers a form of digital advocacy. Her commute is a 3.8-mile ride on the J-Church Muni line from her apartment in the Mission District, a neighborhood she chose for its cultural vibrancy, which reminds her of home. Her daily routine is a blend of data analysis, user interviews, and collaborative design sessions.\n\nEvenings are for decompressing: a pottery class in the Dogpatch, exploring new restaurants with a tight-knit group of friends from college, or simply reading in Dolores Park. Weekends often involve visiting her family in Daly City, bringing back Tupperware filled with adobo or carnitas.\n\nWhile grateful for her financial stability, Catalina dreams of more. She aspires to lead a research team focused on ethical technology, specifically designing products for underserved communities\u2014immigrants, the elderly, and those with disabilities. For Catalina, San Francisco isn't just a place of opportunity; it's a living lab where she hopes to build a more humane and equitable digital world, honoring the legacy of the parents who inspired her path."

            "value": "1.\nAt twenty, home from UC Santa Cruz, she watched her father\u2019s calloused mechanic's hands tremble slightly over the mouse, her mother squinting at the screen. They were trying to navigate a new health portal. Their shared frustration was a physical thing in the room. It wasn't their fault; the system was broken. In that moment, her vague interest in psychology sharpened into a laser-focused purpose. She wouldn't just study people; she would build bridges for them in the digital world. This memory is the cornerstone of her career.\n\n2.\nIt was her Tio\u2019s birthday in Daly City; she must have been ten. The garage, usually smelling of oil, was filled with the scents of her two worlds: Lola\u2019s lumpia frying next to Abuela\u2019s simmering carnitas. She watched them direct kitchen traffic in a mix of Tagalog and Spanish, a seamless fusion of commands and affection. She realized then that her family wasn't two separate halves, but a unique, beautiful whole. This shaped her belief that different systems and cultures could, and should, work together harmoniously.\n\n3.\nHer first Saturday in the Mission, age 24, the J-Church rattled past as she walked down Valencia Street. The scent of pan dulce from a panaderia blended with the sound of cumbia from a parked car. Murals exploded with color on every wall. It felt less like a new neighborhood and more like a familiar echo of her childhood, just with a different rhythm. This wasn't just an apartment; it was a homecoming. It cemented her sense of belonging in the city she now called her own.\n\n4.\nA year into her job, she interviewed an elderly man struggling with a new banking app. He reminded her so much of her father. She listened, not as a researcher, but as a person. She later presented his story\u2014not just the data points\u2014to the engineers. When the next build included the simple, high-contrast button he\u2019d described, she felt a profound victory. It wasn't about aesthetics; it was about dignity. This moment affirmed her role as a true digital advocate.\n\n5.\nLast fall, in her Dogpatch pottery class, her hands were slick with wet clay. Her mind, usually parsing user feedback and data, was silent. She focused only on the spinning form beneath her fingers, coaxing the walls of a bowl upward. It was a different kind of creation\u2014intuitive, flawed, and entirely tangible. This practice of shaping something real and useful with her own hands grounds her, reminding her that the best technology, like the best pottery, begins with a simple, human touch."
