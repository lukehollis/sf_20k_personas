            "value": "Maya Dubois is a product of San Francisco\u2019s creative crucible, a collage of influences just like the city itself. Born to a French-American architect father and a Japanese-American ceramicist mother in a sun-drenched Potrero Hill walk-up, her childhood was a sensory education in line, texture, and form. She didn't have a traditional playroom; she had a drafting table littered with schematics and a corner of her mother's studio where she learned to feel the story in a piece of clay. Formal education never resonated with Maya, who found classrooms sterile compared to the vibrant, chaotic world of her parents\u2019 studios.\n\nHer career path was an apprenticeship in slow motion. Instead of pursuing a degree, she learned by doing: helping her mother install gallery shows, assisting set designers for local theater, and eventually taking small commissions to organize pop-up art events. The pivotal turning point came at 28 with her mother's sudden passing. Maya inherited the ground-floor studio, a space imbued with memory and purpose. Rather than let it go, she transformed it into her own live-work headquarters, officially launching her one-woman exhibition design firm. This is why her commute is zero; she lives and breathes her work within the same four walls.\n\nNow 36, Maya\u2019s life is a disciplined blend of digital precision and tactile craft. Mornings are for client calls and 3D modeling on her computer, designing the flow and narrative of a space. Afternoons are for building physical models, testing lighting, and sourcing materials from local artisans. Her clients range from blue-chip galleries in Dogpatch to tech companies in SoMa seeking to create immersive brand experiences. Her social life is small but deep, woven into her professional world\u2014a tight-knit circle of artists, curators, and fabricators.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is physical and profound; she shapes how people experience art and ideas within its spaces. While she is proud of her success, her dream is to design a permanent wing at the de Young Museum. More personally, she yearns to curate a full retrospective of her mother's work, using her own skills to tell the story of the woman who first taught her how to see."
