Born in Seoul and adopted at six months old by a loving Irish-American couple, Brandon grew up amidst the fog and bustle of San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district. His parents, Declan and Maeve O'Connell, owned a charming, cluttered neighborhood boutique selling high-end home goods and artisanal gifts. From a young age, Brandon spent his afternoons stocking shelves and learning the rhythms of retail, absorbing his father\u2019s knack for customer service and his mother\u2019s eye for quality.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State, pursuing a degree in graphic design, a passion that felt distinctly his own. For two years, he thrived, creating a new identity separate from the family store. However, his path veered sharply when his father suffered a major health scare. Feeling a deep sense of duty and gratitude, Brandon put his education on hold to manage the shop. What was meant to be a temporary arrangement slowly solidified into his new reality.\n\nNow 27, Brandon is the official Assistant Store Manager, living in the small one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop. His commute is a walk down a flight of stairs. His days are a predictable cycle: brewing coffee, updating inventory, chatting with the neighborhood regulars who have known him since he was a boy, and closing up long after the sun has set. He is good at his job\u2014organized, personable, and possessing an innate sense of the store's aesthetic\u2014but a quiet restlessness hums beneath the surface.\n\nHis social life is limited, constrained by the long retail hours. Late at night, in his apartment, he sometimes opens his old design software, sketching logos for imaginary companies or redesigning the store\u2019s dated website. He dreams of revitalizing the business with a modern, minimalist edge\u2014an online store, collaborations with local artists\u2014but hesitates to push his semi-retired parents too hard. His greatest hope is to find a way to merge his inherited life with his own aspirations, to finally feel like the true proprietor of his own story, not just a caretaker of someone else\u2019s."
