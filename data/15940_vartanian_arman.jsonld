Born in Yerevan, Armenia, he immigrated to San Francisco with his family in 1979. They settled in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, joining a small but tight-knit Armenian community. His father, a former mechanic, found work in a garage and taught Arman that honor was found in building and fixing things with your own two hands.\n\nThis ethos guided Arman\u2019s youth. He was a tinkerer who saw potential in every discarded machine. He enrolled in Industrial Design at City College, drawn to the promise of creation, but found himself stifled by theory. A family financial setback became a pivotal turning point; he left school to take an apprenticeship at a machine shop. There, amidst the roar and precision of CNC machines, he found his true calling. It was the perfect fusion of design and tangible craft.\n\nOver three decades, Arman mastered his trade. He became a senior prototyping specialist in a Dogpatch manufacturing facility, the quiet artisan who turns a tech founder\u2019s digital dream into a physical reality. He met his wife, Lena, at an Armenian cultural festival, and their daughter, Anahit, is now studying computer science at UC Davis\u2014a fact that fills Arman with profound pride.\n\nHis daily routine is a ritual of consistency. An early start with strong coffee, then the 8.5-mile drive in his meticulously maintained 2008 Lexus from his Sunset home to the industrial hum of his workshop. He finds deep satisfaction in solving complex fabrication problems that younger engineers can't crack. While he\u2019s seen San Francisco transform around him, he remains anchored to his neighborhood, his family, and the immutable laws of physics and materials. His dream isn\u2019t a lavish retirement, but a smaller workshop of his own, a place to work on passion projects and mentor a new generation in the tangible magic of making things."

Their neighbor\u2019s radio was in pieces, a puzzle of wires and tubes. Arman, mesmerized, watched his father\u2019s hands move with quiet certainty. When the dial finally turned and music filled the small room, he felt a profound sense of awe. It wasn't about the radio; it was seeing how skill could restore order and bring joy. That day cemented in him the belief that true honor was found in fixing what was broken.\n\n2.\nThe classroom theory at City College felt abstract and distant, but his first day at the machine shop in 1989 was a revelation. The deafening roar of the CNC mill, the sharp, clean smell of cutting fluid\u2014it was a symphony. He watched a block of raw aluminum transform into a gleaming, perfect component, its geometry precise to the thousandth of an inch. In that moment of tangible creation, the frustration of school vanished, replaced by the deep, resonant feeling of having finally come home. He knew he\u2019d found his life's work.\n\n3.\nHe first saw Lena in the courtyard of St. Gregory Church during the annual cultural festival in 1995. She was laughing with her friends, the smoke from the khorovats grill swirling around her. Amidst the familiar sounds of Armenian music and language, she felt like the embodiment of a warmth he didn't know he was missing. When she met his gaze and smiled, his world, which had been defined by steel and schematics, suddenly expanded to include the possibility of a shared future, anchoring him not just in his craft, but in his community.\n\n4.\nAround 2015, a young engineer, all confidence and expensive sneakers, brought him a prototype design deemed \"impossible\" by two other shops. Arman looked not at the complex 3D model, but at the titanium block itself, running his thumb over its cool surface. He spent two days silently working, recalibrating the machine by feel and experience. When he handed the finished, perfect part to the astonished engineer, he felt a quiet, unshakable pride. It was a silent validation of decades of craft over fleeting digital theory.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, his daughter Anahit came home from UC Davis for the weekend. She proudly showed him her first complex piece of code, her face illuminated by the screen's glow. He didn\u2019t understand the syntax, but he recognized the structure, the precise logic, the building of something elegant and functional from nothing. He saw his own hands, his own father\u2019s hands, in her mind. His profound pride was mixed with wonder; the family tradition of *making things* had simply been translated into a new language."
