Born in Palo Alto to an American linguistics professor and a first-generation Chinese software engineer, her childhood was an intellectual crucible. Weekends were spent not at the mall, but at the Exploratorium or coding simple games with her mother. While she inherited her father\u2019s quiet, academic demeanor, it was her mother\u2019s pragmatic, logical mind that shaped her future. Mei was a child who preferred building complex Lego structures to playing house, a trait that pointed directly toward her future career.\n\nHer path was linear and fiercely focused. After earning her bachelor's degree at UC Berkeley, a family tragedy became her catalyst. Watching her grandmother\u2019s memories fade under the fog of dementia imbued her with a poignant purpose. She pursued a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at Stanford, determined to understand the architecture of memory and thought. Her thesis on neural network modeling for cognitive augmentation caught the eye of a major San Francisco tech firm, where she was hired directly into their advanced research division.\n\nNow 37, Mei is a Senior Research Scientist, leading a team dedicated to developing ethical AI to assist with cognitive decline. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a dedicated office in her minimalist Mission Bay condo, its large windows overlooking the water. Her days are a disciplined cycle: a 6 a.m. run along the Embarcadero, followed by hours of deep work, collaborating with her team via holographic interfaces. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a younger brother in Oakland and a handful of trusted colleagues who share her intense passion.\n\nSan Francisco is less a city to her and more an ecosystem\u2014the global hub of the very future she is trying to build. While her work is her life, a quiet hope persists. Mei dreams of one day finding a better balance, of rediscovering the part of herself that used to paint watercolors, and of building a connection with someone who understands that her monastic focus is not a lack of feeling, but the deepest expression of her care for humanity."
