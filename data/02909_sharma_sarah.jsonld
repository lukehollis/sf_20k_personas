The daughter of Indian immigrants, her engineer father and homemaker mother envisioned a future for her in medicine or tech\u2014stable, prestigious paths they had sacrificed for. From a young age, however, Sarah was more interested in the stories behind people's eyes than the code on a screen. She was the quiet observer, the one her friends confided in, drawn to the intricate complexities of human emotion.\n\nThis inclination became a quiet rebellion during her time at UC Berkeley. While her parents hoped for a pre-med declaration, Sarah found her calling in sociology. She followed her bachelor's with a Master of Social Work from SF State, a definitive step onto her own path. This decision created a temporary rift with her parents, who struggled to understand her choice to enter a field known more for its emotional toll than its financial rewards.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of public health, working in community clinics in the Mission and Bayview-Hunters Point. She witnessed the raw, unfiltered struggles of the city's most vulnerable, honing her skills in crisis intervention and trauma-informed care. After two decades, seeking a more sustainable pace, Sarah transitioned to private practice.\n\nNow, at 53, her life is centered in her cozy Inner Sunset flat, which doubles as her office. Her commute is a mere walk from her bedroom to her sunlit study, where she conducts telehealth sessions with clients. Her day is a structured rhythm of empathy and analysis, punctuated by walks in the cool, misty air of Golden Gate Park just blocks away. Years ago, she went through an amicable divorce, and while she values her independence, she maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow therapists and artists\u2014for dinners and weekend hikes.\n\nHer future aspirations are not grand, but deeply personal. She dreams of mentoring new social workers, helping them navigate the burnout she knows so well. She also hopes to travel to India, not for a family obligation, but for herself\u2014to connect with her heritage on her own terms, a journey of quiet discovery reflecting the life of mindful independence she has carefully built in her chosen city."
