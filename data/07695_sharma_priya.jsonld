The daughter of an immigrant literature professor at UC Berkeley, Priya grew up in the East Bay surrounded by books, but it was the tangible world of structures that captivated her. The defining moment of her youth was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Witnessing the immense power of nature and the critical importance of human engineering, a teenage Priya found her calling. She would build things that would last.\n\nHer path was a testament to her focus. She earned a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from UC Davis and a Master of Science in Structural Engineering from Stanford, consistently excelling in a male-dominated field. Her early career was spent in a hard hat and steel-toed boots, proving her mettle on construction sites for seismic retrofits and new high-rises. She earned respect not with words, but with flawless calculations and an unwavering work ethic. Over the decades, she transitioned from pure engineering to infrastructure project management, orchestrating the complex dance of architects, contractors, and city planners. A brief marriage in her thirties ended amicably, both parties recognizing that her career was her true partner.\n\nNow at 51, Priya\u2019s life is one of controlled precision. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a sophisticated home office, a command center of monitors displaying blueprints, budgets, and Gantt charts. Her days start with a brisk walk along the Embarcadero before she immerses herself in the high-stakes world of multi-million dollar projects. She is shaping the physical future of San Francisco from her living room. Her connection to the city is literal; she can point to a bridge whose retrofit she managed or a hospital wing she helped bring to life.\n\nHer social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few trusted colleagues and friends from a long-standing hiking group that tackles Mount Tamalpais on weekends. Having reached the pinnacle of her profession, Priya\u2019s ambition has shifted. She now dreams of mentoring young women entering engineering, establishing a scholarship, and ensuring the next generation has a smoother path. She sees her legacy not just in the concrete and steel that hold the city together, but in the future leaders she can help build."
