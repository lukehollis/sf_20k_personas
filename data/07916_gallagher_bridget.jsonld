Raised in a quiet Des Moines suburb by practical parents\u2014an accountant father and a third-grade teacher mother\u2014Bridget was always the dreamer. She pursued this inclination to a small liberal arts college, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History, imagining a future surrounded by the hushed reverence of museums.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco at 22, full of ambition to conquer the art world. Reality, however, was a series of unpaid internships and low-paying gallery assistant jobs. To make rent on her tiny Inner Richmond apartment, she took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a burgeoning tech startup in SoMa. This was her pivotal, accidental turning point. While the engineers and designers created the product, Bridget created order from their chaos. Her ability to track timelines, manage conflicting personalities, and synthesize information\u2014skills honed by years of analyzing artistic movements\u2014was undeniable. The art world faded as a tangible career in tech project coordination blossomed.\n\nNow at 40, Bridget is a seasoned Project Coordinator for a major tech firm, a position she\u2019s held remotely since before the pandemic. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with a BART ride, but with a foggy walk to a local bakery for coffee, followed by hours of Slack messages and Zoom calls from her plant-filled home office.\n\nHer personal life has seen its own pivots. A long-term relationship ended in her mid-thirties, leaving her feeling both liberated and weary of the city\u2019s dating scene. Her social life now centers on a tight-knit group of friends, a mix of fellow tech professionals and artists who remind her of her original path. She feels a deep, complicated love for San Francisco; it's the city that shattered her first dream but gifted her a stable, successful life in return. Her aspirations have matured from curating a museum to simply curating a life of balance\u2014one with more international travel and, perhaps one day, enough savings to open a small, beautifully curated design shop, a final nod to the art historian she once was."
