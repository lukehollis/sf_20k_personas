The only son of a union mechanic and a school secretary, he was raised on the practical gospel of knowing how things work. His childhood was spent disassembling broken lawnmowers and VCRs in the garage, his hands perpetually stained with grease. This innate curiosity for the tangible world led him to Ohio State University, where a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering felt less like a degree and more like a formal validation of his lifelong passion.\n\nHis early career was in traditional automotive manufacturing, a stable but creatively stifling path. The turning point came at age 28. Frustrated by corporate inertia, he saw the hardware revolution blossoming in the Bay Area\u2014drones, robotics, and beautifully designed consumer electronics. He packed two suitcases, sold his car, and moved to San Francisco for a junior engineering role at a startup, a move his parents saw as a reckless gamble.\n\nIn San Francisco, Brendan\u2019s practical, hands-on background became his greatest asset. While others theorized, he built. He thrived in the fast-paced world of rapid prototyping, quickly earning a reputation as the guy who could turn a complex CAD model into a functional object overnight. Now, as a Lead Prototyping Engineer, he guides a small team, finding deep satisfaction in solving physical puzzles.\n\nBrendan's life is defined by a sense of grounded intention. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with his partner of six years, Clara, a landscape architect. His 3.1-mile commute is a daily ritual; cycling through the Panhandle and down the Wiggle allows him to physically connect with the city before immersing himself in the controlled environment of the lab. His social circle is small and tight-knit, favoring brewery trivia nights over exclusive clubs.\n\nThough content, Brendan dreams of translating his skills into something more personal. His ultimate aspiration isn't to become a VP of Engineering, but to open his own small-scale fabrication shop in the Dogpatch, crafting high-end, custom bicycle frames. It\u2019s a dream that connects his past to his present\u2014a return to working with his own hands, building beautiful, functional things for the city he has come to call home."

The air smelled of cold concrete and his father\u2019s lingering, unspoken worry. His one-way flight to SFO was booked, the car\u2019s sale money in his account. The feeling wasn't triumph, but a quiet, stomach-lurching defiance against the practical world that had raised him. That moment, at 28, was the first time his hands felt shaky not from a tool, but from the sheer weight of his own terrifying, exhilarating choice.\n\n2.\nIt was 3 a.m. at his first startup, six months after the move. The lead software engineer had given up, but Brendan saw the physical path through the digital mess. Holding the first fully functional prototype\u2014still warm from the 3D printer\u2014he felt a profound sense of rightness. It wasn't about impressing the CEO in the morning. It was the quiet, powerful affirmation that his grease-stained Ohio background was his greatest asset here. That night, his professional gamble transformed into a hard-won certainty.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the hissed curse as his tire went flat in the Panhandle. Then, Clara\u2019s voice asking if he needed help, not put off by the grease on his hands. She pointed to his bike\u2019s lugged steel frame and started talking about its classic geometry. In that moment, surrounded by a park she knew intimately as a landscape architect, he felt seen not just for what he could fix, but for what he appreciated. That conversation, six years ago, was the start of building a life, not just things.\n\n4.\nCresting a small rise on the Wiggle two years ago, he felt it\u2014a subtle, inefficient flex in his mass-produced bike frame. The engineer in him was annoyed, but something else sparked. He envisioned a frame built *for* these streets, perfectly welded, with no compromises. The thought was electric, more exciting than any venture-backed project. That flicker of frustration crystallized his vague discontent into a tangible dream. It was the moment his future clicked into place: his own shop, his own hands, his own frames.\n\n5.\nHis dad, visiting from Cleveland last year, stood silently in the prototyping lab. He picked up a complex, multi-material assembly, turning it over in his calloused mechanic\u2019s hands. Brendan braced for a skeptical question, but his dad just nodded slowly. \"Same principle as a differential, just\u2026 smaller,\" he said with a wry smile. In that simple observation, decades of unspoken worry dissolved into a quiet, powerful flicker of shared understanding. Brendan\u2019s reckless gamble had finally, beautifully, made sense."
