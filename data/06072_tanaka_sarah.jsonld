A third-generation Japanese-American, she grew up in the suburban quiet of San Jose, daughter to pragmatic parents who, having seen their own parents navigate the aftermath of internment, championed stability and secure career paths. They envisioned a future for Sarah in business or tech, a world away from the emotional complexities they\u2019d learned to suppress. Sarah, however, was always a keen observer, more fascinated by her grandmother\u2019s stoic resilience and the stories left untold than by balance sheets.\n\nAfter earning a business degree to please her family, Sarah spent five years in a soul-crushing marketing job. The turning point came not as a single epiphany, but as a slow, painful erosion. Her father was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. Suddenly, her family was adrift in the bewildering world of healthcare. It was the hospital\u2019s social worker, a calm and compassionate woman, who became their navigational anchor, helping them manage logistics, fear, and grief. In watching this stranger hold her family together, Sarah found her calling. At 28, she quit her job, enrolled at UC Berkeley, and earned her Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 40, Sarah works from her cozy Inner Richmond apartment, her 0.0-mile commute a buffer against the city's frantic energy. Her days are a sequence of telehealth appointments, where she provides counseling to patients and families grappling with chronic illness. The work is emotionally taxing, and she decompressses with ritualistic solo jogs through Golden Gate Park or along the wild coastal trails of Lands End. She finds solace in the fog-dampened air and the rhythmic crash of the Pacific.\n\nHer social life consists of a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly other healthcare professionals who understand the need for low-key dinners and long hikes over loud nights out. Though content, Sarah dreams of deepening her impact. Her quiet ambition is to start a non-profit support group specifically for AAPI families navigating elder care and serious illness, creating a space to voice the very complexities her own family was taught to endure in silence. It\u2019s her way of honoring her grandmother\u2019s unspoken strength and fully connecting her past to her purpose in her chosen city."
