The only son of Korean immigrants Jae-ho and Min-seo, he grew up behind the counter of their Daly City dry-cleaning business. His parents, who sacrificed everything for his future, envisioned a stable path for him: finance or engineering. Andrew dutifully enrolled in Economics at UC Berkeley, but the city itself became his real education. In a required elective on urban sociology, he saw how city planning\u2014from transit lines to zoning laws\u2014was the invisible architecture dictating the lives of people like his parents. It was a revelation. He switched his major to Urban Studies, a decision that caused his parents quiet concern but ignited a deep-seated passion in him.\n\nHe pursued a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, driven by an idealistic vision of creating more equitable and livable cities. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted, if junior, role as an Associate Urban Planner for the City of San Francisco. Now, at 24, he\u2019s confronting the chasm between theory and reality. His days are spent navigating the labyrinth of zoning codes, community feedback sessions, and endless bureaucratic reports, all from the small desk crammed into the corner of his Hayes Valley studio apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute affords him a uniquely intimate relationship with his neighborhood. His \"commute\" is a morning walk to a local cafe, where he observes pedestrian flow and the use of parklets he helped review plans for. His life is modest; he has a tight-knit circle of friends from his graduate program who meet for trivia nights, and he maintains a loving, if slightly distant, relationship with his parents, who are proud but still ask if he\u2019ll ever get a \u201creal office job.\u201d\n\nAndrew\u2019s dreams aren\u2019t grand; they are tangible. He hopes to one day cycle down a protected bike lane he personally helped champion or see a community garden flourish on a once-vacant lot he re-zoned. His aspiration is to leave a small, positive imprint on the city that captivated him, transforming his idealistic sketches into a functional, more humane San Francisco for everyone."

A regular customer complained that the city had moved the 28-line bus stop two blocks away, making it a hassle to pick up her suits. His father just nodded, his face a mask of weary acceptance. Andrew felt a strange pang of injustice for his parents, whose hard work could be so easily affected by a line redrawn on a map. That feeling\u2014of powerlessness against an unseen system\u2014never truly left him.\n\n2.\nHe was nineteen, sitting in the back of a cavernous lecture hall at Cal. The professor projected a map of transit corridors and overlaid it with demographic data of immigrant small business owners. Suddenly, the scent of his parents\u2019 dry-cleaners filled his senses. It wasn\u2019t just a theory; it was the 28-line bus stop, his father\u2019s weary sigh, the architecture of their struggle made visible. In that instant, economics felt hollow. This was real. This was a language he needed to learn.\n\n3.\nThe phone call home to switch his major was harder than any exam. He was 20. Explaining \"Urban Studies\" to his mother, Min-seo, felt impossible. He heard the long silence, thick with the fear that their sacrifice was being squandered on a dream without a clear salary. \u201cWill you have a real office?\u201d she finally asked. The question wasn\u2019t about status, but stability. It was the moment he understood his passion would always be weighed against their love and pragmatism, a tension he carries to this day.\n\n4.\nHis first approved permit, just months into his job at 23, wasn\u2019t for a skyscraper but for a small parklet on Hayes Street. He\u2019d spent weeks on the paperwork. The first morning he saw two neighbors sitting there with coffee, talking where a parking space once was, a quiet joy bloomed in his chest. It was a tiny victory, invisible to almost everyone, but for him, it was the first time a line he\u2019d reviewed on paper became a real place for people. It made the bureaucracy worth it.\n\n5.\nLast month, after a brutal community meeting filled with shouting over a proposed housing development, he felt utterly defeated. Walking home, he saw a father teaching his small child to ride a bike in the newly protected bike lane on Valencia Street\u2014a project he\u2019d done minuscule research for as an intern. The child wobbled, laughed, and was safe. The scale of his contribution was tiny, but the result was so purely good. It was the specific, human-sized validation he needed to keep going."
