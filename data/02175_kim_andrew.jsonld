The only son of Korean immigrants Jae-ho and Min-seo, he grew up behind the counter of their Daly City dry-cleaning business. His parents, who sacrificed everything for his future, envisioned a stable path for him: finance or engineering. Andrew dutifully enrolled in Economics at UC Berkeley, but the city itself became his real education. In a required elective on urban sociology, he saw how city planning\u2014from transit lines to zoning laws\u2014was the invisible architecture dictating the lives of people like his parents. It was a revelation. He switched his major to Urban Studies, a decision that caused his parents quiet concern but ignited a deep-seated passion in him.\n\nHe pursued a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, driven by an idealistic vision of creating more equitable and livable cities. Upon graduating, he landed a coveted, if junior, role as an Associate Urban Planner for the City of San Francisco. Now, at 24, he\u2019s confronting the chasm between theory and reality. His days are spent navigating the labyrinth of zoning codes, community feedback sessions, and endless bureaucratic reports, all from the small desk crammed into the corner of his Hayes Valley studio apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute affords him a uniquely intimate relationship with his neighborhood. His \"commute\" is a morning walk to a local cafe, where he observes pedestrian flow and the use of parklets he helped review plans for. His life is modest; he has a tight-knit circle of friends from his graduate program who meet for trivia nights, and he maintains a loving, if slightly distant, relationship with his parents, who are proud but still ask if he\u2019ll ever get a \u201creal office job.\u201d\n\nAndrew\u2019s dreams aren\u2019t grand; they are tangible. He hopes to one day cycle down a protected bike lane he personally helped champion or see a community garden flourish on a once-vacant lot he re-zoned. His aspiration is to leave a small, positive imprint on the city that captivated him, transforming his idealistic sketches into a functional, more humane San Francisco for everyone."
