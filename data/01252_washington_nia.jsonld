Her father, a mechanic, and her mother, a nurse, instilled in her a formidable work ethic and a deep-seated sense of fairness, but not the expectation of a four-year university degree. After high school, Nia bypassed college and took a job as an administrative assistant at a small legal aid clinic, a decision born more of necessity than passion.\n\nThe turning point came when she was 24. She spent months helping a family fight a wrongful eviction, witnessing firsthand how a sharp legal mind could protect the vulnerable. The family ultimately lost their home, but the experience ignited a fire in Nia. She began attending night school, eventually earning a place at a state university\u2019s law school. It wasn\u2019t an Ivy League institution, but Nia outworked everyone, driven by a purpose her more privileged peers lacked.\n\nAfter passing the bar, she eschewed corporate law, accepting a remote position as Associate Counsel for a national housing rights non-profit. This allowed her the freedom to live anywhere, and she chose San Francisco, a city whose progressive ideals resonated with her own.\n\nNow, at 39, Nia lives in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to a small desk overlooking the street. Her life is one of quiet intention. Mornings start with a run through Alamo Square, followed by focused hours dissecting housing policy and drafting legal arguments. Her social circle is small but deep, centered around a weekly book club and her friendship with Elias, a chef she met at her local coffee shop.\n\nNia\u2019s ambition isn\u2019t a corner office but a stronger social safety net. She dreams of one day leveraging her expertise to help shape municipal housing policy. For Nia, San Francisco isn't just a beautiful city; it's the front line of the battle she chose to fight, and she feels perfectly at home in the trenches."
