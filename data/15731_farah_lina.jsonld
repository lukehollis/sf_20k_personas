Born in Daly City to Filipino immigrants, she grew up in a home filled with the aromas of adobo and the constant hum of Tagalog. Her parents, a nurse and a postal worker, modeled the principle of *bayanihan*\u2014a spirit of communal unity and cooperation. Lina\u2019s defining childhood memory is watching her father spend weeks helping a newly arrived family navigate the labyrinthine systems of housing and employment, an act of selfless service that planted the seed for her own future.\n\nThis calling led her to San Francisco State University, where a Bachelor's degree in Social Work felt less like a choice and more like a destiny. Her first job as a caseworker in the Mission District was a trial by fire. The city\u2019s stark inequalities were on full display, and the weight of her clients' struggles nearly broke her. A turning point came when she successfully advocated for a non-English-speaking family facing eviction and a medical crisis, a hard-won victory that solidified her resolve. She methodically worked her way up, from caseworker to coordinator, and finally to her current role as a Program Director at a community health center.\n\nNow 44, Lina lives a life of purpose. Her apartment in the Inner Richmond is her sanctuary, a quiet space filled with books and photos of her chosen family\u2014a tight-knit group of friends. Her daily routine is a familiar rhythm: a brisk morning walk in Golden Gate Park, then the 2.8-mile Muni ride to work. Her days are a demanding mix of grant writing, managing staff, and, her favorite part, running a wellness workshop for immigrant teens. At an income of $115,000, she feels stable but is acutely aware of the affordability crisis her clients face.\n\nLina is deeply connected to San Francisco, not just as a resident but as a caregiver to its most vulnerable. She dreams of securing permanent funding for a youth mentorship program, a legacy she hopes to build. On quiet evenings, she imagines a future where she has more time for herself\u2014perhaps traveling to the Philippines to trace her family\u2019s history. But for now, her purpose is here, woven into the fabric of the city she tirelessly works to heal."

Her father sat at the kitchen table with a newly arrived family, their faces etched with worry. He patiently explained a rental agreement in a gentle mix of Tagalog and English. In that moment, watching him build a bridge for them, Lina didn't just see her father; she saw her future. It was the first time she understood that *bayanihan* wasn't just a word, but something you build for others.\n\n2.\nShe was 25 and utterly drained from her first year as a caseworker. After weeks of frantic calls, she\u2019d finally stopped an eviction for a family in the Mission. When the mother, clutching her sick child\u2019s hand, hugged her tight and whispered \u201cSalamat, Ate,\u201d (Thank you, big sister), the city's noise faded. The weight of it all nearly crushed her, but that one moment of pure, desperate gratitude became her anchor. It was the victory that taught her she could bear the weight.\n\n3.\nLast year, during a brutal grant-writing season, she walked into Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled through the eucalyptus trees, muffling the city's hum. Standing by the Conservatory of Flowers, she watched the sturdy, ancient plants and felt a profound sense of peace. The park reminded her that even in a chaotic city, there are pockets of resilience that simply endure. She returned to her office not with a solution, but with the strength to keep fighting for one.\n\n4.\nIn her wellness workshop a few months ago, a shy Peruvian teenager named Mateo, who hadn't spoken for weeks, quietly shared a poem he\u2019d written about feeling invisible. The other kids didn't just listen; they snapped their fingers in solidarity. Lina\u2019s heart swelled. It wasn't a policy win, but this small act of trust\u2014of a boy finding his voice in a room she had created\u2014felt more significant than any grant. This was the legacy she was building.\n\n5.\nLast Thanksgiving, her Inner Richmond apartment was overflowing with the sounds of laughter and the scents of turkey and pancit. Her chosen family\u2014a teacher, a chef, a designer\u2014crowded around her small table. Raising a glass, her best friend toasted \"to Lina, who holds the city together.\" For a moment, Lina wasn't a program director or a caregiver; she was just one of them, held by the community she had built for herself. It was a feeling of pure, uncomplicated belonging."
