Born to Elena Flores, a celebrated Mexican-American muralist from the Mission District, and David Cohen, a sharp, East Coast-transplant public defender, Mateo\u2019s childhood in the Inner Richmond was a loving negotiation between two vibrant worlds. He learned to appreciate the fiery passion of his mother\u2019s art and the structured intellectualism of his father\u2019s legal work, celebrating both D\u00eda de los Muertos and Hanukkah with equal sincerity. This dual heritage made him a natural observer and mediator, skills that would later define his professional life.\n\nHis educational journey was deeply influenced by witnessing the struggles of his peers. While his friends chased tech fortunes, Mateo was drawn to the complex inner lives of people around him. After earning his BA from SF State, a key turning point came while volunteering at a youth center, where he saw firsthand the impact of family trauma on adolescents. This solidified his path, leading him to a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology. Now, as a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist for a community health organization, he serves low-income families, using his bicultural understanding to build trust where others cannot.\n\nAt 35, Mateo\u2019s life is one of intentional balance. He lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment near the Panhandle, a perfect launchpad for his 2.5-mile bicycle commute. His days are emotionally demanding, filled with sessions helping others navigate their lives. To decompress, he runs through Golden Gate Park or cooks meals with friends from his tight-knit social circle, a mix of fellow therapists and old neighborhood pals. A serious relationship ended a year ago, leaving him to cautiously re-enter the city\u2019s complex dating scene.\n\nMateo's connection to San Francisco is profound; he loves its foggy mornings, its history of activism, and its acceptance of eccentricity. His dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. He aspires to start a specialized therapy group for bicultural teens struggling with identity. Personally, he hopes to build a lasting partnership and perhaps a family of his own, creating a new, unique blend of traditions, much like the one that shaped him."

In one hand, he held a warm, jelly-filled sufganiyah from his father. With the other, he pointed to a photo of his Abuela on his mother\u2019s vibrant ofrenda. He looked between his parents and felt no conflict, only a profound, warm sense of completeness. It wasn\u2019t a choice between worlds; it was simply *his* world. This quiet moment became the blueprint for his understanding of identity.\n\n2.\nHe was 13, perched on a scaffold in Balmy Alley, the air thick with aerosol paint. His mother handed him a fine brush. \"Just this hummingbird's eye, mijo. You have the steady hand.\" Carefully, he daubed a tiny speck of black. Looking down at the vibrant, sprawling story below, he felt an electric pride. It wasn't just paint; it was a public heartbeat. He learned then that stories, even painful ones, could be transformed into something beautiful and shared.\n\n3.\nAt 20, he was volunteering at a Fillmore youth center. A quiet 14-year-old who never spoke finally whispered to him about hiding in his room during his parents\u2019 screaming matches. In that moment, Mateo saw the boy\u2019s entire world shrink to the size of that bedroom. The abstract concept of \u201cfamily trauma\u201d became a knot in his own stomach. It was a flash of absolute clarity that ignited his path; he wasn\u2019t just going to help, he was going to learn how to heal this specific wound.\n\n4.\nHe was 16, watching his father, David, methodically stirring soup after a grueling day in court. \"Everyone deserves a defense, Mateo,\" he said, his voice tired but firm. \"My job isn't to judge them. It's to make sure the system sees them.\" The sheer intellectual and ethical rigor of that statement struck Mateo deeply. It taught him that empathy wasn't just a feeling; it was a disciplined practice of seeing the person behind their circumstance, a principle that now guides every one of his therapy sessions.\n\n5.\nIt was the first morning after the breakup last year. As he locked his bike near the Panhandle, the silence was deafening; there was no second click of a U-lock next to his. The fog felt heavier, the city both indifferent and deeply comforting. In that quiet, hollow space, he felt the sharp pain of being truly alone again. It wasn't despair, but a sober recalibration\u2014a return to self-reliance and a quiet promise to be more intentional with his heart next time."
