Born to Cantonese immigrants who poured their life savings and boundless hope into their new American life, Mei was expected to ascend. Her parents envisioned a doctor or a lawyer, a tangible symbol of their success. She was a dutiful daughter, excelling in school, but she felt a pull not toward prestige, but toward the unspoken sorrows she witnessed in her community\u2014the elderly man who bought only a single onion each day, the young mother whose eyes held a deep weariness.\n\nHer journey to UC Berkeley was a source of immense family pride, though her choice to major in sociology was a quiet act of rebellion. The true turning point came during a volunteer internship at a community health clinic. There, she translated for monolingual seniors and helped families navigate bewildering healthcare bureaucracy. She saw that healing was more than just medicine; it was about being seen and heard. This realization compelled her to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, a decision that initially disappointed her parents but ultimately defined her purpose.\n\nNow 49, Mei is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major San Francisco hospital system. Her commute is zero miles; a converted bedroom in her quiet Inner Sunset apartment serves as her office and sanctuary. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, her calm voice a lifeline for patients grappling with chronic illness, grief, and the psychic weight of being a caregiver. She listens to their stories against the backdrop of fog rolling over Twin Peaks, a constant, gentle presence.\n\nThough she never married or had children, her life is rich with connection. She maintains a close circle of friends\u2014other therapists and healthcare workers\u2014and has a profound, if professional, intimacy with her patients. Her connection to San Francisco is etched into her routines: morning walks in Golden Gate Park, enjoying the scent of eucalyptus, and Saturday dim sum with her now-retired parents, who finally understand and respect the path she chose. Her aspiration isn't grand; she dreams of starting a pro-bono support group for the adult children of immigrants who have become their parents' caregivers, a way of honoring her roots and healing a wound she knows intimately."

He\u2019d inspect the onions with excruciating care before choosing one, just one, which he paid for with gloved hands. It wasn't about money; it was the crushing loneliness of that single onion. Mei felt a quiet ache, a sudden, clear understanding that poverty had many faces, and the deepest kind was the one nobody spoke about. That ache became the compass for her life\u2019s work, a pull toward unspoken sorrows.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, during her clinic internship, she translated for Mrs. Fong, whose hands trembled as a doctor explained a confusing diagnosis. Ignoring the medical jargon for a moment, Mei asked her in Cantonese what she was truly afraid of. The woman\u2019s shoulders sagged with relief as she confessed her fear of being a burden. In that instant, Mei understood. Healing wasn\u2019t in the prescription; it was in bridging the chasm of fear and language. The path to social work became clear and non-negotiable.\n\n3.\nIt was a telehealth call two years ago, the fog obscuring Twin Peaks behind her screen. A young man described the relentless duty of caring for his immigrant mother, his voice cracking with exhaustion. Mei saw her own reflection in his story\u2014the cultural weight, the silent guilt, the profound love. The call ended, but his weariness stayed with her. That\u2019s when her quiet dream solidified into a tangible goal: she would build a space for them, the caregivers, to honor their struggle and help them breathe again.\n\n4.\nLast year, over Saturday dim sum, her father paused mid-chew. He spoke of his old friend, Ah-Fung, lost and confused by his doctors, and how his son didn't know how to help. He then looked at Mei, his gaze finally clear of old expectations, and said, \u201cWhat you do is important.\u201d He wasn\u2019t praising a title, but her purpose. The weight of his past disappointment lifted completely, replaced by a quiet, shared understanding that tasted sweeter than any dessert.\n\n5.\nOn a walk last week, sunlight filtered through the eucalyptus trees in Golden Gate Park. The air was cool and damp, thick with the scent of earth. For a moment, she just stood there, breathing it in. This was her hard-won peace. Not the life her parents had planned, but one she had carefully built, session by session, story by story. San Francisco wasn't just a city; it was a witness to her life\u2014the fog a comforting blanket, the park a place to exhale the sorrows she carried for others."
