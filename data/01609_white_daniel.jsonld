His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his lofted bed to the humming 3D printers and CNC machine that dominate the ground floor. Growing up in Richmond, Daniel was raised by a mechanic father who taught him the logic of machines, not textbooks. While his peers aimed for college, Daniel found more satisfaction in disassembling and rebuilding engines, his hands greasy and his mind clear. Formal education felt abstract and distant; the tangible world of gears and circuits was his true calling.\n\nAfter high school, he drifted through odd jobs, from bike repair to helping a set builder for a local theater. The turning point came when he answered an online ad for a workshop assistant. An aging industrial designer in San Francisco needed help managing his small-scale fabrication shop. For two years, Daniel absorbed everything, learning to translate digital designs into physical objects. When the owner retired and moved to Oregon, he offered Daniel the chance to take over the lease and the equipment. It was a terrifying leap, but it felt like the only path forward.\n\nNow 27, Daniel\u2019s life is a cycle of production. He wakes to the smell of machine oil and coffee, spending his days fulfilling small-batch orders for local artists, startups, and architectural firms. He\u2019s a crucial but mostly invisible part of the city\u2019s creative ecosystem. His social life is sparse but meaningful, consisting of a few other makers in the neighborhood and the familiar bartenders at a nearby dive bar. He\u2019s quietly seeing a graphic designer he met through a client, a relationship that feels as tentative and promising as his business.\n\nDaniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tethered entirely to his Dogpatch neighborhood. He loves its industrial past and creative present, a stark contrast to the gleaming tech campuses elsewhere. His dream isn\u2019t wealth, but self-sufficiency. He aspires to one day buy the workshop, creating a stable hub for independent creators like himself\u2014a place where tangible skills are valued, ensuring his small corner of the city remains a place where things are still *made*."
