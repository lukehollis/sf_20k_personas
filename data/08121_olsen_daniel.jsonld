The only son of a union carpenter and a public-school teacher in Des Moines, Daniel was raised on the values of hard work and public service. This led him to pursue a Master\u2019s in Public Policy, driven by a youthful idealism to effect meaningful change from within the system.\n\nHis turning point came during a grueling internship in Washington D.C., where he grew disillusioned by the glacial pace of legislative change. He saw that the real power, the force actively shaping the modern world, was in the private sector. Believing he could do more good (and live more comfortably) with a different kind of influence, he pivoted, earning a J.D. from Berkeley Law.\n\nDaniel was immediately drawn into the gravitational pull of San Francisco\u2019s tech industry. He joined a prestigious firm specializing in intellectual property and corporate law, rapidly distinguishing himself with his sharp mind and tireless work ethic. He made partner at 41, a career pinnacle that came at a personal cost\u2014his marriage dissolved a year later, a casualty of his relentless ambition and the 80-hour workweeks that pursuit demanded.\n\nNow 43, Daniel lives a life of curated efficiency in a sleek SoMa condominium. His commute is an elevator ride to the building\u2019s gym, followed by hours in his state-of-the-art home office overlooking the Bay Bridge. His social life consists mainly of networking events and dinners with clients. While he appreciates the city\u2019s vibrancy from his insulated perch, he rarely partakes in its grittier, more spontaneous culture.\n\nLately, however, a restlessness has set in. Having achieved the financial and professional security he craved, Daniel feels the faint echo of his public policy idealism. He\u2019s begun contemplating a shift, aspiring to leverage his position to lead his firm\u2019s pro-bono division or mentor startups focused on social good. He hopes to find a way to merge the two Daniels: the Iowa idealist and the San Francisco powerhouse."
