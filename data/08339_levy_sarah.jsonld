Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this, taking her from her small rent-controlled apartment down a flight of creaky stairs into the quiet, curated space of Sterling Modern, the art gallery she helps run.\n\nRaised in the manicured suburbs of Walnut Creek by a pragmatic dentist and a high school math teacher, Sarah was an anomaly. While her parents valued clear career paths, Sarah was drawn to the narratives hidden in things. She pursued a Bachelor's in English Literature at SF State, finding solace in stories but no clear professional direction. For a decade after graduation, she drifted through administrative jobs, each one feeling more beige and soulless than the last.\n\nThe turning point came at 34. On a whim, she wandered into Sterling Modern, a small gallery showcasing emerging Bay Area artists. She was captivated not just by the challenging, vibrant art, but by the elderly owner, Mr. Sterling, who spoke about each piece with fierce, paternal love. It was an epiphany. A week later, she quit her corporate job and offered to work for him for next to nothing. Mr. Sterling, recognizing a kindred spirit, hired her as his assistant.\n\nTwelve years later, she is the gallery\u2019s anchor. Her days are a gentle rhythm of brewing coffee, updating the inventory, talking with the artists who treat the space as a second home, and writing the small, insightful placards that give each work its voice. Her relationship with the now-frail Mr. Sterling is one of deep loyalty and unspoken understanding; she is the inheritor of his legacy, if not its owner. Her social life is small but rich, comprised of a few local artists and the barista at her corner cafe. A past long-term relationship with an architect ended when he couldn't understand why she wouldn't leave her \"little job\" for a grander life in Los Angeles.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to own the gallery, but to preserve it. She sees Sterling Modern as a bulwark against the city's relentless churn of tech and capital. Her greatest hope is to be the one to give a brilliant, unknown artist their first show, to be the quiet guardian who ensures that in a city obsessed with the future, the stories of the present have a place to be told."
