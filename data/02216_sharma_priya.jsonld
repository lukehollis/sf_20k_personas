The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont, Priya was raised on the familiar narrative of upward mobility. Her parents, a disciplined engineer and a meticulous homemaker, pushed her toward a stable, respectable career. She obliged, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a community college, the first step on a ladder she had no desire to climb.\n\nThe turning point came not as a rebellion, but as a duty. When her mother was diagnosed with a degenerative illness in Priya\u2019s late twenties, she became her primary caregiver. The years of tracking appointments, managing medications, and providing intimate, daily care reshaped her. The sterile scent of rubbing alcohol became more familiar than perfume, the language of symptoms more natural than spreadsheets. In her mother's final, quiet moments, Priya discovered her true vocation: not in managing assets, but in preserving dignity.\n\nAfter her mother's passing, she returned to school, earning her Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification. The career change baffled her father but gave Priya a profound sense of purpose. She found a position at a mid-sized assisted living facility in the Richmond District, and when a small staff apartment opened up on the ground floor, she took it. Her commute became a thirty-second walk down a hallway.\n\nNow at 51, Priya\u2019s daily routine is a gentle rhythm of service. She wakes before the sun, dons her scrubs, and begins her rounds, treating her patients as the neighbors they literally are. She knows who likes their tea with honey and who needs an extra blanket. Her social life is woven into her work\u2014lunches with fellow nurses and conversations with the residents' visiting families. The boundaries between her job and her home are blurred, but she finds comfort in the consistency. On her days off, she takes long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park or picks up pastries from a favorite Russian bakery on Geary Boulevard.\n\nHer hopes are not grand. Her son, a source of immense pride, is studying engineering at UC Davis, fulfilling the dream she set aside. For herself, Priya dreams of quietude: to continue providing compassionate care, to honor her mother's memory through her work, and perhaps one day, to take a trip to the serene beaches of Kauai she\u2019s only seen in pictures\u2014a small, personal reward for a life dedicated to the comfort of others."
