The son of a pragmatic Filipino immigrant father who fixed cars and a second-generation Irish-American mother who worked as a library aide, Nico\u2019s world was a blend of practicality and quiet dreams. It was his mother who cultivated his artistic eye, spending weekends with him not at the park, but wandering through the halls of the de Young and SFMOMA, teaching him to find the stories hidden in brushstrokes and sculpture.\n\nThis early immersion in culture set him on a clear path. He attended San Francisco State University for his undergraduate degree, immersing himself in the city\u2019s vibrant, gritty arts scene. While many of his peers were lured by the promise of the first dot-com boom, Nico doubled down on his passion, pursuing an MFA in Curatorial Practice at the California College of the Arts. He learned that his true talent wasn't just in appreciating art, but in contextualizing it and creating conversations around it.\n\nHis career began with humble gallery assistant roles, but his sharp eye and tireless work ethic saw him rise steadily. Now, as the Director of a prominent Hayes Valley gallery, he navigates the deft balance of commerce and curation. He\u2019s known for championing challenging work while still keeping the lights on, a skill honed over two decades in the industry.\n\nNico\u2019s life is rooted in the city\u2019s rhythms. He lives in a lovingly restored Victorian flat in Duboce Triangle with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named David. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute is a daily meditation, a chance to watch the city wake up as he pedals past Dolores Park. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or enjoying quiet dinners with a close-knit circle of friends from the art and design worlds.\n\nAt 46, Nico feels a sense of earned contentment. His primary aspiration is to use his position to launch the careers of emerging Bay Area artists, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds like his own. He has watched San Francisco morph and change, yet his connection to it remains unbreakable\u2014a native son who found his place not by chasing trends, but by curating the beauty within the city he has always called home."

It doesn't have to be a picture of something to feel like something.\" In that moment, staring into the deep, humming crimson, he understood that an object could hold an emotion. It was the first time he felt the quiet, powerful language of art, a dialect he would spend the rest of his life learning to speak.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, at a party in a cavernous SoMa loft. His friend from State, smelling of new money, was excitedly explaining stock options. Nico, whose hands still had a faint scent of gesso from a late-night studio class, felt a brief, sharp pang of insecurity. Then, looking at the frantic energy in the room, he felt a quiet, defiant peace settle over him. He was choosing the tangible mess of creation over the invisible promise of code. That night solidified his identity, a vow to pursue meaning over profit.\n\n3.\nThe night he sold the first challenging piece he\u2019d truly championed still feels electric. He was 32, and the artist was a recent CCA grad whose sculptures were notoriously difficult. An influential collector was frowning at it, and Nico\u2019s boss looked nervous. Nico approached, not with a sales pitch, but with the story of the artist's struggle and vision. The collector\u2019s expression softened. It wasn't about the commission; it was the visceral thrill of successfully translating an artist\u2019s fragile idea into something another person could finally, truly see.\n\n4.\nHe remembers standing with David in the skeletal frame of their Duboce Triangle flat, just after they\u2019d bought it. Dust motes danced in the single beam of light from the bay window. Surrounded by exposed lath, David was already sketching a garden plan on a scrap of drywall, while Nico instinctively mapped out where the art would hang. In that shared, hopeful silence, he knew he wasn\u2019t just buying a property; he was co-curating a life, building a permanent, loving frame for their future.\n\n5.\nLast year, visiting a drafty Bayview studio, a young painter\u2014the daughter of Salvadoran immigrants\u2014showed him her work. She spoke with a shy fire about her family\u2019s skepticism and her own unshakable need to create. Nico saw a mirror of his own story. Offering her a spot in his gallery\u2019s emerging artist showcase felt less like a business decision and more like fulfilling a debt. This, he realized, was the point of his earned position: to be the person who could open the door for those who came after."
