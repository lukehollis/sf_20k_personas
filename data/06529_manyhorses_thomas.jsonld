            "value": "Thomas Manyhorses carries the weight and wisdom of two worlds within him. Born to Lakota parents on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, his first memories are of vast, open skies and the resonant beat of a drum. When he was six, seeking better economic prospects, his family relocated to Oakland, joining the sprawling, often invisible community of urban Native Americans in the Bay Area. This move defined his youth, a constant navigation between the heritage spoken at home and the concrete reality of East Bay schools where he was simply \"Other.\"\n\nThis feeling of being an intermediary sparked a deep sense of purpose. A transformative trip back to the reservation as a teenager solidified his path. He saw the systemic challenges his relatives faced and knew his life's work would be in bridging gaps. He pursued a Bachelor's in Sociology at SF State, followed by a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on community organizing and policy.\n\nHis career has been a direct extension of his calling. For fifteen years, Thomas has worked as a Program Manager for a non-profit dedicated to supporting the Bay Area\u2019s intertribal Native population. From his home office in the Mission District, he spends his days on Zoom calls securing funding, managing youth mentorship programs, and coordinating services for elders. The 0.0-mile commute allows him to be deeply embedded in his neighborhood, often taking midday walks past the vibrant murals and community gardens, feeling the pulse of its long history of activism and resilience.\n\nHis partner of twelve years, Elena, a Din\u00e9 artist he met at a community event, shares his commitment. Their apartment is filled with both contemporary art and traditional crafts, a quiet sanctuary from the city's hustle. Thomas\u2019s San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or tourist landmarks; it\u2019s the Intertribal Friendship House in Oakland, the annual Stanford Powwow, and the small gatherings that keep cultural traditions alive. His ultimate dream is to secure a permanent, community-owned cultural center in San Francisco, a visible anchor for the First Peoples of the land and for all the displaced children, like him, who came after."
