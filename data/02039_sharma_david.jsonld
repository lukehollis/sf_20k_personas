The son of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, David grew up straddling two worlds. At home, his engineer father and librarian mother preached the gospel of education and stability; at school, he navigated the sprawling, sun-drenched suburbs of the Bay Area. He was studious and methodical, traits that led him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree.\n\nUninspired by the chaotic energy of the first dot-com bubble, David sought a more structured path. He earned a Master's degree in Statistics, fascinated by the elegant certainty of numbers and predictive models. This became his entry into the world of finance, not as a high-stakes trader, but as a risk analyst. He spent decades meticulously building a career at a downtown San Francisco firm, his cautious, data-driven approach earning him a reputation for reliability. He survived the 2008 crash by being the one who had warned his superiors about over-leveraged assets, a move that cemented his ascent to department manager.\n\nHis personal life followed a similarly steady trajectory. He met his wife, Priya, a landscape architect, through mutual friends from Cal. They bought a modest Edwardian home in Noe Valley, raising their daughter, Anjali, there. His key turning point wasn't a crisis, but a slow-dawning realization after Anjali left for college: he had achieved the stability his parents dreamed of, but his world had become small.\n\nThe pandemic-induced shift to remote work, which became permanent for him, solidified this new reality. His 0.0-mile commute transformed his life. His mornings are no longer a frantic BART ride but a leisurely walk with their rescue terrier to a local caf\u00e9 on 24th Street. His office is a sunlit room overlooking his wife\u2019s meticulously curated garden. His connection to San Francisco has become hyperlocal; he knows the names of his neighbors and the baristas, and his days are measured by neighborhood rhythms. Now, at 54, his ambitions have shifted inward. He hopes to mentor younger analysts, travel with Priya to see the gardens of Japan, and finally have the time to master the complex recipes from his mother's kitchen, finding richness not in financial reports, but in a life deeply and quietly lived."
