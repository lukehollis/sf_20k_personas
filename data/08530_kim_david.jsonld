Born in the fog-drenched avenues of the Richmond District, he was the only son of Korean immigrants who equated success with a stable profession. His father, a man whose hands were perpetually rough from the chemicals at their family-owned dry-cleaning business, envisioned David as an engineer or accountant. David, however, was drawn to words and images, secretly filling notebooks with poetry while his parents believed he was studying calculus.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State University, tentatively declaring a major in Art History. The campus felt like a world of boundless possibility, a stark contrast to the starchy scent of pressed shirts that had defined his youth. But his academic journey was cut short. When he was 20, his father suffered a severe stroke, and David dropped out of college to run the family business. Duty came first. For nearly two decades, his life was a cycle of inventory, customer service, and managing the aging machinery, his artistic ambitions folded away like a clean suit. His brief marriage in his late twenties buckled under the weight of his quiet resentment and long hours.\n\nThe turning point came at 45. After his mother passed, David sold the business that had been both his inheritance and his prison. With a modest nest egg, he found a small, rent-controlled apartment in a gritty, vibrant building on the border of SoMa and the Mission. By a stroke of luck, a small non-profit theater company operating on the ground floor needed an administrative assistant. He took the job.\n\nNow, at 54, David\u2019s world is contained within a few city blocks. His commute is a simple walk downstairs. He is the stable center in a world of chaotic artists, the one who ensures grants are filed and schedules are kept. His colleagues, mostly decades younger, see him as a kind, enigmatic anchor. They don\u2019t know that in the quiet of his apartment, surrounded by books he finally has time to read, David is slowly, painstakingly writing a play\u2014a story about a dry-cleaner\u2019s son in a city of fog and dreams. He has no grand aspirations for it to be produced; for now, it is enough just to create."
