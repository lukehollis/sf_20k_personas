The son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up amidst the scent of dried goods and fresh produce in his family\u2019s small grocery store in the Richmond District. His parents pinned their hopes on him, envisioning a prestigious career in medicine. David dutifully enrolled in a pre-med program at UC Berkeley, but his heart wasn't in it. The turning point came during his sophomore year when a family health crisis required the intervention of a hospital social worker. Watching this compassionate professional navigate his family\u2019s fear and confusion with grace and empathy ignited a new calling within him.\n\nHe changed his major, eventually earning a Master of Social Work (MSW). David began his career in a bustling city hospital, providing counseling and support to patients and their families. He found the work profoundly meaningful but emotionally taxing. The relentless pace left him little room for his own life. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, became an unexpected catalyst for change. As the world moved online, so did his practice.\n\nNow, at 45, David runs a private clinical practice entirely from a sun-drenched second bedroom in his Inner Sunset apartment. His 0.0-mile commute gives him back hours each day. His mornings begin not with a crowded MUNI bus, but with a quiet run through Golden Gate Park, his camera often in hand. He spends his days in telehealth sessions, helping clients navigate the complex anxieties of modern life\u2014burnout, loneliness, and grief.\n\nThough single, David maintains a close-knit circle of friends from college and a local hiking group. He\u2019s a fixture at his neighborhood\u2019s farmers' market and has a deep, quiet appreciation for the city he\u2019s always called home. His dream is to one day publish a book of his photography, capturing the overlooked, serene moments of the city that contrast so sharply with the emotional storms he helps others weather every day. He seeks balance, both for himself and for those he serves."
