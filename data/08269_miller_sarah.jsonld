Raised in Redding, California, under the doctrine of blue-collar pragmatism, her world was one of practicality. Her father, a mechanic, and her mother, a retail manager, preached the value of a stable job over a lofty passion. Following their advice, Sarah pursued an Associate\u2019s degree in Business Administration at Shasta College, a straightforward path to a secure future.\n\nThe great pivot in her life came at age 20. She moved to San Francisco, not for ambition, but for love, following her high school sweetheart who had been accepted to SF State. For two years, she saw the city through his eyes, a vibrant backdrop to their shared life. But the city\u2019s ambitious hum eventually pulled them apart. He found a new crowd and new dreams, and Sarah, at 22, found herself alone, with a lease in the Inner Richmond and a sudden, urgent need to build a life that was solely her own.\n\nNecessity led her to an administrative assistant role at a mid-sized financial firm downtown. It was a good job, leveraging her degree and offering stability when she needed it most. Then, the pandemic shifted her world again. Her role became permanently remote, and her commute shrank to the 0.0 miles between her bed and her desk. Now, her rent-controlled apartment is both a sanctuary and a cage. Her days are a cycle of logging into spreadsheets and virtual meetings, a digital ghost in her own home.\n\nTo combat the isolation, Sarah forces a routine upon the city. After logging off, she walks. She explores every corner of Golden Gate Park, finds solace in the fog rolling over Clement Street\u2019s markets, and has a favorite bench overlooking Ocean Beach. Her social life is small but meaningful\u2014a tight-knit circle of friends met through a kickball league years ago. Her true passion, however, unfolds in the evenings. The finance job funds her growing pottery hobby, her hands finding in clay the tangible, creative outlet her work lacks. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day sell her own ceramics at a local market, transforming her quiet resilience into something she can hold."
