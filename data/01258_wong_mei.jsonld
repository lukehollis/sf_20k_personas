The daughter of two nomadic cultural anthropologists, she was raised without a fixed address or a singular ethnic identity. Her parents, who met in Berkeley, viewed cultural labels as restrictive boxes, and \"Mei Lin Wong\" was a name chosen from a beloved poet, not a declaration of heritage. Her childhood was a mosaic of temporary homes\u2014from a dusty dig site in Peru to a scholarly flat in Kyoto\u2014where her education consisted of field notes, museum visits, and a deep, parent-led immersion in the patterns of human behavior.\n\nLacking any formal degrees, a teenage Mei Lin found herself in San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a haven for the unconventional. She took an administrative job at a boutique real estate firm, simply to pay rent. There, surrounded by sales agents chasing commissions, she discovered her true calling in the spreadsheets. She saw stories in market fluctuations and poetry in zoning codes. While others networked, Mei Lin taught herself statistical modeling and macroeconomics, devouring every book and online course she could find.\n\nThe 2008 financial crash was her turning point. As her firm floundered, Mei Lin\u2019s uncanny ability to predict neighborhood micro-recoveries made her indispensable. She left sales support behind and carved out a niche as a pure analyst. Now, as a Senior Real Estate Analyst, she works from her minimalist Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a seamless transition from life to work.\n\nHer days are structured with disciplined precision. A 6 AM espresso from a local roaster, hours of intense data immersion, and a midday break at a Mission climbing gym to decompress. Her social life is as curated as her data sets: a small, loyal circle of fellow climbers and a monthly book club. She sees San Francisco not just as a home, but as a living, breathing dataset she understands intimately. Her dream isn't a bigger title, but to one day use her analytical prowess to help non-profits and community land trusts navigate the city\u2019s brutal market, finally using her skills to build something more tangible than a forecast."
