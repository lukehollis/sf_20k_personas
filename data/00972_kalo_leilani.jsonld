Born to a Filipina mother who arrived in the 1960s and a second-generation Hawaiian father, her heritage is a testament to the city\u2019s Pacific soul. She grew up in the Excelsior District, in a small house filled with the scent of adobo and the sound of ukulele music. Her upbringing was not one of academic pressure but of community resilience. Her parents, a seamstress and a Muni driver, instilled in her a profound work ethic and an even deeper sense of empathy for the struggles of working-class families.\n\nAfter high school, Leilani drifted. She didn\u2019t see the point of a four-year university, feeling disconnected from its formal structure. Instead, she spent her twenties in the churn of service jobs\u2014barista, server, retail clerk\u2014learning more about human nature from her customers and coworkers than any textbook could teach. The turning point came at 30, when she saw kids in her own neighborhood falling through the same cracks she had narrowly avoided. A fierce, protective instinct ignited within her.\n\nDriven by this new purpose, Leilani enrolled in a counseling certificate program at City College of San Francisco, attending night classes while working days. It was a grueling decade, but she emerged with her credentials and a job offer from the middle school just three blocks from her childhood home. For the last fifteen years, her commute has been a short, familiar walk.\n\nNow 50, Leilani is a pillar of her community. A brief, early marriage ended amicably, leaving her with a strong sense of independence. Her life is woven into her neighborhood; she knows the grocers by name, tends a small garden of herbs and tomatoes in her backyard, and her closest friends are fellow teachers and old neighborhood pals. Her hope is simple: to secure more funding for the school's wellness programs. She dreams of a future where every student she sees feels supported and understood, creating a stronger, kinder San Francisco, one kid at a time."
