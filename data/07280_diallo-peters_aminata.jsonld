            "value": "Aminata Diallo-Peters was born into a symphony of influences in Oakland. Her father, a jazz bassist with roots in Senegal, filled their home with rhythm and history, while her mother, a meticulous city librarian, taught her the power of a well-preserved archive. The hyphen in her name was a bridge she walked daily, connecting the vibrant warmth of her West African heritage with the structured, literary world of her American upbringing. This duality became the lens through which she would view all art.\n\nHer path led her east for a Master's in Art History, where she specialized in post-colonial theory and the art of the African diaspora. While a promising academic career awaited, Aminata felt a growing disconnect from the ivory tower. A post-graduate fellowship at a San Francisco arts non-profit proved to be her turning point. The immediacy of working with living artists and tangible objects felt more honest and impactful than academic publishing. She chose the gallery over the lecture hall and never looked back.\n\nNow, at 51, Aminata's life and work are seamlessly intertwined. She lives in a spacious, light-filled loft in Hayes Valley, directly above the contemporary art gallery where she is the Senior Curator. Her zero-mile commute means her first cup of coffee is often taken while reviewing installation plans, the quiet hum of the gallery below her floorboards a constant, comforting presence. After an early marriage ended amicably in her thirties, she poured her formidable energy into her career, becoming a fierce advocate and mentor for emerging Black and Indigenous artists.\n\nHer days are a mix of grant writing, studio visits, and the delicate diplomacy of curating challenging exhibitions. Her social life revolves around this world\u2014dinners with artists, board meetings, and gallery openings. Aminata\u2019s dream is not of personal glory, but of legacy. She is relentlessly focused on building the gallery\u2019s permanent collection, securing an endowment that will ensure it remains a sanctuary and a platform for underrepresented voices long after she has gone. She is not just curating art; she is cementing a chapter of San Francisco\u2019s cultural history."
