Raised in the working-class Irish enclave of South Boston, he was the son of a firefighter and a public school teacher who instilled in him a powerful sense of civic duty. This led him to Georgetown, where he earned a Master's in Public Policy, dreaming of shaping legislation and working for a progressive think tank in D.C.\n\nHis turning point came during a summer internship. To pay down his student loans, he took a short-term analyst role at a top-tier consulting firm. He discovered, to his surprise, an innate talent for deconstructing complex business problems and presenting elegant, data-driven solutions. The intellectual rigor and brisk pace were intoxicating. The idealism of public policy slowly gave way to the pragmatic, high-stakes world of corporate strategy. He told himself he was still fixing things, just on a different scale.\n\nA major tech client brought him to San Francisco for a six-month project twelve years ago; he never left. The city\u2019s blend of ambition and bohemian spirit captivated him, even if he mostly observed it from a distance. His career flourished, but it cost him a fianc\u00e9e who grew tired of competing with late-night calls and last-minute flights.\n\nNow, at 42, Liam\u2019s world has shrunk to the 1,200 square feet of his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. The pandemic normalized his work-from-home status, turning his once-dynamic career into a static existence. His commute is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to his standing desk. His days are a disciplined cycle of Zoom meetings with global teams, meticulous data analysis, and delivered meals from his favorite local spots. His most consistent social interaction is the nod he shares with the barista at Ritual Coffee Roasters.\n\nA quiet dissatisfaction has begun to seep into the cracks of his well-ordered life. He has financial security but lacks genuine connection. Liam finds himself dreaming not of a partnership at the firm, but of using his skills pro-bono for a neighborhood non-profit, or perhaps opening a small, inefficient bookstore in North Beach\u2014a life measured in conversations and worn paper rather than billable hours and quarterly reports."
