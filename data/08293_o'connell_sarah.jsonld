            "value": "Born Park Min-jun in Seoul, South Korea, Sarah O\u2019Connell\u2019s life began with an act of profound dislocation. Adopted at nine months old by a loving, boisterous Irish-American couple from Sacramento, her upbringing was a warm paradox. She was cherished by the O'Connells, but in their predominantly white, suburban world, her face in the mirror was a constant reminder of a history she couldn't access. This duality\u2014of being deeply loved yet feeling fundamentally \"other\"\u2014planted the seeds for her life\u2019s work.\n\nHer educational journey was a search for answers. After completing her undergraduate degree at UC Davis, she felt a pull towards a city that celebrated difference. Moving to the Bay Area for her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley was a turning point. Surrounded by a vibrant, diverse Asian community for the first time, Sarah began to untangle the complexities of her own identity. She realized her innate empathy, honed by years of navigating unspoken cultural gaps, was her greatest strength. She chose to specialize in clinical work within healthcare, drawn to helping individuals and families navigate the emotional chaos of illness and loss.\n\nNow 42, Sarah lives and works from her quiet, second-floor apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse, blurring the lines between her professional and personal space. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, where she provides a calm anchor for patients in crisis. To decompress, she walks. Golden Gate Park is her backyard, and the misty expanse of Ocean Beach is her therapy. She finds comfort in her neighborhood\u2019s routines: the steam from a dim sum restaurant, the chatter of Cantonese and Russian on Clement Street, the familiar presence of the coastal fog.\n\nThough content, Sarah is not settled. Her deepest hope is to one day visit Seoul, not as a tourist, but as a daughter searching for echoes of a life she never lived. Professionally, she dreams of opening a small private practice dedicated to counseling transracial adoptees, creating the resource she desperately wished she\u2019d had. For Sarah, San Francisco is more than a city; it\u2019s the place where she finally found the space to assemble the disparate pieces of herself into a coherent, meaningful whole."
