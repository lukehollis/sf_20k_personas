The only daughter of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up amidst the clatter and aromas of their small grocery store in the Sunset District. Her parents preached a doctrine of practicality and tireless work, envisioning a future for her in medicine or engineering. However, Sarah was a quiet observer, more attuned to the unspoken anxieties of her family and neighbors than to physics formulas. The pivotal moment came in her teens when a beloved uncle suffered a severe depressive episode, which was met with shame and silence within the family. Witnessing his struggle and the cultural stigma surrounding it ignited a quiet fire in her to bridge that gap.\n\nForsaking her parents\u2019 preferred path, Sarah pursued a degree in psychology at UC Davis and then returned to the city for her Master of Social Work at SF State. The journey to becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker was a grueling marathon of coursework, unpaid internships, and thousands of supervised hours, but the sense of purpose was her constant fuel.\n\nNow 29, Sarah works for a large San Francisco hospital, but her office is a carefully arranged corner of her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a product of the post-pandemic shift to telehealth, allowing her to provide therapy to patients across the city from her own sanctuary. Her days are a structured sequence of emotionally taxing video calls, helping people navigate illness, grief, and trauma. To decompress, she runs in Golden Gate Park, her breath misting in the cool air, or explores the culinary gems on Clement Street with her partner, Alex, a landscape architect whose connection to the earth grounds her.\n\nHer bond with San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused, far from the gleaming tech campuses downtown. It\u2019s the city of her childhood, of dim sum parlors and foghorns. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but sustainability\u2014both for her clients and herself. She hopes to one day open a small private practice focused on mental health in the AAPI community, creating the safe space her own family never had. For now, she finds meaning in the quiet triumphs of her clients and the comforting embrace of the city that has always been her home."
