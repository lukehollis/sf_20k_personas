The daughter of a pragmatic, third-generation Irish-American carpenter from the Sunset District and a first-generation Chinese immigrant mother who taught piano to neighborhood kids, Maya grew up toggling between two worlds. Her father, Liam O\u2019Connell, instilled a sense of grounded functionality, while her mother, Wei Zheng, filled their small home with the melodies of Chopin and the aroma of simmering broths. This blend of practicality and artistry became the defining characteristic of Maya\u2019s life.\n\nHer path wasn't a straight line toward the arts. Initially, she pursued a more practical business degree at SF State, influenced by her father\u2019s desire for her to have financial stability. The turning point came during a summer internship at a small nonprofit in the Mission, where she was tasked with writing grants to fund a community mural project. Witnessing how spreadsheets and strategic planning could directly enable public art was a revelation. It wasn't just about creating; it was about building the scaffolding that allowed creativity to flourish. She pivoted, completing a Master's in Arts Administration, determined to become that essential bridge.\n\nNow, as Program Director for a mid-sized arts foundation near Civic Center, Maya is in her element. Her days are a flurry of meetings, budget reviews, and passionate advocacy for emerging artists. Her 2.8-mile commute on the Muni J-Church line from her sunny Mission District apartment is a cherished ritual, a time to read or simply watch the city wake up. Her $110,000 salary affords her a comfortable, though not extravagant, life\u2014one where she can support local artists by actually buying their work.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends, a mix of artists and fellow non-profit professionals. Weekends often involve gallery hopping in Dogpatch, Sunday dim sum with her parents in the Richmond, or runs through Dolores Park. Maya\u2019s deepest aspiration is to one day lead her own foundation, focused exclusively on grants for immigrant and first-generation artists. She sees her work as a tribute to her mother\u2019s quiet, unrealized artistic dreams, ensuring that in a city increasingly defined by tech wealth, the diverse voices that truly build its soul have the support they need to be heard."

From the living room, the intricate notes of a Chopin nocturne spilled out, her mother\u2019s hands flying across the keys. It wasn\u2019t a clash, but a harmony. In that moment, Maya understood that the most beautiful things needed the strongest frames. It was the first blueprint of her life\u2019s purpose, shaping her core belief in practical support for the arts.\n\n2.\nIt was a hot June afternoon in the Mission during her college internship. Her grant application, a sterile document of budget lines and projected outcomes, was now a living thing. On a formerly blank wall, an artist was spraying a brilliant streak of teal. A child pointed, wide-eyed. Staring at the mural, the smell of paint mixing with roasting corn from a street cart, Maya felt a surge of purpose. Her numbers had become a wall of color. Her path was suddenly, irrevocably clear.\n\n3.\nHer first year as Program Director, she had to make the call. She told a young sculptor from Oakland his ambitious project was fully funded. There was a sharp intake of breath, then silence, then a choked, \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d In that moment, Maya wasn\u2019t a director; she was a conduit. She felt the weight and the absolute joy of connecting a dream to a reality. The artist's relief echoed her mother's unspoken hopes, solidifying her commitment to this work beyond a simple career.\n\n4.\nLast Sunday, sunlight streamed through the window at the dim sum parlor. Her mother, reaching for a har gow, smiled a rare, unguarded smile. Her father, ever practical, quietly picked up the bill. The familiar clatter of dishes and buzzing chatter grounded her. In her parents\u2019 contented silence, Maya saw her own story: her mother\u2019s artistry and her father\u2019s stability. It wasn't a conflict to be solved, but a legacy to be honored, and these meals were her sacred reminder.\n\n5.\nThe J-Church lurched around the corner by Dolores Park. It was 8:15 AM. Through the scratched window, she saw the city\u2019s morning ballet: dog walkers, tech workers, the tamale lady setting up. This 2.8-mile ride was her moving sanctuary, a time to simply observe. This quiet commute, a book resting in her lap, is where she mentally sketches grant proposals for her own future foundation. It\u2019s where she feels the steady, creative heartbeat of the city she is fighting for."
