Born and raised in a quiet suburb of Columbus, Ohio, to a high school principal and a librarian, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was stable, predictable, and devoid of the artistic chaos she secretly craved. She pursued an English Literature degree at Ohio State, a practical compromise that satisfied her love for stories while appeasing her parents\u2019 desire for a sensible education.\n\nHer definitive turning point arrived during a post-graduation backpacking trip in the early 1990s. The moment she stepped into the foggy, vibrant embrace of San Francisco, she knew she was home. She never used her return ticket. Sarah\u2019s early years in the city were a hustle of waitressing and bookstore jobs, all while volunteering at fringe art galleries in the Mission. It was there she found her true calling: not as an artist, but as a curator of artists, a storyteller for their visual narratives. She worked her way up from sweeping floors to handling sales, eventually becoming the manager of a small, ambitious gallery.\n\nHer personal and professional lives merged when she fell in love with a charismatic sculptor. Together, they bought a derelict live/work warehouse, pouring two decades of life, love, and savings into transforming the ground floor into the prominent gallery she manages today and the upstairs into their sunlit loft. Their partnership ended amicably five years ago when his career pulled him to Berlin; Sarah, inextricably tied to the world they built, chose to stay.\n\nNow 54, Sarah\u2019s daily routine is a seamless flow. She wakes in her loft, surrounded by pieces from past shows, has coffee on her small deck overlooking a shared garden, and then walks downstairs to open the gallery. Her commute is zero miles, but her world is expansive, filled with the artists she champions, the collectors she befriends, and the neighborhood regulars who stop by to chat. While content, she harbors a quiet dream of discovering one last, brilliant young artist to launch into the world. Her deeper aspiration is simpler: to one day lock the gallery door for a month and finally see the museums of Madrid, entirely on her own terms."
