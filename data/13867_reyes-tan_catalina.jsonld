            "value": "Catalina Reyes-Tan is a daughter of San Francisco\u2019s Excelsior district, born from the union of a pragmatic Chinese immigrant father and a warm, second-generation Filipina-American mother. Her childhood home was a vibrant fusion of cultures, filled with the aroma of both adobo and congee, and the sounds of Cantonese, Tagalog, and English. Growing up, she witnessed the daily struggles and fierce resilience of her immigrant neighbors, experiences that planted the seeds for a career in service. This firsthand view of community needs propelled her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor's in Social Work.\n\nHer career began on the front lines as a caseworker, navigating the complex lives of teenagers in the city\u2019s under-resourced communities. A key turning point came five years in, when she realized she could create broader, more lasting change by shaping the programs themselves. This ambition drove her toward management. Today, as a Program Manager, she balances budgets, mentors staff, and secures grants, fighting to keep essential arts, health, and tutoring services available for the next generation.\n\nCatalina now lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 3.7-mile commute on the 5R-Fulton MUNI bus is a cherished ritual\u2014a time for podcasts and observing the city wake up. Though single, her life is rich with connection; a tight-knit circle of friends, many also in the non-profit world, form her chosen family. Weekends are for long walks in Golden Gate Park, exploring the dumpling shops on Clement Street, and hosting potlucks that reflect her own multicultural upbringing.\n\nHer deepest connection to San Francisco is to its unpolished, resilient heart, not its glistening tech facade. She embodies the city's connective tissue, bridging gaps for its most vulnerable youth. Catalina\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of vast wealth, but of stability and impact: to one day become an Executive Director and, against the odds of her non-profit salary, to buy a small condo in the city that is inextricably part of her identity."

Without a word, Catalina\u2019s father brought out a bag of rice and her mother brewed tea. Catalina felt the weight of that silent exchange\u2014of dignity, struggle, and the quiet ways communities held each other together. It wasn't charity; it was survival. That moment became her blueprint for service: a simple, human act of bearing witness and offering what you can.\n\n2.\nFive years into her career as a caseworker, a guarded teen named Javier finally drew her a picture of his childhood home. It was a breakthrough. A month later, budget cuts slashed the art therapy program that had opened him up. She saw the hope flicker out in his eyes, and her frustration was a physical ache. She realized then she couldn't just help one kid at a time; she had to fight for the programs themselves. That day, the caseworker resolved to become an advocate.\n\n3.\nLast winter, during a torrential downpour, her 5R-Fulton bus stalled near Alamo Square. Instead of groans, a woman shared her snacks and a musician quietly played a ukulele. For twenty minutes, the passengers became an accidental village, sharing stories under the foggy windows. Catalina felt a profound sense of belonging, not to a landmark, but to that shared, resilient, imperfect moment. This, she thought, was the real San Francisco\u2014the one she fought for in her office every single day.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, her Inner Richmond apartment buzzed during a potluck. Her friends, all in non-profits, were burned out, trading stories of funding crises. Then Maria, a legal aid lawyer, raised her glass. \u201cTo staying in the fight,\u201d she\u2019d said, her voice thick with emotion. Looking at their faces, Catalina felt a surge of strength. These were her people, her chosen family, anchored by the same fierce hope. Her small apartment didn't just hold furniture; it held a movement fueled by shared meals.\n\n5.\nJust after her 30th birthday, she saw a 'For Sale' sign on a small top-floor condo in the Inner Sunset. She looked up the price on her phone and felt the familiar San Francisco sting of impossibility. But standing there, as the fog rolled in, despair turned into a quiet resolve. It wasn't about wealth; it was about laying down roots in the city that was her entire identity. She vowed then that her work for the city\u2019s future would one day grant her a small piece of it for herself."
