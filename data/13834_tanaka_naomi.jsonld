            "value": "Naomi Tanaka is a third-generation San Franciscan, a *Sansei* whose family history is woven into the city\u2019s cultural fabric. Her grandparents, who were interned at Topaz during WWII, later settled in the Sunset District, establishing a quiet life built on the principle of *gaman*\u2014enduring with silent resilience. Growing up, Naomi felt the unspoken weight of this history. Her parents, a draftsman and a dental hygienist, preached hard work and discouraged emotional displays, leaving Naomi to navigate her own feelings in solitude. This quiet, observant childhood planted the seeds for her future profession.\n\nHer educational journey took her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Master of Social Work. The program gave her the language to understand the intergenerational trauma she had only intuited in her own family. After graduation, she dove into the demanding world of community mental health, working for a city agency. While fulfilling, the high caseloads and bureaucratic friction left her feeling depleted. The turning point came after a particularly challenging case involving a teenager struggling with family pressures that mirrored her own past. She realized she needed more autonomy to provide the deep, nuanced care she believed her clients deserved.\n\nAt 35, Naomi earned her LCSW licensure and took a leap of faith, opening a private practice from a converted office in her Inner Richmond flat. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a seamless blend of life and work. Her days begin with a misty walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her mind before she sees clients\u2014mostly young adults and professionals grappling with anxiety, identity, and family dynamics. Her home is both her sanctuary and her workspace, filled with art from local makers and the comforting aroma of green tea.\n\nA fiercely independent woman, Naomi maintains a close-knit circle of friends from grad school and the local arts scene. Though she values her solitude, her hope is to one day translate her clinical experience into something broader\u2014perhaps a book or a series of workshops focused on healing cultural and familial trauma for other Asian Americans. For now, she finds profound meaning in her quiet, impactful life, helping others find their voice, one session at a time, in the city that has always been her home."
