Raised in Walnut Creek, he was the responsible older brother to a sister whose struggles with anxiety and depression cast a long, unseen shadow over their family\u2019s middle-class life. While his parents focused on maintaining appearances, David became his sister\u2019s de facto confidant, learning early the weight of unspoken pain and the delicate art of listening. This experience planted a seed, though it would take years to blossom.\n\nInitially, David pursued a more conventional path, earning an undergraduate degree in economics from UC Davis. He felt a pull towards helping people but lacked direction. The turning point came during his mid-twenties when his sister had a significant crisis, finally leading to a proper diagnosis and treatment. Witnessing the profound impact of skilled therapy on his family, David found his calling. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work, and became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), dedicating his life to the work that had saved his sister.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in his late 20s, drawn to its accepting culture and professional opportunities. After several years in demanding community health roles, David saved enough to establish a private practice from his Noe Valley condo, which he purchased before the market became truly unattainable. Now, at 48, his commute is a simple walk down the hall to his home office. His days are structured by telehealth appointments, a quiet rhythm of empathy and guidance.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is deliberately calm. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of his tendency to be a better therapist than a partner\u2014a pattern he has since worked to understand. His social life is small but deep, centered around a few close friends and his rescue terrier, Buster. He breaks up his workday with walks to Douglas Playground or errands on 24th Street. His greatest aspiration is no longer professional but personal: to cultivate a relationship where he can be as present and vulnerable as he encourages his clients to be, and perhaps, to finally write the book of essays on modern loneliness that has been percolating in his mind for years."

Her voice was thin, a sound he hadn't heard since his sister\u2019s first panic attack in high school. She was in the hospital. The unspoken thing that had haunted their Walnut Creek home had finally broken into the open. In that moment of blinding fear for her, David felt his own life\u2019s purpose click into place. The fog of his aimlessness evaporated, replaced by a singular, protective clarity. He would learn how to truly help.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the smell of fresh paint in his empty Noe Valley condo, the key still cold in his hand. He was 31. After years of ramen and ruthless saving from his community health job, this was his. Standing by the bay window, looking down on 24th Street, he felt an exhale he\u2019d been holding since childhood. This wasn\u2019t just property; it was a foundation. It was the physical space where he could finally build a life of quiet intention, a sanctuary for himself and his future clients.\n\n3.\nIt was the final argument with his ex, the one where there was no shouting. \u201cI feel like your last appointment of the day,\u201d Mark had said, his voice flat with exhaustion. The words landed like a diagnosis. David saw it all then: his gentle inquiries instead of shared feelings, his calm analysis instead of vulnerable participation. He was 43, a successful therapist who had failed his most important relationship by applying the wrong tools. The silence after Mark left was the beginning of his own difficult work.\n\n4.\nHe was barely 30, working in a bleak community clinic in the Mission. For weeks, a teenage client had only offered shrugs. Then one rainy Tuesday, after a long silence, the boy quietly described a recurring nightmare. David didn't interpret or solve; he just listened, holding the space his own sister never had. In the boy\u2019s tentative words, David felt not pride, but a deep, resonant rightness. This confirmed his path\u2014it wasn\u2019t just a reaction to his family, but a genuine calling.\n\n5.\nJust last week, standing at the top of Douglas Playground with Buster sniffing at the damp grass. The fog was rolling over the city, muting the noise. His last telehealth session had been draining, but up here, there was just the gentle tug of the leash and the cool air. At 48, he recognized this feeling: a quiet, solitary peace. It was a good life, a calm one. And in that stillness, he felt the first sentence of his book on loneliness finally begin to form."
