Raised in Walnut Creek, he was the responsible older brother to a sister whose struggles with anxiety and depression cast a long, unseen shadow over their family\u2019s middle-class life. While his parents focused on maintaining appearances, David became his sister\u2019s de facto confidant, learning early the weight of unspoken pain and the delicate art of listening. This experience planted a seed, though it would take years to blossom.\n\nInitially, David pursued a more conventional path, earning an undergraduate degree in economics from UC Davis. He felt a pull towards helping people but lacked direction. The turning point came during his mid-twenties when his sister had a significant crisis, finally leading to a proper diagnosis and treatment. Witnessing the profound impact of skilled therapy on his family, David found his calling. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work, and became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), dedicating his life to the work that had saved his sister.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in his late 20s, drawn to its accepting culture and professional opportunities. After several years in demanding community health roles, David saved enough to establish a private practice from his Noe Valley condo, which he purchased before the market became truly unattainable. Now, at 48, his commute is a simple walk down the hall to his home office. His days are structured by telehealth appointments, a quiet rhythm of empathy and guidance.\n\nDavid\u2019s life is deliberately calm. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of his tendency to be a better therapist than a partner\u2014a pattern he has since worked to understand. His social life is small but deep, centered around a few close friends and his rescue terrier, Buster. He breaks up his workday with walks to Douglas Playground or errands on 24th Street. His greatest aspiration is no longer professional but personal: to cultivate a relationship where he can be as present and vulnerable as he encourages his clients to be, and perhaps, to finally write the book of essays on modern loneliness that has been percolating in his mind for years."
