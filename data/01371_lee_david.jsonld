Born in Richmond to a Chinese-American mother and a father who was never a consistent presence, David\u2019s childhood was a lesson in instability. His mother worked multiple low-wage jobs, and they moved frequently, always one crisis away from homelessness. He felt perpetually out of place, a quiet observer caught between cultures and economic worlds.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life came at seventeen. Facing eviction, a compassionate, no-nonsense case worker from a local non-profit intervened, connecting them with emergency housing and resources. For the first time, David saw a path that wasn\u2019t about escaping his reality, but about mastering it. The formal education track felt alien and impossible; this work felt real. After graduating high school, he bypassed college and moved to San Francisco, taking an overnight monitor position at a homeless shelter.\n\nHe proved to be a natural. His calm demeanor and firsthand understanding of systemic poverty allowed him to de-escalate situations and build trust where others couldn't. He absorbed everything he could from senior staff, and after four years of relentless work and proven dedication, he was promoted to Case Manager at a supportive housing facility\u2014the very building he now lives in.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his life and work are completely enmeshed. His clients are his neighbors. His day consists of connecting residents to medical care, mediating disputes, and handling mountains of paperwork, often followed by a knock on his own apartment door after hours. His social life is small, revolving around a few trusted colleagues and a weekly call with his mother, who is now stably housed in the East Bay.\n\nDavid dreams not of wealth, but of quiet. He hopes to one day earn a social work certificate to legitimize the skills he\u2019s earned through experience. His ultimate aspiration is a small, quiet apartment in the Outer Sunset, a place far from the constant sirens, where he can hear the foghorns, walk on the beach, and finally separate David Lee, the man, from David Lee, the case manager."
