            "value": "Mei-ling Bearskin\u2019s name tells the story of her life before she says a word. Born in San Francisco to a Chinese immigrant mother from Guangzhou and a Pomo father from Northern California, her childhood in the Outer Richmond was a tapestry of competing and complementary cultures. She learned empathy early, navigating her mother\u2019s hopes for academic success and her father\u2019s quiet teachings about the earth and ancestry. To the outside world, she fit no neat category, a reality that was first a source of confusion and later one of profound strength. She simply became Mei-ling, a bridge between worlds.\n\nHer path to becoming a healer was not linear. Forgoing college after high school, she spent her twenties working in restaurants and bookstores, absorbing the city's myriad stories. The turning point came with her father\u2019s death when she was 28. The experience of navigating her family's complex grief crystallized her life\u2019s purpose. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, slowly earning credits before transferring to SF State, where she committed to a Master of Social Work. It was a long, arduous journey financed by late-night shifts, but it felt like coming home.\n\nNow 51, Mei-ling is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with a private practice run from a serene, dedicated room in her Inner Sunset flat, hence her zero-mile commute. She specializes in trauma, family systems, and identity issues, drawing directly from her own lived experience. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: morning tea, virtual and in-person sessions with clients, and a long, meditative walk through Golden Gate Park to decompress. She knows the neighborhood\u2019s shopkeepers by name and maintains a small circle of deep friendships cultivated over decades.\n\nMei-ling has found peace not in defining her identity, but in accepting its wholeness. Her aspiration is no longer to achieve, but to deepen her impact. She dreams of leading workshops for multi-ethnic families and mentoring a new generation of social workers who see the person before the label. For Mei-ling, San Francisco is not just a city; it is the crucible that forged her, and her quiet life of service is her thank you."
