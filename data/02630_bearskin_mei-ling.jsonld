Born in San Francisco to a Chinese immigrant mother from Guangzhou and a Pomo father from Northern California, her childhood in the Outer Richmond was a tapestry of competing and complementary cultures. She learned empathy early, navigating her mother\u2019s hopes for academic success and her father\u2019s quiet teachings about the earth and ancestry. To the outside world, she fit no neat category, a reality that was first a source of confusion and later one of profound strength. She simply became Mei-ling, a bridge between worlds.\n\nHer path to becoming a healer was not linear. Forgoing college after high school, she spent her twenties working in restaurants and bookstores, absorbing the city's myriad stories. The turning point came with her father\u2019s death when she was 28. The experience of navigating her family's complex grief crystallized her life\u2019s purpose. She enrolled at City College of San Francisco, slowly earning credits before transferring to SF State, where she committed to a Master of Social Work. It was a long, arduous journey financed by late-night shifts, but it felt like coming home.\n\nNow 51, Mei-ling is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with a private practice run from a serene, dedicated room in her Inner Sunset flat, hence her zero-mile commute. She specializes in trauma, family systems, and identity issues, drawing directly from her own lived experience. Her days follow a gentle rhythm: morning tea, virtual and in-person sessions with clients, and a long, meditative walk through Golden Gate Park to decompress. She knows the neighborhood\u2019s shopkeepers by name and maintains a small circle of deep friendships cultivated over decades.\n\nMei-ling has found peace not in defining her identity, but in accepting its wholeness. Her aspiration is no longer to achieve, but to deepen her impact. She dreams of leading workshops for multi-ethnic families and mentoring a new generation of social workers who see the person before the label. For Mei-ling, San Francisco is not just a city; it is the crucible that forged her, and her quiet life of service is her thank you."

At the table, her father quietly shows her a sprig of yarrow, explaining its purpose in a soft voice. The steam from the pot and the earthy smell of the herb weren\u2019t in conflict; they were simply the air in her home. It was her first lesson in wholeness, teaching her that her worlds didn\u2019t need reconciling, only acceptance.\n\n2.\nAt 24, during a late shift at a bookstore on Clement Street, she shelved a worn copy of a psychology text. She felt adrift, a collector of other people\u2019s stories but with no clear plot of her own. A deep, quiet ache settled in her chest \u2014 not of failure, but of unreadiness. This ache became a patient curiosity, teaching her the profound value of listening to the city's lonely voices, a skill she didn't yet know she was training for her life\u2019s work.\n\n3.\nThe day after her father\u2019s funeral, she watched her mother light incense at their small home altar. The grief was a silent, heavy cloak. Later, Mei-ling walked to Ocean Beach alone, just as her father had taught her, to let the wind and spray wash over her. Holding both her mother\u2019s ritual and her father\u2019s connection to the land felt like holding two irreconcilable truths. In that painful space, she found her calling: to help others hold the complex, contradictory pieces of their own grief and identity. She was 28.\n\n4.\nHer first true breakthrough as an MSW intern. A teenage client, rigid with anger, finally slumped in his chair. \"You just don't get it,\" he mumbled. Instead of offering a solution, Mei-ling met his gaze and said softly, \"I know.\" The silence that followed was not empty, but full of acknowledgement. At 39, after years of study and late-night shifts, she felt a profound click of purpose. Her power wasn\u2019t in having answers, but in her ability to simply bear witness to another's truth.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a walk through Golden Gate Park, she stopped at the Redwood Grove. Placing a hand on the ancient, rough bark, the city\u2019s hum faded into a gentle quiet. She felt no need to define herself or her place in the world. She was simply there, a part of the city\u2019s ecosystem, a product of Guangzhou and the Pomo earth, all of it held in the peacefulness of that moment. At 50, this quiet gratitude felt more profound than any achievement, a peace she now helps her clients find for themselves."
