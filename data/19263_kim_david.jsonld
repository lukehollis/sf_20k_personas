The only child of Korean immigrants, he grew up in the bustling Koreatown of Los Angeles, his childhood scented with the aroma of his parents\u2019 small, beloved bulgogi restaurant. They worked tirelessly, hoping he would pursue a more \u201cstable\u201d career like medicine or law. However, David absorbed the rhythm of the restaurant\u2014the controlled chaos, the human connection, the art of creating an experience.\n\nInstead of the MCAT, he enrolled in Cal Poly Pomona\u2019s Hospitality Management program, a decision that initially disappointed his parents but one they grew to respect. After graduating, he cut his teeth managing high-end hotel restaurants in L.A., but he felt creatively stifled. In his late twenties, he made a pivotal move to San Francisco, drawn by its reputation as a culinary mecca where innovation was celebrated.\n\nHe started as a general manager at a single acclaimed restaurant in SoMa, quickly proving his talent for streamlining operations without sacrificing quality. This led to his current role as Director of Operations for a boutique group known for its concept-driven, Michelin-recognized establishments. His days are a marathon of vendor calls, P&L statements, and staff meetings, often ending long after the last diners have left.\n\nNow 42, David lives in a sleek one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. He gave up owning a car years ago, preferring the convenience of a 15-minute rideshare to his group\u2019s various locations. His social life is intertwined with his work; his closest friends are chefs, sommeliers, and other industry veterans who understand the demanding lifestyle. Recently out of a long-term relationship, he finds himself pouring his energy back into his career.\n\nHis deepest aspiration is to bring his story full circle. David dreams of opening his own place\u2014not a sprawling enterprise, but an intimate, modern Korean restaurant that honors his heritage with a refined, contemporary San Francisco sensibility. It would be a tribute to his parents' hard work, reimagined through the lens of his own hard-won expertise."

His mother, without a word, brought him a small, steaming bowl of *doenjang-jjigae*, on the house. The man\u2019s face softened into a grateful smile. In that quiet gesture, David didn\u2019t see charity; he saw the profound power of a shared meal. It was the moment he understood that a restaurant could be a sanctuary, a lesson that became the foundation of his entire career.\n\n2.\nHis father visited the L.A. hotel restaurant he was managing for the first time. Dressed uncomfortably in a suit, he surveyed the polished room, so different from their humble Koreatown spot. He didn't say much, but as he left, he gripped David\u2019s shoulder, his work-worn hand a stark contrast on the crisp blazer. \"You run a good room,\" he said in Korean. The simple, hard-won approval was more validating than any diploma. It freed David to define success on his own terms.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-eight, sitting in a sterile L.A. boardroom, staring at a PowerPoint slide titled \u2018Guest Expenditure Optimization.\u2019 The soulless corporate jargon felt like a betrayal of the warmth he learned in his parents\u2019 kitchen. A wave of creative suffocation washed over him. That night, gazing at the L.A. skyline, he made the call. He would move to San Francisco, a city he believed still valued soul over spreadsheets. It was a career bet he had to make on himself.\n\n4.\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand announcement, but a frantic late-night text from the head chef: \"WE GOT IT.\" David raced to the SoMa restaurant to find the kitchen staff buzzing, popping a bottle of cheap sparkling wine they kept for emergencies. Surrounded by joyous, exhausted chefs and servers, he felt a profound sense of shared victory. This was the San Francisco he had dreamed of\u2014a place where brutal hard work and a collective obsession with craft were rewarded. His sacrifices felt validated in that single, effervescent moment.\n\n5.\nA month after the breakup, his pristine Hayes Valley apartment felt cavernously quiet. Staring out at the city lights, eating mediocre delivery, he felt the sharp pang of being unmoored. The operational success he managed for others suddenly felt hollow. In that lonely silence, the abstract dream of his own restaurant crystallized into an urgent need. It wouldn't just be a business; it would be his own table, a place to anchor himself. A tribute to his parents, yes, but now it was also his path forward."
