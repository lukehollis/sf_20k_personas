The daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who found a life in Fresno\u2019s agricultural community, Jasleen saw firsthand how logistics were the lifeblood of their world. She tracked her father\u2019s long-haul routes on a worn paper map, internalizing the immense, complex network that connected people and goods. This foundational knowledge, born of love and worry for her father, guided her to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley.\n\nNow 42, Jasleen is a senior Transportation Planner for the city of San Francisco, a role she has held for over a decade. She was a key analyst on projects like the Van Ness Improvement Project, spending years modeling traffic flows and bus rapid transit efficiencies. From her sunny Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as her office, her commute is a mere ten steps to her desk. This creates a quiet irony she often considers: she orchestrates the movement of a million people while remaining perfectly still.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago, after the end of a long-term relationship. Instead of leaving the city, she doubled down, purchasing her small condo and curating a life of intentional solitude and deep connection. Her days are structured by data sets and virtual city-hall meetings, but her evenings are for reclaiming the city on her own terms. She doesn\u2019t drive. Instead, she methodically tests her work, taking the 38-Geary to a bookstore, the N-Judah to Ocean Beach, or the ferry to Sausalito, observing the flow and friction of the systems she helps design.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends from her graduate program and a local book club. Weekends often involve video calls with her parents and brother in Fresno, a comforting link to her past. Jasleen\u2019s dream is not for a promotion, but for the successful implementation of a truly equitable, city-wide transit system\u2014one that makes car ownership a choice, not a necessity. She aspires to a future San Francisco where the city\u2019s arteries pump smoothly for everyone, a grand, intricate design she meticulously refines from her quiet corner of the city."

He unfolds a crinkled map, and her small finger traces the thick blue line from Fresno to Bakersfield. She feels a profound mix of awe and worry, understanding for the first time that this paper grid represented his safety and their livelihood. It was then that logistics became a language of love for her, a system not of goods, but of connection back home.\n\n2.\nDuring a graduate seminar at Berkeley, a professor projects a diagram of California\u2019s agricultural supply chains. Jasleen sees it instantly: the complex web of trucking routes she knew by heart, now academicized in stark black and white. A flush of pride and validation washes over her. Her father wasn\u2019t just a driver; he was a critical node in a vast economic ecosystem. In that moment, her personal history fused with her professional ambition, giving her life\u2019s work a deep, unshakeable purpose.\n\n3.\nIt was a raw, windy afternoon during the Van Ness project, years ago. From a distance, Jasleen watched an elderly man, leaning heavily on a cane, struggle to understand the confusing signage for a temporary bus stop. Her neat traffic models and efficiency projections felt hollow. A wave of shame and fierce resolve hit her. Data was useless if it didn't serve the most vulnerable. That memory became her benchmark, a constant reminder to design not for abstract flows, but for real, fallible people.\n\n4.\nAt 37, the first night in her own condo felt momentous. The relationship was over, boxes were everywhere, but the view of the city lights was hers alone. It wasn\u2019t a sad or lonely silence, but one of deliberate choice. She had bought her small piece of San Francisco, planting her own roots instead of leaving. That quiet evening, sitting on the floor with a cup of tea, reshaped her grief into a profound sense of self-ownership and belonging, cementing her decision to build a life on her own terms.\n\n5.\nLast fall, riding the N-Judah towards a foggy Ocean Beach, Jasleen felt it. She was just another passenger, anonymous in the crowded car. She watched a young couple share headphones, a child press his face to the glass, an artist sketching in a notebook. The gentle rocking of the train, the familiar chime of the doors\u2014it was the city\u2019s circulatory system at work. This wasn\u2019t data; it was life. A deep, quiet satisfaction settled in her, the feeling of an artist watching their creation breathe."
