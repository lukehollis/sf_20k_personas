Raised in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Excelsior District, she is the second-generation daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small, bustling laundromat. They instilled in her a formidable work ethic, dreaming she would become a doctor or an engineer\u2014a tangible symbol of their American success. For a time, Jasmine tried to walk that path, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Davis.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year. Her beloved grandmother suffered a stroke, thrusting the family into the bewildering world of hospital bureaucracy and long-term care. It wasn\u2019t the doctors who held the family together, but a compassionate hospital social worker who navigated insurance, explained complex decisions, and provided a steadying presence amidst the chaos. Witnessing that impact, Jasmine found her purpose. She switched her major and later earned her Master of Social Work from SF State, a decision that initially disappointed her parents but ultimately earned their respect.\n\nAfter graduation, Jasmine endured the grueling process of becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), working with acute-care patients at a busy downtown hospital. The emotional toll was immense. Two years ago, seeking sustainability, she transitioned to a telehealth role within the same healthcare network. This explains her zero-mile commute; her work now takes place entirely within the serene, book-lined second bedroom of her Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHer days are a study in contrasts. From her quiet perch, she counsels families facing devastating diagnoses and helps patients navigate end-of-life decisions through secure video calls. When she logs off, the emotional weight remains. She de-stresses with long walks through Golden Gate Park or by finding comfort in the familiar tastes of dim sum on Clement Street. Her partner, a software engineer, provides a grounding contrast to her emotionally charged work.\n\nJasmine\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of balance. She aspires to one day open a small private practice focused on supporting caregivers, the unsung heroes she so often encounters. For now, she finds fulfillment in her difficult, vital work, a quiet anchor for strangers adrift in crisis, all from her small corner of the city that shaped her."
