The son of a Lebanese immigrant father who ran an auto repair shop and a pragmatic Filipina mother who worked as a nurse, Rami grew up in Daly City, perpetually shrouded in a fog that seemed to sharpen his focus on the mechanical world within his father\u2019s garage. He was fascinated by how things worked, disassembling and reassembling everything from toasters to bicycle gears.\n\nA pragmatist at heart, he pursued a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at San Jose State, seeing it as the most direct path to a stable, tangible career. His first job was on a factory floor for a major electronics company, and he loved the hum of machinery and the satisfaction of seeing a schematic become a physical product. His ascent from junior engineer to Director of Hardware Manufacturing wasn\u2019t just about technical skill; it was about his unique ability to see the production line as a single, complex organism. He had a preternatural talent for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing workflows, earning a reputation as the person who could make impossible deadlines possible.\n\nThis relentless career focus came at a personal cost, contributing to a divorce five years ago. Now, Rami has consciously built a life that balances his demanding job with the vibrancy he craves. He lives in a sleek SoMa condo, choosing San Francisco\u2019s energy over the quiet suburbs closer to his Silicon Valley office. His days are bookended by the 35.8-mile shuttle ride, a liminal space where he listens to podcasts on industrial design or simply watches the endless stream of traffic, decompressing from the pressures of managing a global supply chain.\n\nOn weekends, Rami reclaims the city. He cycles across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin, explores new tasting menus in Hayes Valley, and spends hours at his home workstation, tinkering with a high-end 3D printer. While proud of his career, he feels a growing disconnect from the hands-on work he once loved. His ultimate dream is to leave the corporate grind behind and open a small, bespoke fabrication studio, perhaps creating custom cycling components or minimalist furniture\u2014to once again feel the satisfaction of building something real with his own two hands."

His dad, smelling of grease and patience, handed him a Craftsman socket wrench. The solid *click* as it engaged, the effortless turn\u2014it was a feeling of pure, mechanical rightness. Under a single bare bulb, surrounded by fog, Rami didn't just fix a bike; he understood that with the right tool and focus, anything broken could be made whole. It was the moment he fell in love with solving physical problems.\n\n2.\nEarly in his career, around age 25, he stayed late one night, watching the factory floor from a high catwalk. Below, the hum of machinery, the fluid motion of robotic arms, and the ballet of the assembly team wasn\u2019t just noise and chaos. For the first time, he saw it as a single, living organism with a pulse. It was a profound shift; his job wasn\u2019t just to manage a process, but to listen to the rhythm of the entire system. That perspective defined his professional talent.\n\n3.\nSix years ago, on their anniversary, his wife had cooked a special meal. His phone buzzed\u2014a catastrophic failure at the Shanghai plant. He took the call. An hour later, the food was cold and she was looking at him with a quiet, bottomless resignation he\u2019d never seen before. It wasn\u2019t anger; it was acceptance. He realized in that moment he had successfully optimized every part of his life for efficiency except the one connection that couldn't be routed through a spreadsheet.\n\n4.\nA few months after the divorce was finalized, he impulsively cycled across the Golden Gate Bridge. Halfway across, buffeted by an aggressive wind, he stopped. The raw physical effort had scoured his mind clean of deadlines and escalations. Looking at the city skyline from that vantage point, he felt a thrilling sense of autonomy\u2014of moving under his own power, not for a commute or a goal, but for the sake of the movement itself. It was the first step in reclaiming his life.\n\n5.\nLast year, late on a Tuesday in his SoMa condo, his new 3D printer finished its first real project: a custom headset spacer he'd designed for his bike. He held the piece, still warm from the printer bed. It was solid, precise, and uniquely his. The feeling was more satisfying than closing any multi-million dollar deal. It wasn't a schematic or a projection anymore; it was real. This was the spark, the moment his abstract dream of opening a fabrication studio felt truly possible."
