Born in Oakland to an African American jazz musician and a first-generation Korean immigrant mother, her childhood was a vibrant fusion. The scent of her mother\u2019s kimchi jjigae often mingled with the soulful notes of her father\u2019s saxophone practice. While she cherished their artistic passions, she also witnessed their financial struggles, which instilled in her a desire for a career that was both creative and stable.\n\nThis drive led her to San Francisco State University, where she pursued a Bachelor's in Hospitality Management. She saw it as a way to honor her parents\u2019 worlds\u2014the art of gathering and the joy of food\u2014but with a structured, business-minded approach. Her early career involved managing trendy SoMa restaurants and high-end catering gigs, where she learned the demanding logistics of the city\u2019s food scene. The turning point came when she took a role managing events for a prominent art gallery. There, she discovered her true calling: curating culinary experiences that amplified the art, transforming a simple gallery opening into an immersive sensory event.\n\nNow 41, Jasmine is the Director of Culinary Experience for a renowned San Francisco arts institution. Her days are a blend of creative strategy meetings with chefs to design menus inspired by new exhibitions and negotiating contracts with local purveyors. She lives in a tastefully decorated Hayes Valley apartment, a 3.8-mile MUNI ride from her office. She finds a certain peace in her daily commute, using the time to listen to podcasts on art history or global cuisine.\n\nThough professionally fulfilled, Jasmine remains single after a long-term relationship ended amicably in her late thirties. Her social life is rich, built around a close-knit circle of friends from the art and food worlds. Her ultimate dream is to one day open her own small venue: an intimate space that hosts rotating art exhibits, live music, and a prix-fixe menu\u2014a perfect tribute to the two people who shaped her. For Jasmine, San Francisco isn\u2019t just a home; it's the canvas on which she paints her unique legacy."

The humid, spicy scent of her mother\u2019s kimchi jjigae warred with the cool, mournful notes of her father\u2019s saxophone. A musician friend of his, over for a jam session, took a hesitant spoonful of the stew. His eyes widened. \"Man,\" he'd said, \"that's soul music right there.\" In that moment, Jasmine understood her family wasn't two separate worlds, but one beautiful, complex chord. It\u2019s the harmony she has been chasing ever since.\n\n2.\nAt fifteen, she found her father staring at his dented saxophone case, a repair bill on the table. He wasn\u2019t playing; the silence in the apartment was deafening. He just looked tired. It wasn't a moment of drama, but of heavy, unspoken worry about making ends meet. That silence taught her a hard lesson: passion needed a foundation, a structure to survive. She vowed then that her creativity would have a business plan, one strong enough to hold all the art she loved without ever collapsing.\n\n3.\nIt was her first major gallery opening. The art was stark, minimalist landscapes. Instead of standard canap\u00e9s, Jasmine served deconstructed beet tartare on black slate, mirroring the artist's earthy palette. She watched a guest pause, look from the painting to the food in their hand, and smile in recognition. It was a silent, electric connection. She wasn\u2019t just serving food; she was extending the art onto the plate. That night, in her late twenties, she knew she had found her own medium.\n\n4.\nThe night her eight-year relationship ended, there were no tears, just a handshake and a sad, knowing smile. Alone in her Hayes Valley apartment for the first time, she didn't feel empty. She put on a John Coltrane record, an act that felt like a hug from her dad. In that stillness at thirty-seven, she realized her dream\u2014the little venue with art and music\u2014wasn't something to build *with* someone. It was something to build for herself. It was her solo.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on her MUNI ride home, the bus rattled past a \"For Lease\" sign on a dusty storefront in the Mission. Through the grime, she could see good bones: exposed brick, high ceilings. She instantly imagined a small stage in the corner and a minimalist kitchen serving a prix-fixe menu. It wasn't a daydream anymore; it was a floor plan. The podcast in her ears faded, replaced by an urgent, internal whisper: *What are you waiting for?*"
