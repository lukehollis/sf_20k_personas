Her 0.0-mile commute is a conscious choice, a commitment to the community she serves. Raised in Oakland by a public-school teacher and a union carpenter, Maya grew up seeing the systemic cracks through which her peers could fall. The memory of a close childhood friend who struggled with an undiagnosed mood disorder, without access to school-based support, became the defining catalyst for her life\u2019s work.\n\nThis drive propelled her through a sociology degree at UCLA and back to the Bay Area for a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. She specialized in child and adolescent mental health, driven by a deep-seated belief that intervention had to begin early. After earning her license, she specifically sought a position in a high-need San Francisco school. Landing the LCSW role at a bustling Mission middle school felt like a homecoming, even though it was across the bay. To fully invest, she found a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment just three blocks from the school, a rare gem she shares with her long-term partner, Ben, a graphic designer.\n\nHer days are a whirlwind of crisis intervention, group therapy sessions for anxious teens, and parent meetings. She walks to work, coffee in hand, mentally preparing for the emotional weight of the day. Evenings are for decompression\u2014cooking with Ben, a jog around Dolores Park, or quiet chats with her small, tight-knit circle of friends, many of whom also work in education or social services.\n\nAt 31, Maya feels both anchored and restless. She is deeply gratified by her work but acutely aware of its limitations. Her dream is to eventually develop a community-based wellness program that extends beyond school hours, offering creative outlets and mental health resources to the neighborhood\u2019s youth. For Maya, San Francisco isn't about tech glamour or scenic views; it's about the vibrant, chaotic, and resilient lives of the children she walks alongside every day, a constant and grounding presence in their corner of the city."
