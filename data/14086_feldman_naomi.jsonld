The daughter of a pragmatic architect father and an idealistic sociologist mother, her dinner table conversations were a blueprint for her future, filled with debates on public housing, community building, and the soul of a city. This intellectual foundation led her west to UC Berkeley for her graduate degree in Urban Planning, where she fell irrevocably in love with the Bay Area's dynamic, chaotic energy.\n\nHer career began in the early 90s, but the true turning point was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Witnessing the city\u2019s destruction and subsequent rebirth transformed her academic interest into a visceral calling. She wasn't just planning spaces; she was helping heal a city's wounds. Over three decades, she rose from a junior planner to a Principal at a leading design firm. Naomi built a reputation for championing human-scaled projects: pedestrian-friendly corridors, revitalized public plazas, and mixed-use developments that resisted sterile gentrification, even when facing bureaucratic headwinds.\n\nNaomi\u2019s personal life is deeply woven into her professional one. A marriage dissolved in her late thirties over a fundamental disagreement: her ex-husband craved suburban quiet, while Naomi couldn't imagine leaving the city\u2019s vibrant pulse. She lives in a tastefully minimalist condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose post-freeway transformation she had a hand in shaping. Her daily routine is a testament to her beliefs: a morning walk to her favorite cafe, followed by a short Muni ride to her FiDi office. Her social circle consists of artists, policy wonks, and fellow civic leaders\u2014friends who share her passion for urban life.\n\nNow 53, Naomi looks at San Francisco with the clear eyes of a long-term lover, acutely aware of its flaws\u2014the housing crisis, the fraying social fabric. Her ambition is no longer about climbing a career ladder but about mentorship. She hopes to foster a new generation of planners who prioritize equity and community resilience. Her dream isn't a personal legacy of glass and steel, but a city that is more livable, connected, and humane for everyone who calls it home."

Standing on a hill in Bernal Heights, watching smoke plume from the Marina, the ground\u2019s violent shudder still echoed in her bones. The terror was immense, but it was quickly replaced by a profound, gut-wrenching sense of connection to the strangers beside her. In that moment, her academic work became a calling. It wasn't about designing cities anymore; it was about healing one. This was in 1989, when she was a 20-year-old grad student.\n\n2.\nThe final argument with Mark wasn\u2019t a shouting match but a quiet, heartbreaking slideshow. He had pulled up a Zillow listing for a Craftsman in Mill Valley, talking about garden beds and weekend quiet. Naomi just stared out their apartment window at the glittering ribbon of headlights on Van Ness, listening to the faint siren and the murmur from the bar below. She felt an unbearable sadness, realizing he saw noise, and she saw life. Choosing the city over him wasn't a choice; it was an affirmation of who she was. This was in her late thirties.\n\n3.\nYears after the Central Freeway came down, she sat on a bench on Patricia\u2019s Green. A toddler chased pigeons while two men played chess on a concrete table she\u2019d helped specify. For months, the project had been a war of attrition fought in beige meeting rooms over budgets and permits. But watching that scene, the mundane, un-designed life unfolding in a space she\u2019d fought for, brought a wave of quiet, overwhelming joy. It was the first time she truly felt she had given the city a gift. This was in her early forties.\n\n4.\nAs a junior planner, she\u2019d proposed a series of small, \"unimportant\" pedestrian plazas, only to be steamrolled in a meeting by a senior partner focused on a bigger project. Later that day, a quiet, nearing-retirement architect named Evelyn stopped by her desk. \"The soul of a city is in its pauses, Naomi. Don't let them convince you otherwise.\" That small act of solidarity felt like a shield. It fortified her resolve to champion the human-scaled details for the rest of her career. This was in the mid-90s.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking to her Muni stop, she saw a young intern from her firm sketching the new condos on Market Street. The young woman was completely absorbed, her face alight with the same fierce passion Naomi recognized in her younger self. Naomi felt no envy, only a deep, resonant hope. Her legacy wouldn't be in the buildings that stood, but in the hands and minds of those who would build next. It was a feeling of peaceful, purposeful transition. This happened at age 53."
