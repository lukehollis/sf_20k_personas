She lives in the apartment above the Golden Dragon Cafe, the same restaurant her parents opened after immigrating from Hong Kong in the late 1970s. Her childhood wasn\u2019t defined by playgrounds, but by the rhythmic clatter of woks, the scent of ginger and star anise, and the comforting drone of her father taking orders in Cantonese. She was the family's built-in translator, hostess, and bookkeeper before she even finished high school.\n\nDespite her deep roots in the family business, Mei dreamed of a different life\u2014one rendered in pixels and palettes, not sizzling oil. After graduating from Washington High, she enrolled at San Jose State, determined to pursue a degree in graphic design. For two years, she thrived, creating a life that was finally her own, a world away from the demands of the restaurant.\n\nThe turning point came during her junior year. Her father suffered a major heart attack, leaving her mother struggling to manage the Golden Dragon alone. Without hesitation, Mei put her education on indefinite hold and returned home. It was meant to be temporary, but \"temporary\" stretched into a year, then five, then a decade. Her father recovered but could no longer handle the grueling hours. The mantle of manager passed not by choice, but by necessity, to Mei.\n\nNow 46, Mei Ling is the heart and soul of the Golden Dragon. She knows her regulars by name, their children's names, and their standing weekly orders. She manages inventory, schedules staff, and placates demanding customers with a practiced, weary grace. Her own dreams of design have faded, replaced by more practical aspirations: keeping the restaurant afloat amidst rising rents and ensuring her aging parents are comfortable. Her social life is woven into the fabric of the cafe\u2014the other merchants on the block, the loyal customers who have become like family.\n\nSome quiet nights, after the last table has been cleared, she sits in the darkened dining room, sketching on a napkin. It\u2019s a ghost of the life she almost had. Her hope is no longer for escape, but for legacy\u2014that one day, a younger cousin might want to take over, finally allowing her to see the Pacific Ocean without thinking about the dinner rush."
