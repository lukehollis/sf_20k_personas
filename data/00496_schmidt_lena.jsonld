Raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin, by a pragmatic family of accountants and electricians, her decision to major in Art History at UW-Madison was seen as a charming, if impractical, detour. Lena, however, was captivated by the stories that paintings could tell, the silent histories embedded in brushstrokes.\n\nHer move to San Francisco a decade ago was not for her own career, but for a partner\u2019s. She followed a promising graphic designer, landing part-time work at a small gallery while he climbed the ladder at a tech startup. The city, with its vibrant art scene and dramatic landscapes, felt like a dream. The relationship, however, did not last. When he left for a new job in Austin, Lena faced a crossroads. The gallery couldn't offer a living wage, and the thought of returning to Wisconsin felt like a regression. She chose to stay, forging her own path in the city that was now hers alone.\n\nNeeding stability, Lena pivoted. She leveraged her organizational skills and calm demeanor into an administrative coordinator role at a mid-sized tech company. The world of sprints, stand-ups, and software releases was alien to her art history background, but she excelled at creating order from chaos.\n\nNow 39, her life is contained within the foggy, peaceful blocks of the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her one-bedroom apartment is both her office and her sanctuary. Her days are structured by calendars and Slack notifications, but her free time is her own. She takes long, contemplative walks in Golden Gate Park, knows the baristas at her local coffee shop by name, and has a small, close-knit circle of friends from a pottery class\u2014a community entirely separate from the tech world.\n\nLena\u2019s dream of curating a gallery has softened into a more manageable aspiration: she hopes to one day become a weekend docent at the de Young Museum, sharing the stories of art with others. She has built a life of quiet contentment in San Francisco, a life born not of a grand plan, but of a persistent choice to stay and find beauty in the everyday."
