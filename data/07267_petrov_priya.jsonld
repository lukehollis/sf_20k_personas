The daughter of an Indian computational linguist and a Russian historian who met at a conference in Chicago, Priya grew up in a home filled with the aromas of cardamom and dill, the sounds of sitar and Tchaikovsky. Her childhood was a collage of academic discussions on urban decay in post-Soviet states and the chaotic, organic growth of Mumbai\u2019s suburbs. This unique upbringing instilled in her a deep fascination with the systems\u2014both visible and invisible\u2014that shape human settlements.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley for a Master's in Urban Planning, where she fell in love with the Bay Area's beautiful, chaotic, and deeply flawed urban fabric. San Francisco, with its potent mix of utopian ideals and stark inequalities, became her ultimate puzzle. After graduating, she eagerly accepted a position with the city\u2019s planning department, seeing it not as a bureaucratic job, but as a chance to be an architect of change from within. Her key turning point was helping spearhead a community-led initiative to redesign a neglected network of alleyways in the Tenderloin into safe, green public spaces. The project\u2019s success, though small-scale, solidified her belief in hyper-local, human-centered design.\n\nNow 37, Priya lives a life of intense focus from her sleek, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her living room, with its wall of maps and drafting table, is also her office. Her days are a disciplined rhythm of virtual meetings, policy analysis, and site-visit walks through her neighborhood, where she observes pedestrian flow and the use of public seating with a professional\u2019s eye. Her social circle is tight-knit: a public defender, a data artist, and an architect, with whom she debates housing policy over drinks at Anina or explores new exhibits at SFMOMA.\n\nPriya\u2019s driving ambition is to lead a project that leaves a lasting, equitable mark on the city\u2014perhaps a new model for affordable housing or a revolutionary public transit corridor. While her career is her anchor, a quiet hope persists for a future with more balance: one that includes rediscovering her family\u2019s roots in person and, perhaps, building a personal life as thoughtfully designed as the cities she dreams of."
