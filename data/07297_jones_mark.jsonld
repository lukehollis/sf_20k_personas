Born in a small coastal town near Cebu in the Philippines to a Filipina mother and a father of Spanish descent, his upbringing was one of pragmatism and hard work. He was never one for books, finishing his high school education with the sole aim of finding work to help his family. At 21, he followed an older sister to San Francisco, the city\u2019s promise of opportunity a powerful lure.\n\nThe reality was a series of grueling, under-the-table jobs\u2014washing dishes in a Chinatown restaurant, hauling debris at construction sites. The city was a fast-moving, isolating place. The turning point arrived nearly two decades ago when he landed a job as a live-in custodian for a pre-war apartment building in Nob Hill. It wasn't a career ladder, but it was a lifeline, offering a small basement apartment in exchange for his constant vigilance. The 0.0-mile commute cemented his existence within the building's brick confines.\n\nMark is a solitary figure, more an observer than a participant in the lives swirling around him. He knows the tenants by their habits: the law student on the third floor who orders takeout every night, the elderly woman on the fifth floor whose cat he sometimes feeds, the young tech couple whose arguments seep through the floorboards. His primary social connection is a weekly phone call with his sister, now a nurse living in Daly City. A past relationship crumbled under the weight of his on-call life; he was never truly off the clock, his home and his work inextricably linked.\n\nNow 51, Mark\u2019s dreams have become smaller and more tangible. He no longer imagines wealth, but rather peace. He hopes to save enough to visit his parents\u2019 graves back home, a journey he hasn\u2019t made in thirty years. His most private aspiration is to one day have a small garden of his own, a patch of earth to cultivate for himself, not for his employer. He is an invisible anchor of San Francisco, the quiet man who sweeps the steps and fixes the leaks, maintaining the home of a hundred strangers in a city he serves but can never quite call his own."
