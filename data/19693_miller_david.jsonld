The son of a public-school teacher and an electrician, he grew up in a household where community responsibility was a given, though rarely spoken of. The pivotal moment came in his teens, watching his widowed grandmother navigate a bureaucratic labyrinth of social services, her dignity slowly eroding. The frustration and helplessness he felt then planted the seed for a career dedicated to helping others navigate those same systems.\n\nAfter earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in social work from Ohio State, David felt a pull toward a city wrestling with social issues on a grander scale. In the late 1990s, he moved to San Francisco for his graduate studies at SF State, drawn by the city\u2019s progressive reputation. His early years were a trial by fire, working as a case manager in soup kitchens and shelters in the Tenderloin. The work was grueling, and a brief, earnest marriage in his early thirties buckled under the weight of his emotional investment in his clients. Yet, for every moment of despair, there was a small victory\u2014a client securing stable housing, another finding sobriety\u2014that solidified his resolve. Over two decades, he worked his way up, becoming a Program Director for a non-profit that provides transitional support for unhoused seniors.\n\nNow, at 49, David\u2019s life is a study in contrasts. He wakes to the peaceful, fog-laced quiet of his Outer Sunset apartment. His long commute on the N Judah is a cherished ritual, a time to read and mentally prepare for the day. At his downtown office, he manages budgets, mentors younger staff, and fights for grants with a quiet intensity. He sees the worst of San Francisco\u2019s inequality daily, a reality that has tempered his youthful idealism into a pragmatic, resilient hope.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from the non-profit world who understand the unique pressures of their work. His deepest aspiration isn't personal wealth, but to see his new dementia-care program fully funded. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound and complicated; he is fiercely critical of its failures but remains deeply in love with its enduring spirit of compassion and the wild beauty of Ocean Beach, just a short walk from his front door."

Marcus was clean, his eyes clear for the first time in months. He held out a worn, folded photo of the daughter he\u2019d finally reconnected with. David felt a jolt of hope so fierce it almost hurt. It wasn't a policy win, but a human one. That single, fragile moment of redemption became the fuel he burned through years of bureaucratic battles and emotional exhaustion. It was the day his work felt sacred.\n\n2.\nHe can still feel the silence in his Divisadero apartment around 2009. His wife, Sarah, had made pasta. She asked about his day and he just stared at his plate, unable to translate the raw desperation he\u2019d witnessed into dinner conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s like you carry the entire Tenderloin home in your coat pockets,\u201d she\u2019d said, not unkindly. It was then he understood the chasm between them. The memory isn\u2019t of anger, but of a quiet, profound sadness\u2014the cost of a compassion he couldn't turn off at his own front door.\n\n3.\nThe first time he truly found Ocean Beach was after a devastating budget meeting about ten years ago. Fuming, he'd walked from his apartment straight into the wind and fog. The cold spray on his face and the immense, gray roar of the surf felt like an absolution. It didn't solve anything, but it put the problem in its place, dwarfed by the scale of the Pacific. That walk established a vital ritual, turning the beach from a nice view into his non-negotiable sanctuary for a battered soul.\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday morning on the N Judah, maybe five years back, the train climbed out of the tunnel at Duboce Park. The fog was breaking, and golden light drenched the Victorian rooftops as the train rattled toward the downtown skyline. He looked at the diverse faces of his fellow passengers\u2014some tired, some hopeful. He felt a sudden, overwhelming love for the city\u2019s complex, beautiful, and deeply flawed machinery. The commute wasn\u2019t a chore; it was his daily pilgrimage between San Francisco's quiet heart and its troubled conscience.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a longtime client named Eleanor, a sweet woman with a sharp wit, got disoriented looking for the restroom. The sheer panic and confusion in her eyes as she stood in the hallway was a gut punch. In that instant, she wasn't just a client; she was his grandmother, lost in a maze of paperwork and fading dignity. The professional became intensely personal. That moment solidified his final mission: the dementia-care program wasn't just a good idea, it was a debt he had to pay."
