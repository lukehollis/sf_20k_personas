His name, a legacy from his Irish-American father, often surprises those who meet the quiet, observant man with features inherited from his Chinese-American mother. His childhood was spent in the comforting chaos of his parents\u2019 neighborhood market, where he learned the language of inventory, the art of customer service, and the rhythm of a small family business. This early immersion in commerce and community felt more educational than any classroom.\n\nForegoing a traditional four-year university, Liam pursued a practical path, earning an Associate's degree in Hospitality Management from City College of San Francisco. He wanted to professionalize the skills he\u2019d absorbed organically. His first job outside the family store was as a server in a bustling downtown bistro. There, his innate understanding of flow, efficiency, and staff morale saw him quickly promoted to shift lead, and eventually, he was poached for a manager position at a chic, upscale restaurant in Hayes Valley.\n\nA key turning point was accepting the job\u2019s major perk\u2014and catch: a small apartment located directly above the restaurant. His 0.0-mile commute has come to define his existence. His days are a vertical loop: he wakes, answers supplier emails, heads downstairs for prep, manages the whirlwind of lunch and dinner services, and climbs back up, exhausted, long after the last patron has left. His staff has become his de facto family, the post-shift drink his primary social event.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and evolving. He embodies the city's demanding work ethic, but yearns for the community feel of his parents' old-school market. His dream isn't just to escape the 24/7 grind of his current role, but to create something of his own. He envisions a small, modern gastropub in the Richmond or Sunset\u2014a place that merges the warmth of an Irish pub with the refined culinary principles his mother taught him. It would be a space that reflects his own identity, a testament to the city that shaped him, and a place where he could finally be both the manager and at home."
