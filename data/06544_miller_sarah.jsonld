At 42, her commute is a ten-step walk from her kitchen to a small, sunlit room overlooking a neighbor's garden\u2014her home office.\n\nRaised in the orderly suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, Sarah was the quiet observer in a well-meaning but emotionally reserved family. Her parents provided stability but struggled to voice affection, a silence that sparked Sarah\u2019s lifelong fascination with the unspoken currents between people. She pursued an undergraduate degree in psychology at Ohio State before making a decisive break, moving west to earn her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. The Bay Area\u2019s vibrant, expressive culture was the antidote to her buttoned-up childhood.\n\nFor over a decade, Sarah worked within the demanding ecosystem of UCSF Medical Center, counseling patients and families navigating catastrophic illness and grief. She was good at it, but the constant exposure to trauma and the hospital\u2019s bureaucratic grind led to a profound burnout. The turning point came during the pandemic. Witnessing an overwhelmed healthcare system and feeling her own empathy fray, she resigned. Using her savings, she became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and launched a private telehealth practice from her apartment.\n\nNow, her days are self-directed. Mornings begin with a walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her mind before a day of virtual sessions. She helps clients\u2014many of them tech workers and fellow healthcare professionals\u2014grapple with anxiety, imposter syndrome, and loneliness in a city that can feel isolating despite its density. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from her hospital days and a book club filled with other single women over 35.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is no longer about climbing a career ladder but about deepening her impact. She hopes to eventually write a book exploring the nuances of secondary trauma in healing professions. For now, she finds contentment in her quiet corner of San Francisco, a city that allowed her to escape her past and build a life, and a career, entirely on her own terms."
