The daughter of a Hong Kong immigrant father who ran a successful laundromat and a second-generation Chinese-American mother, Mei grew up navigating the space between two worlds. She spent her childhood folding clothes to the hum of dryers while dreaming of the grand canvases she saw on school trips to the de Young Museum. Bucking her parents\u2019 practical expectations, she pursued her passion at SF State, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History.\n\nHer early career was a dream fulfilled; she worked as a curatorial assistant at a small SoMa gallery. But the dream was fragile. When the dot-com bust of 2001 decimated the city\u2019s arts funding, Mei was laid off. Faced with steep rents and dwindling prospects, she made a pragmatic pivot. She took a data entry course, discovering an unexpected knack for spotting patterns and organizing complex systems\u2014a skill not dissimilar from analyzing brushstrokes and composition. This led to an entry-level role at a software company.\n\nOver two decades, Mei methodically built a new career. She became a Business Analyst, a bridge between developers and stakeholders. She also married, becoming Mei Miller, but the marriage ended amicably a decade ago, leaving her with a renewed sense of independence. Now, at 50, she is a respected senior analyst, working entirely from her quiet apartment overlooking Fulton Street.\n\nHer days are structured and calm. She begins with a misty walk through Golden Gate Park before logging on, her commute a mere ten steps to her desk. Her life is a blend of the old and new; she analyzes complex software architecture by day and reads about Italian Renaissance painters by night. Her small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of old neighborhood pals and former colleagues\u2014gathers for weekly dim sum.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is one of deep, quiet resilience. She has watched the city boom, bust, and reshape itself, all from the vantage of her lifelong neighborhood. Mei\u2019s current dream is not professional, but personal. She is diligently saving to take a six-month sabbatical to Florence, to finally see the masterpieces she once only studied in textbooks. For Mei, life hasn\u2019t been a straight line, but a series of thoughtful adaptations, creating a present that is stable, earned, and entirely her own."
