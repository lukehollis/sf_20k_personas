As a third-generation Japanese-American raised in the meticulous suburbs of San Jose, Kenji\u2019s path was expected to be straightforward. His father, a stoic electrical engineer, encouraged a practical career. Kenji complied, earning a business degree from UC Davis and spending his twenties in a soul-crushingly bland tech marketing role. He felt like a ghost haunting someone else\u2019s life.\n\nThe turning point came when his grandmother, his beloved *Obaasan*, entered hospice care. Kenji watched, mesmerized, as a social worker navigated his family\u2019s grief with a quiet, powerful grace. In that space of vulnerability and dignity, Kenji saw his future. He quit his job at 31, cashed in his stock options, and enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University.\n\nHe thrived in the demanding environment of a downtown SF hospital, spending over a decade on the front lines of crisis intervention and patient advocacy. But the relentless emotional toll, amplified by the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, led to burnout. Seeking sustainability, he transitioned to a fully remote role within the same healthcare system.\n\nNow, Kenji\u2019s life is contained within his quiet Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to a meticulously organized home office. His days are a series of telehealth sessions, providing counseling to patients grappling with chronic illness and end-of-life decisions. After logging off, he decommissions by walking through Golden Gate Park or browsing the hushed aisles of Green Apple Books on Clement Street. He is single, finding deep satisfaction in a small circle of old friends from his MSW program. San Francisco isn't a city of hustle for him; it's a sanctuary he has carefully curated. His dream is to eventually open a small private practice focused on supporting fellow healthcare workers, offering the same compassion he once witnessed and now provides daily from the stillness of his home."
