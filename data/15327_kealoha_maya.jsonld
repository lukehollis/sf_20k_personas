Born to a Hawaiian father who moved to the mainland for work and an Irish-American mother from Daly City, Maya grew up navigating the space between two vibrant cultures. Her father\u2019s stories of Oahu instilled a sense of *aloha* and deep respect for ancestry, while her mother grounded her in the pragmatic, foggy realities of the Bay Area. A quiet, observant child, Maya often felt more comfortable expressing her complex feelings through sketchbooks and clay than with words, a trait that would define her future path.\n\nHer educational journey began at San Francisco State University, where she majored in Psychology. While she was fascinated by the human mind, she found traditional talk therapy limiting. A key turning point came during her senior year when her beloved grandmother passed away. Unable to articulate the depth of her grief, Maya poured it onto a series of abstract canvases. In the strokes of paint, she found a language for her loss. This profound experience led her directly to a graduate program in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Expressive Arts Therapy.\n\nNow 37, Maya is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist working within the San Francisco Unified School District. Her daily 2.8-mile bicycle commute from her small, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset to a high school in the Mission District is a cherished ritual. It\u2019s a time to observe the city waking up before she immerses herself in the complex emotional worlds of teenagers navigating poverty, identity, and trauma. Her own multiracial background gives her a unique empathy for her diverse students.\n\nMaya\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco. Her social circle consists of other healers, artists, and community organizers. She is in a loving, year-long relationship with a landscape architect named Alex, who shares her appreciation for the city's natural beauty. Evenings are for her own art, dinners with friends, or quiet walks through Golden Gate Park. Her dream is not to open a lucrative private practice, but to eventually secure funding for a non-profit expressive arts studio for San Francisco\u2019s immigrant and first-generation youth, creating a sanctuary where, like her, they can find their voice without needing words."

The fog was a cold blanket, but her father\u2019s hands were warm as he showed her how to pierce a carnation with a long needle. He hummed a melody from Oahu as she carefully threaded the flowers, creating a vibrant chain of aloha against the gray landscape. In that moment, she learned that heritage wasn't a place you left behind, but something you could build, flower by flower, wherever you were. (Age 8)\n\n2.\nShe remembers standing in her SF State apartment, the silence deafening after her grandmother\u2019s funeral. Words felt like stones in her throat. Her hands, however, knew what to do. She poured black gesso onto a canvas, spreading it with a palette knife, not painting a thing but smearing the texture of her grief. In that physical act, a pressure valve released. It was the first time she understood that healing could happen without language, a realization that charted the entire course of her professional life. (Age 22)\n\n3.\nHe was a new student from El Salvador who hadn\u2019t spoken a word in three weeks of art group. Maya simply kept the colored pencils and paper available. Then one Tuesday, he slid a drawing across the table. It was a small, detailed house with a volcano in the background. He looked her directly in the eye and pointed to it. That silent gesture of \"this is me, this is where I'm from\" was more powerful than any sentence. It solidified her resolve to build a sanctuary for stories like his. (Age 34)\n\n4.\nOn their third date, walking through the Sutro Baths ruins at dusk, Alex stopped. He pointed not to the view of the ocean, but to a tough little succulent growing in a crack in the concrete. He explained its name and how it thrived in the harsh, salty wind. Maya felt a profound sense of recognition; he saw the resilience in the small things, just as she did. Standing there in the fading light, she knew this love would be a quiet, sturdy thing, built to last. (Age 36)\n\n5.\nCoasting on her bike through Dolores Park on a recent Tuesday morning, she saw the city in a single frame: the fog clinging to Twin Peaks, a tai chi class in progress, a lone tech worker already on their laptop, and the scent of Tartine's bread on the air. A wave of fierce, quiet affection washed over her. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic love for San Francisco, but a deep, abiding one. This daily, observant journey was the ritual that continually reaffirmed her place in the city's complex, beautiful heart. (Recurring)"
