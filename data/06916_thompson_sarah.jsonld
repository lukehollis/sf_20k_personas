The daughter of a pragmatic Chinese immigrant mother and a curious, American-born engineer father, she grew up in Daly City, in a home where academic rigor met a tinkerer\u2019s wonder. From a young age, Sarah was drawn to the elegant logic of biology, the intricate code that wrote the story of life itself. This passion propelled her through a molecular biology degree at UC Berkeley and into a prestigious Ph.D. program in genetics at Stanford.\n\nHer academic pursuit became a personal crusade during her third year of graduate school when her father was diagnosed with a rare, genetically-linked neurodegenerative disease. His slow, heartbreaking decline transformed Sarah\u2019s research from a career into a calling. She poured her grief and intellect into her work, her dissertation focusing on the very cellular pathways that were failing him.\n\nNow, at 40, Sarah is a Senior Research Scientist at a leading South San Francisco biotech firm. Her official commute is zero miles; she negotiated a unique arrangement allowing her to maintain a sophisticated computational lab in her Inner Sunset home. Her quiet, fog-laced neighborhood provides the perfect incubator for her intense focus. Her life is a disciplined routine: waking before dawn to analyze genetic sequences, a mid-day run through the winding trails of Golden Gate Park to clear her head, and long evenings spent designing experiments.\n\nHer social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting mostly of fellow scientists who understand her devotion. A serious relationship in her early thirties withered under the demands of her work, a sacrifice she accepted as necessary. Her primary connection outside the lab is with her aging mother, with whom she shares weekly dinners.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its vibrant culture and more about its geography. The city is a backdrop to her mission\u2014a familiar, stable environment where she can wage her war against the disease that took her father. Her greatest hope is not for wealth or fame, but for a single, successful clinical trial. She dreams of the day she can look at a data set and see not just a scientific breakthrough, but a tangible piece of redemption."
