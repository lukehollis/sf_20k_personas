Born in Sarajevo, her early childhood was punctuated by the warmth of a close-knit family and the vibrant culture of a city that would soon be torn apart. In 1993, at fifteen, the Bosnian War forced her family to flee, eventually arriving as refugees in San Francisco with little more than the clothes they wore. The trauma of the siege and the disorientation of their new life instilled in Amina a fierce, quiet resilience.\n\nShe finished her education at a local public high school, but college was a luxury her family couldn't afford. Amina immediately entered the workforce, taking jobs in restaurants and retail to help support her parents. It was during this time, observing the city's intricate dance of wealth and property, that a seed was planted. She saw buildings not as mere structures, but as anchors of security\u2014the very thing her family had lost.\n\nDriven by a singular focus, she saved relentlessly, earned her real estate license at 24, and threw herself into the industry. Her personal history gave her a unique edge; she didn't just sell houses, she understood the profound human need for a sanctuary. She connected with clients, especially other immigrant families, on a level other agents couldn\u2019t. Her work ethic was relentless, her negotiation skills honed by a life that had demanded she be tough.\n\nBy her late thirties, she had saved enough to take the ultimate risk: opening her own boutique brokerage, \"Hadzic Homes.\" Today, she lives comfortably in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood whose foggy tranquility she finds deeply peaceful. Her 6.5-mile commute in her Lexus is a cherished ritual, a quiet time to strategize before a day of client calls and closings. Her success isn't for extravagance; it's for stability. Her dream is to fully pay off her parents' home and create an endowment to help newly arrived refugee families find their footing in the city that saved her. For Amina, every key she hands over is a promise fulfilled\u2014a tangible piece of the safety and belonging she fought so hard to reclaim."

Her father turned the key twice, his hand trembling slightly, then slipped it into his pocket as if it were still precious. Amina knew, with the chilling certainty of a fifteen-year-old, they would never use it again. That sound became the silence where her childhood used to be. It was the first, and most profound, closing of her life\u2014a transaction where she lost everything, cementing the key as the ultimate symbol of home.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, her hands were perpetually chapped from the hot dishwater in a Polk Street diner. She recalls her first paycheck: a grease-stained envelope with seventy-three dollars in cash. It wasn't nearly enough, but as she handed it to her mother and saw the flicker of relief in her tired eyes, a hard resolve settled in her bones. This city wouldn't break her; it was a system to be understood and conquered. Every scrubbed plate was a small act of defiance against helplessness.\n\n3.\nShe was walking home from her retail job through the Marina at twenty-two. A real estate agent in a sharp suit was slapping a \u2018SOLD\u2019 banner across a sign in front of a beautiful Victorian. In that instant, the agent wasn\u2019t a salesperson, but a gatekeeper to security\u2014the very thing her family craved. A path lit up in her mind, direct and absolute. That sign wasn\u2019t just a marker for a house. For Amina, it became a signpost for her entire future.\n\n4.\nHer first sale to another refugee family\u2014a couple from Eritrea\u2014was around age twenty-seven. They held the paperwork with a sacred terror. When Amina placed the cool brass keys into the mother\u2019s palm, the woman began to cry silently, her shoulders shaking with years of tension. In an instant, Amina wasn't their agent; she was the girl who had fled Sarajevo. This wasn\u2019t a commission; it was a restoration. She wasn't just selling a house, she was giving back what had been stolen.\n\n5.\nJust last week, driving her Lexus through the Inner Sunset\u2019s quiet, fog-shrouded avenues, she felt a profound sense of peace. The soft hum of the engine was a world away from the sirens of her youth. This commute, this bubble of controlled silence, was the sanctuary she had built for herself, mile by painstaking mile. The luxury wasn't the leather seats or the brand; it was the quiet. It was the tangible feeling of being safe, steering her own life, finally."
