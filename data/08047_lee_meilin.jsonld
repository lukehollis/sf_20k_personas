            "value": "Meilin Lee is a San Francisco native, born and raised under the cool, foggy skies of the Sunset District. The daughter of a pragmatic structural engineer and a community-oriented social worker, she grew up navigating the city's grid-like avenues and chaotic intersections. From an early age, she was fascinated not by the destinations, but by the journeys between them: the rhythmic lurch of the N-Judah train, the intricate dance of pedestrians at a Chinatown crosswalk, the flow of families through Golden Gate Park on a Sunday.\n\nThis fascination led her to a Master's in Urban Design, a degree she felt perfectly blended her father\u2019s logic with her mother\u2019s focus on human experience. Her early career in a conventional municipal planning department felt stifling, filled with zoning codes and traffic-flow charts that ignored the soul of a space. The turning point came when she volunteered to help organize logistics for a large outdoor art installation in the Mission District. Watching thousands of people interact with the art, their paths weaving into a temporary, living sculpture, she discovered her true calling: planning the movement of people through cultural spaces.\n\nNow, at 45, Meilin is a highly sought-after freelance consultant. Her \"office\" is her minimalist Hayes Valley condo, allowing for a 0.0-mile commute. Her work involves designing the pedestrian flow for art festivals, optimizing visitor circulation through museum exhibits, and consulting on wayfinding for arts districts. Her days are a mix of intense focus over architectural plans and invigorating walks to local cafes for inspiration.\n\nHer social life is a curated tapestry of old friends\u2014artists, chefs, and fellow designers\u2014with whom she shares intimate dinners and gallery openings. She has seen San Francisco morph through tech booms and busts, yet her connection remains rooted in the city's creative undercurrents. Meilin\u2019s quiet ambition is to lead the public experience design for a massive, city-wide art event, a project that would allow her to shape how millions of people connect with art, with the city, and with each other. For her, it\u2019s the ultimate expression of creating order and beauty out of movement."
