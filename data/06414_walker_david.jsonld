His commute is a short flight of stairs from his minimalist loft down to the polished concrete floors of \"Schema Gallery,\" the space he has managed for the last decade. This seamless integration of life and work is the quiet triumph of a man who spent his early years on a path that wasn't his.\n\nRaised in suburban Walnut Creek, David was the son of a pragmatic engineer and a high school math teacher. He was groomed for Silicon Valley, excelling in logic and numbers. He dutifully earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC Davis and, by 25, was a programmer at a rising dot-com startup. He had the salary, the stock options, and the pervasive sense of being an impostor. The work felt abstract, the culture hollow. The dot-com crash of 2001, which bankrupted his company, felt less like a disaster and more like a parole hearing.\n\nWith a meager severance package, David bought a one-way ticket to Europe. In the hushed halls of the Prado and the Uffizi Gallery, he found a language that finally made sense. He returned to San Francisco not to code, but to start over. He took a job receiving shipments at a gallery in SoMa, leveraging his old tech skills to build them a modern inventory system. He was observant and resourceful, slowly learning the business from the ground up, moving from logistics to sales, and eventually to curation.\n\nNow 46, David\u2019s life is curated with the same precision as the shows he hangs. His social circle consists of the artists he represents\u2014passionate, chaotic forces he helps channel\u2014and a few longtime collectors. Romances have been intermittent, often casualties of his devotion to the gallery. His daily routine is a ritual: coffee from a local roaster, hours spent corresponding with artists or planning installations, and evenings often hosting openings or quiet dinners. His ultimate dream isn't to be a wealthy art mogul, but to discover a singular, visionary artist and give them their first major show. For David, his life\u2019s work isn\u2019t about creating art himself, but about creating the perfect space for it to be seen."
