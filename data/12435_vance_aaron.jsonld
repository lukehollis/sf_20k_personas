Born in Fremont to a pragmatic, first-generation Chinese mother and a laid-back, third-generation Irish-American father, Aaron grew up navigating the space between his parents\u2019 worlds. He was a quiet, observant child, more comfortable listening than speaking, a skill honed by mediating minor cultural misunderstandings at the dinner table.\n\nThe defining turning point of his youth was his younger sister\u2019s struggle with severe social anxiety in middle school. Aaron watched, frustrated, as overworked school counselors and a stressed system failed to provide her with the support she desperately needed. It was this feeling of helplessness that ignited his purpose. He pursued a B.A. in Sociology at UC Davis, then enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, determined to become the resource his sister never had.\n\nNow 31, Aaron is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) at a diverse public high school in the Mission District. His days are a whirlwind of crisis intervention, family counseling sessions, and IEP meetings. He navigates the turbulent emotional lives of teenagers grappling with everything from academic pressure to housing instability, a role he finds both emotionally taxing and deeply fulfilling.\n\nHe lives a modest, structured life in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose blend of cultures reminds him of home. His 3.8-mile commute on the 5-Fulton Muni bus is his time to decompress, listening to podcasts or just watching the city wake up. Evenings are for release: a therapeutic run through Golden Gate Park, pick-up basketball at a local court, or attempting to perfect his mother\u2019s wonton recipe. His social circle is small and loyal, comprised mostly of fellow social workers who understand the unique pressures of the job.\n\nAaron\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth or status, but sustainability. He aspires to one day open a small non-profit providing accessible mental health services to first-generation and immigrant youth. For now, he is content in his chosen home, San Francisco\u2014a city of immense wealth and deep-seated inequality, where he feels his work matters most. He\u2019s not just a resident; he\u2019s an essential part of its complicated, human fabric."

Aaron, small in his chair, carefully explained that Dad didn\u2019t mean she was lazy, just that he admired her work ethic. He felt a quiet pride as the tension eased, a warmth spreading in his chest. He didn\u2019t have a word for it then, but he was learning to translate feelings, not just words. It was the first time he understood that listening could be a superpower.\n\n2.\nHe found his sister, then 13, hiding in the band room instrument closet during lunch, knees pulled to her chest. Her silent tears were a scream he couldn\u2019t unhear. The counselor's door was locked, a note about a staff meeting taped to it. A hot, furious helplessness burned in his gut\u2014a feeling of absolute failure, not his own, but the system's. That moment wasn't just a memory; it was a vow. He would become the person who could unlock that door for someone else.\n\n3.\nDuring his MSW internship, a non-verbal teenager, recently arrived from El Salvador, finally spoke. After weeks of sitting in shared silence, the boy quietly drew a picture of his journey and pointed to a single word he\u2019d written: \u2018solo.\u2019 Alone. Aaron felt the crushing weight of that story and, simultaneously, a profound, humbling sense of connection. The theory from his textbooks suddenly became real and breathing. He was no longer just his sister\u2019s brother; he was learning to be there for others.\n\n4.\nLast spring, a senior he\u2019d counseled through her family\u2019s eviction notice showed him her CCSF acceptance letter. Her hands were shaking slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d even finish high school,\u201d she whispered. Looking into her proud, tired eyes, Aaron felt the exhaustion of a hundred difficult sessions melt away into a singular, radiant point of purpose. It was a small victory against the city\u2019s massive inequities, but for a moment, it was everything. This was why he stayed.\n\n5.\nAfter a day spent de-escalating a vicious family crisis, he was running hard through Golden Gate Park. The fog rolled in, muffling the city\u2019s noise. As he reached the Dutch Windmills, the setting sun broke through the gray, casting a final pink glow on the waves. He stopped, gasping for air, feeling the day\u2019s vicarious trauma wash out of him with the tide. In that quiet moment, the city felt less like a problem to be solved and more like a home that held him."
