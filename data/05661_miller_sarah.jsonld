Raised in Daly City, just over the San Francisco line, she grew up in the loving friction between her Filipino mother\u2019s pragmatism and her Jewish-American father\u2019s intellectual dreaminess. Her mother, a nurse, hoped Sarah would find a stable career, while her father, a history professor, filled their home with books and encouraged her fascination with the stories behind objects and images. This duality defined her.\n\nInspired by her father, Sarah enrolled in Art History at San Francisco State University. She felt alive for the first time, lost in lectures on Dadaism and the Renaissance. But in her third year, her father\u2019s sudden illness brought her world to a halt. She dropped out to help her mother with his care, taking a temp job to contribute financially. When he passed away a year later, the momentum to return to school was gone, replaced by a need for stability. A friend connected her to an opening at a small, scrappy non-profit arts collective in the Mission District. She was hired as the Administrative Assistant, and she never left.\n\nNow 29, Sarah\u2019s life is contained within a few blocks. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a flight of creaky stairs from her rent-controlled apartment to the gallery below. She is the linchpin of the organization\u2014managing grants, coordinating artists, and ensuring the lights stay on. She lives in the orbit of the art world she once longed to join, but always from a support role. Her social life consists of a tight-knit circle of colleagues and a few friends from college, though a recent breakup has made her more introverted.\n\nHer apartment is her sanctuary and her prison, filled with the ghosts of unfinished canvases and half-full sketchbooks. Her greatest hope is to finally honor the artistic spirit her father nurtured in her. She dreams of taking a ceramics class at a community studio or even, one day, having a single piece of her own work hang on the gallery walls downstairs. Sarah is deeply connected to the Mission's creative pulse, yet she fears she is becoming a permanent spectator in her own life, waiting for the courage to step off the sidelines and create."

Her father tapped the wood, telling its story\u2014not of family dinners, but of the 19th-century craftsman who built it. Sarah felt suspended between her mother\u2019s world of practical action and her father\u2019s world of imagined history. It was the first time she understood that an object could hold both the life it was living and the ghosts of lives past. That duality became the lens through which she saw everything.\n\n2.\nShe was 20, sitting in a dim lecture hall at SF State. The slide projector clicked, revealing Duchamp\u2019s *Fountain*. Some students snickered, but Sarah felt a jolt of recognition. It wasn\u2019t just a urinal; it was an idea that shattered everything. For the first time, her mind felt truly her own, sparked and validated. That feeling\u2014of pure, intellectual possibility\u2014became the benchmark for a joy she has been chasing ever since. It was the moment she truly believed she was on the right path.\n\n3.\nShe was 21, at the kitchen table with financial aid papers spread before her. Her art history textbook lay open. Her mother came home from a 12-hour nursing shift, her face a mask of exhaustion, and went straight to her father\u2019s room. In that instant, the theories of the Renaissance felt like an impossible luxury. Closing the book, she quietly logged into the university portal and withdrew from her classes. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic choice, but a quiet, crushing inevitability\u2014the moment her father\u2019s dream for her gave way to her mother\u2019s reality.\n\n4.\nShe was 23, and had been at the collective for a year. The gallery was on the verge of cutting its free youth workshop. Sarah spent weeks wrestling with a complicated grant application, a world away from analyzing brushstrokes. The day the approval email arrived, the director hugged her, calling her their savior. She didn't feel like an artist, but she felt essential. It was a comforting, hollow victory that solidified her place on the sidelines\u2014not making the art, but making the art possible. She learned to find pride there.\n\n5.\nJust last month, during an opening in the gallery downstairs. She was checking the guest list, handing out drinks, a perfect administrator. An artist her own age was standing proudly next to a set of misshapen ceramic vessels. They were imperfect and beautiful. Sarah felt a familiar, painful ache\u2014a feeling of being separated from the scene by a sheet of glass. She went upstairs to her apartment, saw her own dusty sketchbook, and felt the full weight of her silence. That night, she googled \"beginner ceramics classes\" for the first time."
