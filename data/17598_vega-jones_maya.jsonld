The only child of Filipino immigrants\u2014a pragmatic nurse and a steadfast mechanic\u2014Maya grew up in a world that valued stability over creative pursuits. Her parents envisioned a future for her in medicine or law, a secure path they had worked tirelessly to make possible. But a fifth-grade field trip to the de Young Museum ignited a different passion. Standing before a vibrant abstract canvas, Maya felt a sense of order and emotion she couldn't articulate but knew she wanted to spend her life understanding.\n\nThis quiet rebellion defined her educational journey. She compromised with a BA in Art History from UC Davis, but then took a definitive step for herself by enrolling in the Master of Arts in Curatorial Practice program at the California College of the Arts. It was a financial and familial risk, but it felt like coming home. She paid her dues with internships and low-level gallery jobs, steadily building a reputation for her sharp eye and innovative approach to exhibition design.\n\nA key turning point was landing a position at the California Academy of Sciences. Here, her artistic sensibilities found a unique challenge: translating complex scientific concepts into compelling public narratives. She excelled, rising through the ranks over fifteen years to become the Director of Exhibitions. It was at a donor event there that she met her husband, Mark Jones, a thoughtful architect who was captivated by the way she spoke about the intersection of design and nature. They married in their late thirties, consciously choosing a life focused on their careers and shared passions over children.\n\nToday, Maya\u2019s life is anchored in the Inner Richmond. She and Mark own a lovingly restored Edwardian flat. Her daily routine begins with a strong coffee and a walk to the 5-Fulton MUNI bus, her 4.8-mile commute a time for reading and observation. Her days are a whirlwind of meetings with scientists, designers, and fabricators, orchestrating the complex dance of creating a new exhibit. Evenings are often spent with Mark, trying new restaurants on Clement Street or enjoying the quiet fog rolling in from Ocean Beach. Her connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees herself as a steward of its culture, shaping how residents and visitors connect with the world around them. Her dream is to curate a groundbreaking exhibition that truly merges art and science, leaving a legacy that inspires the same awe she felt as a child on that long-ago field trip."

While her parents preached the logic of medicine and numbers, this painting offered a different kind of sense\u2014an emotional one. In its wild splashes of color, ten-year-old Maya felt a deep, resonant order that she couldn't explain. It was the first time she had a secret that was completely her own, the moment a compass inside her found its true north.\n\n2.\nThe silence on the phone after she told her parents she\u2019d chosen CCA over a more practical path was heavier than any lecture. She pictured her mother\u2019s long nursing shifts and her father\u2019s grease-stained hands\u2014all for a future she was turning down. In that moment, guilt warred with a thrilling, terrifying resolve. This was her first, definitive step toward her own life. It was a painful moment of love and separation, but it forged her independence and taught her to stand by her choices, no matter the cost.\n\n3.\nIt was the opening night for \u201cCreatures of Light,\u201d her first major, solo-curated exhibit at the Academy. She watched a young girl press her hands against the glass of a jellyfish tank, her face bathed in the ethereal glow Maya had so carefully designed. She overheard the girl\u2019s father whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s like living art.\u201d All the doubt, the low-paying internships, and the familial pressure dissolved in that instance. She wasn\u2019t just decorating science; she was translating its wonder. She finally felt validated and utterly at home in her work.\n\n4.\nShe was at a donor event, passionately explaining the structural beauty of deep-sea coral for a new exhibit concept. A man, an architect named Mark, wasn\u2019t looking at the renderings but right at her. When she finished, he didn't ask about budget or visitor flow. He simply smiled and said, \"So the structure tells the story?\" In that one question, he saw the core of her entire philosophy. It wasn't just a moment of attraction; it was a profound spark of being seen and completely, intellectually understood.\n\n5.\nOn their first night in the empty Inner Richmond flat, she and Mark sat on the hardwood floor, sharing takeout from a Clement Street spot. The foghorn sounded its low, mournful note in the distance as the cool gray haze crept past their bay window. This wasn't the anxious stability of her childhood home in Daly City. This was a foundation they had built together\u2014a home earned through mutual passion and respect, nestled in the city she loved. Looking at Mark, she felt a deep, quiet sense of peace. She had arrived."
