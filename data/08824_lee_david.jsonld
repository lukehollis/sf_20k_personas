The only son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a bustling laundromat on Taraval Street, his childhood was scored by the rhythmic rumble of washing machines and the hiss of steam presses. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped he would pursue a stable career in business or medicine. But David was always more interested in how things worked, spending his youth disassembling broken appliances and sketching intricate designs for gadgets that only existed in his mind.\n\nRejecting the university path his parents envisioned, David enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Industrial Design and Technology. He found his calling not in textbooks, but in the tangible satisfaction of computer-aided design and the precision of a CNC machine. After graduating, he took a job as a Production Technician at a small, high-end fabrication lab that specialized in prototypes for tech startups and local artists.\n\nThe turning point in David\u2019s life came when a live/work unit became available in the same converted warehouse as his job in the Dogpatch neighborhood. This enabled his 0.0-mile commute. His life is now a seamless blend of personal and professional. He wakes to the smell of coffee from the cafe next door, walks downstairs into the workshop, and spends his days bringing complex digital files to life through 3D printing and laser cutting. His social circle is the small, tight-knit community of designers, engineers, and artists who use the lab, sharing beers at the local brewery after a long day. He\u2019s quietly close with a freelance product designer named Clara, their conversations often a mix of project troubleshooting and unspoken affection.\n\nDavid\u2019s San Francisco is not one of picturesque landmarks, but of industrial textures and creative energy. He feels the city\u2019s pulse in the hum of the machinery beneath his apartment. His dream is to use the lab's off-hours to develop his own line of minimalist, beautifully engineered home goods. At 34, David has built a life of quiet purpose, finding contentment not in climbing a corporate ladder, but in the profound, simple act of making."
