            "value": "Anastasia Petrova was born not in a city of fog, but one of granite palaces and early snows: Leningrad, 1980. The daughter of an engineer father and a biochemist mother, her Soviet upbringing was one of stoicism, intellectual rigor, and an unspoken understanding that emotions were luxuries one couldn't afford. The chaos of the post-Soviet 90s propelled her family to America, trading the Neva River for the promise of Silicon Valley stability when she was 15.\n\nObsessed with the subtext and unspoken narratives of her family, Anastasia initially pursued a Ph.D. in Slavic Literature at UC Berkeley. She excelled, but found the academic world sterile, a place to dissect stories rather than understand the people living them. A family crisis, centered on the immense pressure of assimilation and her parents' quiet, unresolved grief for the country they\u2019d left, became her turning point. She abandoned her dissertation and enrolled in a Master\u2019s program in Counseling Psychology, finally finding a language for the silent tensions that had defined her life.\n\nNow 43, Anastasia runs a private Marriage and Family Therapy practice from her serene apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, allowing her to create a sanctuary for both herself and her clients, most of whom she sees via telehealth. Her days follow a quiet rhythm: morning sessions, a long walk through the misty avenues of Golden Gate Park, then afternoon clients. Divorced a decade ago, she cherishes her independence and a small, tight-knit circle of friends who share her love for art house cinema and long, rambling conversations.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s fog is a comfort, a familiar echo of her St. Petersburg childhood. She lives within a ten-block radius, frequenting a local bookstore and a Russian bakery on Geary Boulevard for a taste of home. Her aspiration is not for expansion, but for depth: to continue helping couples and families untangle the legacies they carry, and perhaps one day write a book on the unique psychological burdens of the first-generation immigrant. For Anastasia, who began life amidst the collapse of an empire, success is the quiet, stable world she has carefully built for herself, one session at a time."
