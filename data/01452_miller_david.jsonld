            "value": "David Miller considers himself a \u201cPrincipal in None,\u201d a title he carries with a mix of irony and sorrow. Born in a Sonoma County commune to idealist parents who rejected societal labels, David\u2019s upbringing was a lesson in fluid identity. They taught him he was simply a member of the human family, a belief he still holds, hence his refusal to claim a specific ethnicity. His family moved to the Mission District in the late 70s, immersing him in a vibrant, multicultural San Francisco that shaped his worldview.\n\nForegoing a traditional college education, David pursued what he called a \"degree in living.\" He spent his twenties traveling through Southeast Asia and South America, absorbing philosophies and teaching English. This journey solidified his conviction that true learning happens through experience, not rote memorization. Returning to SF, he channeled this passion into creating \"The Agora Project,\" an alternative high school in a converted Mission warehouse. For fifteen years, he was its beloved Principal, fostering a curriculum based on Socratic dialogue, community service, and artistic expression.\n\nThe turning point was the dot-com boom of the late 2010s. The school\u2019s landlord sold the building, and the skyrocketing rent made relocation impossible. The Agora Project closed its doors, leaving David a principal with no school, a leader with no community to lead.\n\nNow, David lives in a small apartment in the same building that once housed his life's work; his commute is zero because he rarely leaves. His days are quiet and structured, filled with reading philosophy, tending to his balcony garden, and corresponding with former students who are now scattered across the globe. These connections are his lifeline, proof that his work mattered. He feels like a ghost of a bygone San Francisco, a city he loves for its history of rebellion but feels alienated from in its current, hyper-capitalist form.\n\nAt 53, David dreams not of rebuilding his school, but of distilling its essence. He hopes to write a book on his educational philosophy or start a small discussion group for local youth, a quiet effort to keep the spirit of inquiry alive in a city he fears is losing its soul."
