Born and raised in the Mission District, she is the daughter of a Chilean political refugee who found his voice in mural painting and a pragmatic second-generation Filipina nurse. Her childhood was a blend of her father's artistic soulfulness and her mother's compassionate pragmatism. She grew up surrounded by vibrant street art and the quiet resilience of immigrant communities, learning early that healing could take many forms.\n\nThe turning point that set her on her path came at sixteen when she discovered a hidden portfolio of her father's charcoal sketches depicting his flight from Chile. In those stark, silent images, she witnessed the power of non-verbal storytelling and the deep wounds of trauma. This profound moment ignited a desire to understand the human psyche, leading her to study psychology at UC Berkeley and later earn her Psy.D. from The Wright Institute.\n\nNow 43, Elara channels her background into her work as a clinical psychologist, specializing in supporting adolescents and families navigating the complex pressures of urban life. She works within a community health network, collaborating with schools and social services. Her 2.8-mile commute on the Muni N-Judah line from her Inner Sunset apartment is a daily ritual of observation, a moment to ground herself before immersing in the emotional lives of others.\n\nElara is intentionally single, finding fulfillment in a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of artists, educators, and fellow healthcare workers. Evenings are often spent decompressing with a walk through Golden Gate Park or sharing a meal at a neighborhood restaurant. San Francisco is both her sanctuary and the source of the anxieties she treats; she loves its diversity and creative energy but sees firsthand the toll its inequalities take.\n\nHer ultimate aspiration is to open a private practice that integrates art and narrative therapy, a tribute to her father\u2019s legacy. She dreams of building a space where young people can process their experiences not just with words, but with paint, clay, and ink\u2014creating a new generation of stories, healed and whole."

Inside, stark sketches depicted a desperate flight\u2014barbed wire, shadowed faces, a hand reaching through a fence. In that silent, dusty moment, his unspoken trauma became a language she could finally understand. It wasn't just art; it was survival. This discovery planted the seed of her life's work, showing her that the deepest stories are often told without a single word.\n\n2.\nAt twelve years old, she watched her mother tend to a neighbor boy who\u2019d fallen from his bike on the Mission sidewalk. There was no panic, only a pragmatic calm as she cleaned his bloody knee with firm, sure hands, her voice a low murmur of Tagalog and English. Elara saw how her mother\u2019s competence instantly soothed the boy\u2019s fear more than any platitude could. It taught her that compassion wasn't just about feeling; it was about capable, grounding action. That lesson became the bedrock of her clinical approach.\n\n3.\nShe was thirty-eight, and a non-verbal teen in her therapy group had been silent for weeks. One afternoon, Elara simply left a block of clay on the table. He picked it up, and with trembling hands, molded a small, cracked boat before sliding it across to her. For Elara, it was a profound echo of her father\u2019s sketches\u2014a story of a perilous journey told through art. This moment crystallized her dream, confirming that she had to build a space where healing could be shaped by hand.\n\n4.\nJust last year, on a crowded N-Judah, she watched a teenager huddled by the window, sketching furiously in a worn notebook as the train rumbled through the Sunset tunnel. The exhaustion on their face was stark against the focused intensity of their drawing. In that fleeting moment, Elara saw the city\u2019s paradox: immense pressure fueling desperate creativity. It was a silent, powerful affirmation of her purpose, a reminder of the young souls she fought for every day in her work.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, she sat with her closest friend, an educator, near the Dutch Windmill as fog spilled into Golden Gate Park. They didn't dissect the day\u2019s anxieties. Instead, they shared a thermos of tea, watching the cypress trees fade into the grey. In that comfortable quiet, Elara felt a deep sense of peace\u2014a connection untethered to diagnosis or treatment. This chosen family, this simple ritual, was her anchor. It was the sanctuary that made her difficult, necessary work possible."
