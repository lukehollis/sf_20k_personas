Born to a first-generation Chinese mother, a pragmatic accountant, and a white-American father, a laid-back high school drafting teacher, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a blend of two worlds. Her mother instilled a fierce discipline for academics, while her father encouraged her to deconstruct everything from toasters to model airplanes, fostering a love for understanding how things work. This duality shaped her into a person who saw beauty in both elegant theories and tangible, well-made objects.\n\nHer path was set early. She earned her Bachelor\u2019s from Cal Poly, reveling in its \"learn by doing\" philosophy, before securing a Master\u2019s in Industrial Engineering from Stanford. Sarah entered the tech world in the late 1990s, just before the dot-com bubble burst. While others were building flashy websites, she was focused on the less glamorous but more enduring challenge of manufacturing hardware. Her skills in optimizing supply chains and perfecting factory floor processes made her invaluable, allowing her to weather industry booms and busts with quiet competence.\n\nA key turning point was her amicable divorce a decade ago. Her ex-husband craved a slower, suburban life, but Sarah found her identity inextricably linked to her demanding career and the vibrant energy of San Francisco. She bought her condo in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she chose for its tranquility and proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her 0.0-mile commute began with the pandemic and never ended; her home is now her command center.\n\nHer days follow a strict rhythm. An early morning walk through the park, a strong coffee from a local cafe on Irving Street, and then hours of focused work, orchestrating a symphony of global logistics on video calls. Socially, she maintains a small, tight-knit circle of old friends and professional colleagues. Having mastered the corporate ladder, her aspirations have shifted. She dreams of mentoring young women in STEM and, perhaps one day, starting her own small consulting firm. More immediately, she hopes to find time for a pottery class\u2014a desire to reconnect with the tactile, creative world her father first showed her, a perfect counterbalance to the digital precision that defines her career."
