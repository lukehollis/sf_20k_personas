Her name itself tells the story: a Vietnamese mother who found a home in the Outer Richmond after the war, and an Irish-American father whose family had worked the city\u2019s docks for generations. Raised on foggy avenues and her mother\u2019s pho, Mai\u2019s childhood was grounded in a working-class community where family was everything. She was a bright, practical kid, the first in her family on a path to a four-year degree, enrolling in Business Administration at San Francisco State.\n\nHer neat life plan derailed during her sophomore year. Her father\u2019s health declined sharply, forcing him into an early, unpaid retirement. Without a second thought, Mai dropped out of college to find work, sacrificing her future for her family\u2019s present. She landed a job as an administrative assistant for a high-end real estate firm\u2014a stable position that valued her sharp organizational skills.\n\nNow 29, Mai lives a life of stark contrasts. Her 0.0-mile commute is a technical perk; she lives in a small, subsidized unit within the same gleaming SoMa high-rise where she works. Every day, she facilitates the sale of multi-million dollar condos with panoramic views she will never afford, organizing open houses for a level of wealth that feels alien. She is an invisible cog in the machine of the new San Francisco, a city that is rapidly erasing the one she grew up in.\n\nThough professionally courteous, Mai keeps her colleagues at a distance. Her true connections lie outside the glass tower: weekly dinners with her mother in the Richmond and a small circle of childhood friends who understand her quiet sense of duty. Her great hope is not to climb the real estate ladder, but to escape it. She meticulously saves for her real estate license, seeing it not as a career change but as a ticket to financial freedom. Her dream is to finally have the stability to pursue her passion for photography\u2014capturing the old, fading corners of the city, preserving the San Francisco of her parents before it disappears completely."
