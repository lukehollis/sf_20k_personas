            "value": "David Miller\u2019s story began before he was born, in the salty air of the Richmond District where his Korean immigrant parents opened a small dry-cleaning business in 1978. Born Min-jun but known always as David, his childhood was a blend of American cartoons and the Korean spoken at home, his days measured by the rhythmic hiss of the steam press from the shop below their apartment. He was a quiet, observant boy, absorbing the intricacies of customer service and the quiet dignity of his parents' tireless work ethic.\n\nHe was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling at San Francisco State with vague ambitions of studying business. But when his father\u2019s health failed during his sophomore year, David left school without a second thought to manage the family business. The temporary measure became a permanent reality. For over a decade, he was the constant behind the counter, the one who remembered which customers needed extra starch and who always asked about their children.\n\nThe turning point came when he was 35. The neighborhood was changing, rents were soaring, and the family decided to sell the business. It was both a liberation and a loss. With his deep-rooted experience in retail, David found work managing a high-end home goods store in Hayes Valley. He excelled, his quiet competence and genuine care for people making him an invaluable manager.\n\nAt 48, David\u2019s life is a masterclass in routine and stability. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from his clean, minimalist apartment to the immaculate showroom he manages. He is divorced, an amicable split years ago, and his main social connections are the other local shop owners and his regulars, with whom he shares coffees and neighborhood gossip. His connection to San Francisco is deep but hyperlocal; the city to him is not its iconic skyline but the familiar faces within a ten-block radius.\n\nHis aspirations have downsized from youthful ambition to quiet contentment. He finds joy in perfectly arranging a display, in helping a young couple choose their first \"real\" furniture. David dreams not of wealth or fame, but of one day having enough saved to take a long trip to see the national parks. He is a product of an older San Francisco\u2014a city of neighborhood loyalties and second-generation sacrifices, the steady, familiar face in a world constantly changing around him."
