The daughter of a pragmatic South Korean immigrant mother, a nurse who taught her discipline, and a freethinking Caucasian father, an architect who showed her beauty in structure, Sarah grew up in the East Bay suburbs. Her childhood was a blend of two cultures, a careful navigation between filial duty and American individualism that shaped her observant, analytical nature.\n\nHer educational path was unconventional for a future tech professional. Drawn to understanding societal patterns, she pursued a Master's degree in Sociology. While she loved the theory of human behavior, she grew frustrated by its qualitative limitations. A post-grad stint at a non-profit confirmed her suspicion: to truly understand the world, she needed data. This realization was her pivotal career turning point. Sarah methodically taught herself SQL and Python, translating her sociological curiosity into the language of code and analytics. She landed her first tech job in her late twenties and quickly climbed the ranks, finding a profound satisfaction in revealing the human stories hidden within datasets.\n\nNow 39, Sarah lives in a meticulously curated Hayes Valley apartment that doubles as her office. The 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate choice, a consequence of both the pandemic and a significant breakup two years prior that ended a long-term relationship. The split solidified her independence, leading her to invest deeply in her career and her personal space. Her days are structured by data queries and virtual meetings, but she breaks the digital monotony with intention. A morning run through the Panhandle, coffee from her favorite local cafe, and a weekly pottery class in the Mission provide tangible connection to the city.\n\nThough content, Sarah dreams of a future where her skills serve a more direct purpose. She envisions leaving corporate tech within the next decade to start a data consultancy for non-profits and social justice organizations. It would be the ultimate synthesis of her life\u2019s journey: using the rigid logic of data to support the complex, messy, and beautiful patterns of humanity she first fell in love with."
