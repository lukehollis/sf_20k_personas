Born and raised in the foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, he is a third-generation Japanese-American (Sansei). His father, a pragmatic structural engineer, and his mother, a gifted ikebana artist, instilled in him a dual appreciation for form and function. Pushed towards a stable career, Kenji honored his father\u2019s wishes, earning a Master of Architecture from UC Berkeley. For a decade, he designed sleek, minimalist commercial spaces, but a persistent, hollow ache grew within him. The buildings were beautiful, but he felt disconnected from the people who moved through them.\n\nThe turning point came at 38, during a severe burnout that left him questioning everything. In his recovery, he rediscovered his mother\u2019s influence, not in arranging flowers, but in using charcoal and clay to process his own confusion and anxiety. Art became his therapist. This profound experience ignited a new purpose. He enrolled at the California Institute of Integral Studies, earning a Master's in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Art Therapy. It was the degree that finally made sense of his life\u2019s disparate threads.\n\nNow, at 54, Kenji\u2019s commute is a walk down the hall of his Noe Valley Victorian. He has converted the light-filled front parlor into a serene studio and therapy practice. The air smells of turpentine, damp clay, and brewing green tea. Here, he guides clients\u2014grieving widows, anxious teens, and professionals facing their own burnouts\u2014through the non-verbal language of creation. His long-term partner, a landscape architect named David, tends to their lush back garden, a shared sanctuary.\n\nKenji\u2019s days are a calm rhythm of client sessions, quiet reflection, and walks with David through the neighborhood, where he is a familiar, gentle presence. He feels deeply woven into the fabric of San Francisco, a city that allowed him to fail, pivot, and rebuild a life of profound meaning. His dream is to secure funding to create a mobile art therapy studio, bringing the healing power of creation to underserved youth in the Tenderloin and Bayview-Hunters Point, offering the same lifeline that once saved him."
