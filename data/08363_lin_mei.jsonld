The only child of immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up amidst the controlled chaos of her parents\u2019 small restaurant in the Sunset District. From a young age, she wasn't just clearing tables; she was mentally redesigning the kitchen workflow, calculating the most efficient path from the stove to table four. Her parents, valuing hard work over procedural grace, saw her quiet observations as daydreams, but for Mei, it was the beginning of her calling.\n\nThis innate drive led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Industrial & Systems Engineering at UC Davis. While her peers were drawn to designing grand structures or complex code, Mei was fascinated by the elegance of a seamless process. She landed a job at a burgeoning tech firm in San Francisco, not as a coder, but as a Process Improvement Engineer\u2014a role that felt like coming home. Her talent was in identifying friction points in workflows and designing elegant, human-centric solutions.\n\nThe key turning point in her life was a professional triumph that coincided with a personal failure. After redesigning her company's entire project management pipeline, earning a major promotion, her long-term boyfriend ended their relationship. His parting words stung: \u201cI feel like a project you\u2019re constantly trying to optimize.\u201d This was a devastating revelation. Her greatest professional asset was a liability in her personal life.\n\nNow, at 32, Mei lives a life of careful intention in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute offers no separation between work and life, so she creates her own. Her mornings begin with a walk to Golden Gate Park, a ritualistic pour-over coffee, and then hours of focused work, untangling digital knots for her team. Socially, she is rebuilding. She maintains a small circle of college friends and recently joined a pottery class, forcing herself to embrace imperfection and the messy, unpredictable nature of clay.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. She knows the best time to get fresh dumplings on Clement Street and which bench in the park gets the perfect afternoon sun. Her dream is no longer just about optimizing external systems. Mei aspires to apply her skills inward, to find a sustainable process for her own happiness and learn to love the beautiful, inefficient messiness of human connection."
