Rebelling quietly, David pursued a Bachelor's degree in Art History, captivated by the stories and craftsmanship behind beautiful objects. After graduation, the academic world felt too stuffy, so he took a job at a high-end department store, discovering an unexpected talent. He didn't just sell a handbag; he sold its lineage, the designer\u2019s vision, and the feel of the hand-stitched leather.\n\nIn his late twenties, a management offer lured him to San Francisco, a city that pulsed with a vibrancy Portland lacked. He thrived, moving from department stores to exclusive designer boutiques. His career became his anchor, especially after a decade-long relationship dissolved amicably in his early forties, leaving him with an impeccably decorated but empty apartment. He poured his energy into his work, becoming the quintessential store manager: discreet, discerning, and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of his inventory.\n\nNow, at 53, David\u2019s life is a masterpiece of curation. He lives in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, a mere two-block walk from the luxury boutique he manages, making his commute non-existent. His days follow a precise rhythm: an espresso from his favorite local caf\u00e9, a walkthrough of his pristine sales floor, mentoring his young staff, and personally assisting his roster of long-standing clients. His social life is a small circle of industry peers and a few friends in the arts, often meeting for a glass of wine at a quiet bar or attending a performance at the nearby SFJAZZ Center.\n\nHe lives and works in the heart of the city but remains an observer. His connection to San Francisco is aesthetic and professional rather than deeply communal. Secretly, he dreams of cashing out and opening a small, personal gallery in a coastal town like Carmel, showcasing emerging artists. He has spent his life selling a carefully constructed version of the good life, and now he yearns to find a piece of it that feels entirely his own."
