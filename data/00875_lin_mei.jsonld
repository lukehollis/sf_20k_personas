Raised in a small apartment above her family\u2019s restaurant, Golden Jade Cafe, in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, her life was mapped out by the rhythms of the kitchen. The soundtrack of her youth was not pop music, but the clatter of porcelain, her mother\u2019s sharp commands in Cantonese, and the sizzle of oil hitting a hot wok. She was a dutiful daughter, bussing tables after school and doing homework at a corner booth, all while dreaming of a life beyond the steam-filled windows.\n\nHer escape route was education. She enrolled at San Francisco State University, choosing Business Administration as her major\u2014a practical degree she believed would land her a clean, quiet office job downtown. College was her first taste of freedom, a world away from inventory counts and demanding dinner rushes. She loved the anonymity of a large lecture hall and the promise of a structured, 9-to-5 career that was entirely her own.\n\nThe turning point came during her senior year. Her father, the heart and soul of the kitchen, suffered a serious health scare, forcing him into a sudden, early retirement. Her mother was overwhelmed, and the restaurant they had poured their life savings into began to falter. Reluctantly, Mei put her corporate ambitions on hold to \"help out for a few months.\" Those months bled into a year.\n\nNow, at 30, Mei is the manager of Golden Jade. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her apartment downstairs to the front of the house. The life she ran from has become her own. But it\u2019s different now; she\u2019s not just an unwilling helper. She uses her business degree to streamline ordering, manage social media, and build relationships with a new generation of diners. Her days are a blur of staff schedules, placating picky customers, and ensuring her father\u2019s recipes are honored with precision.\n\nHer social life is small but strong, mostly forged with other industry folks who understand her grueling hours. Her dream is no longer to escape the restaurant, but to elevate it. She envisions a subtle renovation, a modern cocktail menu that complements their classic Cantonese fare, and earning a Bib Gourmand nod from Michelin. Mei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into the very fabric of her existence\u2014she is a guardian of her family\u2019s legacy on a fog-drenched Clement Street, fighting to make their American dream her own."
