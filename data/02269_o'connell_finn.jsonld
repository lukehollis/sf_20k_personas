Growing up in Daly City, the son of a pragmatic electrician and a preschool teacher, Finn inherited a quiet sense of duty rather than a burning ambition. He was a gentle, observant child who preferred listening to holding court. School was a place he went, not a passion he pursued. After graduating high school without a clear path, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco and earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts, a credential that felt more like a placeholder than a destination.\n\nDrifting into the workforce, he sought stability and a role where his calm demeanor would be an asset. He found it as a Healthcare Assistant at a small community clinic in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. The real coup was landing a small, rent-controlled studio on the third floor of the same building that housed the clinic on the ground floor, making his commute a simple walk down two flights of stairs. His life became a compact loop: home, work, the corner grocer, the laundromat, and Golden Gate Park on sunny Sundays.\n\nAt 24, Finn is a master of routine. He manages patient records, schedules appointments, and offers a reassuring presence to those in distress. He is the keeper of other people's stories\u2014stories of pain, recovery, and resilience that he files away both digitally and mentally. He knows the neighborhood's rhythms through the ebb and flow of clinic appointments. Yet, he remains an observer, living vicariously through the dramas that unfold at his check-in window.\n\nA recent turning point came while listening to an elderly patient recount her vibrant life of travel, love, and activism in the city. Finn realized his own story felt unwritten, his connection to San Francisco transactional rather than experiential. A new restlessness has taken root. He\u2019s started taking the Muni to explore different neighborhoods after work, leaving his self-contained world behind. He dreams of going back to school, perhaps for nursing or social work\u2014a role where he isn\u2019t just supporting the story, but actively helping to shape a better outcome. Finn wants to build a life in San Francisco that is as rich and varied as the ones he so carefully documents each day."
