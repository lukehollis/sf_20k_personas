Growing up in Daly City, the son of a pragmatic electrician and a preschool teacher, Finn inherited a quiet sense of duty rather than a burning ambition. He was a gentle, observant child who preferred listening to holding court. School was a place he went, not a passion he pursued. After graduating high school without a clear path, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco and earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Liberal Arts, a credential that felt more like a placeholder than a destination.\n\nDrifting into the workforce, he sought stability and a role where his calm demeanor would be an asset. He found it as a Healthcare Assistant at a small community clinic in San Francisco's Inner Richmond. The real coup was landing a small, rent-controlled studio on the third floor of the same building that housed the clinic on the ground floor, making his commute a simple walk down two flights of stairs. His life became a compact loop: home, work, the corner grocer, the laundromat, and Golden Gate Park on sunny Sundays.\n\nAt 24, Finn is a master of routine. He manages patient records, schedules appointments, and offers a reassuring presence to those in distress. He is the keeper of other people's stories\u2014stories of pain, recovery, and resilience that he files away both digitally and mentally. He knows the neighborhood's rhythms through the ebb and flow of clinic appointments. Yet, he remains an observer, living vicariously through the dramas that unfold at his check-in window.\n\nA recent turning point came while listening to an elderly patient recount her vibrant life of travel, love, and activism in the city. Finn realized his own story felt unwritten, his connection to San Francisco transactional rather than experiential. A new restlessness has taken root. He\u2019s started taking the Muni to explore different neighborhoods after work, leaving his self-contained world behind. He dreams of going back to school, perhaps for nursing or social work\u2014a role where he isn\u2019t just supporting the story, but actively helping to shape a better outcome. Finn wants to build a life in San Francisco that is as rich and varied as the ones he so carefully documents each day."

Finn watched his dad\u2019s steady hands work, not speaking a word, just mending what was broken. He didn\u2019t understand the circuitry, but he understood the care. It was a lesson he absorbed deeply: that the most important work is often done quietly, in service to others, without any need for applause.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, sitting on a concrete bench at City College, he felt invisible. A group of students nearby were passionately arguing about a film, their futures feeling bright and certain. Finn clutched his textbook, a placeholder for a passion he didn't have. He wasn\u2019t sad, just adrift\u2014a ghost haunting the edges of other people\u2019s vibrant lives. That feeling of being an observer, of living behind glass, became a comfortable, if lonely, default state for years.\n\n3.\nHis first night in the studio above the clinic was a revelation. After locking the clinic\u2019s front gate, he walked up two flights of stairs and was home. Through his window, he watched the fog swallow the streetlights on Clement Street. He felt a profound sense of peace in this small, self-contained world. He hadn\u2019t conquered the city, but he had found a secure anchor within it. For a long time, that security was enough.\n\n4.\nMrs. Petrov, an elderly Russian patient, was describing a protest she\u2019d joined at City Hall in the 80s. As she spoke, her frail hand gripped the check-in counter, her eyes alight with a fire Finn had only read about. He looked from her face to the patient files he managed\u2014neatly organized chronicles of other people\u2019s pain and triumphs. Suddenly, his own life felt like a blank page in a locked cabinet. A deep, aching restlessness bloomed in his chest for the very first time.\n\n5.\nTwo weeks ago, after his shift, he walked past the stairs to his apartment and boarded a bus heading downtown. He got off at the Embarcadero and just stood, watching the bay lights flicker against the darkening sky. The cold wind felt like a shock to his system. It was the first time he\u2019d chosen the city over his routine, a small, deliberate act of stepping into his own unwritten story. He felt a terrifying, thrilling sense of possibility."
