A third-generation Sansei, he was raised in San Jose by a pragmatic engineer father and a nurturing librarian mother. They instilled in him a profound respect for both nature and order, sending him on a path that would blend the two. His childhood was marked by family trips to Yosemite, where the grandeur of the landscape sparked a lifelong passion for the environment.\n\nThis passion led him to UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's in Environmental Policy. He started his career with fiery idealism, working for a Bay Area non-profit, chaining himself to old-growth trees and writing impassioned op-eds. However, a key turning point came in his early thirties. Frustrated by the slow pace of activist victories, he pivoted to consulting, believing he could effect greater change from within the corporate world\u2014a compromise he still wrestles with. He became an expert in navigating the intricate web of environmental regulations, helping companies meet compliance not just as a legal hurdle, but as a strategic advantage.\n\nDavid has lived in the same rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset for over two decades. His 0.0-mile commute is a recent, welcome development, allowing his days to unfold with a placid rhythm. His morning begins with a walk through the dewy quiet of Golden Gate Park, coffee in hand, before he settles into his home office, a room lined with books and geological maps. A long-term partnership ended five years ago, leaving him with a solitude he has slowly learned to appreciate. His social life is small but deep: a weekly dinner with two old friends from his Berkeley days and a monthly hiking group that explores the coastal trails of Marin.\n\nAt 52, his ambition has softened from personal achievement to fostering a legacy. He finds deep satisfaction in mentoring junior consultants and dreams of seeing the complex wetlands restoration project he\u2019s championed for years finally break ground. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and tangible\u2014the fog rolling over the park, the green grocer who knows his name, the quiet hum of the N-Judah. He no longer needs to save the whole world, but hopes to leave his corner of it a little greener and more resilient than he found it."
