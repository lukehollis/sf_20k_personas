The son of an Indian immigrant mother, a talented chef, and a white American father, a quiet high school history teacher, he grew up in the suburbs of Sacramento. His childhood was a blend of fragrant curries and backyard barbecues, of Diwali celebrations and Christmas mornings. This constant cultural code-switching gave him a deep, early-developing empathy for anyone trying to find their footing between worlds.\n\nThe pivotal moment came when he was sixteen. His maternal grandmother, who spoke little English, suffered a fall. Rohan spent weeks navigating a labyrinthine healthcare system for her, translating complex medical terms and fighting for culturally competent care. He saw firsthand how easily people could be failed by the very systems meant to support them. The experience ignited a fire in him, leading him to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Social Work at San Francisco State University, drawn to the city\u2019s promise of diversity and progressive action.\n\nAfter graduating, Rohan started as a caseworker, dedicating himself to the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations. He worked tirelessly, his calm demeanor and innate empathy earning him the trust of clients and colleagues alike. He gradually moved into management, finding he could create wider change by shaping programs from the inside. Now 38, he is a Program Manager at a community health clinic in the Mission District, overseeing youth outreach and multilingual health education services.\n\nHis daily life is grounded and intentional. He begins each morning with a 2.1-mile bicycle ride to work, pedaling past vibrant murals and the familiar bustle of his neighborhood. His days are a blur of grant proposals, staff meetings, and the profound satisfaction of seeing his programs make a tangible difference. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Lower Haight, a space filled with books and plants. His social life revolves around a close-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow non-profit workers, teachers, and artists\u2014who prefer potlucks and Dolores Park picnics to the city\u2019s pricier nightlife.\n\nRohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. He hopes to secure enough funding to launch a new intergenerational program, connecting local youth with elderly immigrants\u2014a direct echo of the experience that set him on his path. He is a man woven into the fabric of San Francisco, not for its tech boom or scenic vistas, but for its compassionate, resilient, and ever-beating heart."

The bus was a moving tapestry: an elderly Cantonese woman arguing with her grandson, two men in leather jackets debating politics in Spanish, a musician cradling a cello. For the first time, Rohan didn't feel like he was code-switching between worlds. He felt like he was *in* the world, all at once. That feeling of quiet, chaotic belonging was the moment he knew he would never leave. It affirmed his choice and settled his restless heart.\n\n2.\nAt 25, as a new caseworker, he spent a month helping a monolingual Vietnamese family navigate the paperwork for disability benefits. When the final approval letter arrived, the mother, a woman who had been tense and fearful for weeks, simply placed a plate of freshly cut mango in front of him. Her son handed him a crayon drawing of their family, with a smiling stick figure labeled \"Rohan.\" In that small, humid Tenderloin apartment, he understood a wealth that had nothing to do with money, cementing his dedication to this demanding, soul-filling work.\n\n3.\nThe day he signed the lease on his Lower Haight apartment, age 28, felt more significant than his college graduation. He stood in the empty living room, smelling old paint and dust, and looked out the bay window at the cypress tree. It was rent-controlled, a near-mythical foundation in the city. This wasn't just an apartment; it was security. It was the key that unlocked his ability to pursue a life of service without the constant, gnawing fear of displacement. He could finally, fully, put down roots.\n\n4.\nLast summer, during golden hour in Dolores Park, he remembers the specific warmth of the blanket beneath him. His friends\u2014a public school teacher, a muralist, a fellow nonprofit lifer\u2014were laughing, sharing cheap wine and a potluck salad. The conversation wasn't about stock options or promotions, but about a student's breakthrough and a new community garden. It was a moment of profound contentment, a realization that he had built the exact life, and chosen the exact family, that his soul required.\n\n5.\nAbout a year ago, standing at the corner of 24th and Folsom, he saw it. A group of elderly Latina women sat on a bench outside a panader\u00eda, while a trio of teenagers from his outreach program practiced skateboard tricks nearby. They existed in separate orbits, inches apart. He saw his grandmother in the women's faces and his own youthful clients' search for purpose in the kids. In that instant, his past and his present collided, igniting the clear, unwavering vision for his intergenerational program. It wasn't just an idea; it felt like a calling."
