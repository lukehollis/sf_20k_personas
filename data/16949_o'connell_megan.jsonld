Raised in a working-class Irish-American family in Sacramento, she was the daughter of a union machinist who taught her to appreciate the mechanics of how things are made. While her friends were chasing ephemeral trends, Megan was fascinated by the complex dance of supply chains and production lines. This practical mindset led her to Cal Poly, where she earned a degree in Operations Management, choosing tangible systems over abstract theories.\n\nHer career began on the factory floors of the Central Valley, but ambition pulled her to the Bay Area in her late 20s. The move was a culture shock, but she found her niche. Megan\u2019s ascent was steady, built on a reputation for being tough but fair. The 2008 financial crisis was her trial by fire; as a junior manager, she had to implement painful layoffs, a memory that cemented her resolve to protect her teams whenever possible. A decade later, a difficult divorce became another turning point, forcing her to channel her focus entirely into her career, which ultimately propelled her into a directorship.\n\nNow, at 46, Megan\u2019s daily routine is a testament to her resilience. Her alarm sounds at 5:15 AM in her quiet Outer Sunset home. The fog is usually still thick as she gets into her car for the 18.3-mile commute to an advanced manufacturing plant in the East Bay, a grind she endures with audiobooks on industrial history. Her days are a whirlwind of solving complex logistical puzzles and managing a large, diverse team.\n\nShe lives alone but isn't lonely, maintaining a small circle of loyal friends from different chapters of her life. Weekends are her sanctuary, spent hiking the coastal trails of Marin or indulging in a glass of Sonoma Zinfandel at a favorite wine bar in Cole Valley. While she feels like an outlier in tech-obsessed San Francisco, she loves her foggy neighborhood\u2014a peaceful haven set against the wild Pacific. Her dream isn\u2019t a startup exit, but a future where she can use her expertise to consult for smaller, ethical manufacturers, and perhaps mentor the next generation of women who, like her, love to build things."

Her father, his own hands calloused and stained, explained how each tooth had a purpose in a larger dance inside a machine. The Sacramento garage air was thick with the smell of motor oil. It wasn't just metal; it was a system, a promise of order in a messy world. In that moment, she learned her first and most important language\u2014the language of how things work. This became her lifelong creed.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe name on the spreadsheet was Hector, a man with two kids and twenty years on the line. It was 2008. As a junior manager, Megan had to deliver the news in a stark, windowless office. She remembers how his gaze dropped from her face to his own worn work boots as she recited the corporate script. The shame burned in her throat. That day, she vowed she would climb high enough to build walls around her people, to make sure she was never just the messenger for someone else\u2019s bottom line again.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was the first Saturday after the divorce, around 2018. Her new house in the Outer Sunset was cavernous in its silence. She stood by the window, watching the fog swallow the street, a perfect reflection of her own internal landscape. The emptiness felt vast, but then a different feeling emerged: clarity. All the energy she\u2019d poured into her marriage was now hers alone, a resource to be managed. She decided then to invest it all in the one system she knew she could always fix: her work.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe call came at 2 AM a few years ago. The main production line was down, a catastrophic bottleneck costing thousands by the minute. Megan drove to the plant, the empty freeway her domain. On the floor, amidst the hum of idling machinery, she saw it\u2014a subtle timing flaw in the transfer mechanism that everyone else missed. An hour later, the line roared back to life. Standing in the rhythmic thunder of production, she felt a profound sense of belonging that no corner office could ever provide.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast spring, on a solo hike in the Marin Headlands. She\u2019d reached a windswept peak, watching the Golden Gate Bridge pierce through the rolling fog below. It was a masterpiece of engineering set against the wildness of the Pacific. In the quiet, she felt no loneliness, only a powerful solitude. This was the life she had meticulously built for herself, piece by piece. A system that worked, on her own terms, far from the noise of the city and the expectations of others."
