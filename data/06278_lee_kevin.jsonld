Raised in the sprawling suburbs of Fremont, he is the only son of first-generation Chinese immigrants who equated success with an engineering or medical degree. His childhood was a structured landscape of academic excellence, piano lessons, and the unspoken expectation that he would land a stable, high-paying job in Silicon Valley. His parents saw his future as a straight line; Kevin saw it as a map with unexplored territories.\n\nHis first major act of rebellion was choosing his major at UC Berkeley. He declared a Bachelor of Arts in History, a decision that baffled and disappointed his parents. He was fascinated by the patterns of the past, the stories that shaped societies, not by lines of code. Graduation, however, brought a harsh reality. Armed with a deep understanding of the fall of Rome but few marketable tech skills, he faced a challenging job market. This was his key turning point. In a pragmatic pivot, Kevin spent a year teaching himself data analysis, project management frameworks, and SQL, cleverly framing his history degree as a study in analyzing complex systems and human behavior.\n\nThe strategy worked. He landed a remote position as a Program Analyst for a mid-sized tech company. The 0.0-mile commute was his ticket to freedom. He immediately left Fremont and found a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. His daily routine is a study in contrasts. From 9 to 5, he is laser-focused, analyzing program requirements and user feedback from his small desk. But his breaks and evenings are for intentional exploration. He forgoes delivery apps to walk to local taquerias, gets his coffee from the same family-owned shop on 24th Street, and spends weekends photographing the murals in Clarion Alley.\n\nSocially, he maintains a close-knit circle of college friends but is slowly building connections through a local film club. His biggest dream is to finally bridge his two worlds. He envisions creating a history-focused app or an interactive web project that tells the stories of San Francisco's forgotten neighborhoods\u2014a project where his passion for the past could finally inform the technology of the future, proving to himself, and perhaps his parents, that his path was the right one all along."
