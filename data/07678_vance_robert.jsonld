            "value": "Robert Vance was a product of the stable, academic Midwest. Raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by a librarian mother and a professor father, his world was built on books and quiet intellectualism. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History, captivated by the grand narratives of the past, but found himself directionless upon graduation. The practical world had little use for his knowledge of the Peloponnesian War. Following a post-college girlfriend to Chicago, he took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a brokerage firm simply to pay rent. To his own surprise, he excelled. He had a historian's knack for organizing vast amounts of information and creating coherent systems from chaos.\n\nThis accidental career path led him to San Francisco in the late 1990s, recruited for a management role by a larger financial institution. For two decades, his life followed an upward trajectory. He and his long-term partner bought a condo in Hayes Valley, enjoying the city\u2019s vibrant culture. His career wasn\u2019t his passion, but it afforded him a life he was proud of. The key turning point came six years ago when his 15-year relationship ended, leaving him alone in the home they had built together. The breakup coincided with his company\u2019s shift toward remote work, a process the pandemic later made permanent.\n\nToday, Robert\u2019s world has shrunk to the 900 square feet of his condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to his ergonomic desk in the living room. His days are a disciplined cycle of Zoom meetings, portfolio spreadsheets, and email correspondence. He sees his neighborhood\u2014the stylish boutiques, the line at the local coffee roaster\u2014mostly through his large picture window. Though financially secure, a quiet melancholy has settled in. He feels more like a resident of his apartment than a resident of San Francisco. His dream is to one day disconnect entirely\u2014not just from work, but from the routine. He fantasizes about taking a year off to visit the historical European cities he once only studied, trading his digital life for a tangible connection to the past he left behind."
