            "value": "David Evans was born Chan Wai-keung in 1970s Hong Kong, the only son of shopkeepers. His world was the cramped apartment above his parents\u2019 small grocery store, a universe of scent\u2014dried fish, incense, and fresh produce. His education was practical, learned by stacking tins and making change. The future felt pre-written until the looming 1997 Handover cast a long shadow of uncertainty. In 1994, when David was 20, his family liquidated their assets and emigrated to San Francisco, seeking stability.\n\nThey bought a small corner market, complete with a two-bedroom apartment upstairs, in the Inner Richmond. David\u2019s formal education ended with his Hong Kong secondary school certificate, irrelevant in his new home. School was now the store. He learned English from delivery drivers and the elderly Russian women who bought kefir and rye bread. His career path was a staircase leading from the front door of their apartment down to the shop floor. He never applied for another job; the family business needed him.\n\nThe key turning point in David\u2019s life was not a single event, but a slow erosion of personal ambition. In his late twenties, he was engaged to a woman who dreamed of a life beyond ringing up lottery tickets and stocking beer. She pleaded with him to go to community college, to find a path that was solely his. But with his father\u2019s health failing, David couldn\u2019t fathom abandoning the store. The engagement ended, and with it, his last real dream of a different life. He officially took over as manager, and his parents retired, moving to a small condo in the Sunset.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is a loop contained within a single city block. His 0.0-mile commute is the 14 steps from his apartment to the shop floor. His social connections are the daily chats with his regulars\u2014the teacher from the school nearby, the construction foreman, the young renters who buy wine on a Friday night. They are his community, his extended family.\n\nHis hope is simple: to keep the store afloat against rising rents and the new organic grocery two blocks away. He dreams not of wealth, but of solvency. Perhaps one day he\u2019ll sell the business and use the money to travel, to finally see the world beyond the pages of the newspapers he sells. Until then, David Evans remains a quiet, essential fixture of his neighborhood, a man whose entire life story is written in the daily rhythm of a San Francisco corner store."
