Adopted at eleven months by a loving, blue-collar couple from Hayward, he grew up as the only child of an auto mechanic and a school cafeteria worker. His upbringing was filled with the smell of motor oil and the practical wisdom of making things work. While he was never academically inclined, he inherited his father's knack for taking things apart and putting them back together, a skill that defined his future.\n\nAfter graduating from high school with a general studies diploma, college seemed like an abstract and expensive detour. Instead, Kevin took a temp job in the late 90s, pulling cables for a data hosting company during the first dot-com bubble. This was his turning point. He was mesmerized by the intricate, orderly world of server racks and cooling systems. While others chased stock options, Kevin chased certifications\u2014A+, Network+, and later, specialized vendor credentials. He was reliable, methodical, and calm under pressure. He didn't build the websites; he built the physical foundation they lived on. Over two decades, he steadily climbed the ranks from a junior tech to the Lead Data Center Technician he is today.\n\nKevin's personal life is as orderly as his cable management. He lives alone in a small but well-kept apartment in SoMa, just a 2.1-mile MUNI ride from the vast, humming data center he oversees. He chose the neighborhood for its practicality, not its glamour. He\u2019s the guy who keeps the city's digital heart beating but remains anonymous to the tech-bro culture he quietly facilitates. His social life is small but tight-knit, consisting of his work crew and a few old friends he meets for beers at a no-frills dive bar.\n\nAt 46, Kevin feels a quiet sense of accomplishment. He has stability and a level of comfort his parents worked their whole lives for. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup but to take a long-overdue trip to South Korea. It\u2019s not about searching for his roots, but about seeing the country of his birth with the eyes of a man who has built his own world, one server rack at a time."
