The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and fresh produce in her parents\u2019 small grocery store on Irving Street. Her childhood was a lesson in practicality and hard work, with evenings spent stocking shelves and weekends helping customers. While her parents hoped she might become a pharmacist, a severe bout of pneumonia her father suffered when she was a teenager solidified her path. Watching the compassionate medical assistants manage his care with efficiency and kindness inspired her to pursue a career where she could offer the same steady support.\n\nShe enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Medical Assisting. It was a practical choice that allowed her to stay close to her aging parents. Soon after graduating, she began working at the student health clinic of a local university, a position she has held for nearly three decades. Her career has been her anchor, especially after the profound turning point of losing her husband, a Muni bus driver, to a heart attack ten years ago. Left to raise their teenage son, Alex, alone, Mei-Ling found solace in the routines of her work and the familiar streets of her neighborhood.\n\nToday, Mei-Ling\u2019s life is one of quiet rhythm. Her 1.2-mile commute on the N Judah light rail is a time for reflection. At the clinic, she is a calming presence for students navigating everything from homesickness to their first major illness, her professional demeanor softened by a maternal warmth. Her $68,000 income requires careful budgeting in the expensive city, but she lives modestly in the same rent-controlled apartment she shared with her husband.\n\nHer evenings are simple: cooking traditional Cantonese dishes, tending to her small balcony garden of orchids and jade plants, and FaceTiming with Alex, now a software engineer in San Jose. Her hopes are not grand; she dreams of seeing her son find a good partner and, one day, taking a trip to Hong Kong to see the village her parents left behind. Mei-Ling is a quiet anchor, a testament to the enduring, working-class soul of a city constantly in flux."

Mrs. Chan, a tiny woman who spoke only Toisanese, was panicked, unable to find the right herbs. Mei-Ling, using the halting dialect her father had taught her, calmly located the red dates and dried lily bulbs for a soothing soup. Seeing the woman\u2019s shoulders relax, her frantic energy soften into gratitude, planted a seed in Mei-Ling\u2019s heart. It wasn't a transaction; it was a quiet, necessary comfort.\n\n2.\nThe hospital room felt chaotic, her father\u2019s breathing a ragged sound against the beeping machines. Mei-Ling felt powerless until a medical assistant entered. Deftly and without fuss, she checked his vitals and spoke to him in gentle Cantonese, her calm presence a small island in their sea of fear. In that moment, watching the assistant\u2019s quiet competence, Mei-Ling saw her future. She didn\u2019t want to be a doctor or a pharmacist; she wanted to be that steady hand, the person who brings order to another\u2019s fear.\n\n3.\nKen was driving the N Judah then, years before his heart gave out. One crisp Saturday, she and a young Alex rode his route just for fun, sitting right behind him. At the UCSF Parnassus stop, he caught her eye in the big mirror and gave a little wink. The city slid past the windows, a world they were both a part of\u2014he, steering its artery; she, healing its people. Now, whenever the train lurches at that stop on her commute, she feels the echo of that wink.\n\n4.\nIt was a few months after Ken\u2019s death. Alex, then fifteen, quietly asked if they would have to move. Mei-Ling was terrified of the same thing, but she looked at her son\u2019s worried face and found a strength she didn\u2019t know she had. She pulled out a notepad and said, \"No. We just have to be smart about it.\" Together, they made their first budget at the small kitchen table. That list of numbers became her shield, a promise to her son written in ink.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, a freshman from rural Oregon came into the clinic, overwhelmed and homesick, with a minor cold. While taking his temperature, Mei-Ling saw the same look of displacement she'd seen in her own parents. She told him about the sea lions at Pier 39 and the best place to get a warm sourdough bowl. The student\u2019s tense shoulders dropped. She knew then that her work wasn\u2019t just about medicine; it was about anchoring these kids, momentarily, until they could find their own footing in the city."
