Born in San Jose to an Iranian engineer father and a Mexican-American librarian mother, her childhood was a vibrant blend of meticulous Farsi poetry and the warm storytelling of her maternal *abuela*. Her father instilled in her a love for logic and systems, while her mother taught her empathy and the art of finding the right story for the right person. This dual heritage planted the seeds for her future: understanding how humans connect with complex information.\n\nShe sailed through her undergraduate studies at UC Santa Cruz, but graduated with a degree in Cognitive Science just as the 2008 recession hit. The ensuing struggle through a series of unfulfilling temp jobs became a pivotal learning experience. It was during a stint organizing chaotic customer feedback for a struggling startup that she had her epiphany: she wasn't just organizing data; she was translating human frustration into actionable insights. This realization propelled her to pursue a Master\u2019s in Information Science at the University of Michigan.\n\nArmed with a graduate degree, Sonia returned to the tech-saturated Bay Area. She quickly moved up the ranks, her unique ability to blend data analysis with genuine human understanding making her invaluable. Now a Senior UX Researcher, she leads a team that shapes how millions of people interact with information online.\n\nHowever, the relentless pace led to severe burnout five years ago. In a deliberate act of self-preservation, she moved from a sterile SoMa apartment to a charming Victorian flat in Alameda. Her daily routine is now anchored by the 11.4-mile ferry commute. This tranquil journey across the bay, book in hand and sea air on her face, is her non-negotiable buffer between the demanding world of user flows and her quiet, personal life. San Francisco is the city of her ambition, but Alameda is her sanctuary. She hopes to one day launch a small consultancy focused on improving user experiences for non-profits, bringing her high-level skills to organizations with more heart than capital."

The air was thick with the scent of her *abuela\u2019s* corn tortillas and the rhythmic sound of her father reciting Hafez, his voice a low, melodic Farsi current. In that moment, she felt no division, only a perfect wholeness. Logic and poetry, storytelling and sustenance, all coexisting in the warm kitchen air. This memory became her internal compass, teaching her that seemingly disparate systems could create something beautiful together. It was the foundation of her entire worldview.\n\n2.\nIt was 2009, under the humming fluorescent lights of a temp job she hated. Drowning in a spreadsheet of angry customer feedback, she felt a wave of despair. But then, as she stared at the raw, messy text, something shifted. These weren't just complaints; they were stories of frustration. In a sudden, electric moment of clarity, she saw the human behind the data point. This epiphany transformed her career trajectory, turning a dead-end job into the first step toward translating human experience into functional design.\n\n3.\nHer first major project review as a team lead. The engineers were dismissing user frustrations as illogical. Sonia took a breath, put away the data charts, and instead told the story of a single user: a grandfather trying to video call his granddaughter. She used his exact words. The room went silent. For the first time, she saw cold data analysis fail where a simple story succeeded. This moment cemented her confidence, proving her unique, empathy-driven approach was not a soft skill, but a powerful advantage.\n\n4.\nThe first morning commute from Alameda, five years ago. Stepping onto the ferry, the cold salt spray hit her face, a stark contrast to the recycled air of her SoMa office. As the boat pulled away, shrinking the imposing San Francisco skyline into a picture postcard, she felt a knot in her chest\u2014one she hadn't even known was there\u2014finally unravel. This wasn't an escape; it was a reclamation. That daily journey across the water became her sacred ritual of decompression and self-preservation.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, she tried to donate to a small arts non-profit online. The website was a clunky, frustrating mess. Her initial annoyance quickly melted into a deep, aching empathy. She pictured the passionate, overworked staff who simply lacked the resources to build something better. She realized her high-level corporate skills could be a lifeline for organizations with more heart than capital. In that moment of compassionate frustration, the dream of her own consultancy was born, a way to bridge the gap for them."
