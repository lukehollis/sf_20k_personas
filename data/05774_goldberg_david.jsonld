He was born and raised in the Richmond District, the son of a pragmatic tailor and a quiet school librarian. His father preached the value of a steady trade, while his mother filled their foggy home with stories, whispering worlds into existence from the pages of worn library hardcovers. This duality defined David\u2019s youth: a pull between the practical and the poetic.\n\nHe dutifully enrolled in business classes at San Francisco State University, a compromise to appease his father. But the fluorescent lights of the lecture halls felt sterile compared to the warm, cluttered aisles of the city's bookstores. After three semesters, David made his first and most definitive life choice: he dropped out. He found his true education stocking shelves and running the register at \"The Last Page,\" a beloved, slightly ramshackle independent bookstore in North Beach. The owner, a sharp-witted woman named Eleanor, saw in him not just an employee, but a successor.\n\nThe key turning point came fifteen years ago. When Eleanor retired, she sold David the store\u2014and the small apartment above it\u2014for a price that was more gift than transaction. His commute became a short walk down a creaky wooden staircase. His life and livelihood fused. This devotion likely cost him his long-term relationship; his partner grew tired of competing with dusty first editions for his attention.\n\nNow, at 53, David\u2019s days are a familiar ritual. He wakes before the city, curates the window display, and shares quiet conversations with his regulars\u2014the grad students, the neighborhood poets, the tourists seeking an authentic piece of San Francisco. These people are his true family. He remains a fixture of an older San Francisco, a quiet protest against the city\u2019s frantic modernization. His greatest hope is not wealth or fame, but simply to keep the lights on for another year, ensuring that in a city obsessed with the future, there is always a place to turn the last page."
