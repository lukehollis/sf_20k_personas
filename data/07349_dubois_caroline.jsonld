The daughter of a history professor and a librarian, her upbringing was a scaffold of books, disciplined study, and dinner-table debates on social justice. This environment instilled in her a deep-seated belief in civic duty, but she yearned for a more hands-on way to effect change than the academic world offered. After completing her undergraduate degree in sociology, a year with AmeriCorps in Philadelphia solidified her path. It was there, working with unhoused populations, that she found her calling.\n\nThis led her to pursue a Master of Social Work (MSW), focusing on public policy and administration. Armed with her graduate degree, she moved to San Francisco in her late twenties, drawn by the city\u2019s progressive reputation and a job offer at a prominent housing-focused nonprofit. For over a decade, she threw herself into her work, climbing from caseworker to her current role as a Program Manager. A key turning point was the end of a long-term relationship five years ago, an amicable split that prompted a period of intense self-reflection and a recommitment to her own sense of purpose.\n\nToday, Caroline\u2019s life is deeply rooted in her Inner Richmond neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute means her small, book-filled apartment doubles as her office. Her days are a structured rhythm of Zoom calls with city officials, grant writing, and remotely managing her team. Mornings begin with a walk to a local bakery for coffee and a pastry, followed by a stroll through Golden Gate Park, her sprawling backyard. She has a tight-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of friends, forged through years of potlucks and shared holidays.\n\nWhile she feels the city\u2019s deep-seated tensions\u2014the chasm between tech wealth and street-level poverty\u2014she remains a pragmatic idealist. Her dream isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but to see the programs she manages create lasting, stable housing for her clients. She aspires to a future of quiet contentment, meaningful work, and continued connection to the community she has chosen to call home, one spreadsheet and one successful housing placement at a time."
