The only child of Russian immigrants who settled in Daly City in the late 1990s, she grew up as the family\u2019s primary navigator of American life. She watched her parents, brilliant engineers in their homeland, struggle to understand obtuse insurance forms and deferential doctor\u2019s visits, a stark contrast to the direct, and often brusque, system they had left behind.\n\nThe turning point came when her grandmother, visiting from Moscow, suffered a preventable health crisis due to a misunderstood prescription. The incident ignited a quiet fury in sixteen-year-old Anastasia. She realized the biggest barrier to health wasn't always disease, but a lack of clear, culturally competent information. This conviction guided her to UC Davis, where she pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Public Health, focusing on community outreach and education.\n\nUpon graduating, Anastasia secured a fully remote position as a Health Educator for a major Bay Area healthcare provider. This freedom allowed her to move away from the quiet suburbs of her youth and into the vibrant heart of San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a privilege she doesn\u2019t take for granted. Her days are structured yet flexible: a morning run through Golden Gate Park, followed by hours at her standing desk, designing accessible health literature, developing virtual wellness workshops, and answering patient queries via a secure portal.\n\nAnastasia\u2019s apartment, filled with plants and books, is her sanctuary. She maintains a close-knit group of friends from college, often hosting potlucks where her homemade borscht is a staple. Her connection to her parents remains profound; she calls them daily and spends most Sundays back in Daly City, helping them with everything from grocery shopping to deciphering their latest medical bills. She is their bridge, a role she now plays professionally for countless others.\n\nWhile she finds deep meaning in her work, Anastasia dreams of launching her own non-profit. Her vision is to create a resource center providing health literacy programs specifically for the Bay Area's diverse immigrant communities, ensuring no one else\u2019s family has to suffer because something was lost in translation."
