She arrived in the Outer Richmond from Hong Kong at age twelve, speaking halting English. Her family poured their life savings into a small grocery store on Balboa Street, and Mei\u2019s childhood was spent stocking shelves, running the register, and translating for her parents. While she earned her high school diploma, her true education came from managing inventory, handling difficult customers, and understanding the razor-thin margins of a family business. College was a luxury she couldn't afford and didn't have the grades for; her focus had always been survival.\n\nHer career began not with an internship, but as a receptionist at a burgeoning software company in the late 90s. In the chaotic dot-com boom, Mei\u2019s innate sense of order and preternatural ability to anticipate needs made her indispensable. She wasn't just answering phones; she was fixing broken printers, coordinating lunches, and quietly organizing the office move that everyone else dreaded. A perceptive COO noticed her competence and promoted her to Office Manager. This was her turning point. Mei climbed the ladder through sheer grit and performance: from Office Manager to Facilities Head, and now, to Director of Workplace Services, managing a global team from the sleek home office in her SoMa condo.\n\nAt 49, Mei is divorced\u2014a brief marriage in her thirties to a man who couldn't understand her ambition\u2014and has no children. Her primary connection is to her aging parents, whom she has set up comfortably in the Sunset. Her days start early with calls to European vendors and end late checking on build-outs in Asia. Her 0.0-mile commute gives her back hours she invests in her work or in quiet evenings overlooking the city that sculpted her. Her aspirations are no longer about the next promotion; she\u2019s already surpassed her wildest dreams. Now, she hopes to create a mentorship program for administrative professionals within her company, championing the kind of non-traditional talent she once was. Mei Lin\u2019s San Francisco is not one of venture capital and IPOs, but of resilience, observation, and the quiet, undeniable power of making things work."
