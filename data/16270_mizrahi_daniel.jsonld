The son of a second-generation Japanese-American ceramicist and an Israeli-immigrant history teacher, his childhood was a blend of wabi-sabi aesthetics and lively debates over Sephardic history. This unique upbringing instilled in him a deep appreciation for how culture is preserved and passed down, shaping his future path.\n\nHe stayed local for his undergraduate studies, earning an Art History degree from San Francisco State University. While he loved the theory, he felt a stronger pull toward the practical side of the art world\u2014the organizing, funding, and community-building that allowed art to exist. This realization led him to Boston University for a Master\u2019s in Arts Administration. Returning to the Bay Area after the 2008 recession, he faced a challenging job market, cutting his teeth with grant-writing gigs for small, struggling theater companies. A key turning point came when he secured a career-saving grant for a beloved Mission District performance space, cementing his belief that he could be a bridge between creativity and capital.\n\nNow, as the Director of Development for a prestigious contemporary science and arts museum in SoMa, Daniel\u2019s days are a whirlwind of donor meetings, strategic planning, and campaign launches. He translates artistic vision into financial viability, a role he finds both stressful and immensely rewarding. His 2.5-mile commute on the Muni bus from his Hayes Valley apartment is a cherished ritual, a time to listen to podcasts and watch the city wake up.\n\nHe shares his life with his partner of six years, Mateo, a landscape architect. Their evenings are often spent attending gallery openings, trying new restaurants in their neighborhood, or simply enjoying the view from their bay window. Daniel loves San Francisco for its vibrant, rebellious creative spirit, a spirit he sees as constantly under threat. His ultimate aspiration isn't just to meet fundraising goals, but to build a lasting endowment for his institution, ensuring that the city's artistic soul has a permanent, protected home. He dreams of a San Francisco where art is not a luxury, but a fundamental part of its identity, accessible to all."

She was mending a cracked tea bowl with delicate lines of gold lacquer. \"It's more beautiful for having been broken,\" she explained, a core tenet of *kintsugi*. He traced the golden seams with his finger, feeling a profound lesson settle in his bones: that caring for fractured things, highlighting their history instead of hiding it, was its own form of art. This idea of mending with gold would become his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nIt was 2011, and he was hunched over his laptop in a cramped apartment. The call came from the director of the Mission theater he'd spent months fighting for. Her voice cracked with relief. \"We got it, Daniel. You saved us.\" In that moment, the abstract grind of grant-writing vanished, replaced by a visceral, electric certainty. He wasn\u2019t just shuffling papers; he was building a lifeboat. That feeling of tangible impact, of being the bridge between a vision and its survival, became the bedrock of his entire career.\n\n3.\nA few years ago, after a brutal week of donor negotiations, Mateo led him to their new Hayes Valley bay window. Below, the evening light hit the trees in the median, their leaves a perfect, designed green. \"My work,\" Mateo said softly, gesturing down, then pointed toward the glowing dome of City Hall. \"Your work.\" Daniel felt the tension in his shoulders release. He understood their partnership then: two different disciplines, both dedicated to building and preserving beauty in the same small, beloved city.\n\n4.\nHe was an undergrad at SF State, walking past a small gallery in the Haight he cherished, only to see a stark \"For Lease\" sign in the window. The academic theory he\u2019d learned that day felt hollow, useless against the brute reality of rent. It was a gut punch. He realized he didn\u2019t just want to interpret art; he wanted to protect it, to fight for its physical space in the world. That day, his focus pivoted from art history to arts administration, from the \"what\" to the vital \"how.\"\n\n5.\nLast spring, he was walking through the museum, his mind churning over endowment figures. He saw a field trip of fifth-graders gathered around an interactive light sculpture he\u2019d helped fund. One girl, completely transfixed, reached out a tentative hand as if to touch the photons. Her expression wasn't just wonder; it was ownership. In her eyes, he saw his true goal realized: not a dollar amount, but a future where every San Francisco kid felt this art was fundamentally, irrevocably theirs."
