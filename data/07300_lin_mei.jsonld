Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she was the dutiful daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the boisterous sounds of her American schoolyard, her days often ending with her stocking shelves or running the cash register after homework. This early immersion in retail instilled a powerful work ethic, but Mei dreamed of a world beyond dusty cans and produce bins.\n\nWith a passion for visual arts, she enrolled at San Francisco State University to study graphic design. For two exhilarating years, her world expanded with color theory and typography. However, this chapter closed abruptly when her father suffered a major health crisis, forcing him into early retirement. The family had to sell the store, and with their savings strained, Mei made the difficult decision to leave college and find full-time work to help support her parents.\n\nHer experience from the family business made her a natural in retail. She landed a job at a chic home goods and apparel boutique in Hayes Valley, quickly proving her competence and sharp eye for merchandising. Within a few years, she was promoted to Assistant Store Manager. Her life became intrinsically tied to the neighborhood when she moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment directly above the shop, reducing her commute to a simple flight of stairs.\n\nNow 27, Mei's days are a familiar rhythm. She wakes to the sounds of Hayes Street coming alive, grabs a coffee from her favorite local cafe, and spends her days managing inventory, styling mannequins, and connecting with regulars. Her social life is woven into her work; drinks with coworkers after a long shift, weekend brunches with a few close friends. She remains deeply connected to her family, making the MUNI trip back to the Sunset every Sunday for dim sum with her mother.\n\nWhile she\u2019s proud of the stable life she\u2019s built, the artist inside her hasn't vanished. In the quiet of her apartment, she sketches designs for her own dream store\u2014a curated space that would combine vintage finds, local artisan crafts, and perhaps, her own line of prints. The sacrifice she made for her family defined her path, but Mei is quietly gathering the skills and savings to one day merge her past experience with her deferred dream, right in the city that holds her entire history."
