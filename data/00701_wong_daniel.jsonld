He was raised in the fog-drenched avenues of the Outer Richmond, the son of Hong Kong immigrants who poured their life savings and relentless energy into a small neighborhood grocery store. From behind the counter, a young Daniel learned the language of inventory and margins, but his mind drifted to the histories of the dynastic artifacts he read about in library books. His parents, pragmatic and weary, pushed for a stable career in engineering or medicine.\n\nDaniel compromised. He indulged his passion with a B.A. in East Asian Studies from UC Berkeley, a choice that caused quiet friction at home. However, witnessing his father\u2019s health decline from decades of tireless labor was a turning point. Daniel realized that passion needed a sustainable engine. He pivoted, pursuing a Master of Science in Information Management and Systems, also at Berkeley. This unique blend of humanities and data science made him a perfect fit for the burgeoning tech world.\n\nHe quickly ascended the ranks of tech management consulting, known for his ability to translate complex human behaviors into actionable data strategies. Now, at 37, he operates from a minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his success; his workday consists of back-to-back video calls, orchestrating corporate transformations from his standing desk overlooking the city.\n\nHis life is comfortable but contained. Weekday evenings are for the gym or meticulously prepared meals, while weekends are for trail runs in the Marin Headlands or catching up with a close-knit group of friends from grad school. He is single, having found that the demands of his career often eclipsed the needs of past relationships.\n\nLately, a familiar restlessness has returned. The financial security he built feels like a foundation, not a destination. His dream is to bridge the two halves of his life: to launch a venture that uses AI and augmented reality to preserve and share cultural histories, starting with the stories of immigrants like his parents. He yearns to trade corporate decks for a project with personal meaning, to finally build something that honors both the boy who read about dynasties and the man who mastered data."
