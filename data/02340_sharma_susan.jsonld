Her commute is a flight of stairs, from her small apartment down to the fragrant, bustling dining room of \"Sharma's Kitchen,\" the restaurant that has defined her American life.\n\nBorn Sunita in a crowded Delhi neighborhood, she was the eldest of four sisters. Her education ended after higher secondary school, her future aimed squarely at a good marriage. That marriage was to a man with family in San Francisco and a shared dream of opening an authentic North Indian restaurant. She arrived in her early twenties, full of nervous hope, embracing the new name \u2018Susan\u2019 to make things easier for customers.\n\nThe dream materialized, but it was fragile. Just five years in, her husband died suddenly from a heart attack, leaving Susan a widow in a foreign country with a young son, Raj, and a restaurant now fully owned by her brother-in-law. Grief was a luxury she couldn't afford. She transitioned from a helper in the kitchen to the restaurant\u2019s lead server, her warmth and efficiency becoming the establishment\u2019s bedrock.\n\nFor over two decades, her days have followed a familiar rhythm: the morning scent of cardamom and cloves, the lunch rush, the brief afternoon lull where she calls her son, and the long dinner service. Her customers are her community; she knows their orders, their children\u2019s names, their quiet triumphs and sorrows. Her relationship with her brother-in-law is professional but carries the weight of unspoken history.\n\nNow, at 51, her son Raj is a successful software engineer, the embodiment of her sacrifice. Her personal dreams have become quiet embers. She fantasizes about a trip back to India, not for family obligation, but to see the Taj Mahal by moonlight, just for herself. More privately, she hopes that one day her brother-in-law will add one of her mother\u2019s recipes to the menu\u2014an acknowledgment that this kitchen, this life, is hers, too."
