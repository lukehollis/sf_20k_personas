Raised in a small logging town by a practical-minded teacher and a forester, her love for stories felt like a private rebellion. She pursued this passion at the University of Oregon, earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, fascinated by how narratives shape human understanding. After graduating, she felt adrift, working in a Portland bookstore, surrounded by stories but not yet knowing how to create her own.\n\nThe turning point came during a visit to a small gallery. She saw a video installation piece\u2014a fragmented, haunting narrative told through light and sound. It was a revelation; art wasn't just static images, but a living, breathing form of storytelling. Fueled by this new purpose, she moved to San Francisco, drawn by its vibrant and experimental art scene.\n\nHer entry into the art world was a grind. She volunteered, worked the ticket counter at a SoMa museum, and spent her evenings at gallery openings, absorbing everything. Her literary background gave her a unique perspective, allowing her to articulate the narrative threads in abstract works. This insight eventually earned her an interview, and finally, the position of Curator Assistant.\n\nNow 36, Sarah\u2019s life is a curated five-block radius. Her modest, rent-controlled apartment is a short walk from the museum, making her commute a daily stroll through Yerba Buena Gardens. She lives alone, having ended a long-term relationship a year ago, and pours her energy into her work. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a graphic designer and a writer\u2014who meet for wine in Hayes Valley or explore pop-up galleries.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to step out from the shadow of the senior curator and helm her own major exhibition. She envisions a show exploring the intersection of folklore and digital media, a concept that bridges her Oregon upbringing with her tech-centric San Francisco reality. She feels the city\u2019s constant thrum of innovation and reinvention, and she is determined to add her own story to its collection."
