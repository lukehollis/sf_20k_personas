The son of a meticulous accountant, he inherited a mind for numbers but chafed at the predictability of his provincial life. He saw finance not as a tool for bookkeeping, but as a grand, competitive game.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree in economics, but it was his graduate work\u2014a Master's in Financial Engineering from UC Berkeley\u2014that served as his launchpad. He arrived in San Francisco during the late-90s dot-com boom, a young analyst hungry for action. He learned his first brutal lessons in market volatility during the subsequent bust, a trial by fire that instilled a deep-seated caution that would define his career. He survived the 2008 crisis by being one of the few who listened to his gut, shorting markets while others bled out. This cemented his reputation and fast-tracked his ascent to Senior Portfolio Manager.\n\nHis relentless ambition came at a cost. A decade-long marriage, born from optimistic college days, crumbled under the weight of 80-hour workweeks and the emotional absenteeism required to manage billions in other people\u2019s money. The key turning point was missing his daughter\u2019s 10th birthday for an emergency call with Asian markets; he and his wife separated a year later.\n\nToday, David orchestrates his portfolios from a sterile, glass-walled office in his Rincon Hill condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a prized symbol of his seniority, allowing him total control over his environment. His days are a disciplined cycle: pre-dawn global market analysis, a solitary run along the Embarcadero, and a cascade of video calls. He appreciates his neighborhood for its anonymity and sweeping views of the Bay Bridge, a landscape he observes more than he participates in. His social life consists of curated dinners with colleagues and a polite, bi-weekly video call with his daughter, now a student at UCLA.\n\nNearing 50, David finds that financial security feels hollow. His aspiration is no longer a bigger bonus, but a sense of meaning. He dreams of selling his condo, buying a small vineyard in Sonoma, and finally having the time to repair the most important portfolio of all: his relationship with his daughter."
