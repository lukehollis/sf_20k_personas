Raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, he was the son of a librarian and an accountant, a background that instilled in him a love for quiet order and historical narratives. He pursued this passion at Ohio State, earning a Bachelor's degree in American History with vague dreams of becoming a museum curator or archivist. Life, however, had a different plan. In the late 90s, he followed a college girlfriend to San Francisco, arriving just as the first dot-com bubble was inflating.\n\nThe archival jobs were scarce, but tech was booming. Needing to pay rent, David took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a burgeoning startup. His meticulous, history-major mind proved surprisingly adept at organizing chaotic engineering schedules and tracking project milestones. The temp job became permanent, and over two decades, he carved out a niche for himself. He wasn't a coder or a visionary, but a reliable Project Coordinator\u2014the essential person who translated creative chaos into manageable tasks and deadlines. His career wasn't a passion, but a practical application of his innate organizational skills.\n\nNow at 45, David\u2019s life is contained within the foggy avenues of the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his workday begins and ends in his second-bedroom office, distinguished from the rest of his life only by the glow of a second monitor. His daily routine is a predictable loop: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, hours spent on Slack and Zoom calls managing Jira tickets, and an evening stroll through Golden Gate Park. His social life is small but consistent, centered around a weekly trivia night with a few long-time friends, most of whom also fell into tech and share his quiet sense of ambivalence.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate but narrow. He loves the city\u2019s history and the quiet solitude of its western neighborhoods, but feels like an outsider to its loud, ambitious heart. His dream isn't a promotion, but a return to his original path. He daydreams of leaving tech, using his savings to research and write a book on a forgotten piece of California history. For now, he finds solace in the tangible order he creates, both in his project timelines and his quiet, well-managed life, forever wondering about the archivist he might have been."
