            "value": "David Cohen is as San Francisco as the fog that rolls through the Inner Richmond, the very neighborhood where he lives in the same house he grew up in. Born to second-generation Jewish-American parents who ran a small pharmacy on Clement Street, David\u2019s childhood was filled with the rumble of the N Judah streetcar and the aroma of his mother\u2019s brisket. He was never one for traditional academics; while his friends stressed over SAT scores, David was captivated by the nascent world of personal computers, teaching himself BASIC on a Commodore 64 his father bought him.\n\nInstead of college, David dove headfirst into the burgeoning tech scene of the early 90s. He took a job doing data entry, quickly proving his aptitude for organizing the digital chaos others created. He evolved with the industry, becoming a Data Administrator\u2014a stable, unglamorous, yet essential role. He survived the dot-com bust not by being a visionary, but by being reliable. This pragmatism defined his career and, in many ways, his life.\n\nThe major turning point came not from a career shift, but from loss. His parents passed away within a few years of each other, leaving him the family home. This inheritance was both a blessing and a burden; it anchored him to San Francisco in a way few of his generation could afford, but also encased him in memories. Around the same time, his marriage amicably dissolved, his ex-wife moving to Portland. Their daughter, now a sophomore at UC Davis, remains the bright, central focus of his life.\n\nDavid\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is to his home office, a room overlooking the familiar rooftops of his neighborhood. His days are structured by routine: a morning walk to Golden Gate Park, eight hours untangling databases for a large tech firm, and evenings spent either cooking for one or getting takeout from a favorite neighborhood spot. He is a quiet observer of the city\u2019s frantic evolution, feeling a mixture of resentment and dependence on the industry that employs him. His aspirations are modest: he hopes to see his daughter graduate, maybe restore the vintage motorcycle gathering dust in his garage, and simply hold onto his quiet corner of a city that never stops changing. He is a living archive, a keeper of data both professional and personal, a remnant of a San Francisco that exists more in memory than reality."
