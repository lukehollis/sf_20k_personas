            "value": "David Cohen is as San Francisco as the fog that rolls through the Inner Richmond, the very neighborhood where he lives in the same house he grew up in. Born to second-generation Jewish-American parents who ran a small pharmacy on Clement Street, David\u2019s childhood was filled with the rumble of the N Judah streetcar and the aroma of his mother\u2019s brisket. He was never one for traditional academics; while his friends stressed over SAT scores, David was captivated by the nascent world of personal computers, teaching himself BASIC on a Commodore 64 his father bought him.\n\nInstead of college, David dove headfirst into the burgeoning tech scene of the early 90s. He took a job doing data entry, quickly proving his aptitude for organizing the digital chaos others created. He evolved with the industry, becoming a Data Administrator\u2014a stable, unglamorous, yet essential role. He survived the dot-com bust not by being a visionary, but by being reliable. This pragmatism defined his career and, in many ways, his life.\n\nThe major turning point came not from a career shift, but from loss. His parents passed away within a few years of each other, leaving him the family home. This inheritance was both a blessing and a burden; it anchored him to San Francisco in a way few of his generation could afford, but also encased him in memories. Around the same time, his marriage amicably dissolved, his ex-wife moving to Portland. Their daughter, now a sophomore at UC Davis, remains the bright, central focus of his life.\n\nDavid\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is to his home office, a room overlooking the familiar rooftops of his neighborhood. His days are structured by routine: a morning walk to Golden Gate Park, eight hours untangling databases for a large tech firm, and evenings spent either cooking for one or getting takeout from a favorite neighborhood spot. He is a quiet observer of the city\u2019s frantic evolution, feeling a mixture of resentment and dependence on the industry that employs him. His aspirations are modest: he hopes to see his daughter graduate, maybe restore the vintage motorcycle gathering dust in his garage, and simply hold onto his quiet corner of a city that never stops changing. He is a living archive, a keeper of data both professional and personal, a remnant of a San Francisco that exists more in memory than reality."

His father, smelling of disinfectant and paper from the pharmacy, just said, \u201cI see you looking at these.\u201d That night, after plugging it in, the blinking cursor on the screen pulsed with quiet promise. It wasn't an A+ on a report card; it was a secret language he knew he could learn. In that moment, he felt seen for who he was, not who he was supposed to be. It set him on a path of quiet competency.\n\n2.\nHe can still smell the mix of old paper and his mother\u2019s perfume behind the pharmacy counter. He would watch her type prescription labels, each tap of the typewriter a precise, essential act. Mrs. Chan\u2019s blood pressure pills, Mr. Rossi\u2019s antibiotics\u2014a universe of data keeping the neighborhood well. He learned then that the most crucial work is often the quietest and most orderly, a lesson that would later define his entire career in the digital world, managing the chaos others created.\n\n3.\nA month after his mother\u2019s funeral, he walked into the house and the silence was total. For the first time, there was no brisket aroma, no MUNI rumble muffled by his parents\u2019 chatter. The house was no longer *theirs*; it was suddenly, heavily, *his*. Every scuff on the floor, every dusty photograph, was now his to preserve. In that crushing quiet, he felt the weight of becoming the family\u2019s archivist, the sole keeper of its history. It\u2019s a role he never asked for but can\u2019t abdicate.\n\n4.\nThe year after the divorce was a blur, but he remembers a specific Tuesday in Golden Gate Park. His young daughter, all scraped knees and bright laughter, was determined to catch a falling leaf before it hit the ground. For ten minutes, that was their entire world. Watching her joyous focus, he realized this was his new center of gravity. His marriage was over, his parents gone, but this small, brilliant person was his purpose. His life\u2019s data had found its primary key.\n\n5.\nLast fall, he stood in the garage, wiping dust from his father\u2019s old Honda motorcycle. He could almost feel the phantom vibration of riding it through the park as a teenager. Then, from the street, came the whisper-quiet hum of a new Rivian, followed by the loud voices of tech workers heading to a bar. The contrast hit him hard. The tangible past he could fix sat idle, while the intangible future he serviced paid his mortgage. It clarified his place: a quiet remnant powering a city he barely recognized."
