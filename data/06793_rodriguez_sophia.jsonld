Born and raised in Fresno, she was the daughter of Mexican-American parents who ran a small, beloved community grocery store. Her world was defined by the scent of fresh produce and the rumble of the delivery trucks that were its lifeblood. She saw firsthand how infrastructure\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014shaped lives, from the inefficient bus routes her grandmother relied on to the highways that sliced communities in two. This formative awareness planted the seed of her future career.\n\nHer educational journey was a deliberate move towards a larger world. After earning a bachelor's degree at UCLA, she was accepted into UC Berkeley\u2019s prestigious Master of Urban and Regional Planning program. It was during a transformative semester studying public transit in Copenhagen that her purpose solidified. She saw how thoughtfully designed systems could foster equity, sustainability, and human connection. Landing a role as a Transportation Planner for the city of San Francisco felt like the culmination of her life's trajectory.\n\nNow 29, Sophia lives in a compact, sunny apartment in the Mission District. The 0.0-mile commute listed on her file is a slight misnomer; she works a hybrid schedule, with her home office serving as her primary base. On remote days, her routine is a Mission-centric rhythm: morning coffee from a local roaster, deep-focus work analyzing traffic flow data, and an evening run through the vibrant chaos of Dolores Park. On in-office days, she finds a quiet satisfaction in her short Muni ride to Civic Center, observing the very systems she works to improve.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit circle of grad school friends and colleagues who share her passion for civic life. Weekends often involve volunteering at a community garden or exploring the Bay Area\u2019s hiking trails. Sophia feels deeply connected to the Mission, a neighborhood that echoes the Latino heritage of her childhood while pulsing with the progressive energy she thrives on.\n\nHer dream is to lead a project that fundamentally reshapes a part of the city\u2014a new protected bike lane network or a rapid bus corridor that connects an underserved neighborhood. She seeks to leave a tangible legacy of a more equitable and accessible San Francisco, ensuring that the city\u2019s arteries work for everyone, just as she once wished they did in her hometown."
