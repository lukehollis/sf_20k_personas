Growing up in the sprawling, car-dependent suburbs of Sacramento, he spent his adolescence feeling landlocked, entirely reliant on his parents for access to friends, jobs, and culture. He watched buses pass by his subdivision only a few times a day, their inefficient routes a symbol of isolation. This frustration fueled his decision to study Urban Planning at UC Davis, where he saw the potential of well-designed systems to foster community and equity.\n\nUpon graduating, Caleb began his career in Oakland\u2019s planning department, learning the political and practical realities of implementing transit solutions. After seven years, he landed his dream job as a planner for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The move to San Francisco was a professional and personal triumph. He chose his Hayes Valley apartment specifically for its walkability and direct MUNI access, a living testament to his core beliefs.\n\nHis daily 2.5-mile commute on the 21-Hayes is both a routine and a field study. He observes passenger flow, notes delays, and silently critiques stop placements. His work involves long hours of data analysis, community meetings, and navigating the bureaucratic maze to push for projects like dedicated bus lanes and signal priority. A key turning point was a long-term relationship that ended two years ago over the classic SF dilemma: his partner yearned for a home with a yard in the East Bay, while Caleb couldn\u2019t imagine leaving the city he was actively trying to improve.\n\nNow 42, Caleb\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with his profession. His social circle consists mainly of fellow civic-minded professionals and neighbors he meets at local cafes and the Patricia's Green farmers' market. His hopes are not for wealth, but for legacy. He dreams of seeing the Central Subway operate seamlessly and of spearheading a new bus rapid transit line that connects underserved neighborhoods. For Caleb, a better San Francisco is one where a child feels the freedom he never did\u2014connected, mobile, and part of a vibrant urban fabric."

He remembers the sinking feeling as the bus, the last one until morning, sailed past the entrance to his subdivision without stopping. It wasn't just disappointment; it was a profound sense of powerlessness, of being trapped by asphalt and poor planning. That evening, sitting on the curb under a lonely streetlight, his frustration crystallized into a lifelong mission. He swore he would build systems where no other kid felt so utterly stuck, so completely forgotten by the world beyond their street.\n\n2.\nHis first day at SFMTA. He remembers stepping onto the 21-Hayes, his new employee Clipper card feeling heavy in his wallet. The familiar squeal of the brakes, the chime of the stop request\u2014it all sounded different. It was no longer just his ride; it was his responsibility. Every lurch, every delay, every crowded aisle was suddenly a data point in his own life's work. A profound sense of ownership settled over him. He wasn't just living in the city anymore; he was one of its caretakers.\n\n3.\nIt was the quiet after the argument, two years ago. She stood by the door, keys in hand, while he just stared out his window at the MUNI bus gliding down Hayes Street. \"A yard, Caleb,\" she'd said. He looked at the bus, full of people heading home, and knew he couldn't leave. He was part of this intricate machine, a gear trying to make it turn better. The heartbreak was immense, but in that moment of loss, he felt a painful, clarifying loyalty. He was married not to a person, but to a city.\n\n4.\nHe recalls standing on a windswept corner in the Bayview during a community meeting five years ago. An elderly woman, leaning on her walker, told him how the unreliable bus service made her feel like a prisoner in her own home, often forcing her to miss doctor's appointments. Her words, laced with exhaustion and dignity, cut through all the data and schematics. That moment solidified his purpose beyond theory; it gave his work a face, a voice, and an undeniable urgency that he carries into every planning session.\n\n5.\nLast year, he rode the Central Subway on a Saturday, just for fun. He didn't bring a notepad or time the headways. He just watched a family point out landmarks to their grandchild as the train slipped quietly beneath the city. He saw a group of friends, unburdened by traffic, heading for a day in Chinatown. It was seamless. It was working. A quiet, fierce pride swelled in his chest. This was the point of it all\u2014not the plans or the meetings, but that child's easy, boundless access to their city."
