Raised in a placid suburb of Columbus, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, David\u2019s world was one of practicality and predictable comfort. Numbers, unlike the ambiguities of history, always made sense. He excelled in math and followed a logical path to a Bachelor's in Finance from Ohio State University. Lured by a compelling job offer and the mystique of the West Coast, he moved to San Francisco at 24, trading predictable seasons for the perpetual cool of the Bay.\n\nHis career developed as planned. He started as a junior analyst, diligently working his way up the corporate ladder. For nearly fifteen years, his life was a spreadsheet of calculated moves: promotions, a mortgage on a condo with his then-wife, Sarah, and annual contributions to his 401(k). The key turning point came not in his career, but in his personal life. His divorce at 38 was an unexpected, destabilizing event that forced him to re-evaluate the predictable path he had so carefully constructed. The life he thought he was building had been foreclosed on.\n\nNow, at 45, David\u2019s life has found a new equilibrium. He lives alone in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its quiet streets and the omnipresent fog that rolls in from the Pacific. His 6.8-mile commute on the Muni 38-Geary bus is a cherished ritual, a buffer of time where he listens to economic podcasts or simply watches the city slide by. Socially, he maintains a small circle of close friends, preferring a well-crafted beer at a local pub to the loud, trendy bars downtown.\n\nHe\u2019s a senior analyst, respected and secure, but the burning ambition of his youth has softened into a desire for balance. His hopes are no longer about climbing higher, but about deepening his experiences. He dreams of taking a sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain and of finding a new partnership\u2014one built on shared quiet moments rather than shared ambitions. David Price is a man who has learned that true wealth isn\u2019t just on a balance sheet; it\u2019s found in the steady rhythm of a life lived deliberately, even after its foundations have been shaken."

The Pacific wasn't the welcoming blue he'd imagined, but a vast, churning grey that roared with indifference. It made his meticulous five-year plan feel laughably small. For the first time, he felt a variable he couldn't quantify, a raw power that had no place on a spreadsheet. This terrifying, untamable beauty was the real reason he\u2019d moved; a quiet promise of a life bigger than the one he'd planned.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the day he and Sarah, then 32, got the keys to their Noe Valley condo. They celebrated with champagne on the empty floor, mapping out a future that felt as solid and secure as the deed in his hand. They weren't just building a home; they were executing a long-term strategy of shared success. Looking back, he realizes they were celebrating the achievement more than each other. That memory now feels like a prospectus for a company that was destined for a painful bankruptcy.\n\n3.\nAt 38, his first night in the Inner Richmond apartment was the quietest of his life. After the movers left, he sat on a single cardboard box, the silence amplified by the distant moan of a foghorn. There was no spreadsheet for this suffocating emptiness. His meticulously constructed life wasn't just fractured; it was liquidated. In that hollowed-out moment, he felt the terrifying freedom of having absolutely nothing left to lose. It was the absolute bottom of his life\u2019s chart, the point from which a new trend had to begin.\n\n4.\nOne Tuesday morning, maybe three years after the divorce, his podcast died mid-commute. Annoyed, he looked up from his phone. The 38-Geary was crawling through the fog, which softened the edges of the city into a watercolor painting. He watched a woman carefully select oranges from a corner grocer, a tiny, perfect ritual he\u2019d never noticed. The commute was no longer a buffer, but a destination in itself. He felt a profound, unexpected peace. He was simply a man on a bus, and for the first time, that was enough.\n\n5.\nHe was 44, sharing a pint with his friend Mark, who was complaining about a corporate reorganization. David found himself describing the Camino de Santiago\u2014the simple rhythm of just walking. \u201cThat actually sounds like you now,\u201d Mark said, taking a sip of his beer. In that moment, the vague fantasy solidified into a tangible goal. It wasn't about running away from his old life, but walking deliberately toward his new one. He realized his true north was no longer a promotion, but simply a direction."
