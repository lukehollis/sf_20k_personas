The son of Mei-ling Liu, a pragmatic and disciplined immigrant from Guangzhou, and David Miller, an idealistic literature professor from Ohio, Ethan grew up in Berkeley caught between two worlds. His mother saw the world as a series of problems to be solved with logic and hard work; his father saw it as a tapestry of stories and ideas. Ethan, with a natural talent for math and a quiet love for his father\u2019s books, chose the path of structure.\n\nHe pursued a Master's in Structural Engineering from Stanford, driven by a desire to build things that were tangible and permanent. His early career was a success, working for a major firm on the skeletons of gleaming downtown San Francisco high-rises. He was good at it, but the corporate scale felt impersonal, the projects disconnected from the people who would inhabit them. The turning point came during the pandemic. Faced with burnout and the sudden shift to remote work, he reassessed his path. He quit the firm and established his own small consultancy from his Hayes Valley apartment.\n\nNow, at 35, his commute is the few steps from his bedroom to his desk, where drafting software and complex calculations fill his screens. His work has become intimate and personal. He specializes in seismic retrofitting for historic Victorian homes and collaborates with artists on the engineering of ambitious public installations. He finds more satisfaction ensuring a family\u2019s Mission District home can withstand the next quake than he ever did designing a corporate skyscraper.\n\nHis daily routine is a microcosm of his blended heritage: disciplined work sessions broken up by long walks, where he observes the city's architectural grammar with a trained eye. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, a mix from college and his old firm, but is most comfortable in the quiet of his own space. Ethan\u2019s dream is no longer to build the tallest structure, but the most thoughtful one. He aspires to design a small community library or a beautifully engineered pedestrian bridge\u2014something that strengthens the city\u2019s fabric, seamlessly blending the art of living with the science of safety, finally creating a perfect balance of his parents\u2019 worlds."

His father spoke of its impossible beauty, calling it a \"harp strung for the wind.\" His mother, unimpressed, pointed out the precise engineering, the sheer tonnage of steel and concrete holding back the immense forces of nature. Ethan felt a strange pull from both, a nascent understanding that the bridge\u2019s poetry was only possible because of its math. It was the first time he saw that art needed a strong, logical skeleton to truly soar.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-eight, he stood on the bare concrete of the 40th floor of a new downtown skyscraper. He had calculated its every joint and beam. Below, San Francisco was a silent map, a grid of anonymous lives. The immense achievement felt hollow, a monument to a company he didn't know, for people he would never meet. The pride he expected was replaced by a profound sense of disconnection, a feeling of having built a beautiful, empty shell. That loneliness cemented a deep crack in his ambition.\n\n3.\nThe moment of clarity came during a lockdown Zoom call. As a senior partner droned on about maximizing leasable square footage, Ethan watched his Hayes Valley neighbors through the window. He saw the faint, spidery cracks in the facade of their Victorian home and felt a jolt of visceral concern. The abstract numbers on his screen suddenly felt meaningless compared to the tangible vulnerability of that family\u2019s home. In that instant, his career path felt not just unfulfilling, but wrong. He drafted his resignation letter that night.\n\n4.\nHis first solo project was a seismic retrofit for a family in the Mission. After the final inspection, the mother grabbed his arm, her eyes filled with a relief so potent it stunned him. \"Thank you,\" she said, \"We can finally sleep through the night without worrying.\" Inside, he saw children\u2019s drawings taped to a wall he had helped make safe. The feeling wasn\u2019t the distant pride of a skyscraper; it was a warm, heavy sense of purpose settling directly in his chest. He had fortified a home, not just a building.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a walk through Golden Gate Park, he paused before a twisting steel sculpture he helped an artist bring to life. He watched a child trace its curves with a small finger. No one could see his calculations, the precise work that kept the massive form balanced and safe. They only saw its beauty. He felt both his parents inside him then\u2014his mother\u2019s pragmatism in the hidden bolts, his father\u2019s idealism in the public joy. He was finally building things that held both stories and strength."
