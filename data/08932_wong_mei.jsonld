Her parents, immigrants from Guangdong, China, ran a small but bustling laundromat, instilling in Mei a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for community. Her childhood was filled with the rhythm of her neighborhood \u2013 the aroma of her mother's cooking, the lively chatter of customers at the laundromat, and summers spent exploring Golden Gate Park.\n\nMei excelled in academics, a path encouraged by her parents who saw education as the key to a better life. She pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, initially considering pre-med, but a volunteer experience at a free clinic ignited her passion for preventative care and community health. This led her to pursue a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health, focusing on health disparities in urban populations.\n\nAfter graduation, Mei landed a position as a Community Health Educator for a nonprofit providing health resources in underserved areas of San Francisco. This role solidified her commitment to equitable healthcare, allowing her to directly impact the lives of those facing systemic barriers. A particularly impactful moment came during a workshop she led on diabetes prevention, where an elderly participant shared how the information had motivated her to make significant lifestyle changes. This experience reinforced Mei\u2019s belief in the power of education and community support.\n\nMei remains close to her family, often sharing weekend meals at her parents' home. She has a small but supportive circle of friends, many of whom she met during her MPH program, who share her passion for social justice. She enjoys exploring the city\u2019s diverse culinary scene with them and participating in local neighborhood events.\n\nCurrently, Mei's days are a blend of leading health workshops, developing educational materials, and conducting outreach in various San Francisco neighborhoods. Her commute is a daily opportunity to observe the city's vibrancy and diverse communities. Her income, while comfortable, reflects her dedication to mission-driven work over financial gain.\n\nMei\u2019s hopes for the future revolve around expanding access to culturally competent healthcare and reducing health inequities in San Francisco. She dreams of developing innovative programs that address the unique health challenges faced by different communities. Her connection to San Francisco is deep-rooted; it's the city where she was born, where her family built their life, and where she is dedicated to making a tangible difference, one community group at a time."
