Her parents, practical immigrants who worked relentlessly, envisioned a different life for her\u2014one with a degree, a stable office job, and freedom from the grueling heat of a commercial kitchen. Following their wishes, Mei-Ling studied Art History at San Francisco State University, her passion for aesthetics a quiet rebellion against her pragmatic upbringing.\n\nAfter graduating, she took a corporate job in arts administration, but felt stifled by the bureaucracy. The turning point came in her late twenties when her father\u2019s health declined. Mei-Ling left her job to help run the family restaurant, expecting it to be a temporary duty. Instead, she rediscovered her calling. In the familiar chaos of the kitchen, she realized that food was her true medium. It was here she could blend the discipline of her heritage with the artistic principles she\u2019d studied.\n\nAfter her father passed, she didn't just take over; she transformed. Selling the family establishment, she partnered with her old college friend, a sculptor named Anya, to create something new. They purchased a narrow, two-story building in Hayes Valley, converting the ground floor into \"Cerise,\" a restaurant-gallery hybrid. Mei-Ling became the Executive Chef and Anya the curator.\n\nToday, Mei-Ling lives in the apartment directly above Cerise, her commute a simple walk downstairs. Her days begin with early morning visits to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, sourcing ingredients that inspire her seasonal, Asian-fusion tasting menus, each dish a carefully composed work of art. She is married to her craft, her social life woven into the fabric of the restaurant, which hosts artists, writers, and loyal patrons.\n\nAt 53, Mei-Ling feels a deep sense of fulfillment. Her hope is to mentor a new generation of female chefs, encouraging them to find their own voice. She dreams of one day writing a cookbook that is part memoir and part culinary philosophy, a testament to her journey from a daughter of the Sunset to a celebrated artist of the San Francisco food scene."
