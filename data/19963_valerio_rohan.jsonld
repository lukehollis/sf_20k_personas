The son of a pragmatic Filipino-American Merchant Marine and an intellectually curious immigrant librarian from Mumbai, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a blend of cultures and perspectives. He inherited his father\u2019s appreciation for the complex dance of global trade and his mother\u2019s love for systems and order. While other kids were idolizing athletes, Rohan was fascinated by the container ships gliding under the Golden Gate Bridge, marveling at the sheer logistical scale.\n\nHe pursued a practical education at San Francisco State University, earning a degree in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. His career began not in a gleaming tech campus, but on the gritty, windswept docks of Oakland in the late 1990s. There, managing warehouse inventories and trucking schedules, he saw firsthand the inefficiencies and human errors that choked the arteries of commerce. The first dot-com boom was a turning point; while others chased web-based fortunes, Rohan saw the potential of software to revolutionize the physical world. He became an early adopter of optimization software, earning a reputation as an innovator within a traditional industry.\n\nHis personal life saw both fulfillment and fracture. A marriage in his late twenties gave him his beloved daughter, Sofia, but ended in an amicable divorce a decade later, largely due to the intense focus his career demanded. As technology evolved, so did Rohan. He transitioned from optimizing routes for human drivers to designing the very systems that would replace them. Today, as Director of Autonomous Fleet Operations, he orchestrates a symphony of algorithms and sensors from his Mission Bay office, managing a fleet of self-driving trucks that crisscross the state.\n\nRohan now lives in a modest, renovated home in the Outer Richmond, where his 8.5-mile commute feels like a world away from the tech hub. His evenings are for long walks along Ocean Beach, the cool salt air a welcome antidote to a day spent staring at data streams. At 53, his ambition has shifted from financial security to legacy. He dreams of perfecting a fully autonomous supply chain, making transportation safer and more efficient for everyone. His greatest hope, however, is simpler: to build a stronger relationship with Sofia, now a university student, and to prove that a life dedicated to logic and systems can still have a deeply human purpose."

His father explained the currents, the cargo, the long journey from Mumbai or Manila. For Rohan, it wasn\u2019t just a ship; it was a moving piece in a global puzzle. In that moment of quiet awe, he didn't see a boat; he saw order and purpose on a massive scale. It was the first time logic felt like magic, setting the course for his life.\n\n2.\nOakland docks, 2 AM, 1998. Rain slicked the asphalt. A misplaced shipping container caused a three-hour backlog, the chaos radiating outwards. Rohan saw the exhaustion etched on a trucker\u2019s face, a man who just wanted to get home. The anger he felt wasn\u2019t at the man, but at the flawed, fragile system that relied on tired people and paper manifests. That night, his abstract desire for efficiency became a deeply personal mission to eliminate the friction that wore people down.\n\n3.\nSofia was seven, a monarch butterfly in her school play. Rohan watched it on a grainy video his wife sent him, sitting in a sterile airport lounge while closing a logistics deal. He\u2019d celebrated the professional win, but the sight of his daughter\u2019s tiny, painted wings made his achievement feel hollow. It was the sharpest pang of a fracture he only later understood; he was building a perfect system for the world while the small, essential system of his own family was failing.\n\n4.\n2001. Everyone was obsessed with digital storefronts. Rohan was in a stuffy conference room, watching a demo for clumsy inventory software. While others saw a clunky interface, Rohan saw the future. He mentally superimposed the code over a map of the Port of Oakland. He didn't see pixels; he saw digital commands moving real-world containers and trucks. It was his epiphany: the true power of this new language wasn't to replace stores, but to perfect the physical arteries that supplied them.\n\n5.\nLast year, walking along Ocean Beach as the sun bled into the Pacific. An alert buzzed on his phone: Truck 718 had performed an autonomous emergency brake, avoiding a collision on I-5. A life potentially saved by his code. Minutes later, a text from Sofia at UCLA: \u201cThinking of you, Dad.\u201d Staring at the waves, the two messages merged into one. This was his legacy\u2014a safer world, and the love of the daughter who made it all meaningful."
