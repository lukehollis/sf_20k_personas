The only daughter of Punjabi immigrants, she was raised in a home filled with the scent of spices and the weight of expectation. Her parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned her as a doctor or an engineer. But Manpreet was a quiet observer, more attuned to the unspoken anxieties of her community\u2014the elders struggling to navigate healthcare paperwork in English, the generational divides, the silent burdens carried by her neighbors. This was the world that truly called to her.\n\nDefying gentle but persistent family pressure, she pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The move to the Bay Area was a revelation, exposing her to a diversity of thought and identity that both challenged and liberated her. It was there she honed her innate empathy into a professional skill set. Her first job post-graduation was a baptism by fire: a case manager at a community clinic in the Tenderloin. The burnout was immense, but a key turning point came when she successfully advocated for a non-English-speaking family to receive critical, life-saving care, navigating a labyrinth of bureaucracy that had nearly defeated them. In that moment, she understood her work wasn't just a job; it was a form of justice.\n\nNow 40, Manpreet is a Clinical Social Worker at a major hospital on Parnassus Avenue. Her life is deeply integrated with her work, evidenced by her 0.0-mile commute. She lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, a few blocks from the hospital entrance. Her days are emotionally demanding, spent counseling patients and families through devastating diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. To decompress, she has a sacred routine: long, quiet walks through the Strybing Arboretum in Golden Gate Park, losing herself in the cool, green quiet. Her social life is small but deep, centered around a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nManpreet\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic landmarks and more about its quiet corners. It's the morning fog blanketing her street, the familiar warmth of Arizmendi Bakery, and the anonymous solidarity of the N-Judah streetcar. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s an extension of her life\u2019s work. She aspires to develop and lead a specialized palliative care support program for immigrant families, creating the very resource she wishes her own grandmother had all those years ago."
