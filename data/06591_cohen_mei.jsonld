The only child of a Jewish-American history professor from Berkeley and a first-generation immigrant mother from Guangzhou, Mei grew up in a home where Passover seders were followed by Lunar New Year celebrations. Raised in Oakland\u2019s Dimond District, she navigated a world of dual identities, feeling the weight and wonder of both. This heritage fostered in her a profound sensitivity to the concepts of community, displacement, and belonging, shaping the path she would choose.\n\nHer educational journey was a direct line from her upbringing. After completing her undergraduate degree in sociology at UC Santa Cruz, she felt an pull to turn theory into action. She enrolled in San Francisco State University\u2019s Master of Social Work (MSW) program. A grueling internship with a family services non-profit was her turning point. Witnessing a family lose their housing due to a bureaucratic oversight solidified her resolve; she would work within the system to fight for those it too often failed.\n\nNow 28, Mei lives and works in the same square mile. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her small studio apartment on the edge of the Tenderloin to the community non-profit where she manages cases for housing-insecure families and at-risk youth. Her days are a triage of crises: filling out aid applications, connecting clients with mental health resources, and advocating fiercely in situations that feel impossibly stacked against them. The work is emotionally taxing, and she guards her energy closely. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends who understand the pressures of her field. They trade nights out for potlucks and hikes in the Presidio.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of tech glamour or postcard views, but of sidewalk grit and human resilience. She knows the neighborhood not by its restaurants, but by its shelters and resource centers. Her dream is not a promotion, but to one day launch a mentorship program connecting elders with immigrant youth, a project that would honor both sides of her own story. She fights off burnout by finding small pockets of peace\u2014a quiet corner in the SF Public Library or the fog rolling over Bernal Hill\u2014reminders of the beauty that exists alongside the struggle she confronts every day."
