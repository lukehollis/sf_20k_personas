Born in Fremont to an Indian-American father who was an engineer in the burgeoning Silicon Valley and a Filipino-American mother who was a nurse, Priya grew up in a home that blended cultures and valued pragmatic solutions. From her childhood window, she watched the Bay Area's landscape transform, fascinated by the networks of freeways and the expanding BART lines that stitched disparate communities together. This early fascination with how people move set her on a direct path toward a career in public service.\n\nHer educational journey was a deliberate one, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from UC Berkeley before pursuing her Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA. Armed with her degree, she was drawn to San Francisco, the city she saw as the ultimate urban puzzle. She joined the city\u2019s transportation agency as a junior planner, meticulously analyzing bus routes and pedestrian flow. A key turning point was her leadership on a controversial project to implement dedicated bus lanes on a major corridor. Facing down fierce public opposition, she used data and community outreach to demonstrate the project's benefits, solidifying her reputation as a capable and resilient leader. This success propelled her through the ranks to her current role as Director.\n\nNow, at 49, Priya\u2019s life is deeply intertwined with the city she serves. She lives in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood chosen for its central location and vibrant street life. Her daily commute on the Muni is not a chore but a living laboratory for her work; she observes rider patterns and wait times with a critical eye. Amicably divorced for a decade, her most significant relationship is with her son, now a university student in Oregon. Their weekly video calls are a cherished ritual.\n\nPriya\u2019s aspirations are extensions of her career. She dreams of a San Francisco with a world-class, equitable transit system that reduces the city\u2019s reliance on cars. Her ultimate goal is to leave behind a legacy of connectivity, ensuring that a person\u2019s zip code doesn't determine their access to opportunity. She imagines a future where her son might return to a city that is more efficient, sustainable, and accessible because of the work she does today."

Her father would explain it like a circuit board, her mother like the veins connecting the city\u2019s heart to its limbs. For Priya, it wasn't just traffic; it was a living schematic. Tracing the red taillights with her finger, she felt the first spark of her life's obsession: understanding how every single light was connected to a destination, a home, a person. This was when the puzzle first took shape.\n\n2.\nIt was a shouted comment from the back of the stuffy Richmond district library: \"You don't live here! You're ruining our lives!\" The hostility during the bus lane project felt like a physical force. For a searing moment, alone under the fluorescent lights, she almost believed him. But then, looking at the tired faces in the crowd, her fear hardened into resolve. This wasn't about winning an argument; it was about connecting their daily struggle to the solution she knew would work. That night, in her early thirties, cemented her grit.\n\n3.\nShe can still feel the weight of the Clipper card she placed in her son\u2019s ten-year-old hand for his first solo trip on the N-Judah. As the doors hissed shut, leaving him looking small and brave inside, a wave of parental panic washed over her. It was followed by a profound sense of purpose. The network she planned on paper was no longer an abstraction; it was the system she was entrusting with her entire world. The abstract goal of efficiency became a deeply personal need for safety and reliability.\n\n4.\nHer ex-husband handed her the keys to the empty Hayes Valley apartment a decade ago. The echo of their footsteps felt lonelier than she\u2019d expected. \"You're right in the center of everything now,\" he'd said, a kind of peace offering. As he left, she looked out the window not at a yard, but at the city's pulsing arteries. It wasn\u2019t an ending. It was a recalibration, a deliberate choice to place herself at the very heart of the puzzle she had sworn to solve. That day, the city truly became her home.\n\n5.\nLast week, on the 21-Hayes bus home, she watched a nurse in scrubs nod off, her head resting against the vibrating window. Across from her, a line cook scrolled through his phone, his backpack smelling faintly of garlic. Priya felt a familiar, fierce ache of responsibility. These weren't data points on a ridership chart; they were the city's lifeblood. Her job wasn't just shaving minutes off a commute, but gifting this exhausted nurse, this tired cook, a few more precious moments of their own."
