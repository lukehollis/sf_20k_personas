Born and raised in Oakland in a family deeply involved in the Civil Rights movement, she witnessed firsthand the power of collective action and the persistent struggles faced by marginalized communities. Her mother, a schoolteacher, and her father, a union organizer, instilled in her a fierce sense of justice and a belief in the transformative power of education and community engagement.\n\nExcelling academically, Priya pursued her passion for health equity, earning a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from UC Berkeley before obtaining a Master's in Public Health from UCLA. Her early career took her to non-profits focusing on health disparities in Southern California, where she refined her skills in program design and grant writing. A desire to be nearer her aging parents and to tackle the unique challenges of the Bay Area brought her back to the region in her late 30s.\n\nReturning to the Bay Area was a significant turning point. The escalating housing crisis and widening wealth gap in San Francisco fueled her determination to make an impact. She landed a role at a prominent foundation, eventually rising to Director of Community Health Initiatives. Her work involves bridging the gap between healthcare providers and underserved populations, focusing on preventative care, mental health access, and health education within the education system. A defining moment came when she successfully advocated for funding to launch a mobile health clinic serving the OMI (Oceanview-Merced Heights-Ingleside) neighborhoods, a project she remains deeply proud of.\n\nPriya is a woman of quiet strength and deep connections. She is a devoted aunt to her sister's two children and maintains close ties with a core group of college friends who still reside in the Bay Area. Though she's previously navigated meaningful relationships, she is currently single, finding fulfillment in her work and her community involvement. Weekends often involve exploring San Francisco's parks via Muni \u2013 her preferred method of navigating the city, allowing her to observe the vibrant tapestry of her adopted home. She is an active member of her San Francisco neighborhood association, advocating for pedestrian safety and green spaces.\n\nHer current lifestyle is centered around her work and community. Mornings begin with a quiet cup of tea before hopping on the Muni for her commute, using the time to catch up on news or mentally prepare for her demanding day. Evenings often involve community meetings or time spent reading.\n\nLooking ahead, Priya dreams of establishing a permanent community health center spearheaded by local residents. She envisions a future where access to quality healthcare and education is not a privilege but a right for all San Franciscans. Her hope is to leave a lasting legacy of health equity and community empowerment in the city she now calls home."

Seeing residents line up, knowing she helped make this vital service a reality, solidified her purpose and dedication to practical, tangible change. It was a culmination of years of work.\n\n2.  Sitting on the steps of Wheeler Hall at Berkeley, arguing passionately about social justice with friends, she felt the intoxicating power of shared conviction. These were the bonds that would ground her, the intellectual crucible that forged her commitment to health equity. Early adulthood memories, shaping her trajectory.\n\n3.  Walking through Golden Gate Park, the fog rolling in, she felt a profound sense of belonging returning home. The familiar scent of eucalyptus and the rhythmic clang of a Muni bell were a comforting embrace, reaffirming her decision to return to the Bay Area for her parents and her calling. Mid-life return.\n\n4.  Witnessing her mother tirelessly explain the school board's budget cuts at a packed community meeting in Oakland as a child imprinted on Priya the tireless effort needed for advocacy. It was a silent lesson in resilient activism, a memory that fuels her own current neighborhood efforts. Childhood influence.\n\n5.  During a quiet moment, sharing tea with her aging father, feeling the weight of their hands clasped, she understood deeply the fragility of health and the importance of family. This tenderness underscored her drive to ensure others had access to the care her parents deserved. Recent, powerful moment."
