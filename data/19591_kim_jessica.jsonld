Born Jessica Albright, her upbringing was solidly middle-class and conventionally Midwestern. While her parents were loving, their world was small, and Jessica felt an early, unspoken disconnect. She found solace not in team sports or church groups, but in the local art house theater and the vibrant chaos of her high school's drama department. It was a world of color and expression that stood in stark contrast to the muted tones of her suburban life.\n\nHer escape was Ohio State, where she majored in Art History and, more importantly, found the language for her own identity. Coming out as queer in college was both a liberation and a final, definitive break from the life she was expected to lead. It was also where she met David Kim, a charismatic MFA student in photography. They fell in love, and his world of art, activism, and Korean-American culture felt like the home she\u2019d always craved. They married, and she enthusiastically took his name. The marriage ended amicably five years later when their paths diverged\u2014he sought a quieter, academic life, while Jessica was drawn to the front lines of community arts. She kept the name; it felt like a part of her own hard-won identity.\n\nArmed with a graduate degree in Arts Administration from a Boston university, Jessica was hired for an entry-level position at an arts nonprofit in San Francisco, a city she\u2019d long idealized. She arrived with two suitcases and a fierce determination to build a life on her own terms. For years, she worked tirelessly, learning the intricate dance of fundraising, curation, and community outreach. Her turning point came when she was appointed Director of Programming for the city\u2019s preeminent LGBTQ+ Arts Festival.\n\nToday, Jessica thrives. She lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Castro, her 2.5-mile commute on the K-Line Muni a daily ritual of reading grant proposals and people-watching. Her life is a blur of board meetings, artist negotiations, gallery openings, and late-night coffees with her tight-knit \u201cfound family\u201d of fellow artists and activists. Her aspiration is to expand the festival, ensuring it elevates the most marginalized voices within the community\u2014especially trans and QTPOC creators. San Francisco is no longer an ideal; it is her home, the city that finally gave her a stage to direct not just a festival, but her own authentic life."

The fog was rolling in, but the neon sign of the Castro Theatre cut through the grey, a vibrant beacon. It felt less like a movie palace and more like a cathedral. This wasn't the muted world of Ohio; this was a promise of color, of acceptance. That image burned into her mind, cementing the feeling not that she was running from something, but that she had finally run *to* somewhere.\n\n2.\nJessica recalls signing the final divorce papers. There was a simple box to check: \u201cRestore former name.\u201d Staring at it, she realized \"Albright\" felt like a costume she\u2019d shed years ago. \"Kim\" was the name she wore when she fell in love with art, community, and a bigger world. Leaving the box unchecked wasn\u2019t about holding onto her ex-husband; it was about refusing to give up a piece of her own hard-won identity. It was an act of claiming, not losing.\n\n3.\nHer first night as Director, the festival office was silent. Staring out the window at the city lights, the immense weight and privilege of her new role settled in. It wasn\u2019t just a promotion; it was a mantle of responsibility. She remembers whispering to the empty room, \u201cOkay, now we get to work.\u201d That quiet moment wasn\u2019t about ego; it was the crystallization of her life's ambition into a tangible purpose: to build a bigger stage for others.\n\n4.\nAfter a frantic but successful opening night, she found herself crammed into a booth at a 24-hour diner with a drag queen, a filmmaker, and two volunteers. It was 3 a.m., and they were all exhausted, giddy, and sharing a plate of fries. In the midst of the joyful chaos, she felt a profound sense of peace. This, she realized, was the \u201cfound family\u201d she\u2019d always read about. This effortless, supportive warmth was the real reward for all the grant-writing and stress.\n\n5.\nRiding the K-Line home one evening, she looked up from her paperwork as the train emerged at Castro Station. She saw a young person on the platform, eyes wide with a mix of fear and excitement that was achingly familiar. For a fleeting second, she saw her younger self. A wave of quiet gratitude washed over her. She wasn't the newcomer anymore; she was part of the city's living fabric, a fixture in the very scene that once saved her."
