Adopted as an infant from South Korea by Declan and Siobhan O\u2019Connell, he was raised in Daly City, a world of Irish pride, Sunday mass, and boisterous family gatherings. He was an O\u2019Connell through and through, yet every glance in the mirror was a quiet reminder of a separate, unknown history. His childhood was happy but marked by a subtle cultural dissonance; he was the only Asian face in a sea of shamrocks on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, a disconnect he couldn't articulate until his late teens.\n\nChoosing a practical path his parents would approve of, Liam earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College of San Francisco. He wasn't passionate about academia, finding more comfort in clear, sequential tasks. This led him to a stable, if unexciting, job as a Logistics Coordinator Assistant. The position became fully remote during the pandemic, a change Liam embraced.\n\nThe true turning point in his life came at 23, when he used his savings to move out of his family home and into a small studio apartment in the Inner Richmond. The move was less than ten miles geographically, but a world away culturally. Suddenly, he was surrounded by the sights, sounds, and smells of Asian cultures he\u2019d only observed from a distance. His 0.0-mile commute meant his world was his apartment and his neighborhood. His daily routine became a quiet pilgrimage: work from his small desk facing the foggy street, then a lunchtime walk through Golden Gate Park or an errand run to the bustling markets on Clement Street, where he\u2019d shyly buy ingredients for Korean recipes he found online.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few CCSF friends and a tight-knit online gaming guild. He finds it easier to connect from behind a screen, where his name and his face don't immediately spark questions. Liam\u2019s deepest aspiration has nothing to do with climbing the corporate ladder. He dreams of saving enough money to visit Seoul. It\u2019s a terrifying and exhilarating goal\u2014not to find his birth parents, but to simply walk the streets, breathe the air, and finally connect the man named Liam O\u2019Connell with the Korean heritage he is slowly, tentatively, beginning to call his own."

But as the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade passed, a blur of pipes and green, he caught his reflection in a storefront window. A small Korean boy with a Gaelic symbol on his face. He felt a confusing twinge, a love for his family tangled with the undeniable fact that he looked nothing like them. It was the first time he felt like a loving, misplaced puzzle piece.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, after a boisterous Christmas dinner, he stood alone in the hallway bathroom. The sound of his family\u2019s laughter echoed from the living room. He stared at his reflection, really *stared*, and the name 'Liam O'Connell' felt both perfectly right and utterly foreign. In that moment, the vague unease of his childhood coalesced into a single, sharp thought: *I have two stories, and I only know one.* It wasn't sadness, but a profound, quiet awakening that would define his coming years.\n\n3.\nThe first night in his Inner Richmond studio was the quietest of his life. At 23, surrounded by unpacked boxes, the silence was deafening without his family's constant hum. He sat on the floor, eating takeout from a Clement Street restaurant, the scent of garlic and sesame new and exciting. A wave of loneliness washed over him, immediately followed by a thrilling jolt of absolute freedom. For the first time, his space, his choices, and his future were entirely his own.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the steam rising from the pot, smelling exactly like the YouTube video promised. Following the recipe felt like a sequential task, a system he could understand. He brought the first spoonful of his homemade kimchi jjigae to his lips. It was a searing, spicy, profound taste of a world he\u2019d never known. At his small desk, staring out at the foggy street, he felt nourished in a way that had nothing to do with hunger. He was tending to a part of himself.\n\n5.\nDuring a late-night gaming session, a guildmate shared a link: a walking tour of Seoul's Hongdae district. Liam watched, mesmerized. The neon signs, the street food stalls, the cadence of the language\u2014it all felt strangely familiar. He saw faces that looked like his everywhere. A deep, aching longing hit him, so powerful it took his breath away. The vague wish to visit Korea solidified into a non-negotiable mission. That screen wasn't a window; it was a promise to himself."
