The middle child of third-generation Japanese-American parents who ran a small, beloved plant nursery, Maya grew up surrounded by patient growth. However, her home life was shadowed by her older brother\u2019s struggles with severe depression and substance abuse. She witnessed firsthand the cyclical failures of a healthcare system that felt impersonal and culturally blind, a pain that planted a seed of purpose within her.\n\nWhile her parents hoped she would pursue a more stable, lucrative career, Maya\u2019s path was set during a harrowing family crisis when a hospital social worker became the only person to offer clarity and humane guidance. This encounter was a turning point. Maya pursued a bachelor's in Psychology at UC Davis, followed by a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, determined to become the advocate her family had so desperately needed.\n\nUpon graduating, she accepted a position as a Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital. The pandemic normalized telehealth, and Maya\u2019s role became fully remote, reducing her commute to the few steps from her bed to her desk. She now lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood chosen for its proximity to Golden Gate Park. Her days are a structured rhythm of intense, back-to-back virtual sessions with patients grappling with everything from chronic illness diagnoses to end-of-life planning.\n\nHer daily routine is a necessary ritual of decompression. She starts each morning with a foggy walk among the eucalyptus trees in the park, a silent meditation before immersing herself in the emotional turmoil of others. After work, she often unwinds by exploring the neighborhood\u2019s dim sum spots or losing herself in the aisles of Green Apple Books. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly fellow social workers who understand the unique weight of their profession. Her relationship with her brother is now one of loving, carefully maintained boundaries.\n\nMaya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status, but of sustainability. She hopes to avoid the burnout that claims so many of her peers and, one day, wants to help develop a culturally competent mental health program for AAPI youth, ensuring others see a reflection of their own experience in the person offering help."
