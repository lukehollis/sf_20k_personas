Raised in Fresno by a mechanic father and a bookkeeper mother, Olivia was a studious child who found escape not in California\u2019s sun, but in the shaded worlds of classic literature. Her parents, grounded in practicality, were baffled when she chose to pursue an English degree at UC Santa Cruz, viewing it as a beautiful but ultimately useless endeavor.\n\nOlivia thrived amidst the redwood campus, relishing dense literary theory and late-night debates about Woolf and Faulkner. Graduation, however, brought the harsh reality her parents had predicted. Publishing internships were unpaid, and barista jobs barely covered rent. The turning point came during a tearful phone call home. Her father, trying to help, reminded her how she\u2019d always been the one to fix the family\u2019s computers. \"You've got a good head for that stuff, Liv,\" he'd said. It was a lifeline.\n\nSpurred by pragmatism, Olivia completed a six-month intensive IT certification program. Her knack for patient, logical problem-solving\u2014honed by years of analyzing complex texts\u2014made her a natural. She landed a remote IT support role for a downtown tech firm, the job serving as her long-dreamed-of ticket to San Francisco.\n\nNow, her days are a structured rhythm of Slack notifications and video calls, patiently guiding frantic employees through password resets and VPN issues. After logging off, she sheds her tech support skin. She\u2019s a regular at Green Apple Books on Clement, and her weekends are spent getting lost in Golden Gate Park, finding quiet benches to read or simply watch the fog roll in. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from her certification course and a local book club.\n\nWhile grateful for the stability her career provides, Olivia feels a creative pull. She secretly dreams of transitioning into UX writing, a field where she could finally merge her technical knowledge with her inherent love for language and story. For now, she finds contentment in her quiet corner of the city, a place where a literature-loving techie can build a life, one support ticket at a time."
