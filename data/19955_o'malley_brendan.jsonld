The son of a union firefighter and a pediatric nurse, his upbringing was steeped in a culture of service, stoicism, and storytelling. Conversations around the dinner table weren't about ambition, but about the daily dramas of the city\u2014the lives saved, the systems navigated, the small acts of community that held the neighborhood together.\n\nHe fled the East Coast for his graduate studies, seeking a different perspective. Landing at UC Berkeley for his Master of Social Work felt like entering another country. The emotional openness of the West Coast was a stark contrast to his family\u2019s reserved Irish-Catholic demeanor, and it was here he found his professional calling. After earning his MSW and completing the grueling hours for his licensure, Brendan began his career in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s community health clinics. For over a decade, he worked with families in the Mission District, navigating poverty, trauma, and the labyrinthine social services system.\n\nThe turning point was burnout, followed by the global pandemic. The city-mandated shift to telehealth was initially a disruption, but Brendan discovered an unexpected affinity for it. It allowed for a different kind of intimacy and accessibility for his clients, many of whom were students or healthcare workers struggling with their own overwhelming environments.\n\nToday, at 46, Brendan operates his own small private practice entirely from a converted second bedroom in his rent-controlled Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his life is hyperlocal. Mornings are for walks in Golden Gate Park, observing the way the light filters through the cypress trees. His days are a series of virtual sessions, a quiet voice of guidance against the backdrop of his book-lined walls. His clients are his primary connection to the city's pulse. A past decade-long partnership dissolved amicably years ago, leaving him with a quiet solitude he mostly embraces. His social life is a small, tight circle of other long-term residents who remember the city before the last tech boom.\n\nBrendan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to change the world, but to shore up the foundations of the people in his small corner of it. He aspires to continue offering a steady presence in a turbulent city, helping others find their footing, one session at a time, from his quiet apartment where the fog is a constant, comforting companion."
