Born in San Jose, he was raised by his Iranian father, an engineer who fled Tehran after the revolution, and his Irish-American mother, a compassionate public school teacher. His father instilled a fierce work ethic and a respect for logic, while his mother nurtured his innate empathy. Navigating this bicultural identity, David often felt like a bridge\u2014his last name a marker of a heritage many couldn't place, his appearance allowing him to move through spaces as simply \"White.\" This duality shaped his worldview, drawing him toward professions focused on understanding and helping others.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work at San Francisco State University, a choice that aligned with his mother\u2019s values over his father's more pragmatic hopes. David spent his late twenties and early thirties working for a non-profit in the Mission, counseling at-risk youth. He saw the profound impact of direct service but was also frustrated by the constant scarcity of resources and the threat of burnout. The turning point came when he saw how a simple scheduling app could revolutionize patient access at a community clinic. He realized technology wasn't the enemy of social good; it was a powerful, scalable tool.\n\nDavid transitioned into the health tech sector, finding his niche as a Clinical Program Manager. He now leads a team developing mental health support platforms for university students, a perfect fusion of his clinical background and a desire for broader impact. His $165,000 salary affords him a life he never imagined in his non-profit days. He lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the Castro, a neighborhood whose history and vibrant community he deeply cherishes. His daily routine is structured: a Muni ride to his SoMa office, intense workdays acting as a translator between clinicians and developers, and evenings spent either running through Duboce Park or sharing dinner with a close circle of friends.\n\nThough single after a significant long-term relationship ended a few years ago, David feels grounded. He dreams of one day leveraging his experience to launch his own social-impact venture. For now, he finds meaning in his work, his friendships, and the complex, ever-changing city he proudly calls home."

He was thirteen, and his father, usually lost in engineering schematics, was teaching him to make *tahdig*. His father\u2019s hands, normally so precise with tools, were just as meticulous with the rice, layering it with a quiet reverence. It wasn\u2019t just a recipe; it was a transfer of heritage, a fragile link to a Tehran he\u2019d never see. In that moment, David felt the weight and pride of his last name, understanding it was a legacy worth preserving.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe can still picture the worn-out couch in his office at the Mission non-profit, around age 28. A quiet 16-year-old girl, who hadn\u2019t said more than three words all month, suddenly slid her sketchbook across the table. It was filled with vibrant, powerful character designs. She spoke of wanting to be an animator. The raw talent was breathtaking, but so was the chasm between her dream and her reality. That specific, aching mix of hope and systemic unfairness fueled his desire for a solution bigger than one-on-one counseling.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe epiphany came not in a boardroom, but in the chaotic waiting room of a community clinic where he was consulting. He watched an exhausted receptionist try to manage a paper sign-in sheet while the phone rang incessantly. Then, a volunteer showed her a simple scheduling app on a tablet. He saw the tension leave the receptionist\u2019s shoulders, a small moment of order in the chaos. Suddenly, technology wasn't the enemy. It was a tool for dignity. For David, then 31, it was the bridge between his two worlds.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThree years ago, on his first solo run through Duboce Park after his partner moved out, the silence in his Castro apartment had been deafening. Each step up the steep hill was a punishment. But at the top, breathless, he looked out over the city lights toward the rainbow flag flying over Harvey Milk Plaza. He wasn't just a single man in an empty apartment; he was part of this neighborhood, held by its history of resilience. It was a quiet, profound realization that he was still home.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, during a tense Zoom call, a lead developer dismissed a clinician's concern about user triggers as an \"edge case.\" David saw the communication breakdown. He paused the debate and reframed the clinician\u2019s fear into a discussion of user retention and product liability. The developer\u2019s face changed from dismissive to engaged. In that instant, David felt his purpose crystallize. He wasn\u2019t a social worker or a tech guy; he was a translator, standing firmly on the bridge he\u2019d been building his whole life."
