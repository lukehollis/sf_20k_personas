Born in the Richmond District to a third-generation Irish-American mother, his last name comes from his Korean-American stepfather, a kind hardware store owner who raised him after his biological father left. Growing up in a blended, middle-class family, Robert saw the city not as a postcard, but as a complex organism of distinct neighborhoods, each with its own culture and struggles. He watched his stepfather serve their community with quiet dignity, a lesson that shaped his own sense of duty.\n\nWhile his peers in the 90s were chasing dot-com fortunes, Robert felt a different calling. He saw the first tremors of the housing crisis displacing families he\u2019d known his whole life. This solidified his path. He pursued a Master of Public Administration at San Francisco State University, driven by a pragmatic idealism to work within the system, not just rail against it. His career has been a steady, determined climb through the city\u2019s bureaucracy, moving from analyst to his current role as Deputy Director in the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development.\n\nNow 54 and long-divorced, Robert\u2019s life is anchored by routine and purpose. His day begins with a 1.1-mile walk from his modest Hayes Valley apartment to City Hall. This commute is his daily ritual, a ground-level survey of the city he serves\u2014observing new construction, homeless encampments, and the vibrant street life that persists against all odds. His days are a grueling marathon of policy meetings, budget analyses, and tense community forums, navigating the chasm between developer interests and residents' needs.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting of old friends who, like him, remember a different San Francisco. He\u2019s a regular at a neighborhood bar and holds season tickets to the Giants. Robert harbors no grand illusions of \"solving\" the housing crisis. His aspiration is more grounded: to see the projects he's championed break ground, providing tangible homes for teachers, artists, and families. His hope for the future is not for personal gain, but for a San Francisco that can reclaim a piece of its soul, one affordable unit at a time."

An elderly neighbor couldn't afford a new lockset. Robert watched Joon pull a used one from a back shelf, clean it, and give it to her for a few dollars. \"We don't sell things, Robert,\" Joon told him later, his hands stained with grease. \"We help neighbors keep their homes together.\" That quiet act of dignity became Robert\u2019s life's blueprint.\n\n2.\nIn 1998, he stood on a sidewalk in the Mission, helping his childhood friend Mateo load the last box into a U-Haul. Mateo\u2019s family, who had run the corner store for thirty years, was being displaced by an Ellis Act eviction. There was no grand speech, just the hollow sound of the truck door slamming shut on a life. That sound echoed in his head on the long bus ride back to his SF State classes, transforming a vague unease into a cold, focused resolve to work within the system that broke things.\n\n3.\nYears after the paperwork and brutal community meetings, he visited a new teacher housing complex on Folsom Street on a whim. He saw a young woman unlocking her door, a school tote bag over her shoulder, her daughter clutching her leg. She stopped, looked up at the clean lines of her new home, and let out a deep, relieved breath. Robert stood across the street, unseen. That single exhale of relief was more gratifying than any commendation or ribbon-cutting ceremony. It was the sound of a foothold.\n\n4.\nOn his morning walk down Franklin, he passes a sleek glass condominium. But for a second, he still sees the laundromat that used to be there. He remembers arguing with his then-wife, Sarah, in that steamy space over whose turn it was to fold the sheets. They were young, broke, and fought about stupid things because the big things were too scary. The laundromat is gone. Sarah is gone. The memory is a faint scar he traces with his eyes each day, a quiet acknowledgment of the lives the city holds and discards.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a chilly Tuesday night game last September. The Giants were losing, but nobody left. As the fog crept over the outfield wall, a stranger passed him a thermos of something warm and vaguely alcoholic. They shared a nod, two middle-aged men in orange and black, witnessing the simple ritual. In that moment, surrounded by the roar of the crowd and the smell of garlic fries, Robert felt the stubborn, beating heart of the city. This, he thought, is what we\u2019re actually trying to save."
