Born in Fresno to a Mexican mother from Jalisco and an Indian immigrant father who worked the same agricultural fields, Raj grew up in a household rich with the scent of both cumin and cilantro. His mother, Elena Ramirez, called him \"mi rey,\" while his father, wanting him to have an Indian name, chose Raj. He spent his youth feeling like an observer, caught between the vibrant warmth of his mother\u2019s heritage and the quiet, industrious nature of his father's. He never felt fully part of either world, a quiet kid who preferred listening to leading.\n\nSchool was a place to pass through, not to excel. After graduating high school, Raj followed his father into various labor jobs, from packing houses to warehouses. A failed romance in his late twenties was the catalyst that pushed him to San Francisco, seeking anonymity and a fresh start. He found both, along with a deep sense of purpose, in an unexpected place: the sterile corridors of a hospital. He started as a janitor, but his meticulous nature and quiet dedication saw him become an Environmental Services Technician. For over two decades, he has been a silent guardian against infection, his work a vital, unseen contribution to patient healing.\n\nRaj\u2019s life is contained within a few city blocks. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk across an alley from his small, rent-controlled SRO (Single Room Occupancy) unit to the hospital\u2019s back entrance. Now 51, his routine is his anchor. His days are spent in the methodical rhythm of cleaning and sanitizing, his nights in the quiet solitude of his room, listening to old cumbia records or watching soccer. His social circle is small, consisting of a few night-shift nurses with whom he shares coffee and brief, knowing conversations.\n\nHe is woven into the fabric of his Mission District neighborhood, a familiar face at the corner taqueria and the local panaderia. The vibrant murals are the backdrop to his life. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it's to save enough to finally visit his mother\u2019s village in Jalisco, a place he\u2019s only ever seen in faded photographs. He hopes to walk the streets she described and, for the first time, feel wholly connected to one part of his story."
