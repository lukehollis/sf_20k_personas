            "value": "David Wu is the quiet heart of the pre-war Russian Hill apartment building he calls home. Born and raised in the Richmond District, his childhood was a blur of helping his immigrant parents at their small neighborhood grocery store. The scent of dried mushrooms and the clatter of the cash register were the sounds of his youth. He was taught the value of hard work, reliability, and fixing what was broken, whether it was a wobbly vegetable stand or a faulty cooler.\n\nHis path seemed set for engineering at SF State, a practical application of his innate ability to understand how things worked. However, two years into his degree, his father\u2019s health declined sharply, pulling David from his studies and back behind the counter full-time. He never returned to college. After his father passed and his mother sold the store to retire, David, then in his late twenties, found himself adrift. He took a job assisting a building manager, and something clicked. The tangible satisfaction of diagnosing a plumbing issue or rewiring a faulty circuit was more rewarding than any textbook theory.\n\nNow 48, David is the live-in building maintenance technician, a role that perfectly explains his zero-mile commute. His life is inextricably woven into the groans of the old elevator and the hum of the boiler. He knows which floorboards creak and which windows stick. His amicable divorce years ago was partly a result of this life; his ex-wife couldn't handle that his work was never truly over. His greatest pride is his daughter, Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA, whose photo is the only bright spot on his utilitarian desk.\n\nHis daily routine is a quiet rhythm of responding to tenant requests, preventative maintenance, and long walks through the neighborhood on his breaks, observing the city change around his steadfast building. He\u2019s a friendly but reserved presence, the keeper of secrets for the dozens of residents who pass through the lobby. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; he hopes to see Maya graduate without debt and perhaps one day buy a small fishing boat. More immediately, he fights to keep his aging building running smoothly, a quiet guardian standing firm against the relentless tide of modern San Francisco."
