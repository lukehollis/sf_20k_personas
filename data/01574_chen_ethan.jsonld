            "value": "Ethan Chen\u2019s identity was forged not by a place, but by the lack of one. The son of international contract engineers, his childhood was a blur of dusty construction sites and sterile corporate apartments across Southeast Asia and the Middle East. He holds a passport, but no allegiance to a flag or a culture; \"Chen\" is just a name inherited from a grandfather he barely knew. His education was a patchwork of his mother's homeschooling and the practical lessons learned from local workers, leaving him with a sharp mind but no diploma to prove it.\n\nAt nineteen, desperate for an anchor, he broke from his parents\u2019 nomadic life and landed in San Francisco with two duffel bags and a few hundred dollars. The city was overwhelming and indifferent. He stumbled into a dishwashing job at a bustling, no-frills bistro in the Mission, trading his labor for cash and a staff meal. It was there, amidst the clatter of pans and the roar of the hood vents, that Ethan found his first true home. He was drawn to the kitchen's raw meritocracy, a world where your worth was measured in speed, precision, and resilience\u2014not your background.\n\nHe spent years observing, graduating from the dish pit to prep cook, and finally, to the line. Now 33, his life is contained within a few city blocks. He lives in a small SRO just upstairs from the restaurant, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His days are a disciplined cycle of prep, the intense ballet of dinner service, and the camaraderie of a shared beer with the crew after closing. These colleagues are his family, their communication a lexicon of nods, grunts, and shared understanding over the symphony of steel and fire.\n\nEthan\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t one of landmarks or scenic views; it's the pre-dawn silence of his street, the smell of produce deliveries, and the rhythm of his neighborhood waking up. His dream is quiet but fierce: to save enough to one day open a tiny, six-seat noodle counter. It wouldn\u2019t be grand, but it would be his\u2014a permanent station in a life spent in motion, a place to finally put down roots."
