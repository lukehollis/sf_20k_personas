The only son of first-generation Korean immigrants, he grew up not in San Francisco proper, but just over the border in Daly City. His parents ran a small dry-cleaning business where the scent of starch and steam was the backdrop of his childhood. They preached the gospel of hard work and stability, hoping he\u2019d become a doctor or engineer. But David was more interested in the customers\u2014the subtle tells of their stress, the fatigue in their eyes, and the brief moments of relief when his mother offered a kind word.\n\nHis undergraduate years at UC Davis, studying psychology, were exploratory. The true turning point came when his maternal grandmother, who spoke little English, struggled to access mental healthcare after his grandfather\u2019s death. David witnessed her frustration navigating a system that didn\u2019t understand her culture or her language. The experience ignited a purpose in him. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work (MSW) with a focus on culturally competent care. This felt more vital and authentic than any career his parents had envisioned.\n\nNow 33, David is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major hospital network, working entirely from his one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his coffee maker to his spare-room office. He is a digital lifeline for patients across the Bay Area, providing therapy through a secure video link. His days are a structured rhythm of intense, empathetic sessions, broken up by long walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. He finds solace in the fog-laced streets and the familiar hum of the N-Judah line.\n\nThough dedicated to his work, he\u2019s conscious of the isolation that comes with it. He maintains connections through a weekly rock-climbing group at Mission Cliffs and a tight-knit circle of friends from his graduate program. Thoughtfully single after a recent breakup, David dreams of eventually opening a small private practice focused on serving the AAPI community. More than anything, he hopes to build a life defined not by wealth, but by the depth of his connections and the quiet, steady impact he has on the lives of others, one session at a time."

His mother, handing back the ticket, said something soft in Korean. The woman\u2019s shoulders dropped an inch, a silent sigh of gratitude. David realized then that his mother wasn't just cleaning clothes; she was absorbing a piece of someone's grief. It taught him that the most profound services are often unspoken, a lesson that would define his entire career.\n\n2.\nHe was 23, sitting in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, the phone pressed between their heads. He tried translating her grief into clinical English for a scheduler who offered no warmth. He can still feel the vibration of his *halmoni's* defeated sigh when she finally hung up, unheard. The wave of helpless anger that washed over him wasn't just an emotion; it was a directive. It was the moment he knew he had to build a bridge for people like her, a bridge made of language, culture, and empathy.\n\n3.\nLast year, after a telehealth session, an elderly Cantonese patient, silent for weeks, finally met his gaze through the webcam. After David sat patiently in the digital silence with him, the man offered a single, slow nod of understanding. In that tiny gesture across the digital void, David felt the connection click into place. It wasn't a dramatic breakthrough, but a quiet affirmation that his work was reaching the people who needed it most. This was the impact he had always wanted to make.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, after a session left him feeling heavy with a patient's trauma, he walked into Golden Gate Park. The fog was so thick it felt like a blanket, muffling the city's noise to a distant hum. Standing beneath the dripping cypress trees, he felt the cool air on his face and realized the park wasn't just an escape; it was a partner in his work. It absorbed the echoes of his day, allowing him to breathe again. This ritual of walking became his own form of therapy.\n\n5.\nA few months ago at Mission Cliffs, he was frozen on a difficult route, his muscles screaming. His mind, so used to navigating emotional landscapes, went blank. From below, his friend's voice cut through the fear: \"Breathe, David. I\u2019ve got you.\" He felt the taut rope, a literal lifeline held by someone he trusted. In that moment, the raw, physical reality of support was a jolt of clarity. It reminded him that for all his digital work, true connection is something you can feel in your bones."
