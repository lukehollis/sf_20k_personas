The son of Filipino immigrants\u2014a compassionate nurse at UCSF and a steadfast postal worker\u2014Marco was raised in a home where hard work and community were paramount. His upbringing was a warm blend of lively family gatherings, the aroma of adobo, and the unspoken expectation to pursue a stable, respectable career.\n\nThe pivotal turning point in his life came during his teenage years. He watched his younger sister, Lena, struggle with a crippling anxiety that their family, despite their love, didn't have the language to address. Navigating the cultural stigma around mental health to find her effective support was a formative, frustrating experience. It ignited a quiet fire in Marco: a resolve to become the resource his family had so desperately needed.\n\nThis mission guided his educational journey. He earned his undergraduate degree from UC Davis and immediately enrolled in San Francisco State University\u2019s Master of Social Work program. It was during his internships in the city\u2019s public schools that he found his true calling. Now, as a mental health clinician, he works with high school students, many of whom are first-generation or from immigrant families facing the same silent battles his sister once did.\n\nMarco\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the city. He lives in a cozy, roommate-shared apartment in the Inner Richmond. His mornings start with a strong coffee before he catches the 38-Geary Muni bus for his 2.5-mile commute. His days are a challenging rhythm of student counseling sessions, parent meetings, and an avalanche of paperwork. Weekends are for recharging: pickup basketball at the Panhandle, dim sum on Clement Street with friends from grad school, and Sunday dinners with his family in Daly City, where Lena is now a thriving graphic designer.\n\nHis $86,000 salary affords him a life of mindful choices rather than luxury. His dream isn't a tech fortune, but something richer: to one day spearhead a program that provides culturally competent mental health care for Asian-American youth throughout the Bay Area. For Marco, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's the community he serves, a city of immense beauty and profound need, and he is determined to help it heal, one student at a time."

He found his sister Lena not downstairs, but curled in her darkened bedroom, unable to face the noise. He sat with her in the silence, feeling a profound helplessness turn into a quiet, burning resolve. That moment wasn't about fixing her; it was the silent vow that he would learn the language of healing that his loving family simply didn\u2019t know. It was the first step on his path.\n\n2.\nDuring his SF State internship, a quiet Filipino boy had been silent for six straight sessions. Then, one Tuesday, the student finally looked up and whispered about the pressure of disappointing his parents. For Marco, it was a profound click\u2014he was hearing his own family\u2019s unspoken fears in a school office. This wasn't just a job; it was a calling. He realized he could be the person he and Lena had needed, confirming his life's purpose was right there in that chair.\n\n3.\nLast month, standing room only on the 38-Geary home, he watched Lena showcase her graphic design portfolio on her laptop at Sunday dinner. She was confident, funny, and even joked about her anxious high school years. A wave of quiet pride washed over Marco, so intense it almost felt like his own accomplishment. Seeing her thrive wasn't just a relief; it was the living, breathing proof that the difficult work mattered, that healing was real and beautifully possible.\n\n4.\nOn a particularly draining Thursday, Marco felt the weight of his caseload. Boarding the foggy 5:00 PM Muni, he saw the faces around him: an elderly Cantonese woman, a group of high schoolers blasting music, a tired cook in his whites. He suddenly didn\u2019t feel alone in his exhaustion. He was part of this city's immense, complicated rhythm. The commute wasn't an obstacle; it was a daily reminder of the community he belonged to and the very people he had sworn to serve.\n\n5.\nHuddled around a wobbly table for dim sum on Clement Street last Saturday, Marco let his grad school friends\u2019 familiar laughter wash over him. They vented about impossible cases and bureaucratic headaches\u2014the shorthand of shared work. In that moment, surrounded by steam and noise, he felt deeply understood. It crystalized for him that while his work was about giving support, his survival in San Francisco depended entirely on knowing how, and where, to receive it."
