Born to an Indian immigrant mother and a third-generation Irish-American father, his San Jose childhood was a culinary Venn diagram of fragrant curries and hearty stews. His parents ran a small, bustling deli, where Rohan learned the language of inventory and the importance of a welcoming smile long before he could legally work.\n\nDespite his upbringing, Rohan initially sought a more academic path. He moved to San Francisco to pursue a History degree at SF State, fascinated by the stories of how people and cultures connect. To pay his bills, he took a waiting job at a trendy restaurant in the Mission District. It was here, amidst the symphony of service and the clatter of the kitchen, that he found his true calling. The immediate, tangible nature of creating a perfect dining experience felt more real and impactful than any history book.\n\nThe turning point was a chaotic Saturday night when the manager quit mid-shift. Rohan, then just a senior waiter, stepped up instinctively, organizing the floor, placating a frustrated chef, and ensuring guests remained oblivious to the backstage drama. The owner noticed. Upon graduating, Rohan was offered an assistant manager position, trading historical narratives for nightly service reports.\n\nNow, at 29, Rohan is the General Manager of \"Cinder & Saffron,\" a respected Cal-Indian eatery in the Mission. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; he lives in a small apartment directly above the restaurant. His days are a blur of staff schedules, vendor negotiations, and orchestrating the nightly chaos. His social life is intertwined with his work; his staff are his surrogate family, and the neighborhood regulars are his community. San Francisco, for him, isn't a vast city but the vibrant, mural-splashed blocks surrounding his building.\n\nHis dream is to one day open his own place, a small, intimate restaurant that truly honors his heritage\u2014a menu where Goan vindaloo and Irish shepherd\u2019s pie aren\u2019t just on the same menu, but in the same dish. He wants to create a story of his own, served one plate at a time."
