Raised in a pragmatic, blue-collar Pittsburgh family, his decision to pursue a Master's in Urban History was seen as a charming but impractical deviation. His parents, a steelworker and a school administrator, hoped he\u2019d find a stable, tangible profession. For a time, it seemed he would disappoint them, working a low-paying archival job after graduation.\n\nThe first tech boom of the late 90s was his unexpected lifeline. A friend in San Francisco convinced him that his skills\u2014organizing complex information and understanding systemic development\u2014were perfectly suited for the burgeoning field of project management. He made the leap, trading Pittsburgh\u2019s industrial history for California\u2019s digital future. He found surprising success, his humanities background giving him an edge in communication and strategy that many pure engineers lacked. A layoff during the dot-com bust taught him a crucial lesson in resilience, and he rebuilt his career with a more guarded, strategic approach, eventually landing his senior role.\n\nNow, Jason lives in a meticulously kept apartment in NOPA (North of the Panhandle), his 0.0-mile commute a testament to modern tech life. His days are a blur of Zoom calls and Slack notifications, punctuated by a ritualistic morning walk to a local cafe for a pour-over and an evening run through the Panhandle to clear his head. His social life is small but solid: a few trusted colleagues and a non-tech trivia team he treasures for its grounding reality. A serious long-term relationship ended five years ago, a casualty of schedules and diverging life goals, leaving him comfortably, if sometimes lonelily, single.\n\nWhile financially secure, Jason feels a growing disconnect. He lives in a city whose history he studied, yet he feels more connected to its global network of servers than its streets. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He hopes to eventually pivot, using his program management expertise to consult for historical preservation societies or civic tech initiatives\u2014a way to finally merge the two halves of his life and build a legacy more enduring than a software release."
