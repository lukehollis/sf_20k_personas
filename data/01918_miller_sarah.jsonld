Raised in a small logging town in rural Oregon, Sarah\u2019s upbringing was practical and grounded. Her father worked long, hard hours in the timber industry, and her mother was a home health aide, whose stories of caring for the elderly instilled in Sarah a deep sense of empathy and purpose from a young age.\n\nDriven by this early inspiration, she pursued a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Oregon Health & Science University. Her first decade as an RN was spent in the chaotic, high-stakes environment of a Portland emergency room. While she thrived on the adrenaline and the tangible impact of her work, the relentless pace and emotional toll led to severe burnout. The turning point came after a particularly grueling week when she realized she was losing the compassion that had drawn her to nursing in the first place.\n\nSeeking a dramatic change, she answered an ad for a private, live-in nurse in San Francisco. For the past eight years, she has been the sole caregiver for Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but frail matriarch of a wealthy family. Sarah\u2019s life is a disciplined rhythm of medication schedules, meal preparation, and quiet companionship. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate yet detached; she knows the fog patterns over the Bay from her patient's window and the precise slope of the streets she walks on her afternoons off, but feels like an outsider in the opulent neighborhood. Her social circle is small, mostly consisting of a few other nurses she connects with on rare weekends.\n\nThough she is devoted to Eleanor, Sarah dreams of reclaiming her own space. Her hope is to one day buy a small, simple cottage in a quiet coastal town like Pescadero, where the rhythm of her life is dictated by the tides instead of a medical chart. She yearns for the simple peace of her own garden, a testament to a life spent nurturing others, and now, finally, herself."
