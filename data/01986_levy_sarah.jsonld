Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing elementary school teacher mother, her upbringing was stable, predictable, and imbued with a Midwestern sense of community. While her parents encouraged practical pursuits, Sarah was always more fascinated by systems of knowledge and how people organized information. This led her to pursue a Master\u2019s in Library and Information Science at the University of Michigan, a degree her parents found slightly esoteric but supported nonetheless.\n\nHer initial career path was traditional, working as a research archivist for a university. However, a turning point came when a recruiter for a Bay Area tech firm saw her unique ability to structure and interpret human-centric data. Lured by the challenge and the promise of a new life, she made the cross-country move to San Francisco six years ago. She thrived, translating messy user behavior into clean, actionable insights.\n\nThe biggest shift in her life came with the pandemic, when her job went fully remote. Instead of a sterile office, her world became her Inner Richmond apartment. This forced her to root herself in her neighborhood in a way she never had before. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not with traffic, but with a foggy walk in Golden Gate Park and a coffee from a small Clement Street caf\u00e9. She knows the names of her local grocers and librarians.\n\nHer social life is a curated tapestry of close friendships, many formed through a hiking group that explores Mount Tamalpais on weekends. A significant relationship ended two years ago over the classic SF ultimatum\u2014stay and struggle, or cash out and move\u2014and Sarah, to her own surprise, chose the city.\n\nNow, at 35, Sarah\u2019s dreams are not of founding a startup, but of stability. She aspires to use her data skills for a company with a social mission, to find a partner who loves the city\u2019s quiet corners as much as she does, and maybe, just maybe, to one day buy her own small condo\u2014a permanent anchor in the city that became her unexpected home."
