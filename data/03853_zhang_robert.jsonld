The son of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, he grew up in Daly City, surrounded by the scent of his parents' small Cantonese restaurant and their fervent hopes for his future. They envisioned him an engineer or a doctor, a path of stability they had crossed an ocean to provide. Robert, however, was drawn to the architecture of language. He defied their quiet expectations and pursued a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing at San Francisco State University, dreaming of life as a novelist.\n\nThe reality of a writer's income in the late 90s was a harsh editor. Needing a steady paycheck, Robert took a \"temporary\" job as a copywriter for a burgeoning dot-com. There, he discovered a surprising talent: he could apply his narrative skills to consumer behavior, crafting compelling stories around products. The temporary job became a career. He rose through the ranks, his unique ability to blend creative storytelling with data analysis making him invaluable. He became the Senior Director of E-commerce Strategy, a title that would have thrilled his parents, who have since passed.\n\nNow, at 49, Robert\u2019s world is the four walls of his home office in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute offers efficiency but little separation. His days are a blur of Zoom calls and strategic decks, his evenings spent with his wife, Elena, a landscape architect, and their 16-year-old daughter, Lily. It was watching Lily\u2019s passionate dedication to her painting that reawakened Robert's dormant ambitions. He saw his younger self in her, unburdened by practicality.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and sensory\u2014not the hustle of downtown, but the quiet hum of Clement Street, the taste of authentic xiao long bao, and the solace of long walks through the fog-drenched cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. He doesn't dream of escaping his corporate life, but of integrating his lost self into it. Late at night, after the house is quiet and the last email is sent, Robert opens a fresh document on his laptop. He is slowly, secretly, writing his novel again, building a world of words within the city that has held every version of him."

His father, hands calloused from the wok, spreads the day\u2019s cash on a steel table. \"For your future, Ah-Jai,\" he says, his voice tired but proud. Robert feels a crushing wave of love and guilt. He nods, but in his mind, he isn't calculating profits; he's rearranging the words on the menu into a poem. It was the moment his ambition became a secret.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-three, during his MFA workshop at SF State, a visiting poet reads one of Robert\u2019s paragraphs aloud. The room is silent. The poet looks up from the page, right at him, and says, \"The ache in that sentence is real.\" In that cold, drafty classroom, under the dim fluorescent lights, Robert feels a warmth spread through his chest. It was the first time he felt truly seen, not as a son or a student, but as a writer. That validation became a private anchor for years.\n\n3.\nIt\u2019s 1999, and he\u2019s twenty-eight. In a dot-com conference room buzzing with nervous energy, he presents his first major ad campaign. Instead of listing product features, he tells the story of the person who needs it. He watches the CEO lean forward, captivated. The subsequent surge in sales feels different from workshop applause\u2014it\u2019s quantifiable, powerful. He feels a surprising, pragmatic thrill. It\u2019s the day he realizes storytelling has currency, solidifying a path he never intended to take.\n\n4.\nHe is forty-eight, and he finds his daughter, Lily, staring at a half-finished canvas in the garage, her shoulders slumped in frustration. \"It just won't feel right,\" she whispers, smudging a bold streak of cerulean blue with her thumb. He recognizes the look in her eye\u2014that intense, personal battle with creation. Seeing her wrestle with her art, not for a grade but for herself, dissolves his own decades-old excuses. Her struggle gives him permission to begin his own again.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, after a brutal day of budget meetings, he takes a walk. The Inner Richmond is wrapped in its usual evening fog. As he passes a small shop on Clement Street, the smell of steamed dumplings transports him. He\u2019d been stuck on a scene in his novel for weeks, and suddenly, the answer is there, prompted by the sensory echo of his childhood. He realizes his corporate mind can build the structure, but his memories provide the soul. He feels a quiet click of integration, an alignment of his two selves."
