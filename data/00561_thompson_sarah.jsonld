Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a pragmatic engineer father and a literature-loving mother, Sarah grew up straddling the worlds of logic and narrative. She found comfort in the Dewey Decimal System, seeing it as a beautiful, intricate map for all human knowledge.\n\nHer early career saw her applying this unique perspective not to libraries, but to the burgeoning tech landscape of the late 90s. She became a management consultant, her specialty being the untangling of complex organizational structures and workflows. She was brilliant at it, transforming corporate chaos into elegant, efficient systems. For fifteen years, she was a road warrior for a top-tier firm, a life of airport lounges and hotel rooms that ultimately cost her her marriage and led to a severe burnout at age 38.\n\nThat crisis was her turning point. Sarah left the firm, went independent, and vowed never again to let her work consume her life. Today, she operates from the quiet sanctuary of her Cole Valley flat, her commute a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her meticulously organized home office. Her days are structured and serene. A morning walk through the eucalyptus-scented paths of the Presidio, followed by deep-focus work for a select handful of clients. Evenings are for pilates, a glass of wine with a neighbor, or quietly reading by her bay window as the fog rolls in.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is now hyperlocal. She knows the baristas at her local cafe by name and has a running tab at the neighborhood bookstore. Having conquered the corporate world, her aspirations are more personal. She dreams of traveling not for business, but for pleasure\u2014to see the ancient libraries of Europe. She\u2019s also begun a passion project: creating a digital archive for a local historical society, finally using her degree for its original purpose. Sarah has found her balance, curating a life as thoughtfully as she once curated corporate strategies."
