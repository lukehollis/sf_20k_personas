            "value": "Rohan Vance\u2019s life has been a study in blending worlds. Born in Chicago to an Irish-American father, a stoic architect, and a vibrant mother from Chennai, India, his childhood home was a fusion of quiet structure and expressive color. His father taught him perspective and form, while his mother filled their home with intricate Kolam patterns and the aroma of spices. This duality shaped him, making him a keen observer who understood that what is left unsaid is often as important as what is spoken.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his youth came when his younger sister battled a prolonged illness, leaving her withdrawn and unable to articulate her fear. While traditional counseling fell short, Rohan noticed she found solace in her sketchbook, drawing fantastical creatures and surreal landscapes. He saw firsthand how art could create a language for pain when words failed. This revelation guided his path. He pursued a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology with a specialization in Art Therapy at a program in the Bay Area, drawn by San Francisco's reputation for progressive mental health care and its thriving arts scene.\n\nNow 40, Rohan has built a quiet, meaningful life in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is to the converted front room of his Edwardian flat, a serene studio space where he conducts telehealth sessions with clients in hospitals and long-term care facilities. He helps patients process trauma, grief, and illness through painting, sculpture, and drawing. His days follow a gentle rhythm: morning sessions with clients, an afternoon break for his own painting or a long walk through Golden Gate Park, and evenings spent with his partner, Leo, a landscape designer.\n\nRohan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep. He feels at home in a city that doesn't demand conformity. He is an active member of a local pottery co-op, finding community among fellow creators. His ultimate dream is to secure funding to open a small, free community art therapy studio for underserved youth in the city, providing a sanctuary where others, like his sister years ago, can find their voice through color and form."
