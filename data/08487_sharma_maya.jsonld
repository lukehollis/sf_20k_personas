Raised in the warm, competitive incubator of Fremont, she is the only child of Indian immigrants\u2014an engineer father and an accountant mother who saw a clear, stable path for their daughter in medicine or tech. Maya, however, was always more drawn to the stories behind the data. She dutifully excelled in science but spent her nights lost in novels, fascinated by the architecture of human narrative.\n\nThis led her to pursue a Bachelor's in English Literature at UC Berkeley, a choice that caused quiet concern at home. She thrived, dissecting modernist poetry and post-colonial fiction, but a turning point arrived during her senior year. Her beloved grandmother in Mumbai was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder and enrolled in a clinical trial. Maya became the family\u2019s liaison, translating complex medical protocols and patient diaries. She was captivated by the process: the rigorous data collection, the ethics, and the profound human hope woven into every stage. Here, she realized, was a story that saved lives.\n\nAfter graduating, she pivoted. Maya completed a post-baccalaureate certificate in Clinical Trial Management and landed an entry-level position at a UCSF-affiliated research center. Now, at 27, she is a Clinical Research Coordinator, a role that perfectly marries her analytical mind and empathetic soul.\n\nHer life is centered in a sleek Mission Bay apartment, just blocks from the research campus where she occasionally goes for meetings, explaining her nonexistent commute. Most days are spent at her standing desk, corresponding with patients, verifying data, and ensuring regulatory compliance for a new oncology drug trial. Her routine is disciplined: a sunrise run along the Embarcadero, focused work, and evenings spent either with a small circle of college friends exploring restaurants in Hayes Valley or quietly reading at home.\n\nMaya feels deeply connected to San Francisco, a city that embraces reinvention. She found her unique calling here, blending the humanities with healthcare. Her dream is to one day manage international neurology trials, inspired by her grandmother\u2019s journey. For Maya, every data point is a character, every trial a chapter in a story she is helping to write."
