Born and raised in the Outer Sunset, he was the only child of immigrants from Guangdong who ran a small corner grocery store. His childhood was a soundtrack of the N-Judah streetcar rattling past, the Cantonese chatter of his parents\u2019 customers, and the constant, quiet hum of a family working to stay afloat. He saw how the city\u2019s major newspapers rarely told their stories, instead focusing on downtown politics and tech booms. This oversight planted the seed for his future.\n\nAfter graduating from San Francisco State University with a journalism degree, Wei resisted the allure of larger, more prestigious publications. He felt a pull toward the granular reality of the city, taking a job at the *District Chronicle*, a community paper covering the western neighborhoods. For over two decades, he has been its anchor. His career began documenting the first dot-com boom\u2019s impact on local businesses and peaked with an award-winning series on the eviction battles faced by legacy tenants. He became the institutional memory for a part of the city in constant flux.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce ten years ago. His ex-wife, a graphic designer, grew tired of the financial struggle of living on a reporter\u2019s salary in an increasingly expensive city. The split left Wei feeling more tethered to his work than ever, doubling down on his role as a community watchdog. His personal life is now a quiet routine. His day starts with a MUNI ride, where he invariably sees someone he has interviewed. His social circle is small but deep: weekly dim sum with his aging mother in Chinatown, and occasional beers with a city hall source at a dive bar.\n\nNow 48, Wei lives in a modest, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. His income of $82,000 provides for a life of careful budgeting, not luxury. He harbors a quiet dream of compiling his years of reporting into a book\u2014a non-fiction account of San Francisco\u2019s changing soul, told through the lives of its everyday people. More than anything, he hopes his small newspaper can survive, believing that if no one is there to tell the stories of the corner grocers and the displaced renters, a vital piece of the city will vanish forever."

The man didn\u2019t look at his father, just gazed past him out the window, talking on a bulky cellphone about \"clearing out dated storefronts for redevelopment.\" His father just smiled, wiped the counter, and said, \"Thank you, come again.\" Wei felt a hot, quiet anger bloom in his chest. In that moment, he knew he wanted to be the one who made people like that man finally *see* his father.\n\n2.\nHis first real story for the *Chronicle*, in 1999, was about a shoemaker on Irving Street losing his lease to a dot-com startup. The old man\u2019s hands, stained with a lifetime of polish, trembled as he described his eviction notice. After Wei\u2019s article ran, people didn\u2019t just read it; they showed up. They brought their shoes for repair, buying him time. The shop still closed a year later, but for a few months, Wei saw the power of a small story to rally a neighborhood. It solidified his purpose.\n\n3.\nThe breaking point with his ex-wife wasn\u2019t a fight, but a quiet Sunday. She was scrolling through Redfin on her laptop. \"Look, Wei,\" she said, her voice flat, showing him a tiny, million-dollar condo. \"This is what it costs to have a future.\" He looked from the glossy screen to his own worn reporter\u2019s notebook on the table. He felt the chasm between their worlds open right there in their Richmond apartment. He knew he couldn't cross it, and realized he didn't want to.\n\n4.\nFor his series on tenant battles, he interviewed an 80-year-old woman in her Fillmore apartment of fifty years. She ignored his questions about the Ellis Act and instead, pulled out a photo album. \u201cThis is my son, on this carpet, right here,\u201d she said, her finger tracing a faded image. Wei put down his pen. He wasn\u2019t covering a housing crisis; he was documenting the potential erasure of a life\u2019s entire geography. The story became his mission, fueled by a protective, almost filial rage.\n\n5.\nLast week on the N-Judah, he saw a woman he\u2019d interviewed years ago about her fight to save a community garden. She didn't see him, but she was smiling, showing a child something out the window where the garden still stood. Wei felt a pang of something more complex than pride. It was a quiet, weary satisfaction. His life wasn\u2019t grand or wealthy, but it was etched into the city's memory in small, vital places like that one. He was still here, watching."
