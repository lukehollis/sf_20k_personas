His father, an exacting Iranian engineer who immigrated in the late \u201870s, and his mother, a free-spirited Irish-American potter from the Sunset District, raised him in a home filled with blueprints and clay dust. Growing up in Alameda, Kian\u2019s childhood was spent in the garage, where he learned to respect the precision of his father\u2019s tools while inheriting his mother\u2019s desire to create something beautiful from raw materials. This duality defined his path.\n\nHe initially followed his father\u2019s hopes, enrolling in San Francisco State\u2019s Industrial Design program. But Kian grew restless. The theoretical world of computer-aided design felt sterile; he craved the grit and satisfaction of making. The turning point came during a part-time job at a small machine shop in the Bayview, taken to cover tuition. The visceral process of milling a block of aluminum into a precise component was a revelation. He saw his future not on a screen, but on the workshop floor. To his family\u2019s initial concern, he left college after two years to pursue a machinist apprenticeship.\n\nNow 33, Kian is a highly skilled CNC machinist and fabricator at a custom design firm in Dogpatch. He thrives on turning complex designs from architects and artists into tangible objects. His daily 3.5-mile commute from his rent-controlled Potrero Hill apartment is a quick, exhilarating ride on his meticulously maintained Triumph motorcycle, a machine he services and customizes himself.\n\nHis social circle is tight-knit, mostly colleagues and fellow riders who share his appreciation for well-made things over fleeting trends. He's found his tribe not in tech lounges but in the city's historic industrial heart. Kian\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder, but to save enough to open his own small-scale fabrication shop. He envisions a space where he can create bespoke furniture and high-end architectural fixtures, leaving a tangible legacy cast in steel and aluminum, a perfect synthesis of his parents' two worlds."

His father had just shown him how to perfectly deburr a small aluminum block with a file, the edges sharp and precise. Then, his mother took it, her hands smudged with clay, and gently pressed her thumbprint into the soft metal, marring the perfection with a human touch. In that moment, holding the block\u2014part blueprint, part sculpture\u2014Kian felt a profound sense of peace. It was the first time he understood that precision and soul could occupy the same space. This became his life\u2019s mission.\n\n2.\nThe smell is what he remembers most from that first shift at the Bayview machine shop. It wasn\u2019t just oil; it was the scent of hot metal and cutting fluid, a sharp, industrial perfume. He was twenty, watching a CNC mill carve a perfect arc into a block of steel. The sheer, visceral power of it\u2014turning a digital file into a solid, tangible object\u2014was a revelation. In that moment, the sterile world of CAD software dissolved. He knew, with absolute certainty, that his future was here, covered in grease and metal shavings.\n\n3.\nHe remembers laying his father\u2019s old, hand-drawn blueprint on the kitchen table. He was 21 and about to break his father\u2019s heart. Next to the intricate drawing, he placed a heavy, imperfect steel bracket he\u2019d made himself. \"This,\" Kian said, his voice steadier than he felt, pointing to the bracket, \"is what I need to do.\" The silence was crushing until his father reached out, not in anger, but to trace the welded seam with a knowing finger. That silent gesture of respect was the permission Kian needed to build his own life.\n\n4.\nIt was the first morning commute after he\u2019d rebuilt the Triumph\u2019s engine himself. Cresting Potrero Hill at dawn, the city spread below, the bay glinting under the rising sun. The engine didn\u2019t just run; it sang a note he had personally tuned. In that moment of perfect synchronicity\u2014man, machine, and the sprawling industrial beauty of Dogpatch below\u2014he felt a fierce, quiet joy. This was his freedom, a life he had quite literally built with his own two hands, and every vibration of the bike was a confirmation.\n\n5.\nLast year, he walked into a new restaurant in the Mission and saw it: the serpentine brass handrail he had spent a month fabricating. He watched a woman run her hand along the seamless curve, her fingers tracing the exact contour he had polished for hours. There was no plaque with his name, just the quiet, solid presence of his work. A deep, anchoring pride filled him. He wasn't just a machinist; he was leaving a permanent, beautiful mark on the city he called home. This was his legacy taking form."
