Raised in the Outer Sunset by his second-generation Japanese-American father, a quiet architect, and his boisterous Irish-American mother, a city librarian, Kenji grew up between two worlds. He inherited his father\u2019s meticulous nature and his mother\u2019s empathy, traits that would define his future in unexpected ways. While other kids were focused on sports, Kenji was taking apart old radios and VCRs, fascinated by the logic of their inner workings.\n\nFormal education was a struggle; the rigid structure of high school and a brief, uninspired stint at City College felt disconnected from the practical world of circuits and code he explored online. The true turning point came when his father was laid off during a downturn. At 21, Kenji leveraged his self-taught troubleshooting skills into an entry-level help desk job. He discovered a deep satisfaction in untangling complex technical knots for frustrated strangers, finding order in digital chaos.\n\nNow 37, Kenji is a senior technical support specialist for a design software company, a job he performs entirely from his small Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute offers a life of quiet routine. Mornings begin with a walk to a local bakery for coffee and a croissant, followed by hours spent logged in, patiently guiding users through software glitches. His social life is small but solid: a weekly Dungeons & Dragons game with friends he\u2019s known since childhood and occasional visits with his parents, who still live in his childhood home.\n\nThough content, Kenji nurtures an analog dream in his digital life. His apartment is filled with vintage synthesizers and audio equipment he meticulously restores. His ultimate aspiration is to open a small workshop dedicated to repairing classic electronics, a place of tangible craft. He feels most connected to San Francisco not in its bustling downtown but on evening walks in Golden Gate Park or staring out at the Pacific from Ocean Beach, feeling the cool, familiar fog roll in, a comforting blanket over the city that has always been his home."
