The daughter of a pragmatic immigrant mother from Hong Kong and a second-generation Filipino-American father with a Welsh surname, she was raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. Her childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home, the smell of adobo from her father\u2019s kitchen, and the pervasive creative spirit of the Bay Area. While her parents pushed for a stable career, Jasmine found her calling not in a lab or a law office, but in the quiet, reverent halls of the de Young Museum, where school field trips became personal pilgrimages.\n\nHer educational path was a deliberate fusion of passion and practicality. She earned her B.A. in Art History from UC Berkeley, but a key internship revealed her true talent: she was a brilliant organizer, capable of transforming an artist's chaotic vision into a stunning, coherent exhibition. This realization led her to pursue a graduate degree in Arts Administration on the East Coast, vowing to return.\n\nShe fulfilled that promise, starting as an assistant and meticulously working her way up. The turning point in her career came when she secured a massive grant to digitize and exhibit a collection of overlooked works by female Californian artists of the mid-20th century. The project\u2019s success cemented her reputation, eventually leading to her current role as Director of Curatorial Affairs at a major corporate art advisory firm.\n\nNow living in Noe Valley with her husband, a software architect, Jasmine\u2019s life is a structured routine. Her day begins with a walk for their rescue terrier, Frida, followed by a 5.5-mile commute on the J-Church Muni line, where she trades reading emails for art history podcasts. Her job is a constant balance between managing multi-million-dollar acquisitions for tech campuses and nurturing emerging Bay Area talent.\n\nJasmine\u2019s deepest aspiration is to launch a fellowship program that supports first-generation American curators, ensuring the voices shaping the art world are as diverse as the city itself. For her, San Francisco is not just a backdrop but the central piece in her collection\u2014a dynamic, multicultural work-in-progress she is proud to help curate."

It wasn\u2019t just the thick, frosting-like paint; it was the quiet reverence of the gallery. In that hushed room, surrounded by things made just to be beautiful, she felt more at home than anywhere else. This wasn\u2019t a lesson; it was a revelation. It planted the unwavering belief that art wasn't a luxury, but a necessity, a language she was meant to speak.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring her Berkeley internship, a visiting artist\u2019s installation was a chaotic mess of wires and salvaged metal just hours before the opening. The artist was frantic, but Jasmine felt a strange calm. She saw not chaos, but a sequence of steps. She started organizing, delegating, untangling. In the artist\u2019s relieved gaze and the final, stunning coherence of the piece, she recognized her true calling. It wasn\u2019t to make the art, but to make the art possible\u2014a discovery that felt more profound than any textbook theory.\n\n***\n\n3.\nAt the opening night of her exhibition on female Californian artists, she watched from a distance. An elderly woman stood before a small, rediscovered landscape, her hand covering her mouth. \"That's my grandmother's,\" the woman whispered to her companion, tears in her eyes. \"I never thought I'd see it on a museum wall.\" In that moment, the years of research and grant-writing dissolved into pure, visceral purpose. Jasmine understood then that curating wasn't just about arranging objects; it was an act of resurrecting legacies and delivering long-overdue justice.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was last winter, on the J-Church heading home. The train crested the hill near Dolores Park, and the city unfolded below, wrapped in a low-lying blanket of fog that caught the last pink light of sunset. Her phone buzzed with work emails, but she ignored it. For one perfect, fleeting moment, the motion of the train, the view, and the quiet hum of the city felt like a secret gift. It was a reminder that beneath the stress and the ambition, her deepest love was simply for this place itself.\n\n***\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, she'd taken a talented young curatorial assistant out for coffee. He was brilliant, a first-generation student with a sharp eye, but he spoke anxiously about his student debt and the cost of his commute. Jasmine saw her own parents\u2019 pragmatic fears mirrored in his face\u2014the terror of a dream being crushed by rent. The conversation lit a fire in her. Her vague desire to \"help\" crystallized into a concrete mission: she wouldn't just mentor, she would build a bridge. The idea for the fellowship was born right there."
