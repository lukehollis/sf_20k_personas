The son of a mechanic and a grocery store clerk from Stockton, he was the first in his family to attend college. Enrolled in a social services program, he was filled with ideals about fixing broken systems. That idealism met a harsh reality when his mother was diagnosed with aggressive cancer during his sophomore year.\n\nThe turning point wasn't a single event, but a grueling eighteen-month education in navigating a healthcare system that felt designed to confuse and exhaust. David became his mother\u2019s advocate, battling insurance companies, translating medical jargon, and demanding compassionate care. He dropped out of college, not out of failure, but because his true calling had found him. After his mother passed, the thought of returning to a classroom felt hollow.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in the mid-90s, drawn by its reputation for social action. Armed with lived experience rather than a diploma, he found a low-level administrative job at a community health clinic. Over the years, his quiet tenacity and deep empathy saw him rise through the ranks. Now, as a Patient Advocate, he does for others what he once did for his mother: he fights.\n\nAt 50, David\u2019s life is one of routine and meaning. His mornings begin with a strong coffee from a local shop in his Inner Richmond neighborhood before he catches the Muni bus for the short commute to the healthcare nonprofit where he works. His $78,000 salary affords him a modest, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment filled with books and photos of his late parents. Socially, he maintains a small, tight circle of old friends\u2014fellow SF \u201clifers\u201d who remember the city before the tech booms.\n\nHis deepest aspiration is not wealth or recognition, but to ensure fewer people feel as lost as his family once did. David dreams of starting a small, free workshop to train family members on how to be effective advocates for their loved ones, turning his personal pain into a public good, one patient at a time."

David, just twenty, stood his ground. He calmly recited the doctor's specific orders and the time of her last medication. The nurse finally relented. In that small, bitter victory, he felt no triumph, only a hardening resolve. That night, the abstract ideal of \"social services\" died, replaced by the fierce, specific, and unconditional duty of an advocate. This was the moment his real education began.\n\n2.\nHis first week in San Francisco, still hollowed out by grief, he took the N-Judah to its last stop. He stood on the cold sand of Ocean Beach, watching the violent, gray chaos of the Pacific. The immense, indifferent roar of the waves didn't offer comfort, but scale. His personal agony felt small against its vastness. It was the first time since his mother\u2019s death that he could breathe. That moment, in late 1996, wasn\u2019t about healing, but about finding a space big enough to hold his pain.\n\n3.\nIt was 1999. A terrified, elderly monolingual Spanish-speaking woman, Mrs. Alvarez, was holding a collections notice. David was just a file clerk, but he recognized the coding error from his own family\u2019s battles. Bypassing protocol, he spent his lunch break on the phone with the provider, patiently untangling the mistake. When he finally told her the debt was gone, the way she gripped his hand and whispered \"Gracias, mijo\" felt more validating than any diploma. He knew then his lived experience was his greatest credential.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a late night around 2002, crammed into a dark booth at a now-vanished Mission dive bar with his friends. They were all patching together lives on nonprofit salaries, sharing complaints about rent and celebrating small victories. There was no talk of stock options or IPOs, only of art, community, and purpose. In the warm haze of cheap beer and deep camaraderie, David realized he had found his family\u2014fellow lifers who loved the city for its soul, not its gold. It anchored him to San Francisco forever.\n\n5.\nJust last year, David saw a young man in the clinic waiting room, his face a mask of exhaustion, his hands full of binders, quietly weeping into his phone. David saw himself at twenty-two reflected in the man\u2019s despair. The sight struck him with the force of a physical blow. He could help this one man, but how many others were out there, alone? The vague notion of \"doing more\" sharpened into a singular, urgent mission: he had to teach them. The idea for his advocacy workshop was born in that moment of painful recognition."
