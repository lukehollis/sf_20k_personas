The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store in San Jose, he was raised on the values of diligence and pragmatism. His parents, who had sacrificed everything for his future, envisioned him as a doctor or an engineer. Jonathan, however, spent his childhood filling sketchbooks with charcoal drawings, finding more truth in shading and form than in formulas.\n\nThis conflict defined his early adulthood. He enrolled as a biology major at UC Davis to appease his parents, but his heart was in the art electives he took on the side. The turning point came during a volunteer stint at a youth center, where he instinctively used drawing to help a withdrawn child speak about a traumatic event. It was a revelation; art wasn't just expression, it was a bridge. He finished his degree and, despite his parents\u2019 initial deep disappointment, enrolled in a graduate program for Art Therapy. He proved the value of his path not with arguments, but with stories of the children he was helping.\n\nNow 37, Jonathan has built a life that honors both his heritage of service and his innate passion. He lives in a small but sunny apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose blend of cultures and proximity to Golden Gate Park feels like home. His daily 2.8-mile bicycle commute is a meditative ritual, taking him through the park\u2019s foggy mornings to his work at a local social services agency. There, he works with children and adolescents, using paint, clay, and charcoal to help them navigate anxieties and traumas they cannot otherwise articulate.\n\nHis social life is a small, warm circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow therapists, artists, and cycling buddies. Evenings often involve cooking simple, flavorful Korean dishes he learned from his mother, or meeting a friend for a beer at a low-key neighborhood bar. Jonathan is content but not complacent. His dream is to one day open his own community art therapy studio in a San Francisco neighborhood, a non-profit space offering free creative healing to underserved youth\u2014a perfect synthesis of his parents\u2019 practicality and his own artistic soul."

He sketched his father\u2019s work-worn hands on a brown paper bag with a piece of charcoal. His father found him, not with anger, but a deep, weary sigh that held all of his hopes for a different future. In that silence, Jonathan learned to nurture his art in the quiet spaces, a secret language his parents\u2019 pragmatism couldn't yet understand.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, at a youth center in Davis. A small boy, mute with trauma, had refused to speak for weeks. On a whim, Jonathan slid a sketchbook and charcoal towards him. The boy drew a house, scribbling furiously over one window until the paper tore. He pointed at the hole and whispered, \"He gets in there.\" In that instant, Jonathan felt his entire future click into place. Art wasn't an escape from the real world; it was the only way in. This was his path.\n\n3.\nIt was a phone call with his mother when he was 28. He\u2019d just finished telling her about a teenage girl who, through clay work, had started processing her grief. There was a long pause. Then his mother said, in Korean, \u201cYou are a good son. You heal people in your own way.\u201d The words were simple, but they landed with the weight of absolution. The years of quiet disappointment dissolved, replaced by a warmth that felt like coming home. His world was finally whole.\n\n4.\nJust last year, on his commute. The fog in Golden Gate Park was so dense it felt like riding through a cloud. He rounded a curve near the Conservatory of Flowers, and a lone coyote stood silently on the path before vanishing into the white. The city was muted, dreamlike. In that moment of profound stillness and unexpected wildness, he felt a deep, anchoring peace. This ride, this park, this city\u2014it wasn't just a place he lived. It was his sanctuary.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, a non-verbal teenager he\u2019d worked with for a year suddenly grabbed a paintbrush. Using only black and a shocking slash of yellow, she painted a jagged line that perfectly articulated her silent rage. She looked at him, her eyes clear for the first time. He saw not just her breakthrough, but the blueprint for his future. The need for a dedicated space for this exact kind of healing became a palpable, urgent mission, no longer just a distant dream."
