She lives in a renovated apartment directly above Alba, the upscale North Beach restaurant she manages, a perk that has defined her existence in San Francisco.\n\nRaised in a quiet Chicago suburb by practical-minded parents, Sarah was an outlier, choosing to study Art History. She imagined a life spent in the hushed halls of museums, but graduation led to the harsh reality of unpaid internships and a crushing sense of impracticality. To pay rent, she took a job waiting tables at a high-end bistro and, to her surprise, found her calling. The frantic, coordinated dance of a dinner service, the an-ticipation of a guest's needs, the curation of an experience\u2014it was a different kind of art, one that was immediate and alive.\n\nShe followed a serious boyfriend to San Francisco a decade ago. The relationship eventually dissolved, but Sarah\u2019s love affair with the city\u2019s vibrant, demanding culinary scene had just begun. She worked her way up from server to floor manager, eventually landing the general manager position at Alba. When the owners offered her the newly finished apartment upstairs, she felt she had finally arrived.\n\nAt 40, her days are a seamless blend of personal and professional. Mornings start with coffee and inventory reports on her laptop, overlooking Washington Square Park. Her staff is her family, their triumphs and dramas her own. Evenings are a blur of controlled chaos, solving problems with a calm authority honed over years. Her social life consists of regulars who have become friends and late-night drinks with other industry folk. She is respected and capable, but sometimes, in the quiet after the last table has left, she feels the weight of a life so completely fused to her job. Her dream is no longer about interpreting the old masters; it\u2019s about creating something of her own\u2014a small, intimate wine bar in a quieter neighborhood, a place where the art is in the conversation and the perfect glass of Pinot Noir."
