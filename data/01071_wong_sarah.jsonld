            "value": "Sarah Wong is a product of San Francisco, born not in a glimmering downtown hospital but in a modest one near the fog-laced avenues of the Outer Richmond. A second-generation Chinese-American, her childhood was scored by the clang of the N-Judah streetcar and the multilingual chatter along Irving Street. Her parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, poured their life savings into a small neighborhood hardware store. Sarah spent her youth stocking shelves and watching her father patiently explain the difference between toggle and molly bolts, learning early lessons in community service and the city's quiet economic pressures.\n\nThis experience fueled her academic path. A standout student at Lowell High School, she went on to UC Berkeley, initially drawn to architecture before realizing her passion wasn't in designing buildings, but in shaping the policies that allowed them to be built for everyone. A Master of Public Policy from Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School followed. Her early career was a trial by fire in a city supervisor's office, where her idealism was quickly tempered by the brutal realities of San Francisco politics. Frustrated by the glacial pace of change, she moved to a non-profit think tank, believing she could have a greater impact by shaping the conversation around urban development from the outside.\n\nNow 38, Sarah\u2019s world is contained within her rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, just blocks from where she grew up. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of moving from her small kitchen to her desk overlooking a shared garden. A key turning point was the pandemic; while she embraced remote work, the isolation has sharpened her anxieties about the city's fraying social fabric. Her days are a blur of data analysis, policy briefs on housing density, and Zoom calls with city officials. She breaks up the solitude with long, pensive walks through Golden Gate Park or by grabbing dim sum on Clement Street, a comforting taste of her past.\n\nSarah\u2019s personal life is quiet; long work hours have often sidelined romance, but she maintains a fierce loyalty to a small group of friends from college. Her connection to San Francisco is a complicated love affair\u2014she\u2019s deeply devoted to its soul yet professionally obsessed with its dysfunctions. Her greatest hope is to see one of her key housing proposals adopted, to build a tangible legacy in the city that shaped her. More privately, she dreams of a future where she feels less like an analyst of the city and more like a participant in a thriving community, the kind she remembers from her father\u2019s hardware store."
