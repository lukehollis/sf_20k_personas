The daughter of a high school history teacher and a nurse, she was raised in a home filled with books and a deep appreciation for the narratives of the past. While her peers were focused on the future, Sarah was captivated by the ghosts of what came before, a passion that led her to pursue a history degree at a small liberal arts college.\n\nCalifornia was a deliberate escape, a search for a city with more layers than the one she\u2019d known. She arrived in the Bay Area for graduate school at San Jose State, earning her Master of Library and Information Science. It was there she met David Wong, a charismatic architecture student. Their connection was immediate, a whirlwind romance built on late-night study sessions and a shared love for exploring San Francisco's hidden corners. They married young. For a decade, she was Sarah Wong, a name she grew into and cherished. The divorce, five years ago, was an amicable but profound fracture. They had simply grown into two different people. Choosing to keep the name was a quiet act of preservation\u2014a nod to a significant chapter of her own personal history.\n\nToday, Sarah lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, the scent of saltwater and eucalyptus often drifting through her window. Her 2.1-mile commute on the 38-Geary MUNI bus is a daily ritual, a time for reading or simply watching the city wake up. As a Community History Project Manager, she spends her days digitizing oral histories, curating photo archives of demolished buildings, and ensuring the stories of the city\u2019s diverse neighborhoods aren't lost to gentrification.\n\nHer life is one of curated contentment. Evenings are for yoga classes, dinners with a tight-knit circle of friends, and walks in Golden Gate Park. The divorce left a scar, but it also focused her purpose. Sarah\u2019s dream is to secure funding for an interactive, map-based digital archive of San Francisco\u2019s \"ghosts\"\u2014lost businesses, forgotten communities, and untold stories. She preserves the city's memory, and in doing so, has built a life that is uniquely and profoundly her own."

Standing above the ghostly foundations of the Sutro Baths, she felt the city\u2019s deep, layered past physically present around her. It was a profound sense of arrival, a feeling that she hadn't just moved to a city, but into a story. That day, California stopped being an escape and became her chosen history, the one she would actively inhabit and explore.\n\n2.\nIt was a dusty afternoon in a Tenderloin building slated for demolition. David, then just a brilliant architecture student, pointed out the ghost marks of old walls and traced the faded grandeur on a tiled entryway. He spoke of a building\u2019s life, its memories held in the structure. In that moment, watching dust motes dance in the light, her love for history entwined with her budding love for him. Their connection was forged there, in a shared reverence for the stories that places hold long after people are gone.\n\n3.\nThe divorce wasn\u2019t a single fight but a quiet conversation over two cooling mugs of tea in their Richmond district kitchen. No raised voices, just the shared, heartbreaking acknowledgment that a chasm had quietly formed between them over the years. Sarah remembers the strange lack of anger, replaced by a deep, historical sorrow. It felt like archiving the end of an era, not a personal failure. That acceptance allowed her to preserve the good parts of their story, including the name she had come to call her own.\n\n4.\nAbout a year after David moved out, she was riding the 38-Geary home on a rainy Tuesday. Looking through the streaked window at the neon signs blurring into the wet pavement, she was hit not by loneliness, but by a quiet, forceful contentment. This bus route, this foggy neighborhood, this life of curated solitude\u2014it was all hers, built entirely by her. The feeling was a revelation, the moment she realized she was no longer one half of a whole, but a complete and self-sufficient person.\n\n5.\nAt work, she was digitizing an oral history of a woman who grew up in the Fillmore before redevelopment. As the woman\u2019s crackling voice described the precise location of her childhood home, now a featureless stretch of sidewalk, an idea struck Sarah with the force of a historical discovery. A static archive wasn\u2019t enough. People needed to see the ghosts on the map. In that specific, poignant story of loss, her personal mission found its true form: to create a living, interactive atlas of San Francisco\u2019s memory."
