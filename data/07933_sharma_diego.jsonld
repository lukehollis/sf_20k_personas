Raised in Hayward by his Mexican-American father, a carpenter, and his Indian-American mother, a librarian, Diego grew up between two cultures and with a deep appreciation for the tangible world. His childhood was spent exploring the East Bay hills, fostering a quiet fascination with the resilience of nature clinging to the edges of urban sprawl.\n\nWhile his parents hoped for a more traditional career, Diego found his purpose at UC Berkeley, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science. A transformative internship with the Golden Gate National Recreation Area was his key turning point. He realized he didn\u2019t have to leave the city to work with nature; he could become a steward for the wildness that existed within it. This experience solidified his career path, steering him away from abstract policy and toward hands-on fieldwork.\n\nThis led to his current role as an Environmental Technician. The 0.0-mile commute is no data error; he lives in a small, spartan staff apartment nestled within the Presidio. His days begin with the cry of a hawk, not an alarm clock. He spends his hours monitoring water quality in restored streams, tracking native plant growth, and removing invasive species. His work is a solitary, meditative practice, punctuated by interactions with dog walkers and curious tourists.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, revolving around a tight-knit circle of fellow environmentalists and friends from college. They meet for weekly climbing sessions at Mission Cliffs or grab beers in the Richmond District, where he can briefly shed his role as a park guardian and just be a 25-year-old. He is currently single, finding his unique lifestyle a difficult one to share.\n\nDiego\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeper than most. He knows the city by its watersheds and migration patterns. His dream is to lead a major habitat restoration project, reintroducing a species that hasn\u2019t been seen in the city for a century. For Diego, home isn't just an address; it's a living ecosystem he is sworn to protect."
