His father was a union electrician and his mother a school secretary; they valued stability and a steady trade. Liam\u2019s decision to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History was a quiet act of rebellion, a nod to a sensitive, scholastic side his family didn\u2019t quite understand. He rarely mentions his degree now, feeling it belongs to a different man.\n\nUpon graduating, the romance of curating galleries collided with the reality of unpaid internships and a mountain of student debt. He took a waiting job at a high-end Boston bistro to make ends meet and discovered an unexpected calling. He thrived in the controlled chaos of a busy dinner service, appreciating the choreography of the staff and the immediate gratification of a perfectly executed evening. The restaurant became his new gallery, and a positive guest experience his masterpiece.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco a decade ago, seeking a break from his East Coast past. After proving his mettle in a few city restaurants, he landed the manager position at \"Cypress Table,\" an upscale bistro in Hayes Valley. The offer included a key turning point: a small but private apartment directly above the restaurant. His commute instantly became 0.0 miles, and his life became inextricably woven with his work.\n\nLiam\u2019s days are a structured rhythm. He wakes to the morning prep sounds from the kitchen below, spends afternoons handling inventory and staff schedules, and commands the floor with a calm authority from 5 PM until closing. His social life consists mainly of his loyal staff and a few regulars he shares a post-shift drink with. A significant past relationship crumbled under the weight of his demanding schedule, a quiet heartbreak that reinforced his commitment to his work.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. He is the unofficial mayor of his block in Hayes Valley, knowing every shop owner and the daily dramas of the street. His long-dormant dream has reshaped itself: he no longer envisions curating art, but owning a small, intimate wine bar in the neighborhood. A place of his own, where every detail is perfectly chosen\u2014a final, curated exhibition of a life dedicated to hospitality."
