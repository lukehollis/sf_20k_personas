Raised by a pharmacist father and a high school math teacher, his upbringing was one of pragmatism and predictable futures. He was pushed toward a stable career, enrolling at UC Davis with an undeclared major that was meant to become Economics. However, a required Art History elective in his sophomore year proved to be a profound turning point. The world of Abstract Expressionism and the defiant energy of the Dadaists felt more real and vital to him than any supply-and-demand curve. Against his family\u2019s gentle but persistent advice, he declared his major in Art History.\n\nUpon graduating, he fled the Central Valley\u2019s heat and sensibilities for the foggy embrace of San Francisco. After months of working in a cafe and applying for any position remotely related to the arts, he landed an internship at a small, independent gallery nestled just off Columbus Avenue. The pay was negligible, but the opportunity was everything. His passion and meticulous nature impressed the owner, a formidable woman in her late 60s, who eventually offered him a full-time Gallery Assistant position and a small studio apartment above the gallery itself\u2014explaining his zero-mile commute.\n\nNow, Ethan\u2019s days are a quiet rhythm of cataloging new pieces, handling client inquiries, and meticulously arranging lighting for upcoming shows. His life is an immersion in art; he wakes to the smell of oil paints from a neighboring artist\u2019s studio and falls asleep after long nights spent helping hang a new exhibition. His social circle is a tight-knit group of artists, writers, and fellow gallery workers who understand the city\u2019s trade-off: sacrificing financial security for creative purpose.\n\nWhile he loves his work, he aspires to be more than an assistant. Ethan dreams of becoming a full-fledged curator, discovering and championing emerging Bay Area artists who are being priced out of the city they help define. He sees his future not in a larger institution, but in a space of his own\u2014a gallery that is as much a community hub as a place of commerce, a small beacon of defiant creativity in the heart of San Francisco."
