A second-generation Chinese-American, she grew up in the ground-floor apartment of the same two-story home she lives in today. Her parents, who ran a bustling laundromat on Taraval Street, worked tirelessly, instilling in Mei Ling a profound sense of duty and the expectation that she would pursue a stable, lucrative career.\n\nFollowing their dream, Mei Ling attended UC Berkeley, dutifully enrolling in the Economics program. She found the world of macroeconomic theory and financial modeling to be sterile and isolating. The turning point came during her junior year when, needing an easy elective, she took an introductory-level child development course that required volunteer hours. She spent two afternoons a week at a campus daycare, and within a month, she felt more at home amongst the joyous chaos of toddlers than she ever had in a lecture hall. The world of finger paints, scraped knees, and story time felt honest and vital.\n\nAfter graduating with her bachelor's in Economics\u2014a credential she earned for her parents\u2014Mei Ling immediately enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program for an Early Childhood Education teaching credential. Her parents were initially disappointed, but their skepticism softened when Mei Ling, using her inheritance from her grandmother, converted the ground floor of their family home into a licensed in-home preschool, \u201cSunset Sprouts.\u201d\n\nNow 38, Mei Ling\u2019s commute is a walk down the stairs. Her days are a whirlwind of circle time, mediating disputes over toy dinosaurs, and wiping away tears. She is the beloved \u201cAuntie Mei\u201d to a dozen neighborhood children. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her work; she shares coffee with parents during drop-off and has become a trusted confidante. Her closest friend is the owner of the corner bakery, another local woman forging her own path.\n\nMei Ling\u2019s dream isn\u2019t expansion or wealth; it\u2019s continuity. She hopes to one day create a small scholarship fund to reserve a spot at Sunset Sprouts for a low-income family. Watching her former \u201csprouts\u201d thrive in elementary school is her greatest reward. She isn\u2019t just a teacher living in San Francisco; she is a vital anchor in her community, nurturing the city\u2019s next generation from the heart of the home where she, herself, grew up."
