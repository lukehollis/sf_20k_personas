Raised in Fremont by Indian immigrant parents who sacrificed everything for stability, his path seemed pre-written. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a pharmacist, encouraged a future in a similarly practical field. Arjun complied, earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from San Jose State, a sensible choice that promised a secure future. He spent three years post-graduation in a downtown financial district office, analyzing data for a consulting firm. The tidy spreadsheets and predictable career ladder felt less like a foundation and more like a cage.\n\nThe turning point came during a walk through the Mission District. He saw a sprawling, vibrant mural being painted on a warehouse wall and was struck by the raw, collaborative energy. It was everything his life was not. Within six months, he had quit his job, taken a massive pay cut, and accepted an administrative assistant position at a sprawling arts collective in Dogpatch. His parents were mystified, but Arjun had never felt more certain. He applied his business acumen to the chaotic world of art, organizing inventory, streamlining class schedules, and managing vendor relationships. He was the pragmatic scaffolding upon which creativity could flourish.\n\nNow, at 34, Arjun is the Studio Operations Manager. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his immersion; he lives in a small loft apartment carved out of the same converted warehouse he manages. His days are a blur of logistical problem-solving\u2014fixing a potter\u2019s wheel, ordering gallons of gesso, mediating studio space disputes\u2014and serene moments spent observing the artists he supports. His social life is woven into his work, consisting of a close-knit group of sculptors, printmakers, and painters who have become his chosen family.\n\nArjun doesn't dream of making his own art. His aspiration is to build a self-sustaining sanctuary for it. He hopes to secure grants to create a residency program for underrepresented artists and ensure the studio can weather San Francisco's economic storms. He found his purpose not on a canvas, but in the background, ensuring the lights stay on so others have the chance to create."
