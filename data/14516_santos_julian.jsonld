He was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, the only child of a formidable Portuguese-American fishing boat mechanic and a quiet, academic librarian of English descent. His childhood was a negotiation between worlds: the grease-stained, practical reality of his father\u2019s workshop and the hushed, intellectual order of his mother\u2019s libraries. Art became his neutral ground. While his father dismissed it as frivolous, his mother encouraged his weekend trips to the RISD Museum, where he discovered that objects could tell stories more powerfully than words.\n\nThis passion led him to an art history degree on the East Coast, but he felt pulled westward, drawn to the more experimental and less tradition-bound art scene of the Bay Area. He was accepted into the MFA in Curatorial Practice program at the California College of the Arts (CCA), a move that solidified his destiny. He arrived in San Francisco at 24 and never left, falling for the city\u2019s fusion of grit and high culture.\n\nHis career began with unpaid internships and low-level assistant roles at smaller galleries. The turning point came after his father\u2019s death. While clearing out his workshop, Julian discovered dozens of intricate, framed knot boards\u2014functional art his father had made for years without ever calling it such. This profoundly reshaped his curatorial philosophy. He began to champion artists who elevated craft, told immigrant stories, and found beauty in the functional. This new, more accessible vision propelled his career, leading to his current role as Chief Curator for a prominent contemporary arts institution downtown.\n\nToday, Julian lives in a tastefully minimalist apartment in the Mission District with his partner of ten years, Leo, a landscape architect. His daily routine is an urban ritual: a 2.8-mile bicycle commute past vibrant murals and bustling cafes, a ride that clears his mind before the demanding day of meetings, artist negotiations, and installation planning. His social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends in creative fields. He and Leo host intimate dinner parties where discussions of civic design blend with debates on the latest biennial.\n\nJulian\u2019s ambition is now focused on legacy. He dreams of acquiring a major collection that will redefine the museum\u2019s identity and launching a fellowship to support artists from working-class backgrounds, like the one his father never had. He hopes one day to finally disconnect for a month-long trip to Japan with Leo, but for now, his purpose is found in the city\u2014bridging the gap between the art world and the real world, one exhibition, and one bike ride, at a time."

It smelled of eucalyptus and damp pavement, a scent so different from Providence\u2019s salty air. A profound sense of dislocation warred with an exhilarating feeling of rightness. This city was not his father's world or his mother's, but a complex territory he could finally claim as his own. That moment wasn't just a move; it was the quiet, terrifying, and thrilling start of his own life.\n\n***\n\n2.\nWeeks after his father\u2019s funeral, while clearing the grease-scented chill of the workshop, he found them. Tucked away in a metal locker were a dozen framed knot boards\u2014monkey's fists, sheet bends, stevedore knots\u2014each a perfect, muscular sculpture. The man who dismissed art as frivolous had been making it all along. A wave of grief and sudden, piercing love washed over Julian. It was his father\u2019s hidden language. That discovery didn\u2019t just change his career; it gave it a soul, a purpose rooted in his father\u2019s hands.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe met Leo on a drizzly Saturday volunteering to build a parklet on Valencia Street. Julian was stacking salvaged wood when he noticed Leo patiently explaining the drainage needs of native grasses, his hands smudged with soil but moving with an architect\u2019s precision. They talked for hours about public space and private beauty. It was the first time he felt a connection that was both intellectual and instinctual. That day, amidst the sawdust and damp earth, his carefully curated life finally felt shared and truly whole.\n\n***\n\n4.\nAt the opening of \u201cObjects of Labor,\u201d his first major exhibition guided by his new philosophy, he watched an older Latino man in a mechanic's jacket stand before a series of welded steel sculptures. The man didn't read the wall text. He just looked at Julian and said, \u201cGood welds. Honest work.\u201d That simple, expert praise meant more than any critic\u2019s review. It was the moment the gap between his father's workshop and his gallery closed, validating that he was finally telling the right story.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his daily bike ride home, he stopped. The late sun ignited a new mural on Clarion Alley, and the artist was still there, packing her paint cans. She was young, her hands spattered with color. They didn\u2019t speak, but shared a brief, knowing nod of mutual respect. In that fleeting, wordless moment\u2014a commute interrupted by sudden beauty\u2014he felt the city\u2019s pulse as his own. It was a perfect reminder that art wasn\u2019t just in the museum; it was alive everywhere."
