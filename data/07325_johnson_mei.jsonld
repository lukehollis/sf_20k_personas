As a Regional Merchandising Director, her 0.0-mile commute ends at a custom standing desk overlooking Patricia's Green, where her world of spreadsheets, color palettes, and sales forecasts unfolds.\n\nRaised across the bay in Berkeley, Mei is the product of two distinct worlds: a pragmatic, second-generation Chinese-American mother who worked as a financial analyst, and a free-spirited Caucasian father, a tenured professor of cultural anthropology. Their home was a blend of disciplined budgeting and intellectual curiosity. From her mother, Mei learned to see the patterns in numbers; from her father, she learned to understand the stories behind human choices. This duality became the foundation of her career.\n\nAfter earning an undergraduate degree in Design Management, Mei entered the competitive world of retail. She was skilled at creating beautiful store displays but frustrated by decisions that felt arbitrary. The turning point came when a corporate directive, based on flawed data, killed her bestselling product line. That failure ignited a new ambition. She enrolled in an MBA program, determined to master the business analytics that drove the industry. Armed with her graduate degree, she returned to retail not just as a creative, but as a strategist, rising quickly to her current director role.\n\nMei\u2019s life is tightly curated. Mornings start with a pour-over from a local roaster, followed by leadership calls. Afternoons are for deep work, but she often takes \"inspiration breaks,\" walking through the neighborhood's boutiques to observe what people are truly buying. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised mainly of fellow MBA grads who share her drive. Though professionally fulfilled, she quietly yearns for a partnership that complements her ambition.\n\nHer ultimate dream is to launch her own sustainable home goods brand, a venture that would perfectly merge her parents' legacies of pragmatic design and cultural meaning. For now, San Francisco is both her home and her muse. The city\u2019s blend of data-driven tech and vibrant street style is the very essence of her work, and from her window in Hayes Valley, Mei feels perfectly positioned to direct it all."
