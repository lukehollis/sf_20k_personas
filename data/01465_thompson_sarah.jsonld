Raised in Daly City, the daughter of a Filipino immigrant mother who worked as a nurse's aide and an Irish-American father who was a union carpenter, Sarah learned the value of a dollar and relentless hard work from an early age. Watching the gleaming towers of San Francisco from her foggy neighborhood, she felt an intense pull toward the city\u2019s energy. Forgoing a traditional college path, which felt both financially out of reach and abstractly slow, she graduated high school and immediately entered the workforce, starting as a receptionist at a small property management company.\n\nIt was there she discovered her calling. Sharp, meticulously organized, and a quick study, Sarah absorbed the language of leases, zoning, and tenant improvements. She saw the immense wealth being generated in commercial real estate and became determined to carve out a place for herself. At 25, she made the pivotal move across county lines into San Francisco, landing a coveted role as a commercial real estate assistant at a major firm in the Financial District. This was her turning point\u2014leaving the familiar behind to immerse herself in the competitive heart of the city.\n\nNow 37, Sarah\u2019s life is a testament to her ambition. She lives in a compact, modern apartment in Rincon Hill, a strategic choice that allows her to walk to her office, making her commute negligible. Her days are a blur of coordinating schedules for high-powered brokers, preparing pitch decks, and managing sensitive client data. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few close friends\u2014a mix from her Daly City past and work colleagues\u2014with whom she enjoys weekend hikes in Marin or trying new restaurants in Hayes Valley. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, partially due to her intense focus on her career, leaving her single and cautiously independent.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is professional and deeply personal. She understands the city not through its landmarks, but through its commercial arteries and a building\u2019s cap rate. Her ultimate dream is to get her broker's license within the next two years. She isn't just an assistant; she is an apprentice, quietly studying the masters she serves. Her aspiration is to one day see her own name on a sign, having brokered a deal that changes the city\u2019s skyline, a final, definitive statement that the girl from Daly City has truly arrived."
