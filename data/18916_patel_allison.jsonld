Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a nurturing elementary school teacher mother, her upbringing was a study in stability and Midwestern sensibility. She attended Ohio State University, earning a Bachelor's in Business Administration, a practical degree chosen for its promise of a secure future.\n\nLured by the magnetic pull of opportunity in the late 90s, Allison moved to San Francisco. She started as a junior analyst at a large bank, quickly finding her niche in real estate finance. It was here she met Rohan Patel, a charismatic architect. They married when she was 28, and as she built her career, she built a life with him. Her professional ascent was steady and hard-earned, moving from analyst to manager, known for her sharp mind and unwavering composure in high-stakes negotiations.\n\nThe pivotal turning point came in her late thirties. As Allison was being promoted to Director, the chasm between her and Rohan\u2019s dreams became undeniable. He longed for kids and a quiet suburban life in Marin; she was deeply entwined with her career and the vibrant, demanding pulse of the city. Their amicable divorce left her with a successful career, a network of professional contacts, and a name she kept, as \"Allison Patel\" was the identity she had built in the finance world.\n\nToday, Allison\u2019s life is a curated picture of urban success. She lives in a chic Hayes Valley condo, its minimalist decor a stark contrast to the complex portfolios she manages. Her day begins with a pre-dawn Pilates class before an Uber whisks her the 4.5 miles to her Financial District office. Her work is her domain\u2014a world of strategy, risk assessment, and multi-million dollar assets. Evenings often involve networking dinners or quiet meals at a favorite local bistro.\n\nThough she has achieved the financial security her parents championed, Allison quietly yearns for a different kind of asset. She dreams of leveraging her expertise to start a small consulting firm, one that allows her more personal freedom. Her connection to San Francisco is no longer just about ambition, but about the life she has forged on her own terms, wondering what the next, more personal, chapter will hold."
