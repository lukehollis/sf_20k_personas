            "value": "Daniel Cohen is a man built from the two San Franciscos. His story began 44 years ago in the Mission District, the product of an unlikely romance between his father, a Jewish-American bookseller with a passion for socialist theory, and his mother, a first-generation immigrant from Jalisco, Mexico, whose faith was as vibrant as her cooking. Growing up, Daniel\u2019s world was a blend of his father\u2019s quiet intellectualism and his mother\u2019s boisterous warmth. He learned to be practical, fixing leaky faucets and patching drywall in their aging rent-controlled apartment while his friends\u2019 families were slowly priced out of the neighborhood.\n\nHe was never one for academics. While his father hoped he\u2019d attend a four-year university, Daniel found his calling in the tangible world of systems and mechanics. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Electrical Systems Technology. His career was a steady climb through the city\u2019s guts: maintaining the temperamental heating in old Victorians, then upgrading the wiring in downtown office buildings.\n\nThe turning point came a decade ago when a new, gleaming residential tower went up in Mission Bay, filled almost exclusively with tech employees. They needed an on-site Facilities Maintenance Technician, someone reliable who could live in the designated staff apartment. Daniel took the job, and his commute instantly became zero miles. His life is now contained within the building\u2019s clean, climate-controlled walls.\n\nHe is the ghost in the machine of modern luxury. His days are a routine of responding to maintenance tickets: fixing a glitch in a smart-home system in a $2 million condo, unclogging a garbage disposal, or ensuring the rooftop infinity pool\u2019s pump is running perfectly. He is on a first-name basis with residents who make ten times his salary, offering them a friendly, professional smile while remaining an invisible part of their world.\n\nDaniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound but layered with melancholy. He sees the remnants of his city from his apartment window but feels disconnected from the street-level life he once knew. His dream is simple: to save enough to buy a small duplex in the East Bay, a place with a garage for a proper workshop. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration for a man who maintains the shiny facade of a city that feels less and less like his own."
