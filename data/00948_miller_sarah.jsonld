            "value": "Sarah Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laden, working-class grit. Born and raised in the Dogpatch before it was a trendy enclave of breweries and artist lofts, her childhood was defined by the sounds of the shipyard and the scent of salt from the bay. Her father was a longshoreman, her mother a bookkeeper for a local shipping company. They were practical people who valued a steady paycheck over ambitious dreams, a lesson Sarah absorbed deeply.\n\nFormal education was never a priority. After graduating from high school with little fanfare, Sarah immediately entered the workforce. She found a job on the packing line at a heritage sourdough bakery, a neighborhood institution that had been churning out loaves for a century. It was demanding, repetitive work, but she was reliable. Over three decades, she learned every facet of the business\u2014from the temperament of the starters to the mechanics of the industrial ovens. Her quiet competence and no-nonsense approach saw her rise from the floor to the role of Production Supervisor.\n\nSarah\u2019s life has been steady, not seismic. A brief, early marriage in her twenties to a neighborhood boy ended amicably when he decided to chase a more affordable life in Oregon; Sarah, however, could never imagine leaving. Her real family became the crew at the bakery. She is the unflappable center of the operation, the one who solves logistical nightmares and knows who needs a shift covered because their kid is sick.\n\nHer commute is a three-block walk from her small, rent-controlled apartment to the bakery. Her days start before sunrise, the smell of baking bread her alarm clock. She moves through the facility with a clipboard and an eye for detail, a quiet authority respected by all. Her social life is a small circle of old friends, other natives who remember the city before the tech booms. They meet for beers at old-school pubs, not cocktails at rooftop bars.\n\nNow 50, Sarah\u2019s primary aspiration is a quiet one: to not be priced out of the only home she\u2019s ever known. She watches the luxury condos rise around her with a sense of melancholic resignation. Her dream isn\u2019t to travel the world or start a new venture, but to simply be able to afford retirement in her Dogpatch apartment, to see her bakery family thrive, and to remain a living part of the city\u2019s authentic, crusty soul."
