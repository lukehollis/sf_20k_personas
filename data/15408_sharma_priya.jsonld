As the daughter of immigrants from Mumbai, she watched them work tirelessly, building a life while navigating a new world. They hoped she would pursue a stable, lucrative career in medicine or engineering, but Priya was more drawn to the social fabric of her community. She saw the quiet struggles of customers and the growing disparity in the Bay Area, which fueled a desire to understand systems, not just symptoms.\n\nThis led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Public Policy. The turning point came during her junior year while volunteering at an Oakland homeless shelter. The experience was raw and transformative, replacing abstract theories with human faces and stories. It solidified her commitment to public service, setting her on a direct collision course with her parents\u2019 practical dreams, but aligning perfectly with her own sense of purpose.\n\nAfter graduation, Priya began her career at a housing non-profit before landing a role with the City of San Francisco. Now, at 35, she is a Program Manager for the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. Her days are a triage of managing budgets, navigating bureaucracy, and advocating for programs she believes in, even when progress feels agonizingly slow.\n\nHer 3.8-mile commute on the 14-Mission bus is a daily immersion in the city she serves\u2014a cross-section of its vibrancy and its crises. She lives in a prized rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Mission District, a neighborhood whose art and energy she loves, but where the realities of her work are visible on every corner. Her routine is disciplined: a morning run in Dolores Park to clear her head, followed by a demanding workday, and evenings spent decompressing with a close-knit group of friends or cooking traditional Indian meals that connect her to her roots.\n\nPriya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a promotion or a higher salary; it's the hope of seeing tangible change. She aspires to a San Francisco where the programs she manages create visible pathways off the streets, bridging the gap between the city\u2019s progressive ideals and its lived reality."

A woman, whose face she knew but name she didn\u2019t, came to the counter with baby formula, her hands trembling as she counted out loose change. She was short. Priya watched her father simply nod, bag the formula, and say, \u201cPay me next time.\u201d The quiet transfer of dignity, not just groceries, settled deep in her bones. It was the first policy she ever understood: community is a form of currency you don\u2019t keep score of.\n\n2.\nThe air in her parents\u2019 kitchen was thick with the scent of cardamom chai and unspoken disappointment. She was 22, clutching her Berkeley diploma, explaining why she was taking a low-paying non-profit job instead of applying to med school. Her mother\u2019s tears were a quiet river of worry for her future; her father\u2019s silence was a wall of betrayed dreams. In that moment, choosing her path felt like both a betrayal and an act of profound self-love, a painful severing that was necessary to become herself.\n\n3.\nIt wasn\u2019t a lecture or a textbook, but the raw, chapped hands of an elderly man named Walter at the Oakland shelter. She was 20, a volunteer, tasked with sorting donated clothes. Walter just needed dry socks. As she handed him a thick wool pair, he looked at her and said, \u201cI used to be a mailman. Walked miles a day.\u201d The simple, humanizing detail shattered her academic distance forever. Homelessness was no longer a concept; it was Walter, who once had a route and a purpose.\n\n4.\nThe first time she handed a key to a client felt like holding lightning. It was for a small SRO unit, but after eighteen months of applications and setbacks, it was a palace. The woman, a survivor of domestic violence, didn\u2019t weep with joy but let out a long, shuddering breath, a sound of profound exhaustion finally ending. Priya felt a fierce, bright surge of victory. Walking back to her office, however, the glow faded, replaced by the heavy knowledge of the hundreds still on her waiting lists.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a morning run, she paused at the top of Dolores Park. The sun was rising, painting the downtown skyline in hues of impossible orange and pink. It was breathtakingly beautiful. Then her eyes drifted down to a row of tents huddled near the tennis courts, their occupants still asleep. The raw contradiction\u2014this city of staggering beauty and staggering pain, held in a single glance\u2014solidified her resolve. It wasn\u2019t a source of despair, but her life\u2019s work, contained in one perfect, heartbreaking view."
