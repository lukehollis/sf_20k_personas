Born in Oakland to a genetics researcher from Mumbai and an American literature professor, his name itself tells a story of blended worlds. His mother, widowed young, remarried a pragmatic software engineer named Anderson, who raised Rohan as his own. Growing up in the East Bay, Rohan inherited his mother\u2019s deep-seated immigrant drive for stability and his stepfather\u2019s logical, problem-solving mindset.\n\nHis first love, however, was history. He devoured tales of empires and economies at UC Berkeley, envisioning a life in academia. But a visit to his family in Mumbai during a monsoon-flooded recession became a turning point. Surrounded by brilliant relatives struggling financially, the allure of a professor\u2019s salary waned. Pragmatism won. Rohan pivoted, channeling his intellect into an MBA from Stanford, mastering the language of capital with the same fervor he once reserved for ancient texts. He excelled, quickly rising as a management consultant who could diagnose a company's financial ills with surgical precision.\n\nNow, at 45, Rohan\u2019s world is his sleek Hayes Valley condo, where his commute is a ten-step walk from his espresso machine to his standing desk. The efficiency is a fortress he built around himself, especially after a quiet, amicable divorce five years ago. His days are a disciplined sequence of market analysis, international Zoom calls, and crafting strategy decks. He solves billion-dollar problems for faceless corporations, his home a silent testament to his success.\n\nYet, the history major still resides within him. San Francisco is his chosen home, not just for its proximity to capital, but for its layers of history and its immediate access to the wildness of the Marin Headlands, where he hikes every weekend to escape his structured life. His social circle is small and curated\u2014a monthly poker game with other tech and finance veterans. Lately, a quiet aspiration has taken root: to pivot one last time. He dreams of leaving consulting, using his wealth not for another investment, but to fund historical documentary projects, finally bridging the gap between the man he became and the boy who was fascinated by the stories of the past."

His uncle, a PhD in physics, sat hunched over a thin ledger, his face etched with worry. In that moment, watching brilliance buckle under financial strain, the romantic notion of academia evaporated. It wasn't a choice, but a conclusion. He would master the language of money, not for greed, but for the bulwark of security his family deserved.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe was 32, closing his first nine-figure restructuring deal. The celebratory dinner was at a Michelin-starred restaurant he couldn't have afforded a year prior. He remembered the weight of the wine glass, the murmur of praise from senior partners. He\u2019d won. He\u2019d solved the puzzle. But walking back to his empty apartment, the intellectual thrill faded, leaving only a sterile silence. He had achieved the stability he craved, but it felt like he had just perfected a beautiful, intricate, and utterly meaningless machine.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe remembers signing the divorce papers at their dining table five years ago. There were no tears, just his ex-wife's sad smile. \"We optimized our lives apart,\" she\u2019d said, and the consulting term resonated with a terrible clarity. The split was amicable, a logical dissolution of a partnership that no longer yielded dividends. The quiet in the condo after she left wasn't peaceful; it was the sound of a problem efficiently solved, leaving a void where warmth used to be, and it cemented his preference for structured solitude.\n\n***\n\n4.\nWalking through the Financial District a few years back, he saw a brass medallion on the sidewalk marking the 1849 shoreline. He paused, imagining the Gold Rush ships rotting in the mud beneath the glass towers where he consulted. The past wasn't just in books; it was a foundation, buried but present. He felt a sudden, sharp longing\u2014not just to know the story, but to tell it. A hunger no balance sheet could satisfy. It was the first inkling of his final pivot.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast winter, on a ridge in the Marin Headlands, the fog finally broke. Below, San Francisco gleamed like a circuit board, a system he knew how to manipulate. But facing the wild Pacific, with the wind tearing at his jacket, he felt a profound disconnect. He was an expert on the circuit board, but his soul was out here in the wind. He realized he didn't want to just solve another company's problems. He wanted to map the unseen coastlines of history."
