Born in Bangalore to a physics professor father and a librarian mother, her childhood was a quiet but intellectually vibrant one. She excelled in mathematics and spatial reasoning, spending hours drawing intricate cityscapes rather than playing with dolls. Her path was clear early on: she would build things that lasted. After earning her undergraduate degree from a prestigious Indian university, she set her sights on America, drawn by the world-renowned civil engineering program at UC Berkeley.\n\nShe arrived in the Bay Area in 1988, a bright-eyed graduate student ready to absorb everything. The turning point of her life struck a year later, on October 17, 1989. Experiencing the violent shudder of the Loma Prieta earthquake from her Berkeley apartment was a terrifying, clarifying moment. The abstract theories of seismic stress and structural failure became visceral realities. From that day forward, her academic work and career became a singular mission: to understand and fortify cities against the power of the earth.\n\nAfter graduating with her Master's, Priya joined a leading San Francisco engineering firm, specializing in seismic retrofitting and sustainable infrastructure. She met her husband, Rohan, a data scientist, at a Diwali celebration in the city. They married and settled in a beautiful Edwardian home in Noe Valley, raising a daughter a few years later.\n\nNow 52, Priya is a Senior Civil Engineer who transitioned to a fully remote role during the pandemic and never looked back. Her \"commute\" is a few steps to her meticulously organized home office, which overlooks her garden. Her days begin with a brisk walk up to Twin Peaks for a panoramic view of the skyline she has spent her life protecting. Her work is her passion, a complex puzzle of load-bearing calculations and material science that safeguards thousands of lives. With her daughter now in college back on the East Coast, Priya and Rohan have rediscovered their city, enjoying evenings at the SFJAZZ Center and exploring hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Her aspiration is no longer to climb a corporate ladder, but to mentor the next generation of female engineers and perhaps consult on international projects, sharing the hard-won knowledge of building for a world that is always in motion."

In her Berkeley apartment in 1989, the violent shaking threw her books\u2014her precious theories on structural integrity\u2014to the floor. It was a terrifying, 15-second lesson in humility. The abstract equations of seismic stress became a visceral force trying to tear her world apart. That terror didn't break her; it forged her. In the sudden, ringing silence that followed, her academic interest crystallized into a life's mission: she would build things that could withstand the earth\u2019s fury.\n\n2.\nAt a Diwali celebration in the mid-90s, the air was thick with the scent of marigolds and cardamom. Priya, usually more comfortable with blueprints than parties, felt a bit lost. Then she saw Rohan, a data scientist whose smile seemed to defy all logic and structure. He talked about patterns in data, but all she saw was a warmth that felt like home. A different kind of blueprint began to form in her mind, not of steel and concrete, but of a shared life. It was a connection that grounded her more profoundly than any foundation she could design.\n\n3.\nStanding across the Embarcadero in the early 2000s, she looked at the newly retrofitted Ferry Building, its grand clock tower resolute against the sky. Her team had spent years on the project, pouring over calculations of shear walls and base isolators. Seeing it finished, gleaming in the sun, she felt a quiet, immense pride. It wasn\u2019t just a structure; it was a promise kept to the city and to the terrified young woman she had been in 1989. This building, and the thousands of people inside it, were now safer because of her.\n\n4.\nThe last hug at the SFO gate felt like letting go of a critical load-bearing pillar. As her daughter walked toward her college life on the East Coast just a few years ago, the carefully constructed architecture of Priya\u2019s daily life suddenly felt cavernous and quiet. The pride was immense, but the silence in their Noe Valley home was deafening. This profound shift forced her and Rohan not to rebuild what was, but to design something new, rediscovering the city and each other in the newfound space.\n\n5.\nNow, in the pre-dawn chill atop Twin Peaks, her daily walk is a ritual. The city she spent her life protecting is laid out below, a silent testament to her work. As the sun first hits the Transamerica Pyramid, she doesn\u2019t see just a skyline; she sees the invisible network of steel, bolts, and dampers she helped fortify. This panoramic view isn\u2019t one of conquest, but of quiet stewardship. It\u2019s a daily reminder that her purpose is no longer about building higher, but ensuring what\u2019s already there endures."
