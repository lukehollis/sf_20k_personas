The daughter of ambitious software engineers who settled in Daly City, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a structured path toward a predictable future. Her parents, having achieved their own American dream through tireless work in the tech sector, envisioned a similar, respectable path for her: business, finance, something stable and lucrative.\n\nTo appease them, Sarah earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College. She spent two soul-crushing years as an administrative assistant at a downtown startup, her days a blur of spreadsheets and scheduling meetings about things she couldn't bring herself to care about. The turning point came during a volunteer weekend at a local community center. While helping in the childcare room, surrounded by the joyful chaos of finger painting and story time, she felt a profound sense of purpose she had never experienced in a cubicle.\n\nAgainst her parents\u2019 wishes, she quit her office job and took a position as a Preschool Teacher Assistant. The decision created a quiet but persistent rift with her family, who saw it as a step backward. For Sarah, it was the first time she had ever truly chosen her own life.\n\nHer zero-mile commute is a rare stroke of San Francisco luck: she lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, directly above the small, private preschool where she works. Her days start with the sound of children arriving and are filled with patching scraped knees, mediating disputes over toy blocks, and celebrating the successful scribbling of a letter 'S'. Her life is contained within a few blocks \u2013 walks in Golden Gate Park, groceries from the corner market, and dim sum on Clement Street with a small circle of friends, most of whom are also clinging to the city they love.\n\nAt 34, Sarah\u2019s dreams are not of wealth, but of sustainability. She hopes to one day earn her full teaching credential and lead her own classroom. More than that, she hopes her parents will eventually see the value in her happiness, recognizing that nurturing the city\u2019s next generation is its own form of success."
