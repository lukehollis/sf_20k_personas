The only son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small neighborhood market, David grew up amidst the scent of dried herbs and the quiet hum of hardworking resilience. His parents envisioned a stable future for him in business or engineering, a path of clear financial security they had never known.\n\nHe tried to honor their wishes, initially enrolling in a business program at San Francisco State University. However, a pivotal family crisis during his sophomore year changed his trajectory. Watching a beloved uncle struggle with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, stigmatized and misunderstood within their community, ignited a different calling in David. He witnessed firsthand how silence and cultural barriers could devastate a person\u2019s mental health. This experience became his catalyst; he transferred programs and eventually earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, determined to bridge the exact gaps that had fractured his own family.\n\nDavid\u2019s early career was spent in the trenches of community health, working in clinics in the Mission and Tenderloin. He saw the city\u2019s deep wounds up close, dealing with trauma, addiction, and the psychological toll of poverty. While rewarding, the bureaucratic grind and emotional weight led to burnout. Several years ago, after a difficult divorce, he made a significant shift. He became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and established a private practice from a converted office in his own Inner Sunset home.\n\nNow, at 51, his life is one of deliberate quiet. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk across the hallway. His days are structured by teletherapy sessions with clients, where he offers the calm, empathetic presence he wished his uncle had. He knows the city not as a tech playground, but as a complex organism of interconnected lives. His free time is spent on long, meandering walks through Golden Gate Park or seeking out the best hand-pulled noodles in the Richmond. His dream is no longer about achievement, but about sustainability\u2014to continue his vital work without losing himself, and perhaps, to mentor a new generation of therapists who understand the soul of this ever-changing, complicated city he will always call home."

An elderly woman, Mrs. Chan, was a regular, but this time she stood silently, her eyes glassy. David\u2019s mother quietly packed a small bag of ginseng and winter melon, pressing it into the woman\u2019s hands without accepting payment. He didn't understand the exchange then, only the profound weight of unspoken sorrow and the quiet language of care. It was his first lesson in seeing the needs that hide behind a brave face.\n\n2.\nIt was a Lunar New Year dinner, sophomore year of college. His uncle, usually the life of the party, sat stone-faced, his knuckles white around his chopsticks. When a cousin made a joke, he abruptly pushed his chair back and left the room. David can still feel the suffocating silence, his parents\u2019 fearful, sidelong glances. Later, he heard them whispering about \"bad energy,\" not \"illness.\" That moment of collective denial and shame was a splinter in his soul, igniting a resolve to find the right words for what was happening.\n\n3.\nHe was 34, sitting in his beat-up Civic after a twelve-hour shift at the Mission clinic. He couldn't shake the image of a child drawing a picture of their home with bars on the windows. The sheer volume of trauma felt like a physical weight, and the mountain of paperwork on his passenger seat seemed a grotesque insult to that child's pain. He felt himself cracking under the strain, realizing he could either drown in the system or find a different way to be a lifeline. The decision wasn't a choice, but a necessity for survival.\n\n4.\nThe first autumn after the divorce felt impossibly quiet. He walked into Golden Gate Park, aimless, the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth filling the air. He found an empty bench near Stowe Lake and just watched the light fade, the city\u2019s murmur a distant hum. There was no revelation, just a slow, quiet acceptance that being alone didn't have to mean being lonely. That walk became a ritual, a way of grounding himself in the simple, reliable turning of the seasons when everything else felt uncertain.\n\n5.\nLast year, during a teletherapy session, a young client recounted telling his immigrant father about his depression for the first time. The client used a metaphor they had workshopped: a boat with a slow, invisible leak. His father, for the first time, didn't dismiss it\u2014he asked how he could help patch the hole. Seeing the relief wash over his client's face, David felt a profound, quiet click of purpose. This was it. He was helping families have the conversations his own never could."
