Her commute is a two-step journey from her bedroom to a small, sunlit office nook in her Inner Sunset flat. From here, through the sterile glow of a laptop screen, she performs a kind of emotional triage, serving as a Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital system.\n\nHer path to this role began not in California, but in the flat, predictable landscape of suburban Ohio. The only child of a quiet accountant and a mother who battled a degenerative illness for over a decade, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a masterclass in premature responsibility and navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system. She watched nurses and social workers provide her mother with a dignity that medicine alone could not. That quiet compassion became her calling. She left Ohio for UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work and leaving her old life behind like a shed skin.\n\nSarah\u2019s early career was spent in the chaotic trenches of a hospital emergency department, a high-stakes environment that both fueled and frayed her. It was also a crucible for her marriage, which eventually dissolved under the weight of shared trauma and divergent paths. The pandemic was a pivotal turning point. Forced into telehealth, she discovered a new, more sustainable way to practice. The distance provided a necessary emotional buffer, allowing her to do the work without being consumed by it.\n\nNow, at 43, her life is one of deliberate intention. Mornings begin with a walk through the cool, grey tendrils of fog in Golden Gate Park with Buster, her scruffy rescue terrier. Her social life is a small, tightly-curated circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014who gather for dinners in Cole Valley or weekend hikes in Marin. She has found a hard-won peace in San Francisco, a city that prizes reinvention. Her aspiration is no longer to save the world, but to provide a steady, anchoring presence for her clients. In the future, she dreams of transitioning to a small private practice, maybe even writing about compassionate care\u2014creating a space of healing, both for others and for herself."
