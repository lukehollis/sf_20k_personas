The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, bustling grocery store on Taraval Street, Jenny learned the language of responsibility before she learned algebra. Her childhood was a blur of stocking shelves, running the cash register, and translating for her parents, her own dreams simmering quietly beneath a surface of familial duty.\n\nHer escape was art. Accepted into the graphic design program at San Francisco State University, she felt, for the first time, that her life was truly her own. But two years in, her father\u2019s sudden illness pulled her back into the family orbit. College was put on indefinite hold as she and her mother cared for him and tried to keep the store afloat. After he passed, selling the store was a painful necessity.\n\nNeeding stability above all else, Jennifer found a role as an administrative assistant for a busy real estate firm. The work was organized and predictable, a stark contrast to the creative chaos she once craved. She excelled, her ingrained sense of duty making her an invaluable, if quiet, team member.\n\nNow at 38, Jennifer\u2019s commute is non-existent. She works remotely from the same modest two-bedroom apartment above the now-closed family store, where she lives with and cares for her aging mother. Her days are structured: a morning walk to Ocean Beach with a thermos of oolong tea, logging on at 8:30 AM sharp, and a quiet lunch. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few high school friends and weekly dim sum with her mother.\n\nBut her early aspirations have not entirely faded. After logging off from her real estate duties, she opens Adobe Illustrator. Fueled by the city lights twinkling through the fog, she spends her evenings on small freelance design projects\u2014logos for local cafes, menus for new restaurants. Her quiet dream is to one day save enough to open a small, one-woman design studio in her own neighborhood, helping the next generation of Sunset entrepreneurs build their own futures, just as she once helped her parents."
