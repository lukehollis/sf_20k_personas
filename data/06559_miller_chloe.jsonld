Raised in a small town near Mount Hood by a pragmatic engineer father and a bookish librarian mother, she spent her childhood tracing tributaries and identifying ferns. While her parents encouraged her scientific curiosity, they were quietly skeptical of her passionate, almost spiritual connection to the natural world.\n\nThis friendly friction fueled her ambition. She pursued an Environmental Science degree at UC Santa Cruz, where the coastal redwoods became her new cathedral. It was during a graduate program in Environmental Management at Yale that her path solidified. An internship placed her within a multinational corporation struggling with its environmental impact report. Chloe saw firsthand that protesting from the outside was one thing, but guiding change from the inside\u2014armed with data, policy, and financial incentives\u2014was another, more powerful tool.\n\nAfter graduation, she was recruited by a San Francisco-based consultancy. The city\u2019s progressive ideals and proximity to stunning natural landscapes felt like a perfect fit. A key turning point came three years ago when she successfully transitioned her role to be fully remote. This allowed her to ditch a stressful cross-city commute and redesign her life around her values.\n\nNow, Chloe lives in a cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not in traffic, but with a foggy morning run through Golden Gate Park. Her work consists of video calls with clients across the country and long, focused hours analyzing data and drafting sustainability strategies. Her partner, Leo, a graphic designer, shares her appreciation for a quiet, intentional life. Their social circle is small but tight, built around a shared love for weekend hikes in Marin and volunteering for park clean-up initiatives.\n\nChloe\u2019s dream is to eventually leave consulting and purchase a small parcel of land in Sonoma County. There, she hopes to apply her expertise on a micro-scale, creating a small, regenerative farm\u2014a living laboratory and a testament to the belief that has guided her entire life: that a sustainable future is not just possible, but buildable."
