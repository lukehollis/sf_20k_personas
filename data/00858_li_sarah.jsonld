Born in the Richmond District to Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery, her childhood was a blend of fragrant home-cooked meals and the damp, fog-draped streets outside. She learned early on that a city wasn't just buildings, but a network of people, commerce, and shared experience humming beneath the surface. Her parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped she would pursue medicine or law, but Sarah was captivated by the city itself.\n\nThe turning point came in 1989. As a teenager, she felt the violent shudder of the Loma Prieta earthquake. The sight of the collapsed Cypress Street Viaduct and the damage to the Marina District wasn't just a disaster; it was a visceral lesson in urban vulnerability. It ignited a passion to understand how cities work, how they break, and how they can be rebuilt stronger and more equitably. This led her to a Master's in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, a degree she pursued with a quiet, fierce determination.\n\nHer career has been a steady ascent within San Francisco's city government. Now a Senior Urban Planner, Sarah has seen her fingerprints on everything from zoning regulations for new housing developments in SoMa to the creation of pedestrian-friendly parklets. Divorced for nearly a decade, she poured her focus into her work, finding a different kind of partnership with the city she served.\n\nToday, at 52, Sarah lives in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood she admires for its successful revitalization. Her 0.0-mile commute is to a meticulously organized home office overlooking a small balcony garden. Her days are a disciplined routine: a pre-dawn walk to a local cafe for a strong tea, hours spent analyzing data and in virtual meetings, and evenings unwinding with historical documentaries or a call with her brother in Seattle. Her dream is no longer about personal advancement, but about legacy. She aspires to shepherd through a landmark affordable housing initiative and see a new public green space flourish in a concrete-heavy district\u2014tangible proof that a city, like a person, can always be thoughtfully reshaped for the better."
