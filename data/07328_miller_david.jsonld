His story began far from the Pacific, in a quiet Michigan town where the hum of a General Motors plant was the local heartbeat. The son of a lifelong assembly line worker, David grew up with grease-stained hands, inheriting a reverence for tangible, well-made things. While his peers saw the declining auto industry as a dead end, David saw the beauty in the process.\n\nHe pursued a degree in Industrial Design, hoping to bridge the gap between function and form. After graduation, feeling adrift in the Midwest's contracting job market, he took a chance and followed a college friend to San Francisco in the early 2000s. He felt alienated by the burgeoning dot-com culture, but found his footing in the city's underbelly of workshops and artist collectives. He landed a job on the production floor of a high-end custom furniture manufacturer in the Dogpatch.\n\nThis became his turning point. He thrived, his practical upbringing and design education making him a natural. He worked his way up from the floor to foreman, and eventually to Production Manager. The company offered him a rare opportunity: the live/work loft directly above the workshop. His commute became a single flight of stairs. This decision, however, solidified the end of a long-term relationship; his partner felt he was literally marrying his job.\n\nNow at 44, David\u2019s days are a familiar rhythm. He wakes to the faint scent of curing wood stain and the whir of machinery starting up below. His life is the workshop\u2014overseeing projects, solving material sourcing issues, and mentoring younger craftsmen. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of colleagues and neighbors, usually meeting for beers at a nearby brewery. He is a quiet anchor in his rapidly gentrifying Dogpatch neighborhood, a remnant of its industrial past. His dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup, but to one day buy out the current owner, ensuring the legacy of craftsmanship he has dedicated his life to continues to have a place in a city obsessed with the future."
