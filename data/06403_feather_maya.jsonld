            "value": "Maya Red Feather\u2019s name is a legacy from her parents, neo-hippie idealists who raised her on a small, off-grid homestead in Humboldt County. Her childhood was an unstructured paradise of redwood forests and communal living, rich in philosophy but lacking in practical stability. This dichotomy became starkly clear during her adolescence when she watched her mother battle severe, untreated depression. Maya felt powerless, a loving but unequipped bystander to a pain that idealism alone couldn't fix. This experience planted a seed of purpose in her: she would learn the language of healing that her parents' world couldn't provide.\n\nSeeking structure, Maya moved to the Bay Area for her education, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. She was drawn to the field\u2019s emphasis on systemic change and individual empowerment. The rigorous, evidence-based frameworks were a comforting contrast to her fluid upbringing. She specialized in medical social work, finding her calling in the high-stakes environment of a major San Francisco hospital system. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), she helps patients and their families navigate the bewildering emotional and logistical fallout of serious illness.\n\nToday, Maya lives and works in a modern studio in the Mission District. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the post-pandemic shift; she conducts nearly all her intense, emotionally demanding sessions via telehealth. Her days are a structured routine of clinical notes and digital triage. To decompress, she walks to Dolores Park or finds solace in the tactile, grounding work of a local pottery class. Her social circle is small and tight-knit, mostly other healthcare professionals who understand the need for dark humor and firm boundaries.\n\nAn SF resident by choice, Maya is deeply connected to the Mission's vibrant, resilient spirit. She finds a certain poetry in living amidst the city\u2019s contradictions\u2014its immense wealth and visible struggle. Her dream is to eventually open a small, community-focused private practice in the neighborhood, a sanctuary that blends the clinical expertise she fought for with the deep, unconditional empathy she inherited from the woods of her youth."
