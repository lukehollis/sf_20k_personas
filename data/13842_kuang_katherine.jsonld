Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a librarian mother, Katherine was a quiet, observant child, more interested in the texture of a leaf or the shifting colors of the sunset than in spreadsheets or story time. Her parents, loving but perplexed by her artistic soul, encouraged a \"sensible\" path. For Katherine, that meant studying Art History at UC Berkeley, a compromise that at least allowed her to immerse herself in beauty.\n\nIt was at Berkeley where her life found its defining partnership. She met Wei Kuang, a thoughtful landscape architecture student who saw the world not as it was, but as it could be. They fell in love over discussions of line, form, and negative space. After graduation, Katherine flirted with a museum career but found the archives cold and static. She felt a pull toward a living canvas, a more intimate form of artistry. This led her to esthetician school, a pivot that horrified her parents but felt like a homecoming to her. She married Wei, adopting his surname but holding onto her own distinct identity.\n\nThe couple moved to San Francisco, drawn to its creative energy. Her first \u201cstudio\u201d was a single room rented in a larger wellness center. There, she honed her craft, rejecting the one-size-fits-all model of skincare. She approached each client\u2019s face like an art historian analyzing a masterpiece, understanding its unique composition, history, and needs.\n\nThe turning point came fifteen years ago when she and Wei purchased a live/work loft in Hayes Valley, just as the neighborhood was blossoming. This is the home of her business, \u201cAetheria,\u201d and the reason for her zero-mile commute. Her days are a curated rhythm: a morning walk with Wei for coffee at a local cafe, followed by appointments with a select, long-term clientele. She doesn\u2019t advertise; her business thrives on the quiet word-of-mouth of San Francisco\u2019s discerning residents.\n\nNow at 51, Katherine feels a profound sense of contentment. Her relationship with Wei is the bedrock of her life, a shared appreciation for cultivated beauty. Her aspirations are no longer about growth, but about depth\u2014perfecting her own small-batch formulations and perhaps mentoring a single apprentice. Katherine Kuang has built a life as bespoke as the services she offers, a carefully composed existence in the heart of the city she loves."
