The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the fog belt of Daly City, surrounded by the quiet hum of her parents\u2019 dry-cleaning business. They instilled in her the virtues of diligence and stability, values she both embraced and resisted. While they dreamed of her becoming a doctor or an engineer, Mei\u2019s passion was for stories, leading her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in English Literature at UC Davis.\n\nHer graduation in 2008 coincided with the Great Recession, a turning point that indefinitely shelved her dreams of working in publishing. Faced with a barren job market, she took the first stable offer she received: an administrative assistant role at a large financial firm in downtown San Francisco. It was meant to be temporary, but Mei\u2019s organizational prowess and calm under pressure made her indispensable. She navigated the rigid corporate structure with surprising ease, slowly climbing the ladder to her current role as a Production Coordinator, where she wrangles chaotic data into polished quarterly reports and pitch decks.\n\nNow 38, Mei lives in a sleek Hayes Valley condo with her husband, Alex, an architect she met through a mutual friend. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a pandemic-era shift that became permanent. Her world has shrunk to her immediate neighborhood. Her mornings begin with a flat white from a local cafe, followed by a day of Zoom calls and managing deadlines from a spare bedroom-turned-office. This work-from-home life provides comfort but also a sense of isolation from the city\u2019s broader pulse.\n\nThough her career provides a comfortable life, her true self emerges after she closes her laptop. In the evenings, she revisits her first love, secretly writing a novel about a family much like her own, navigating the cultural chasms of the Bay Area. Her deepest aspiration is not a promotion, but to one day hold a finished, published copy of her book. For Mei, San Francisco is both the anchor of her secure, practical life and the vibrant, artistic backdrop for the dream she still hopes to realize."
