Raised in a home filled with books, art, and intellectual curiosity, Kenji\u2019s upbringing was a gentle immersion into the world of aesthetics and history. He inherited his mother's patient hands and his father's reverence for the past, finding his calling not in creating new art, but in saving what already existed.\n\nHis educational journey took him from an undergraduate degree in art history at UC Berkeley to a specialized Master of Fine Arts in Conservation from New York University. After a decade working within the hallowed, bureaucratic halls of major East Coast museums, he felt a pull back to the Bay Area. He craved autonomy and a more intimate connection with the art itself. In his late thirties, he returned to San Francisco and established his private practice.\n\nA key turning point came at age 40 when he traveled to Kumamoto, Japan, to search for his birth family. The journey was inconclusive, yielding only fragmented records and a deeper sense of mystery. This experience, rather than leaving him adrift, solidified his life\u2019s purpose. He realized his work was a form of stewardship, a way of piecing together fragmented histories and giving them a future. He preserves the stories of objects because his own was incomplete.\n\nNow, at 53, Kenji lives a quiet, disciplined life in a meticulously restored Hayes Valley Victorian. The garden level is his climate-controlled studio, where he works from home, making his commute a simple walk down the stairs. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted gallery owners, curators, and a former partner with whom he remains close friends. His days follow a rhythm: early morning coffee, hours of focused, painstaking work on a 17th-century canvas or a delicate piece of lacquerware, and a late afternoon walk through his neighborhood, admiring the architecture.\n\nKenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; it is the city that gave him a family and a foundation. He doesn't dream of wealth or fame, but of a legacy project\u2014the chance to restore a piece of such cultural significance that its survival becomes his quiet, lasting mark on the world. He finds his identity not in bloodlines, but in the patient, healing touch he offers to the beautiful, damaged artifacts of history."
