Raised in the misty, literary landscape of Portland, Oregon, by a high school English teacher and a civil engineer, she developed a dual appreciation for elegant narrative and logical systems. This led her not to an MBA, but to a Master's in Library and Information Science from the University of Washington. She imagined a future curating digital archives for a university.\n\nLife had other plans. In the late 1990s, a friend working at a burgeoning San Francisco dot-com startup complained about their chaotic, unnavigable website. On a whim, Sarah sketched out a new information architecture for them. They hired her immediately. She arrived in a city buzzing with frenetic energy, her unique skill set\u2014organizing vast amounts of information for human usability\u2014suddenly in high demand. She surfed the waves of the tech boom and bust, moving from information architect to UX lead, and eventually into high-level e-commerce strategy. A pivotal moment came in her late thirties when a long-term relationship ended over the classic schism: he wanted a suburban family life, while she was deeply fulfilled by her career and the vibrant independence she\u2019d built in the city. The breakup solidified her path.\n\nNow, at 45, Sarah\u2019s world is contained within her meticulously organized Hayes Valley apartment, which doubles as her office. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a structured freedom. Mornings are for deep, strategic work, fueled by coffee from a local roaster. A midday walk through Patricia\u2019s Green is her non-negotiable ritual to reset her mind. Afternoons are a cascade of Zoom calls, her calm authority guiding global teams. Her chosen family is a tight-knit circle of professional women, their bonds strengthened over decade-old book club debates and weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nHaving reached a professional peak, Sarah finds herself looking beyond profit margins. She dreams of leveraging her expertise for causes she believes in\u2014perhaps consulting for non-profits or mentoring young women entering the tech world. She feels a deep, if sometimes complicated, love for San Francisco. She misses the grittier city she first met but is grateful for the opportunities it has given her. Her aspiration is no longer to climb higher, but to build something with more lasting meaning."
