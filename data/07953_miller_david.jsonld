Raised in a sprawling, boisterous family in suburban Sacramento, David was the outlier\u2014a pensive child who preferred the silent company of library books to the noise of family barbecues. His parents, a contractor and a dental hygienist, were loving but perpetually baffled by their son who seemed to exist in a different, more muted frequency.\n\nHis escape came through education. An undergraduate degree in history led him, surprisingly, to a Master of Library Science with a specialization in Archival Studies. He\u2019d discovered his calling not in making history, but in protecting it. While his peers chased tech or finance, David was drawn to the tangible past: the smell of old paper, the weight of a photograph, the story held in a forgotten correspondence.\n\nThe pivotal moment in his life came at 28 when he answered an ad for an archivist at a small, private foundation in San Francisco. The foundation was dedicated to preserving the legacy of a niche but influential 1970s counter-culture art collective. The job came with a unique perk: a small, rent-stabilized apartment directly above the archive itself in a historic North Beach building. This sealed his fate, giving him a 0.0-mile commute and a life interwoven with his work.\n\nNow 44, David\u2019s days follow a gentle, predictable rhythm. He wakes, makes pour-over coffee, and descends a creaking flight of stairs into the climate-controlled archive. His work is a meticulous cataloging of psychedelic posters, performance art slide reels, and fiery manifestos. His social life is spare but meaningful; he plays chess weekly with the foundation\u2019s elderly founder and has a standing Friday-night beer with a fellow archivist from the Beat Museum. He is a familiar, quiet face at the neighborhood cafes and bookstores, a man who observes more than he participates.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not with its glittering tech present, but with its bohemian ghosts. He feels more kinship with the artists whose work he curates than with most of his contemporaries. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; he simply hopes to secure the collection\u2019s future and one day curate a major retrospective at SFMOMA, proving that the vibrant, rebellious history he so carefully preserves still has something to say."
