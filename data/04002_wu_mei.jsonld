The daughter of first-generation immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up in the misty avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. Her childhood was filled with the scents of her parents\u2019 bustling herbal medicine shop\u2014a place of ancient remedies and pragmatic tradition. While her parents measured ginseng and dispensed advice, Mei would sit on the sidewalk, sketching the ornate bay windows and detailed cornices of the Victorian houses that lined their street. For her, the city wasn't just a place to live; it was a blueprint of stories, a puzzle of beautiful, functional forms.\n\nThis fascination led her to UC Berkeley\u2019s College of Environmental Design, where she pursued her Master of Architecture. It was a quiet act of rebellion against her parents\u2019 hopes for a more stable career in medicine, but they saw her disciplined, near-obsessive dedication and eventually gave their blessing. The program was a crucible, forging her raw talent into a professional skill set. She thrived on the late nights in the studio, the complex problem-solving, and the challenge of turning abstract ideas into tangible plans.\n\nNow 28, Mei is a Project Architect at a boutique firm, a position she earned through grit and precision. Her 0.0-mile commute is a core feature of her life; she lives and works in a converted industrial loft in Dogpatch. Her mornings begin with strong pour-over coffee, the quiet hum of her computer booting up, and a view of the cranes that dot the skyline. Her days are a whirlwind of drafting in Revit, coordinating with engineers, and navigating the labyrinth of city permits. Her social life is small but strong, mostly consisting of a handful of friends from her graduate program who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her professional ambition. She dreams of designing not just another glass tower, but a sustainable, mixed-use community space that genuinely serves its neighborhood\u2014a building that feels as integral to the city's fabric as the Victorians she once sketched. It\u2019s her way of honoring her family\u2019s hard work while leaving her own distinct, modern mark on the city that shaped her."

Her father stepped out from the herbal shop, the scent of dried roots clinging to his shirt. He knelt, his calloused finger tracing the lines she\u2019d drawn. \"Like meridians,\" he said softly in Cantonese, \"a blueprint for energy to flow.\" It was the first time she understood that their two worlds\u2014of ancient remedies and modern structures\u2014spoke a similar language. That memory became the foundation of her entire design philosophy.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe memory that always surfaces is from her second year at Berkeley, when she came home for winter break, hollowed out by sleepless nights in the studio. Her mother, who had once pleaded with her to choose a stable path, wordlessly set down a bowl of steaming black chicken soup. As Mei held the warm ceramic, her mother simply said, \"Your buildings... make them strong.\" It wasn't a question, but a blessing. The quiet weight of her family\u2019s approval settled in her heart, freeing her to build her future without guilt.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIt was 3 AM in the Wurster Hall studio, surrounded by the ghosts of failed models. Her design for a community center felt sterile, lifeless. Frustrated, she closed her eyes and saw her parents\u2019 shop: the chaotic, intuitive flow of customers from the counter to the herb drawers. Suddenly, it clicked. She scrapped her rigid grid and redesigned the floor plan based on that organic circulation. The breakthrough felt less like an invention and more like an inheritance, proving her past was her greatest asset.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHer first time on-site as a Project Architect, she stood inside the gutted shell of a North Beach building. The air was thick with plaster dust. While her boss talked logistics, Mei placed her palm flat against the exposed brick wall, feeling its cool, rough texture. It wasn't a drawing in Revit anymore; it was real, holding decades of stories. The immense weight and honor of her work felt tangible for the first time, solidifying her commitment to designing with reverence for the city's past.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last Sunday, Mei sat by her Dogpatch window, sipping coffee and watching the cranes pivot against the dawn sky. For a moment, she felt overwhelmed by the scale of her ambition. On impulse, she found her old childhood sketchbook and opened it to a drawing of a Richmond Victorian. Beside it, on the clean, new page, she began sketching a modern building, weaving the familiar lines of a bay window into a sustainable, mixed-use frame. It was a quiet promise to herself."
