            "value": "Susan Miller began her life as Sunita Sharma, the only daughter of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Daly City in the 1970s. Her parents, a taxi driver and a house cleaner, pinned their hopes on her, envisioning a future in medicine or law. Sunita, however, had a quieter, more practical nature. In her late teens, she fell in love with a local mechanic, David Miller, a decision that caused a deep rift with her traditional family. Choosing love over familial expectation, she married at 20 and adopted his name, a symbolic break from the life she was supposed to lead.\n\nTo support their new life, Susan enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration while working various retail jobs. The four-year university her parents dreamed of felt like an impossible luxury. Her first \"real\" job came through a temp agency: a position on the assembly line at a small specialty food packaging plant in the Dogpatch. The work was repetitive but orderly, appealing to her innate sense of precision. She found a quiet satisfaction in the hum of the machinery and the tangible result of a perfectly sealed and labeled product.\n\nThe key turning point in Susan\u2019s life was not a single event, but a slow divergence. Her marriage to David ended amicably in her late thirties; he wanted to move to the suburbs and start a family, while Susan had become deeply rooted in the rhythm of her work and the industrial landscape of her neighborhood. After the divorce, she poured her energy into her job, rising from the line to team lead, and finally, to Production Line Supervisor.\n\nNow, at 49, Susan\u2019s life is defined by a chosen simplicity. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this; she lives in a modest rent-controlled apartment just a block from the factory. Her days are structured by the factory whistle. Her social life revolves around her crew\u2014sharing lunch, mediating disputes, and celebrating small victories on the factory floor. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or tourist landmarks, but of the T-Third train rumbling past her window and the smell of salt air mixing with roasted coffee from a nearby plant. Her dream isn't to leave, but to one day buy the small apartment she calls home, a permanent anchor in the gritty, steadfast corner of the city that has become her own."
