The only child of a high school history teacher and a city librarian, his childhood home was a sanctuary of books and reasoned debate. Dinner table conversations revolved around local politics and social issues, instilling in him a deep-seated belief that well-designed systems could genuinely improve lives.\n\nHis educational path was a straight line toward public service. After earning a B.A. in Political Science from UC Santa Barbara, he moved to the Bay Area for a Master\u2019s in Public Policy from UC Berkeley. It was there he fell in love with San Francisco\u2019s complex, often contradictory, character. A brief, disillusioning stint as a legislative aide in Sacramento solidified his true calling: he wanted to work on tangible, local issues, not abstract statewide maneuvering.\n\nThe key turning point was landing his role as a Policy Analyst for the City and County of San Francisco. It felt like coming home. Now, at 36, his life is deeply woven into the fabric of the city he serves. Living in the Inner Richmond, his 0.0-mile commute means his world is his neighborhood. His day begins not with a frantic rush for a MUNI bus, but with a quiet coffee from a favorite spot on Clement Street, followed by a run through the Presidio\u2019s misty trails.\n\nHe shares his life and book-filled apartment with his partner of five years, Mateo, a landscape architect whose work beautifying public spaces offers a tangible parallel to Ben\u2019s own abstract efforts. Their social life is built around small dinner parties, browsing the local farmers' market, and volunteering for park cleanup days.\n\nBen\u2019s ambition isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder or amass wealth; it\u2019s quieter and more profound. He dreams of seeing a housing or transit initiative he spent years researching finally break ground, creating a lasting, positive impact. For Ben, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's the complex, frustrating, and beautiful project he has dedicated his life to improving, one meticulously researched brief at a time."
