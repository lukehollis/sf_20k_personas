Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, she was the only child of parents who ran a small neighborhood grocery store on Clement Street. Her childhood was a mosaic of Cantonese spoken at home, the scent of fresh produce, and the quiet diligence demanded by immigrant parents who dreamed of a doctor or lawyer for a daughter. Jen, however, found her peace not in ambition, but in order. She loved the serene quiet of the local library, the way the Dewey Decimal System imposed a beautiful logic onto a universe of chaotic information.\n\nInstead of a four-year university, she chose a practical path, earning an Associate's degree in Library and Information Technology from City College. This decision was a quiet rebellion, a choice for a world her parents didn't fully understand but reluctantly accepted. She began her career as a library assistant, but as the world shifted from paper to pixels, Jen astutely shifted with it. She saw that the core principle remained the same: protecting and organizing information.\n\nA key turning point came after her father passed away a decade ago. Tasked with sorting through boxes of fading photographs, handwritten letters, and business receipts, she felt an acute sense of loss\u2014not just for her father, but for the tangible history that was dissolving in her hands. This solidified her professional purpose. She transitioned into the corporate world, becoming a Digital Asset Manager. Now, she curates and protects vast digital archives for an information services firm downtown, ensuring modern history is not lost to bit rot and poor file management.\n\nJen\u2019s life is one of comfortable routine. She still lives in the Richmond, in a rent-controlled apartment just six blocks from her childhood home. Her mornings start with strong coffee before she catches the 38-Geary MUNI for her 2.8-mile commute. Her social life is small but deep: a monthly book club with other former librarians and weekly dim sum with her aging mother. She is contentedly single, her independence a well-worn, comfortable coat.\n\nHer dream is to eventually use her skills to build a free, public digital archive for the Richmond District\u2014a place to preserve the stories of families and small businesses like her parents'. For Jennifer, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's a living document she feels a profound responsibility to help preserve."

It wasn't just a number; it was a perfect, logical address in a universe of noise. In that serene quiet, she didn\u2019t feel the pressure to become something great, only the profound comfort that everything had its place. It was the first time she understood that order was a form of peace, a feeling she would chase for the rest of her life.\n\n2.\nAt eighteen, she sat at the kitchen table, the City College acceptance letter a small, plain truth between her and her parents. Her father simply polished his glasses, not meeting her eye. The silence was heavier than shouting. In that moment, she felt their disappointment, but also a quiet, tectonic shift within herself. It was the first time she had chosen her own path, not theirs. This practical decision cemented her independence, a choice for a world of tangible systems over abstract prestige.\n\n3.\nA decade ago, after the funeral, she sat on the floor surrounded by her father\u2019s life in cardboard boxes. The brittle receipts from the store, the photographs fading to sepia, the ink bleeding on old letters. She felt a sharp, acute panic\u2014not just grief, but the terror of his story dissolving into dust. It was then her work became a mission. She wasn\u2019t just organizing data; she was fighting to keep ghosts from disappearing, to give memory a permanent, digital home.\n\n4.\nJust last week, on her morning commute, the 38-Geary lurched to a stop. Through the fog-streaked window, she saw a new bakery where a shoe repair shop had been for thirty years. She felt a familiar pang\u2014not of sadness, but of urgency. She saw the city as a living document, constantly being edited, with entire paragraphs erased. It solidified her resolve to build her archive, to create a changelog for the neighborhood she called home, ensuring no story was completely overwritten.\n\n5.\nDuring their weekly dim sum last Sunday, her mother\u2019s hand trembled, struggling with a shrimp dumpling. Jen gently steadied her hand with her own. Her mother, without looking up, began a quiet story in Cantonese about a specific brand of rice they sold at the old grocery store. Jen listened, realizing these fragments\u2014shared over tea and har gow\u2014were the most vital files in her collection. It was in these moments she felt the weight and honor of being her family's, and her community's, living archivist."
