A third-generation Japanese-American, Kenji grew up in the South Bay, caught between his parents' aspirations and a history they rarely spoke of. His father, a pragmatic engineer, envisioned a similar path for him, while the unspoken trauma of his grandparents' WWII internment experience hung in the family's atmosphere like a persistent fog.\n\nInitially, Kenji tried to follow the expected route, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Berkeley. However, a volunteer position at a free clinic during his sophomore year changed everything. It wasn't diagnosing ailments that captivated him, but listening to the stories of struggle, resilience, and systemic failure. The turning point came when he began to connect these external struggles to his own family's quiet pain, realizing that wounds of the mind and spirit required a different kind of healing. He switched his major to social welfare and went on to earn his Master of Social Work.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire, working in a demanding community mental health center in the Mission District. The experience was formative, exposing him to the raw needs of the city, but it also led to severe burnout. This prompted him to pursue his LCSW licensure and establish a private practice from his home, a decision that gave him the autonomy to focus on his true passion: providing culturally competent therapy, particularly for the AAPI community. His 0.0-mile commute is now a deliberate act of self-preservation, allowing for morning walks in Golden Gate Park before his telehealth sessions begin.\n\nKenji shares his life with his partner, Leo, a landscape architect whose work creating green spaces in the city provides a tangible, grounding contrast to Kenji's emotional labor. Their evenings are filled with shared meals and quiet companionship. Kenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal; he sees his work as a continuation of the city\u2019s legacy of community support, from the historic resilience of Japantown to its modern, progressive spirit. His dream is to expand his practice, developing group workshops on intergenerational trauma, hoping to help other families finally start the conversations his own never could."

He asked his father where it was, and the air grew still. His father took the photo, said only, \u201cA long time ago,\u201d and put it away. That silence was heavier than any answer. It was the first time Kenji understood that history was not just in books, but was a quiet, aching presence in their own home, a question he would spend his life learning to ask.\n\n2.\nIn his sophomore year at Berkeley, volunteering at a free clinic, he sat with an elderly man who was supposed to be there for his blood pressure. Instead, the man spoke for twenty minutes about the view from his SRO window, about seeing the city change, about feeling invisible. Kenji just listened, the sterile room filling with a profound loneliness. In that moment, the pre-med checklist in his head dissolved. He realized the most critical ailments weren't on a chart; they were in the stories people needed to tell.\n\n3.\nThe breaking point came under the flickering fluorescent lights of the community health center in the Mission. It was 9 PM, and he was staring at a stack of files, each a universe of trauma he felt utterly unequipped to fix within the system's constraints. A wave of profound helplessness washed over him, the weight of it all settling in his bones. That night, he understood that to prevent himself from drowning, he had to build his own lifeboat. His private practice was born from that desperation.\n\n4.\nTheir first spring in the Inner Richmond, Leo came home with a small, wiry sapling in a plastic pot\u2014a Japanese maple. They spent a Saturday afternoon on their small patio, carefully repotting it, their hands covered in soil. Leo spoke about root systems and giving it space to grow. For Kenji, whose work was so internal and abstract, the simple, tangible act of nurturing something real with his partner felt like a powerful anchor, a physical manifestation of the home and peace they were building together.\n\n5.\nAbout a year into his private practice, a client, a young Vietnamese-American designer, finally broke a long silence. He haltingly described the unspoken sorrow his parents carried from the war, a grief that shaped every family interaction. Hearing this echo of his own experience, Kenji felt a jolt of profound recognition. It wasn't just a clinical breakthrough; it was validation. He knew then that his work wasn't just a career, but a calling to help untangle the knots of the past for his community."
