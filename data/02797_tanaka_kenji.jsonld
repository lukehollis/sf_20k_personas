A third-generation Japanese-American, Kenji grew up in the South Bay, caught between his parents' aspirations and a history they rarely spoke of. His father, a pragmatic engineer, envisioned a similar path for him, while the unspoken trauma of his grandparents' WWII internment experience hung in the family's atmosphere like a persistent fog.\n\nInitially, Kenji tried to follow the expected route, enrolling as a pre-med student at UC Berkeley. However, a volunteer position at a free clinic during his sophomore year changed everything. It wasn't diagnosing ailments that captivated him, but listening to the stories of struggle, resilience, and systemic failure. The turning point came when he began to connect these external struggles to his own family's quiet pain, realizing that wounds of the mind and spirit required a different kind of healing. He switched his major to social welfare and went on to earn his Master of Social Work.\n\nHis early career was a trial by fire, working in a demanding community mental health center in the Mission District. The experience was formative, exposing him to the raw needs of the city, but it also led to severe burnout. This prompted him to pursue his LCSW licensure and establish a private practice from his home, a decision that gave him the autonomy to focus on his true passion: providing culturally competent therapy, particularly for the AAPI community. His 0.0-mile commute is now a deliberate act of self-preservation, allowing for morning walks in Golden Gate Park before his telehealth sessions begin.\n\nKenji shares his life with his partner, Leo, a landscape architect whose work creating green spaces in the city provides a tangible, grounding contrast to Kenji's emotional labor. Their evenings are filled with shared meals and quiet companionship. Kenji\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deeply personal; he sees his work as a continuation of the city\u2019s legacy of community support, from the historic resilience of Japantown to its modern, progressive spirit. His dream is to expand his practice, developing group workshops on intergenerational trauma, hoping to help other families finally start the conversations his own never could."
