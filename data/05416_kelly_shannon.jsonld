Born to a Keralan mother who immigrated for a nursing career and an Irish-American father from Sacramento, Shannon grew up caught between two very different, yet equally pragmatic, worlds. In their suburban Sacramento home, art was a hobby, not a future. Her parents, loving but practical, guided her toward a stable career, pushing her into a business program at a state college.\n\nShannon lasted three semesters. The turning point wasn't dramatic but a slow, creeping realization that she was performing a life, not living one. She felt more alive in the campus black box theater, helping student directors build makeshift sets, than in any economics lecture. At 21, she dropped out, disappointing her parents, and moved to San Francisco with two suitcases and a vague dream.\n\nThe first decade was a blur of barista jobs, shared rooms in the Sunset, and endless networking. She took unpaid internships, learning lighting design, sound mixing, and the chaotic art of production management. She was a perpetual apprentice, soaking up every aspect of the independent arts scene.\n\nNow, at 38, Shannon\u2019s life and work are completely intertwined. She lives in a cavernous live/work loft in SOMA, which also serves as the headquarters for a small, avant-garde performance art collective. Her 0.0-mile commute means her bedroom is just a flight of metal stairs away from the workshop and rehearsal space where she serves as the indispensable Production Assistant. Her days are a collage of scheduling emails, sourcing obscure props from thrift stores, and helping the director coax performances from overworked artists.\n\nHer social life is her work life; the collective is her family, which can be both comforting and suffocating, especially after a recent breakup with the group\u2019s sound designer. San Francisco isn\u2019t just a city to Shannon; it\u2019s the only place that made sense of her rebellion. While she dreams of finally being credited as a lead Set Designer, she finds deep satisfaction in her current reality. She is a crucial gear in a machine that creates strange, fleeting beauty\u2014a life she built herself, piece by salvaged piece."

She ran a hand over the rough, unfinished plywood, then looked at the glossy economics textbook in her lap. It felt alien, like an object from someone else\u2019s life. In the quiet darkness of the theater, a single, calm thought landed: *This is real. The textbook is not.* It wasn't a rebellion, but a recognition. That night, she decided to stop performing and start building.\n\n2.\nHer first day in San Francisco, at 21, was a baptism by fog. She got off the N Judah in the Sunset, dragging two suitcases that held her entire world. The damp chill seeped into her jacket, and the identical rows of houses seemed to stretch into an indifferent, grey infinity. The weight of her parents' disappointment felt as heavy as her luggage. But mixed with the terror was a thrilling, electric lightness. She was completely anonymous, untethered, and for the first time, utterly and completely her own.\n\n3.\nIt was 3 a.m. during a disastrous tech week, about five years ago. The director was weeping, and the lead performer was threatening to quit. The pivotal sound cue, a complex mix by her then-boyfriend, refused to work. Without a word, Shannon found the corrupted file, re-patched the audio through a backup system, and brewed a fresh pot of coffee. An hour later, with the crisis averted, the small crew sat on the dusty stage, sharing a box of stale donuts. In their shared exhaustion, she felt a profound sense of belonging. This messy chaos was her family.\n\n4.\nFor a show last year, the director had an impossible demand: three matching, pre-war birdcages. For a week, Shannon haunted flea markets and scanned online listings, coming up empty. Finally, in a cramped Daly City junk shop, she found them, rusted and forgotten behind a stack of records. The satisfaction she felt cleaning and repairing them was a secret, potent joy. When the stage lights hit the cages during the performance, no one knew their story. But Shannon did. She was the one who found the beautiful, necessary things.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, after the breakup, she stood on the metal stairs of her loft late one night. The performance space below was dark and silent, no longer filled with the sound designer\u2019s ambient tracks or laughter. She looked at the set for the current show\u2014a meticulously crafted, desolate living room\u2014which nearly blended into her own living space. The life she had so painstakingly built, piece by salvaged piece, suddenly felt both like a monument to her freedom and the very walls of her cage. The silence was deafening."
