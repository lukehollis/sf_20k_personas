Born in the Outer Sunset, he is the only child of a Nisei Japanese-American nurse and a proud, third-generation Italian-Mexican-American carpenter from the Mission. His childhood was a blend of cultures: Shogayaki for dinner one night, cioppino the next. He was a quiet, observant child, more interested in the logic of early PCs and the biology of the tide pools at Ocean Beach than in playground games.\n\nA key turning point came in his teens when his father suffered a major heart attack, which was later found to have been misdiagnosed for years due to fragmented medical records. Witnessing his family\u2019s struggle ignited in Daniel a passion not just for medicine, but for the systems that support it. He pursued biology at UC Berkeley, but quickly pivoted, seeing the future in the intersection of code and clinical care. He earned his PhD in Biomedical Informatics, dedicating his dissertation to predictive modeling for cardiac events.\n\nHe was a natural fit for UCSF, joining as a post-doctoral fellow and never leaving. Over two decades, he methodically worked his way up, becoming a respected leader in his field. Now, as Director of Clinical Informatics Research, he manages teams that build the very systems he once dreamed of\u2014tools that use AI to connect disparate data points and provide clinicians with a clearer picture of patient health.\n\nDaniel lives in a cozy Cole Valley Edwardian with his husband of 18 years, Mateo, a public-school art teacher. Their life is a comfortable routine. Daniel\u2019s day begins with a walk with their grey-muzzled terrier in the foggy trails of Sutro Forest, followed by a packed ride on the N-Judah Muni line to the Parnassus campus. He feels deeply rooted in San Francisco, a city he has watched transform. While he appreciates its relentless innovation, he quietly mourns the loss of the working-class soul he grew up with.\n\nHis professional ambition has mellowed into a drive for legacy. Daniel\u2019s ultimate hope is to see a diagnostic algorithm developed by his lab become a national standard, an invisible, life-saving tool that ensures no other family endures the uncertainty his once did."

Ignoring the other kids, he watched a sea anemone slowly retract its tentacles around a piece of shell. It wasn't just an animal; it was a perfect, self-contained system responding to data. He felt a profound sense of calm understanding it. This quiet fascination with the hidden logic of living things became the bedrock of his observant, analytical nature, a world more real to him than any schoolyard game.\n\n2.\nThe fluorescent hum of the hospital waiting room is a sound he can still summon. He was sixteen, watching his mother\u2019s composure crack as doctors spoke in hushed, frustrated tones about his father\u2019s \"conflicting charts.\" In that moment, his fear curdled into a cold, clear rage. It wasn't just a heart attack; it was a system failure, a preventable tragedy born from scattered data. That night, his life's mission ignited: to fix the broken connections, to make the invisible visible, to give anger a purpose.\n\n3.\nIt was 2 AM in a Berkeley computer lab, the air thick with the smell of old coffee. He ran the final simulation for his dissertation. For an agonizing minute, the cursor just blinked. Then, the model correctly predicted the cardiac event from a scrambled set of anonymized patient data. It worked. The relief was so intense it felt like a physical shock. This was the first time he truly believed he could build something to prevent the helplessness his family had endured. It was a promise taking form in code.\n\n4.\nHe recalls standing with Mateo on the steps of City Hall, the papers still crisp in his hand. The grand dome soared above them, but all Daniel could focus on was the feeling of Mateo\u2019s calloused fingers\u2014always dusted with charcoal or clay\u2014laced through his own. His world was one of precise data and clinical logic, but Mateo\u2019s love was an anchor in something messier, warmer, and profoundly human. It was a different kind of certainty, one that taught him that the most important systems don't run on code.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking his grey-muzzled terrier through the damp eucalyptus scent of Sutro Forest, he paused. The fog, the same fog that blanketed his Outer Sunset childhood, felt different now\u2014less a mystery, more a problem to see through. He felt the weight of his father, of the city's lost working-class soul, and of his own aging. His ambition was no longer a fire but a steady, quiet pilot light: a deep, urgent need to leave behind a system that worked, invisibly and perfectly, in the fog."
