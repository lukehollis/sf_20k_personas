The son of Punjabi immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, he was raised in a home that valued education and stability above all else. While his father, an engineer, hoped he\u2019d follow a similar path, David was drawn to the humanities. He pursued a history degree before surprising his family by earning a Master's in Library and Information Science. He was fascinated not by technology itself, but by the architecture of information\u2014how it was structured, stored, and retrieved.\n\nThis niche passion made him perfectly suited for the burgeoning tech scene of the 1990s. He started his career organizing digital assets for an early software company, translating his knowledge of catalogs and taxonomies into databases and server directories. He wasn't a coder, but a systems thinker, and he rose steadily. The dot-com bust of the early 2000s was a critical turning point. He lost his job and saw his paper wealth evaporate, teaching him a profound lesson in resilience and the folly of hype. He rebuilt his career with a more measured, thoughtful approach, eventually becoming the respected IT Director he is today.\n\nNow 51 and amicably divorced for nearly a decade, David lives a deliberately structured life in a meticulously kept Victorian in Noe Valley. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are his own. He starts with a walk to a local cafe for a cortado, works from a sunlit home office overlooking his small, well-tended garden, and ends his day with a podcast or a historical non-fiction book. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few friends who, like him, survived the tech industry\u2019s booms and busts.\n\nConnected more to the quiet streets of his neighborhood than the downtown hustle, David finds contentment in order and peace. His ambitions are no longer corporate; instead, he dreams of mentoring the next generation of tech leaders, encouraging a more ethical and sustainable approach to information. He aspires to one day step back, perhaps volunteer at the SF Public Library, and reconnect with the analog world of knowledge that first captured his imagination."
