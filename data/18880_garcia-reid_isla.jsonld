Her mother, Elena Garcia, is a second-generation Mission District native whose family ran a beloved neighborhood bakery. Her father, David Reid, is a landscape architect from a quieter, more affluent Marin County background. Isla\u2019s childhood was a constant, loving negotiation between these worlds: vibrant quincea\u00f1eras and formal holiday dinners, the scent of pan dulce and the salty air of the bay. This duality fostered in her a profound sense of empathy and an ability to act as a bridge between cultures.\n\nThe pivotal moment in her life came during high school when she volunteered to help recent immigrant students navigate the complex public school system. Witnessing firsthand the systemic barriers her own cousins had faced, she found her calling. She pursued her undergraduate degree at SF State and later earned her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, focusing on youth in urban environments.\n\nNow, at 30, Isla is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a non-profit contracted with the city\u2019s schools. Her days are spent providing counseling and support to students grappling with trauma, poverty, and acculturation. Her 5.1-mile commute on the N Judah from her apartment in the Inner Sunset to a school in the Mission District is a daily ritual of reflection, a time she uses to decompress with podcasts before arriving home.\n\nShe shares her rent-controlled apartment with her long-term partner, Leo, a software engineer whose logical world provides a grounding counterpoint to her emotionally demanding career. Their life is a comfortable blend of home-cooked meals, runs through Golden Gate Park, and exploring the city\u2019s endless culinary scene.\n\nIsla\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into her identity and profession. She loves the city for its resilience and diversity but is acutely aware of its inequities. Her dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact. She aspires to eventually move into a policy-advising role within the school district, creating broader, more effective support systems so that every child, regardless of their background, has a bridge to a better future."
