            "value": "Raj Miller is the indispensable heart of the 1930s Art Deco apartment building he calls home. His life is measured in the hiss of steam radiators and the hum of the boiler he expertly maintains. Raised in Hayward, Raj is the grandson of an Indian immigrant who changed the family name from Patel to Miller in the 1960s, believing it would open more doors in the construction trade. Raj inherited his grandfather\u2019s pragmatism and his father\u2019s knack for mechanics, favoring shop class over literature.\n\nWhile his high school peers were chasing SAT scores for Berkeley and Stanford, Raj knew his path was different. He enrolled at Laney College and earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Building Trades Technology, mastering HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems. He was a natural, a gifted problem-solver who could diagnose a building\u2019s ailments like a doctor. He spent fifteen years as a roving maintenance technician for a large property management company, a demanding job whose unpredictable hours contributed to the amicable end of his marriage in his early thirties.\n\nThe turning point came eight years ago when the facilities manager position opened up in a stately Nob Hill building. The offer included the ground-floor one-bedroom apartment, reducing his commute to zero and fundamentally changing his life. He traded a life in his truck for a life integrated into a single, vertical community.\n\nNow, Raj\u2019s routine is the building's rhythm. He\u2019s up at dawn, walking the perimeter, checking systems before the tenants are even awake. He is the keeper of secrets and spare keys, the confidant for elderly residents, and the friendly face who signs for packages. His social life revolves around the building\u2019s ecosystem and a few old friends from the trades he meets for beers at a low-key pub on Polk Street.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not one of tech campuses or Michelin stars, but of its physical bones and the people within them. Raj dreams of one day buying a small duplex in the East Bay, something to call his own and manage for himself. For now, he finds deep satisfaction in his role as the quiet, capable anchor of his building, the man who ensures the city\u2019s heart keeps beating, one repaired faucet at a time."
