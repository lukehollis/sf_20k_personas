Born in Yuba City to Punjabi Sikh immigrants who worked the fertile farmlands of the Central Valley, her childhood was steeped in community, faith, and the expectation of hard work. While her parents envisioned a path in medicine or engineering, Harleen found her sanctuary in the stark, logical order of the public library. It was a world she could classify, understand, and control.\n\nThis love for structure led her to UC Berkeley for her undergraduate degree and then to San Jose State for a Master's in Library and Information Science. She was prescient, seeing the world's shift from paper to data. While her peers romanticized rare book collections, Harleen focused on database architecture and information ethics, preparing for a future that hadn't fully arrived. Her early career saw her move from academic libraries to corporate records management, methodically climbing the ladder.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. The end of a serious, long-term relationship left her untethered but also fiercely independent. She channeled her energy entirely into her career, accepting a high-stakes position at a burgeoning San Francisco tech firm. Today, as Director of Information Governance, she is the architect of how a massive corporation handles its most vital asset: information.\n\nHarleen\u2019s daily routine reflects her personality. From her immaculate Hayes Valley apartment, she takes the 21 Hayes bus 2.5 miles to her downtown office. Her days are a marathon of meetings on data privacy, compliance, and security. Evenings are for herself: a long walk, a book from a local independent store, or dinner with a small circle of professional women. Her connection to San Francisco is less about its bohemian spirit and more about its intellectual vibrancy\u2014the lectures, the museums, the sheer density of brilliant minds. Her dream is no longer about climbing higher, but about building something lasting. She fantasizes about retiring and consulting for non-profits, helping them organize their histories, bringing the order she cherishes to the stories that matter most."

But inside the cool, hushed library, the air smelled of paper and order. At age nine, she discovered the card catalog, its tiny, perfect drawers holding a map to the entire world. While her parents saw her future in a field or a clinic, she saw it right there, in the quiet authority of a system that brought sense to chaos. This was not rebellion, but revelation.\n\n2.\nIn a graduate seminar at San Jose State, a professor projected a complex database schema onto the screen. Her peers, many of whom romanticized rare manuscripts, saw a sterile flowchart. Harleen saw a cathedral. She felt a jolt of recognition, a deep, quiet thrill in its invisible architecture. She knew then that her path was the right one. She wasn't abandoning the library; she was building its next, more crucial iteration, one that would hold not just books, but identities.\n\n3.\nHer first Saturday morning alone in the Hayes Valley apartment felt vast and empty. The relationship was over. Before the grief could set in, she started unpacking her books. Alphabetical by author, then chronological. The methodical act of creating order on the shelves was a bulwark against despair. By the time she finished, sunlight was streaming in, and the silence felt less like absence and more like sovereignty. At thirty-eight, she had built a new foundation, entirely her own.\n\n4.\nRiding the 21 Hayes bus home one rainy Tuesday, she looked up from her book to see the city lights blurring against the wet glass. Next to her, two strangers were having an intense, brilliant conversation about urban planning and public art. She didn't join in, but she listened, feeling a current of intellectual energy pass through the bus. This, she realized, was why she loved San Francisco\u2014not for its beauty, but for its mind.\n\n5.\nDuring a high-stakes data privacy review, a lawyer referred to user histories as \"legacy liabilities.\" Harleen calmly countered, \"They are community archives.\" The room went silent. In that moment, her corporate work and her private dream converged. She wasn't just a director; she was a custodian of stories, even digital ones. The thought of one day doing the same for a small museum or a non-profit felt less like retirement and more like coming home."
