The only daughter of immigrants from Guangdong, she was raised in a cramped apartment above the family\u2019s herb shop on Waverly Place. Her childhood was a symphony of competing sounds: the clatter of mahjong tiles from the association next door, the English lessons from her public school teachers, and the quiet, persistent wisdom of her parents teaching her the value of community and duty. While her friends dreamed of moving away, Mei felt an unshakeable bond with the neighborhood\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy.\n\nInitially, she aimed for a business degree at UC Berkeley, a practical choice to honor her parents\u2019 hard work. The turning point came during her senior year when her father, a proud man, struggled to navigate the healthcare system after a stroke. The language barriers and lack of culturally competent care left him feeling helpless. Witnessing this ignited a new purpose in Mei. She pivoted, pursuing a Master of Public Health, determined to bridge the exact gaps that had failed her own family.\n\nFor the past two decades, Mei has been the Health Program Coordinator for a non-profit serving low-income seniors. Her 0.0-mile commute is no data error; she lives in a modest apartment on the fourth floor of the same building where her ground-floor office is located. Her days are a seamless blend of personal and professional life. She starts with tea, then heads downstairs to coordinate everything from vaccination clinics and nutrition workshops to simple wellness checks on residents she knows by name.\n\nMei was briefly married in her thirties, but the partnership couldn't withstand her deep-rooted commitment to her work and community. Now, at 53, her life is full, not with a spouse or children, but with the dozens of elders who view her as a daughter. Her dream is not for wealth or recognition, but to secure a grant that will guarantee her programs for the next decade. She hopes one day to finally visit her parents' ancestral village in China, to see the beginning of the story she now stewards in the heart of San Francisco."
