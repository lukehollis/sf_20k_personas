Raised in a quiet, book-filled home in a suburb of Philadelphia, he was the son of a history professor and a librarian. His upbringing was steeped in intellectual curiosity but lacked any trace of business ambition. He followed a predictable path, earning a Political Science degree before heading to Georgetown for law school. He began his career as a corporate lawyer in New York City, expertly navigating mergers and acquisitions, but found the work soulless and repetitive.\n\nThe first dot-com boom was his turning point. In 1998, fascinated by the chaotic energy emanating from the West Coast, David took a massive risk. He left his stable law firm partnership and moved to San Francisco to join a fledgling software company as their in-house counsel. He quickly discovered his true talent wasn't in drafting contracts, but in forging the relationships that led to them. He transitioned from the legal department to business development, a move that defined his career. He survived the dot-com bust, learning resilience, and methodically climbed the corporate ladder through subsequent tech cycles.\n\nThis relentless drive, however, came at a personal cost. His marriage, strained by 80-hour workweeks and constant travel, ended in a painful divorce a decade ago. It\u2019s a source of quiet regret, though he maintains a loving, if somewhat distant, relationship with his daughter, now a sophomore at NYU.\n\nToday, David lives in a sleek Nob Hill condominium with panoramic views of the bay he rarely has time to admire. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the modern executive lifestyle; his day is a marathon of Zoom calls from a meticulously organized home office, building alliances with companies across the globe. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of other industry veterans with whom he shares expensive wine and cynical observations about the latest tech trends. He loves San Francisco for its world-class restaurants and proximity to Napa, seeing it as a beautiful, convenient backdrop for his career. His aspiration is no longer a C-suite title, but a \u201cthird act\u201d \u2013 perhaps consulting part-time, allowing him the freedom to finally reconnect with his daughter and explore the world beyond a laptop screen."
