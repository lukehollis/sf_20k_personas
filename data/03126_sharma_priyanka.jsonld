At 50, her 0.0-mile commute is a hard-won peace. Born in Mumbai, she immigrated to Fremont, California, with her engineer father and homemaker mother at age seven. While her parents pushed for a career in medicine or tech, Priyanka was drawn to the human-side of crises, a path solidified when she witnessed a compassionate social worker guide her family through her grandmother\u2019s frightening cancer diagnosis.\n\nShe pursued this calling with quiet determination, earning her Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University. She threw herself into the city\u2019s complex healthcare system, cutting her teeth in the late 90s working with HIV/AIDS patients, a role that taught her about resilience, grief, and the fierce bonds of found-families. It was in SF that she married a charismatic lawyer, but their paths diverged; his corporate ambition clashed with her people-centric values, leading to an amicable divorce in her early forties. This turning point, though painful, cemented her independence and deepened her commitment to her work.\n\nNow a Senior Medical Social Worker, Priyanka\u2019s days are a tapestry of telehealth calls. She is the calm voice for families grappling with new diagnoses, the logistical wizard securing housing for a patient post-discharge, and the empathetic ear for those navigating end-of-life care. Her mornings start with hot chai and a view of the fog over Golden Gate Park, which serves as her backyard and sanctuary for midday walks to decompress. Evenings are for her tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow healthcare workers and artists\u2014or her book club.\n\nPriyanka\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of purpose. She has weathered its booms and busts, finding her niche away from the frantic tech scene. Her dream is not of retirement, but of legacy: mentoring the next generation of social workers and perhaps, one day, starting a small foundation to provide grants for uninsured patients needing specialized care. She is a vital, grounding force in a city of constant motion, offering stability to those in their most vulnerable moments."

Then a social worker knelt before her, explaining not the disease, but their role as a family. She gave Priyanka the simple job of getting her mother a glass of water, a tiny act that broke the spell of helplessness. In that moment of profound fear, Priyanka felt a flicker of purpose. She understood that holding a family together was as vital as any medicine, and her path was set.\n\n2.\nShe recalls a tiny, smuggled cupcake in a sterile room at SF General in 1998. Her patient, Marco, was rail-thin from AIDS and had no family left. But for his birthday, she and two nurses became his family. They sang softly as the single candle flickered, and his weak smile held more gratitude than she had ever seen. It was her first, sharpest lesson in grief and grace, teaching her that dignity could be found in the smallest acts of defiant love.\n\n3.\nHe was celebrating a huge legal victory, the air in their Marina apartment electric with his ambition. She remembers nodding, the details of his day blurring with the memory of her own: holding the hand of a new widow. There was no fight, just a vast, quiet chasm opening between them. In that silence, she felt a painful clarity. Their definitions of a successful life were written in different languages. The decision to walk her own path, alone, felt both heartbreaking and necessary.\n\n4.\nThe first morning in her Inner Sunset apartment was a revelation. After years of noise, both marital and professional, there was only the gentle hiss of her stovetop chai and the view. She watched the fog blanket the tops of the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park, a silent, moving sea. It felt like the city was offering a quiet exhale, and she breathed out with it. This wasn't loneliness; it was the profound peace of a space that was finally, completely her own.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a telehealth call, a family was fracturing under the weight of a new diagnosis. Their voices were a tangled knot of fear. Priyanka waited, then softly asked, \u201cWhat kind of music did your father love?\u201d The question hung in the air. A daughter, crying moments before, managed a weak smile. \u201cSinatra,\u201d she whispered. They began sharing stories, becoming a team again. It reminded Priyanka that her work wasn\u2019t just about logistics, but about finding the human thread that pulls everyone back together."
