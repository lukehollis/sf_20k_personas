The only son of Korean immigrants who poured their life savings and relentless effort into a small dry-cleaning business, David grew up surrounded by the scent of steam and the quiet weight of parental expectation. They envisioned a secure future for him\u2014doctor, engineer, lawyer\u2014a path paved with tangible success.\n\nHowever, David was more fascinated by what made people tick than by circuits or statutes. He chose to study Psychology at UC Santa Cruz, a decision that caused a gentle ripple of disappointment back home. After graduating, he felt adrift, his degree seeming more philosophical than practical. He took a job as a recruiting coordinator for a chaotic, pre-IPO startup in SoMa, mostly because it paid the bills. It was there, amidst the brilliance and burnout, that he found his calling. He saw that his understanding of human behavior was a superpower in an industry that often treated people like code. He transitioned into Human Resources, quickly finding his niche in helping build healthier, more sustainable company cultures.\n\nThe pandemic was David\u2019s great turning point. When his company went fully remote, his daily BART commute from his small apartment vanished. The sudden stillness was jarring at first, but then it became a revelation. Working from his quiet Inner Richmond apartment, with Golden Gate Park as his backyard, he discovered a new rhythm. His productivity soared, and his stress plummeted.\n\nNow, David\u2019s life is defined by a deliberate balance. His mornings start with a run through the park, followed by hours of focused work from a meticulously organized desk in the corner of his living room. He feels more connected to his neighborhood than ever before, frequenting the dim sum spots on Clement Street and knowing the baristas at his local coffee shop by name. His social life is smaller but deeper, consisting of a tight-knit group of friends. He dreams not of a C-suite title, but of becoming a Head of People at a company with a genuine soul. His greatest aspiration, however, is a quiet one: to one day save enough to buy a small condo in the neighborhood he has truly come to call home."
