Raised by a high school history teacher and a civil engineer, David inherited both a fascination with the story of human settlement and a methodical, analytical mind. He pursued an undergraduate degree in economics, intrigued by predictive models, but found the field too abstract. Seeking a more tangible application, he moved west for a Master's in Urban Planning at UCLA, specializing in quantitative analysis of metropolitan growth.\n\nHis early career was with a municipal consulting firm in Los Angeles, modeling traffic flow and housing needs. While he loved the subject, he grew frustrated by the slow pace of public sector work. The turning point came in 2008 when a friend, an engineer at a burgeoning San Francisco startup, remarked, \"You know that transit data you analyze for the city? We do the same thing with user clicks, but a million times a second.\" Intrigued, David took a leap, moving to SF for a junior data analyst role. He discovered his knack for translating vast, chaotic datasets into clear, actionable narratives was perfectly suited for the tech world. He rose steadily, moving from analyst to manager, and now serves as a Director of Data Analytics.\n\nAt 43, David\u2019s life has settled into a comfortable rhythm in his Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute grants him the luxury of starting each day not with traffic, but with a long, meditative walk through Golden Gate Park, his mind untangling problems before he even logs on. The end of a long-term relationship three years ago left him more introspective, and his social life is a small, curated circle of friends met through cycling clubs and old work connections.\n\nThough he has found immense success, David feels a pull back toward his original passion. He dreams of leveraging his expertise for civic good, perhaps launching a consultancy that helps non-profits or city governments use data more effectively. He loves San Francisco for its dynamic energy and natural beauty but aspires to connect with it on a deeper, more foundational level\u2014not just as a tech professional, but as a planner helping to shape its future."
