Born and raised in the Sunset District to Taiwanese immigrants, his childhood was a quiet landscape of modest aspirations and unspoken pressures. His parents, who ran a small neighborhood grocery, envisioned a stable, respectable future for their only son\u2014a future in engineering or medicine.\n\nDavid, however, was drawn to stories and aesthetics. He enrolled at SF State, deviating from his parents' path by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Art History. He loved the narratives behind objects, the cultural weight of a brushstroke. But the romanticism of Renaissance art couldn\u2019t pay rent. To support himself, he took a part-time job at a high-end Union Square department store. There, on the sales floor, he discovered an unexpected talent. He had an eye for visual merchandising, an intuitive grasp of inventory flow, and a calm authority that commanded respect. He was curating experiences, just with apparel instead of artifacts.\n\nThe key turning point came upon graduation. A museum internship was on the table, but so was a full-time management trainee position at the store. He chose the steady paycheck. That single pragmatic decision charted the course of his life. For thirty years, David climbed the corporate retail ladder. His ambition and long hours led to a divorce in his late thirties, leaving him with a quiet, work-focused existence.\n\nNow, as a Store Operations Director, David lives in a sleek SoMa condo that doubles as his office. His commute is a few steps from his bedroom to the desk where he oversees a dozen stores across Northern California via the glow of dual monitors. His days are a disciplined ballet of logistics calls, sales data analysis, and virtual team meetings. Evenings are solitary; a walk through the Yerba Buena Gardens, a simple home-cooked meal, and a book on architectural history\u2014a nod to the man he once planned to be.\n\nHis dream is no longer corporate. David fantasizes about using his savings to open a small, meticulously curated shop in Hayes Valley, perhaps selling vintage furniture or Japanese ceramics. It would be a return to his original passion, a final merger of his artistic soul and his operational expertise, proving that his life, like a well-designed object, could find its perfect form."
