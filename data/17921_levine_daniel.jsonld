Born in Berkeley to a Korean immigrant mother, a gifted ceramicist, and a Jewish-American father, a literature professor, his childhood home was a fusion of cultures\u2014the scent of kimchi mingling with the musty aroma of old books. He navigated the space between these worlds, finding a universal language in the visual arts. His mixed heritage, once a source of quiet confusion, became the lens through which he saw the world, appreciating the beauty in juxtaposition and dialogue.\n\nHe pursued an undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley before earning his Master's in Art History from Williams College, specializing in the intersection of post-war American and East Asian contemporary art. His early career in New York\u2019s gallery scene was a grind, but a critical turning point came after a show he curated received a scathing review. The failure stung, but it taught him humility and the importance of conviction over consensus.\n\nDaniel moved to San Francisco in his late thirties, drawn by a unique opportunity to shape the private art collection of a major financial firm. Now, as the Director of Curatorial Affairs, his days are a blend of administrative leadership and creative vision. He manages acquisitions, plans installations for their corporate headquarters, and nurtures relationships with emerging artists. His 3.5-mile commute on the Muni bus from his Hayes Valley condo to the Financial District provides a daily moment of reflection, watching the city's diverse residents come and go.\n\nHe shares his life with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Marcus. Their home is a testament to their shared aesthetic: clean lines, natural textures, and carefully chosen pieces of art. Daniel finds his connection to San Francisco not in its tech-fueled gloss, but in its artistic soul\u2014the proximity to SFMOMA, the independent galleries in his neighborhood, and the city\u2019s inherent acceptance of multifaceted identities like his own. He aspires to one day write a definitive book on Korean diaspora artists, but his deepest dream is to guest-curate a major international biennial, a platform to tell a global story of cultural exchange that began for him in a small Berkeley home."

The air was heavy with the smell of wet clay and, faintly, the garlic of fermenting kimchi from the kitchen. His father\u2019s voice drifted from the next room, reading aloud. In that moment, watching his mother\u2019s hands shape a vessel on the wheel, he didn't feel torn between two worlds. He felt he was at the very center of a new one, a place where disparate, beautiful things could coexist. That feeling became the foundation of his entire aesthetic.\n\n2.\nIt was a cold night in the Williams library, surrounded by stacks on post-war art. He remembers a specific slide in a carousel clicking into place: a piece by Nam June Paik. A cello made of television screens. The synthesis of a classic Western instrument with modern, global technology felt like a key turning in a lock inside him. This wasn\u2019t just art history; it was his own story, his own internal dialogue, given a frame and a name. For the first time, his academic pursuit felt deeply, unshakably personal.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel the cheap newsprint of the *Voice* on his knee in his tiny East Village apartment. The scathing review of his first curated show. The critic\u2019s words weren\u2019t just sharp; they felt like a public expos\u00e9 of his own self-doubt. The shame was a physical weight for weeks. But after the sting faded, a quiet resolve settled in its place. He learned that consensus was fleeting, but his own conviction had to be permanent. It was a brutal, necessary lesson in curating from the inside out.\n\n4.\nDaniel recalls the afternoon he and Marcus hung the first major piece of art in their new Hayes Valley condo. They debated its placement for over an hour, a tense negotiation of sightlines and light. When they finally stepped back, seeing the painting perfectly centered on the wall, the silence that followed was profound. It was a feeling of deep, shared contentment. It wasn't just about decorating a home; it was the first act of co-curating their life, a testament to their shared vision and partnership.\n\n5.\nJust last week, staring out the window of the Muni 5R on his way downtown, he saw a young art student sketching the street scene in a Moleskine. The intensity on her face was familiar. In that fleeting moment, watching the city slide by, he felt a surge of purpose. This daily journey wasn't just a commute; it was a reminder of the city\u2019s creative pulse. It solidified his quiet dream\u2014to one day give artists like her, from every corner of the world, a platform like a biennial."
