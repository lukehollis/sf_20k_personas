Raised in the tech-saturated suburbs of San Jose, he was the only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who equated success with engineering degrees and stock options. His parents, a software developer and a lab technician, couldn't understand his childhood fascination with the brushstrokes in a coffee table book on Van Gogh or his insistence on visiting museums instead of science fairs. For them, art was a hobby, not a livelihood.\n\nHis choice to study Art History at UCLA was a source of immense family tension. It felt like a deliberate rejection of their hard-earned American dream. David, however, saw it as claiming his own. He excelled, finding a language for the beauty and context he\u2019d always felt intuitively. He pursued his Master\u2019s at San Francisco State University, drawn to the city's vibrant and defiant arts scene. After a series of internships and assistant roles, he landed his current position as an Exhibitions Manager at a prominent museum near Civic Center.\n\nA key turning point came three years ago when he managed a major retrospective for a groundbreaking Korean-American video artist. Seeing his parents walk through the gallery, reading the name \"David Park\" in the exhibition catalog, and listening to the critical acclaim, he finally felt a sense of validation. It was a bridge between their world and his.\n\nToday, David lives in a sleek one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley with his partner, a landscape architect named Michael. His 2.8-mile commute on the MUNI is a cherished ritual, a time to listen to podcasts on curatorial theory or simply watch the city wake up. His days are a whirlwind of budgets, artist logistics, and installation plans\u2014the practical scaffolding that allows art to shine. He loves his neighborhood's proximity to the opera and symphony, and its blend of chic boutiques and enduring character.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream is to one day become a Chief Curator, shaping an institution's vision and championing underrepresented artists. He wants to ensure that other kids, especially those from immigrant backgrounds, see their stories and heritage reflected on gallery walls, not just as a hobby, but as a vital part of the cultural conversation."

His parents\u2019 voices drifted from the kitchen, a familiar murmur of silicon and lab results. But David heard nothing, his finger tracing the thick, churning impasto of *The Starry Night* printed on the glossy page. This felt more real, more structural than any microchip. It was a silent, deeply personal discovery of another world, a secret language he knew he had to learn. This moment planted the seed of his quiet rebellion.\n\n2.\nDuring his sophomore year at UCLA, a professor deconstructed Goya's *The Third of May, 1808*, speaking not of its beauty, but of its power as political testimony. In the dark lecture hall, a switch flipped in David\u2019s mind. The fight with his parents wasn't just about choosing paintings over programming; it was about choosing a different kind of consequence. Art wasn\u2019t a frivolous escape. It was a record, a weapon, a form of truth. That day, his passion gained a purpose beyond his own fascination.\n\n3.\nHis first week as a Master\u2019s student at SFSU, he rode the MUNI K-Ingleside outbound, getting intentionally lost. As the streetcar lurched above ground near West Portal, the city\u2019s unique, layered architecture spread out below him. It wasn't the manicured landscape of his youth, but a chaotic, vibrant, living installation. He felt a profound sense of arrival, not just in a new city, but in a place that matched the energy of the art he loved. He knew then he wouldn't leave.\n\n4.\nThe museum\u2019s loading dock, five years ago. An installation piece, a fragile sculpture of hand-blown glass, arrived with a hairline fracture. The artist was frantic, the curator despondent. David, then just an assistant, spent the next hour sourcing a specialized epoxy and steadying the artist\u2019s hand as they performed the delicate repair. In the quiet satisfaction of that save, he found his calling\u2014not just loving art, but being the calm, practical scaffold that allows it to stand. It secured his identity within the art world.\n\n5.\nHe remembers their first proper date at the SF Botanical Garden. Michael, then a stranger he\u2019d met through friends, stopped and explained the design of the New Zealand cloud forest collection\u2014how it replicated an ecosystem through deliberate choices of slope, shade, and species. He spoke of sightlines and soil composition with the same reverence David reserved for exhibition lighting. David felt a jolt of recognition. Michael didn\u2019t just tolerate his world; he understood the architecture of beauty. He felt, for the first time, truly home with someone."
