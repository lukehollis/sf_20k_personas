The methodical folding, the satisfaction of crisp lines, it taught her the quiet dignity of hard work and the beauty in precision, skills she'd later apply to plating and service.\n\n2.  Standing backstage after her high school play, the nervous energy giving way to exhilaration as the audience applauded. For a shy kid, that moment of shared joy, of creating something that resonated, sparked a realization: she loved making people feel good, a feeling that would guide her career path.\n\n3.  That first time she successfully translated for her *Po Po* at the grocery store, navigating the complexities of a different language and culture for her grandmother's needs. The sense of bridging worlds, of being the conduit for understanding, reinforced her comfort in moving between different identities.\n\n4.  The night she stayed late at the struggling Hayes Valley restaurant, sketching out the new layout on a napkin, fueled by stale coffee and a fierce determination. The weight of responsibility, the creative fire ignited, solidified her confidence in her ability to take risks and transform a vision into reality.\n\n5.  Sharing dim sum with her parents on a rainy Sunday, the familiar clatter of chopsticks and murmured Cantonese mixing with her Dad's laughter. In that warm, chaotic comfort, she felt the grounding strength of her family, a constant anchor in the sometimes-turbulent world of the restaurant industry."
