As Indo-Fijians who immigrated to the Bay Area in the late 1980s, they settled in Daly City, building a life grounded in hard work and community support. Rohan grew up watching his father, a mechanic, and his mother, a home health aide, navigate the labyrinthine American system. He vividly remembers the stacks of medical bills and insurance forms for his grandmother, a frustration that planted the seed for his future career.\n\nChoosing a practical path that blended his analytical mind with a desire to help, Rohan earned a Bachelor's in Health Informatics from UC Davis. His first job was a data analyst role at a large hospital system, where he saw firsthand how clunky technology created barriers to patient care. This was his turning point. He realized he didn't just want to analyze data; he wanted to build the tools that made care more accessible and efficient. He skillfully pivoted into product management.\n\nNow 36, Rohan is a Product Manager for a health-tech firm focused on social services. He leads a team developing a platform that connects school nurses, social workers, and pediatricians to coordinate care for at-risk students. His 4.5-mile commute on the 5-Fulton MUNI is a daily ritual, giving him time to listen to podcasts before diving into a world of user stories and development sprints.\n\nHe lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its incredible diversity of food. Recently out of a long-term relationship, his social life revolves around a close-knit group of friends who share his passion for weekend hikes in Marin and exploring the city\u2019s hidden culinary gems. Rohan feels the deep duality of San Francisco\u2014the frustration with its systemic problems and the profound love for its beauty, innovation, and acceptance. His dream is less about climbing the corporate ladder and more about launching a product that measurably improves community health outcomes. He aspires to build a life, and perhaps a family, that mirrors the resilience and community spirit he inherited, creating a future as interconnected as the systems he designs."

Stacked between them were his dadi\u2019s medical bills, a labyrinth of codes and frightening numbers. He didn\u2019t understand the details, only the quiet, tired determination on their faces. A hot, powerless anger rose in his chest\u2014a feeling that someone, somewhere, had made things deliberately confusing. That moment planted a seed of fierce resolve in him to one day untangle such knots for others.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-five, staring at a spreadsheet in his sterile hospital cubicle, it clicked. The data showed dozens of missed pediatric appointments from a specific zip code. He dug deeper, discovering the scheduling software wasn\u2019t translated into Spanish and crashed on older phones. These weren\u2019t just data points; they were children falling through digital cracks. It was a failure of design, not of the families. That night, the frustration he felt wasn\u2019t one of defeat, but of profound clarity. He knew he had to build the tools, not just analyze their failures.\n\n3.\nThe final conversation with his ex-girlfriend happened on a familiar bench near Spreckels Lake. As the fog rolled in, swallowing the tops of the cypress trees, the silence between them grew heavier than their words. There wasn't a fight, just the peaceful, heartbreaking acceptance that their paths had diverged. He felt a deep grief for the future they\u2019d designed together, now dissolving like the view in front of them. Walking home alone through the park that evening felt like his first step into a new, undefined life.\n\n4.\nLast winter, the 5-Fulton crested a hill on McAllister, and the setting sun hit City Hall\u2019s dome, setting it ablaze with gold. It was a moment of pure, breathtaking beauty. Then his eyes dropped to the sidewalk, where a man was violently trembling in the throes of a crisis. The city\u2019s majestic beauty and its deep, human brokenness crashed into him all at once. He gripped the pole, overcome with a feeling of profound love and a stubborn, frustrating ache to help fix it.\n\n5.\nHe remembers the sheer joy of watching his father\u2019s face at a tiny Burmese place in the neighborhood. His dad, a mechanic whose hands were mapped with grease and hard work, took a tentative bite of tea leaf salad. A look of surprised delight flickered across his face, a connection made between his familiar world and Rohan\u2019s. In that moment, with the sounds of his parents\u2019 laughter mixing with the restaurant\u2019s chatter, Rohan felt he had successfully built a bridge between his two worlds."
