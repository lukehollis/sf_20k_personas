His commute is a short elevator ride from his company-provided apartment on the 10th floor to his office on the ground level. Born in Daly City to Gujarati immigrants, Rahul\u2019s upbringing was steeped in the hum of fluorescent lights and the scent of industrial-strength cleaner. His parents poured their life savings into a modest motel, and from a young age, Rahul was their de-facto handyman, front-desk clerk, and bookkeeper. He learned the language of leaky faucets and overloaded circuits long before he mastered algebra.\n\nWhile his parents hoped he\u2019d take over the family business, Rahul saw the relentless toil and yearned for something with more structure and less personal risk. He pursued an Associate\u2019s degree in Hospitality Management from a local community college, seeing it as a formalization of the skills he\u2019d acquired his whole life. During the dot-com boom, he saw an opportunity. Tech companies were building massive campuses that were essentially small cities, and they needed people who understood how buildings breathe. He leveraged his motel background into an entry-level facilities role at a burgeoning startup.\n\nHis career grew steadily. Rahul was reliable, practical, and had an uncanny ability to predict a problem before it happened. Now, at 45, he is the head Facilities Manager for a major tech company\u2019s residential tower. A key turning point was a serious relationship that ended five years ago; his partner grew tired of competing with late-night plumbing emergencies and vendor calls. The breakup solidified his quiet, solitary path. He knows the building\u2019s residents not as neighbors, but as work orders.\n\nHis days are a cycle of walk-throughs, contractor meetings, and monitoring building systems from his laptop. Though he lives in the heart of San Francisco, his connection to the city is observational. He sees the Bay Bridge from his window but rarely crosses it. His dream is a quiet one: to save enough to buy a small, four-unit apartment building in a quieter neighborhood like the Outer Richmond. He fantasizes about knowing his tenants by name, fixing their sinks himself, and recapturing the tangible sense of ownership he left behind at his parents\u2019 motel, but this time, entirely on his own terms."
