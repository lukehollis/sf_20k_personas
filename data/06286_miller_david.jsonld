The son of a civil engineer father and a librarian mother, he grew up with an appreciation for both structured systems and the stories they contain. This duality led him to pursue a BA in History, fascinated by how societies built, abandoned, and rebuilt their physical worlds. However, he felt a pull to not just study the past but to shape the future. This calling lured him west in the late 1990s to UC Berkeley\u2019s renowned Master of Urban Planning program, where San Francisco\u2019s chaotic, beautiful, and deeply complicated urban fabric became his new obsession.\n\nHe landed a junior planner position with the city right after graduation, brimming with ideals about equitable transit and beautiful public spaces. His early years were defined by long hours and the thrill of contributing to projects like the redevelopment of Hayes Valley after the Central Freeway came down. It was during this time he met Marcus, a landscape architect, at a public design forum. Their shared passion for the city\u2019s potential blossomed into a loving, 25-year partnership that has been David\u2019s anchor through countless political battles and bureaucratic stalemates.\n\nNow 53, his idealism has been weathered into a resilient pragmatism. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development; his top-floor condo in Hayes Valley now doubles as his office, a perch from which he reviews zoning codes and digital models of a city he knows intimately. His days have a quiet rhythm: coffee from a local cafe, hours wrestling with development proposals, and a mid-afternoon walk with Marcus through Patricia\u2019s Green\u2014a park he helped bring to life\u2014to clear his head.\n\nHaving seen dozens of grand plans wither on the vine of public debate, David\u2019s dream is no longer a utopian city. Instead, he aspires to shepherd one last, meaningful project to completion: a truly innovative affordable housing complex that integrates seamlessly into a neighborhood\u2019s character. He wants to leave a tangible legacy of thoughtful, human-centric design before he and Marcus can finally trade planning commission meetings for extended travels abroad."
