The daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, she grew up amidst the chaotic order of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Richmond District. Long before she knew the term \u2018logistics,\u2019 she was living it\u2014organizing canned goods, predicting the weekend rush for produce, and ensuring inventory met demand. This practical, fast-paced environment instilled in her a deep-seated work ethic and an appreciation for systems that simply *work*.\n\nChoosing to stay local, Christina earned her business degree from San Francisco State University, naturally drawn to the precision of logistics. She began her career in an entry-level position at a freight-forwarding company near SFO and methodically climbed the ladder. Her ability to foresee bottlenecks and streamline complex supply chains made her indispensable. The same meticulous planning that fueled her career, however, eventually created fractures in her 22-year marriage. Her ex-husband, Mark, often lamented that she managed their home life like a warehouse, a criticism she couldn't logically refute.\n\nThe divorce three years ago was a system failure she hadn\u2019t anticipated. Now, at 49, with her son away at college at UCLA, Christina finds herself in an unfamiliar silence. Her days remain structured: a 5:30 AM wake-up in her tidy Sunset District home, the 12.8-mile drive south to the industrial parks, and a day spent solving multimillion-dollar transportation puzzles. But her evenings are now hers to re-engineer.\n\nA native San Franciscan, Christina finds comfort in the city's permanence. The fog rolling over Twin Peaks is a constant she has known her entire life. She\u2019s slowly building a new personal framework, joining a hiking group that explores Lands End on weekends and taking a pottery class\u2014an exercise in embracing imperfection. Her aspirations are no longer about optimizing supply chains, but about optimizing her own happiness, finding a partner who appreciates her structured mind, and finally learning to build a life with room for beautiful, unscheduled chaos."

Seeing the bottleneck at the register, Christina grabbed an empty cardboard box, began sorting the newly arrived oranges by size, and created a second, faster-moving pyramid display. For a moment, the chaotic symphony of the store fell into perfect order, and a jolt of pure satisfaction shot through her. It was the first time she understood the power, the sheer beauty, of a working system.\n\n2.\nChristina remembers handing Mark the laminated itinerary for their anniversary trip to Hawaii. It was color-coded. She had been so proud of its efficiency. He just stared at it, his face falling. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a vacation, Tina,\u201d he\u2019d said quietly, \u201cit\u2019s a shipment schedule. You\u2019ve created a spreadsheet for a soul.\u201d The criticism didn\u2019t feel angry, it felt deeply sad, and for the first time, she realized her greatest strength at work was a devastating liability in her marriage. The insight was chillingly logical.\n\n3.\nThe scratch of the pen signing the final divorce papers was the only sound in the sterile office. It felt less like a legal act and more like the final entry in a ledger, closing out an account at a catastrophic loss. Driving home, she felt an overwhelming sense of system failure. For twenty-two years, she had tried to optimize, streamline, and perfect their life together. The silence in her car wasn\u2019t peaceful; it was the deafening sound of an unsolvable logistical failure, one she had engineered herself.\n\n4.\nIt was the first Tuesday after dropping her son, Alex, at UCLA. She came home at 6:15 PM, her house immaculate, a chicken breast defrosting in the sink per her weekly meal plan. She walked past his empty room and the quiet hit her not as peace, but as a vast, unscheduled void. The perfect order of her home suddenly felt like a cage she had meticulously built for herself. That night, she didn\u2019t just feel lonely; she felt terrifyingly inefficient, with no urgent problem left to solve.\n\n5.\nHer hands were covered in slick, gray clay. The instructor told them to \u201ccenter the clay, then center yourself.\u201d Christina tried to force it, to logically will the lump into a perfect cylinder, but it just wobbled and collapsed into a pathetic heap. Her first instinct was frustration, a desire to scrape it clean and start again, correctly. Instead, looking at the mess, a laugh escaped her\u2014loud and genuine. It was a beautiful, hilarious failure. In that moment, she felt the first flicker of unscheduled joy."
