The son of a third-generation Japanese-American engineer from San Jose and an artist from rural Oregon, he grew up in Marin County feeling neither fully one nor the other. When asked his ethnicity, he often shrugs; the label \"None\" feels more honest than a string of hyphens. His childhood was spent hiking the trails of Mount Tamalpais, developing a profound connection to the coastal ecosystems that felt more like home than any cultural heritage.\n\nWhile his peers chased degrees, Ethan chased tides and revegetation projects. He found the structure of formal education stifling, opting instead for a self-directed path. After high school, he spent years doing hands-on conservation work: building trails in the Sierra, volunteering for Save The Bay, and taking technical courses in GIS mapping and watershed science at a community college. A turning point came when a small, forward-thinking environmental firm in SF hired him, valuing his immense practical knowledge over a traditional B.S. He quickly proved himself, becoming a respected consultant who specializes in urban watershed restoration and green infrastructure.\n\nNow 27, Ethan lives a life of quiet intention in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute means his workday is spent in a sunlit corner of his apartment, analyzing data and writing reports. His apartment is his sanctuary, filled with topographical maps, books on native plants, and a meticulously cared-for collection of succulents. His social life is small but deep, revolving around a rock-climbing group that meets at Mission Cliffs and a few old colleagues from his volunteering days.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is tactile and ecological. His daily routine involves breaking from his screen for long runs through Golden Gate Park, which he sees not as a park, but as a complex, man-made ecosystem full of potential. He knows the names of the trees, the paths of the seasonal creeks, and the best spots to watch for herons. Ethan\u2019s dream is to spearhead a major restoration project within the city\u2014perhaps daylighting a buried creek. He is a man who found his sense of belonging not in people or history, but in the enduring, resilient nature of the land he now calls home."
