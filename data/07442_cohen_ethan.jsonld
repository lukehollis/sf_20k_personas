Raised in the intellectual austerity of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Ethan was the quiet son of a physics professor and a cellist. He grew up seeing the world as a series of complex systems to be deciphered, finding more comfort in the elegant logic of code than in the unpredictability of human interaction.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life came at sixteen, watching his grandmother\u2019s vibrant personality slowly fade into the fog of Alzheimer's. It was no longer an academic exercise; it was a deeply personal problem. This experience drove him to pursue a PhD in Computational Biology from Stanford, where he focused on modeling neurodegenerative diseases. He wasn\u2019t just studying a disease; he was trying to find the ghost in the machine that had stolen his grandmother.\n\nUpon graduating, Ethan and two colleagues secured venture capital to launch a small, specialized research initiative. They chose Mission Bay, the city\u2019s biotech heart, leasing a space that allowed for a small lab and living quarters. This setup perfectly suits Ethan\u2019s monomaniacal focus. His days are spartan and predictable: awaken, run code simulations over coffee, analyze data, and occasionally meet with his team in the lab downstairs. His social life is sparse, consisting of intellectually charged conversations with colleagues and a string of past relationships that withered from neglect. He simply couldn't offer the emotional bandwidth his work perpetually demanded.\n\nEthan\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn't with its iconic landmarks or vibrant culture, but with its immense concentration of intellectual capital. For him, the city is a gigantic, interconnected supercomputer, and he is one of its dedicated processors. His dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but to publish a single paper that fundamentally alters the understanding of neural decay\u2014to build a logical fortress against the chaos that he witnessed as a boy. He lives in San Francisco, but his home is the frontier of his research."
