The only child of a Korean immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father, she grew up in the East Bay suburbs amidst the fragrant, disorganized bustle of her family\u2019s restaurant. She watched her parents pour their souls into the business, only to see it fail from a lack of efficient processes\u2014untracked inventory, inconsistent recipes, and chaotic scheduling. The experience etched a core lesson into her young mind: passion isn't enough; survival requires a system.\n\nThis led her to pursue a Bachelor's in Sociology, fascinated by the invisible structures that govern human organizations. While her peers aimed for academia or social work, Sarah saw a different application. During a post-college internship at a burgeoning San Francisco startup, she was horrified by the brilliant but disorderly \"move fast and break things\" culture. It was her parents' restaurant all over again, just with more kombucha on tap. She found her calling not in writing code, but in streamlining the workflows for those who did. She built a career untangling complex processes, becoming the calm, methodical eye in the tech industry\u2019s storm.\n\nHer biggest turning point came three years ago. After a long-term relationship ended, she sold her condo in SoMa and bought a small apartment in Noe Valley. With her job now fully remote, her 0.0-mile commute redefined her connection to the city. San Francisco is no longer just her employer\u2019s location; it's her home. Her days are structured and serene: a morning walk to a 24th Street caf\u00e9 for an oat latte, focused work sessions punctuated by runs up the steep neighborhood hills, and evenings spent at a local pottery studio, a tactile escape from her digital world.\n\nAt 37, Sarah feels a quiet contentment but yearns for a new kind of impact. Her ultimate dream is to leave the corporate world and launch a consulting practice for small businesses, helping family-run shops and restaurants build the efficient foundations her own parents never had. For Sarah, improving a process isn't just about saving time or money; it\u2019s about giving a dream the structure it needs to thrive."
