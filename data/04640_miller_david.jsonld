Born in the Sunset District to Cantonese immigrants, they chose \"David\" for its American ease, hoping it would smooth his path. Growing up, he was suffocated by their love, which was expressed as a rigid set of expectations: excel in math, pursue a stable career in tech or finance, and honor the sacrifices they made crossing an ocean for him. He followed the script, enrolling in a business program at UC Davis, feeling a constant, low-grade sense of dislocation.\n\nThe turning point came not as a single event, but as a slow, painful awakening during his early twenties. His younger sister began to struggle with a severe eating disorder, a condition his parents, steeped in cultural stigma, couldn't comprehend or name. David witnessed firsthand the family\u2019s helplessness and the chasm between their private suffering and the healthcare system. It was a compassionate, perceptive hospital social worker who finally built a bridge, not just for his sister, but for his parents. In that professional, David saw a path he never knew existed\u2014one that used empathy as a tool and healing as a goal.\n\nAgainst his parents\u2019 tearful objections, he pivoted. He finished his business degree but immediately enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at SF State. The work was demanding but, for the first time, felt authentic.\n\nNow, at 40, David lives in a quiet Inner Richmond apartment where his commute is the few steps from his kitchen to his home office. From a room with a large bay window overlooking the fog-dusted streets, he conducts telehealth sessions as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major hospital network. His days are a structured rhythm of listening to others\u2019 traumas, guiding them through anxiety and loss. His own life is quiet; a long-term relationship ended a year ago, leaving a space he fills with long walks in Golden Gate Park and dinners with a small, close-knit circle of friends.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into his soul\u2014he sees both the city of his childhood and the rapidly changing metropolis of today. His ultimate dream is to open a small private practice focused on providing culturally competent therapy for the AAPI community, creating a space where the next generation doesn't have to choose between their heritage and their well-being."

He was nine, struggling with a word problem, and his father stood over him, tapping a finger on the page. \"Think, David. Not just feel.\" The smell of his mother\u2019s black bean sauce hung thick in the air, a scent of love so dense it was almost suffocating. It was the moment he learned that in his home, love and expectation were the same tangled knot, and his job was simply to excel, not to understand.\n\n2.\nThe hospital waiting room was fluorescent and cold, but he\u2019ll never forget the warmth in the social worker's voice. She sat with his parents, not talking about diagnoses, but about the fear of losing face, of failing in a new country. She used a simple metaphor\u2014a boat in a storm\u2014that finally made his father\u2019s eyes glisten with understanding, not anger. In that moment, David saw a new kind of strength: not a shield of achievement, but a bridge built of empathy. It was a revelation that changed his entire life\u2019s trajectory.\n\n3.\nHe was 24, clutching his SF State acceptance letter. He told his parents in their living room, the one with the plastic-covered furniture. His mother\u2019s silent tears were the hardest part, each one a tiny accusation of his selfishness. His father accused him of wasting their sacrifices on a \u201ctalking job.\u201d David felt a profound, gut-wrenching guilt, but underneath it, a defiant spark of authenticity. It was the first time he had truly chosen his own path, and the pain of their disappointment was the price of his own soul.\n\n4.\nLast month, during a telehealth session, a young client spoke of the pressure to be a \"good son,\" his voice cracking. He detailed a conflict with his immigrant parents so precisely that David felt a jolt of recognition, like hearing an echo of his own heart from twenty years ago. Looking at the young man\u2019s face on the screen, David wasn\u2019t just a therapist; he was a witness. The session solidified his resolve. His future practice wouldn't just be a job; it would be a sanctuary.\n\n5.\nA year after the breakup, he found a new kind of peace. On a foggy Tuesday, after his last session, he walked to Golden Gate Park. He sat on a bench near the Conservatory of Flowers, watching the mist drift through the cypress trees, feeling the quiet hum of the city he\u2019d always called home. There was no profound thought, just the damp air on his skin and a feeling of being perfectly, solitarily in place. He was alone, but for the first time in a long while, not lonely."
