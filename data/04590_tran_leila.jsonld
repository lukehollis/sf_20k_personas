The daughter of Vietnamese refugees who settled in San Jose, Leila grew up amidst the fragrant chaos of her parents' pho restaurant. She learned early on how a community is built not just from concrete and steel, but from the intricate web of small businesses, shared spaces, and walkable streets that anchor people to a place.\n\nHer professional calling was cemented in high school when a proposed freeway expansion threatened to cleave her vibrant community in two. Witnessing her parents and neighbors organize, fight, and ultimately win concessions from the city ignited a passion within her. She pursued this fire to UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Urban Planning, focusing her thesis on transit-oriented, equitable development. Starting as a junior planner, she quickly distinguished herself with her meticulous research and genuine commitment to community outreach, eventually rising to her Senior Urban Planner role with the city.\n\nNow 37, Leila lives in a light-filled apartment in Hayes Valley with her partner, an architect named Alex. Her life is a seamless blend of the personal and professional. Her 0.0-mile commute often means working from her dining table, enormous city maps and policy briefs spread before her. Most days, however, she takes the short walk to City Hall for meetings, grabbing a coffee from a local roaster en route. Evenings are often spent at contentious community board meetings or unwinding with Alex, their conversations invariably circling back to housing density and public space design.\n\nLeila\u2019s social circle is a tight-knit group of policy wonks, artists, and activists she\u2019s met through her work. Her deepest connection, however, remains with the city itself. She feels the pulse of its challenges\u2014the housing crisis, homelessness, gentrification\u2014as personal responsibilities. Her overarching dream is to spearhead a landmark project that creates a new model for truly mixed-income, sustainable housing in the city. She wants to leave a legacy not of iconic skyscrapers, but of thriving, equitable neighborhoods\u2014the kind of stable, supportive community her family once traveled across the world to find."

From her fort, she listened to the neighborhood\u2019s cadence: gossip, worries, and triumphs exchanged over steaming bowls of pho. She realized then that her parents weren't just selling food; they were curating a community. A business wasn't just a building, but a city's living room. This simple truth, learned on the sticky linoleum floor, became the unshakable foundation of her entire life's work.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she saw her father\u2014a man of quiet diligence\u2014stand before the city council, his voice trembling but firm. He spoke not of zoning codes, but of the walk to the market, of neighbors who relied on each other. The proposed freeway wasn't just asphalt; it was a blade meant to sever the community's heart. Watching her parents and their neighbors transform their fear into power that night, the abstract idea of planning became a visceral, personal crusade. It was the moment she knew what she had to fight for.\n\n3.\nShe was 28, a junior planner proudly presenting her first transit proposal. An elderly woman, whose family had run a corner store for fifty years, looked her in the eye and said, \u201cYou see a node, I see my home.\u201d The words hit harder than any professional critique. In that humbling moment, Leila\u2019s academic confidence shattered and was rebuilt as deep empathy. It taught her that community outreach wasn't a box to be checked, but the entire point of the work.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, walking through the Mission, she saw them. A family piling their life into a U-Haul while a sheriff stood by. Leila recognized the building; she\u2019d admired its facade, noting it for potential preservation. Now, it was a scene of silent, bureaucratic violence. The faces of the children, confused and scared, burned into her memory. The housing crisis was no longer a statistic on a policy brief; it was a personal failure she could feel in her own chest, fueling the urgency of her mission.\n\n5.\nLast year, after a brutal board meeting, she sat dejected at her dining table when Alex slid a napkin toward her. On it, he\u2019d sketched a solution\u2014a simple, elegant design for a pocket park on the disputed lot. As she picked up a pen and added lines for a community garden, their hands brushing, the frustration of the night dissolved into a spark of shared creation. In that quiet moment of partnership, she felt an overwhelming sense of hope, a belief that you could truly build a better world together."
