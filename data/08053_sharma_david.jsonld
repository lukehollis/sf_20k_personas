            "value": "David Sharma\u2019s identity is as layered as San Francisco itself. The son of a Salvadoran mother, Elena, and an Indian father, Raj, he grew up in the Excelsior District, his childhood a vibrant mix of pupusas and samosas, Spanish chatter and Hindi films. His parents, both service industry workers, instilled in him a profound sense of duty and a quiet, resilient work ethic. David was the steady one, the bridge between his parents' cultures and the mediator for his fiery younger sister, Sofia.\n\nHis educational journey began with promise at San Francisco State University, where he tentatively pursued a business degree. He wasn't passionate about it, but it felt like a practical path to stability. That path fractured when his mother was diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disease. David, then 21, dropped out of college to become her primary caregiver, learning on the fly how to manage medications, assist with mobility, and provide the constant, patient support she required. The experience was harrowing but transformative. In losing his planned future, he found an unexpected calling.\n\nAfter his mother passed away, David formalized his experience, taking on jobs as a professional caregiver. For the past two years, his life has been defined by a 0.0-mile commute. He is a live-in caregiver for Arthur, an 88-year-old retired history professor living in a quiet Inner Richmond row house. David\u2019s days are a structured routine of medication schedules, meal preparation, physical assistance, and listening to Arthur\u2019s stories of a bygone San Francisco. His connection to the city is now vicarious, seen through Arthur\u2019s windows or experienced in brisk grocery runs and pharmacy pickups.\n\nSocially, his world has shrunk. His main contact is his weekly video call with Sofia, now a teacher in Oakland. Though his current life is confining, David doesn\u2019t see it as a dead end. He is meticulously saving money with a clear goal: to enroll in a registered nursing program. He dreams of a future where he can have his own small apartment, maybe in the Sunset, and continue his work with the credentials to provide a higher level of care. For David, caregiving isn't just a job; it\u2019s an act of remembrance and the foundation of a future he is patiently building."
