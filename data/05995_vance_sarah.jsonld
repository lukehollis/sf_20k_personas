Raised in the Outer Richmond, she was the only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood Laundromat. Her parents, who sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, envisioned a secure future for her: doctor, lawyer, or engineer. Sarah, however, spent her childhood escaping into books and losing herself in the de Young Museum, mesmerized by the power of art to tell stories her parents\u2019 pragmatic world left unspoken.\n\nRebelling quietly, she enrolled at San Francisco State University and pursued a degree in Art History, a choice that created a silent rift with her family. After graduating with honors, she faced the harsh reality her parents had predicted: passion didn't pay the rent. Following a string of unpaid internships at struggling galleries, a sense of filial duty and financial desperation led her to take an administrative job at a downtown financial firm.\n\nThis \"temporary\" detour became her career. Sarah\u2019s meticulous, detail-oriented nature, honed by years of analyzing brushstrokes, made her exceptionally good at managing portfolios and client data. She was promoted to Financial Planning Assistant, a role she performs with quiet competence from the small, tidy one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley she\u2019s lived in for six years. The 0.0-mile commute gives her days a placeless quality, her world confined to spreadsheets and video calls.\n\nNow 35, Sarah lives a life of careful balance. By day, she helps wealthy clients plan their futures. By night, she nurtures the part of herself she fears is atrophyzing. She takes pottery classes in the Mission, attends film screenings at the Roxie, and spends weekends sketching strangers in Alamo Square. Her deepest aspiration isn't to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day open a small, non-profit gallery dedicated to emerging Bay Area artists\u2014a way to finally merge her practical skills with her enduring passion. She remains deeply tied to San Francisco, a city that represents both the sensible life she built and the creative one she still dreams of claiming."
