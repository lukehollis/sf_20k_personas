Raised in Berkeley by two linguistics professors, his childhood home was a library of human language, yet Ethan was always drawn to the language of life itself. He was a preternaturally bright but frustratingly unconventional student, often ignoring curricula to spend hours meticulously documenting the cellular structures of pond scum under a cheap microscope. His parents, recognizing his fierce intellect but mystified by its direction, could only provide support from a distance.\n\nHis formal educational journey was brief and volatile. He entered UC Berkeley\u2019s molecular biology program at 16 but dropped out after two years, maddened by the rigid pace and theoretical focus. He saw it as a distraction from the real work. For the next decade, Ethan became a ghost in the academic system, working odd jobs to fund a makeshift lab in his rented garage. It was there, fueled by sheer obsession, that he developed a novel predictive model for protein folding\u2014a breakthrough he published in an open-access journal.\n\nThat paper was his key. It was read by the founder of a small, ambitious San Francisco biotech startup who valued genius over credentials. Ethan was hired on the spot, his lack of a degree irrelevant in the face of his demonstrable results. He has been there ever since, rising to Senior Research Scientist through a series of foundational discoveries.\n\nNow 52, Ethan\u2019s life is his work. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; his Dogpatch loft is more laboratory than living space, the gentle hum of DNA sequencers a constant companion. A long-term relationship ended a decade ago, his partner unable to compete with his monastic devotion to the lab. His social connections are now limited to the intense, respectful debates he has with his colleagues. He loves San Francisco for its intellectual friction and the proximity of brilliant minds, though he rarely engages with the city beyond his immediate professional sphere. His dream is not wealth or fame, but to finally crack the code of the rare genetic disorder that took a childhood friend\u2014a quiet, personal quest that gives his solitary life its profound meaning."
