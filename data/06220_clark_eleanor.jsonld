The daughter of a pragmatic civil engineer and a thoughtful librarian, she grew up with an appreciation for both natural systems and the stories they held. Her childhood was spent on rainy hikes in the Columbia River Gorge, where her father would explain the engineering of the dams while her mother pointed out native flora. This blend of the practical and the poetic defined her worldview.\n\nHer educational journey took her south to UC Santa Barbara, where she initially declared a major in Political Science, fascinated by the structures of power and policy. However, a transformative summer internship with a small non-profit fighting coastal erosion solidified her true calling. She saw firsthand how policy directly impacted the delicate ecosystems she loved. She quickly added an Environmental Studies minor, realizing she could combine her analytical mind with her passion.\n\nUpon graduating, San Francisco was a natural fit\u2014a city at the forefront of environmental policy and innovation. Eleanor landed an entry-level position at a large environmental services firm. The initial work was grueling data analysis and report compilation, but her sharp insights into regulatory frameworks helped her climb quickly to the role of Environmental Consultant. The pandemic shifted her company to a permanent remote model, anchoring her life entirely within her Inner Richmond neighborhood.\n\nToday, Eleanor\u2019s 0.0-mile commute consists of moving from her small kitchen to the bay-window desk in her apartment, which she shares with a roommate. Her days are a structured rhythm of client calls, environmental impact assessments, and policy research, punctuated by foggy morning walks in Golden Gate Park\u2014her sprawling, essential backyard. Her social life is a close-knit circle of friends, often meeting for trivia at a neighborhood pub or exploring the city's farmers' markets.\n\nWhile she finds fulfillment in advising corporations on sustainability, Eleanor dreams of more direct impact. Her ultimate aspiration is to work in land-use policy for a conservation group like the Parks Conservancy, shaping the future of the very green spaces that sustain her spirit and define her connection to her adopted city."
