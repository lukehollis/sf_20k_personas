Born in a quiet Michigan suburb to a precise Korean-American engineer father and a free-spirited mother of mixed European heritage, he never felt he fully belonged to any single world. This outsider\u2019s perspective became his greatest asset. He was the kid who didn\u2019t just play with LEGOs; he tried to figure out why the company packaged them the way they did.\n\nWhile his peers pursued traditional university degrees, Michael saw the four-year track as an inefficient system. He bypassed formal higher education, instead taking an entry-level logistics job at a manufacturing company. There, his innate talent for seeing patterns and untangling operational knots couldn\u2019t be ignored. He would quietly redesign workflows on his own time, and his unsolicited reports\u2014brilliantly clear and effective\u2014eventually landed on a senior director's desk. This became his turning point. He was pulled into a special projects team, learning the language of efficiency and strategy through sheer practice. This was his real education, a self-made MBA forged in warehouses and boardrooms.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco a decade ago, drawn to the city's ethos of rewarding talent over pedigree. Now, at 39, he works as a successful independent management consultant. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his standing desk in his minimalist SoMa loft is a testament to the life he\u2019s built. Days are a blur of intense client calls, deconstructing organizational charts and supply chains for companies he rarely visits in person.\n\nTo decompress, Michael walks. He\u2019ll spend hours tracing the city\u2019s arteries on foot, from the industrial docks of Dogpatch to the quiet, fog-shrouded trails of the Presidio. San Francisco is his sanctuary, a complex, beautiful system he can appreciate without needing to fix. His social circle is small and carefully curated, valuing depth over breadth. He dreams not of a corporate title, but of achieving enough financial freedom to apply his unique problem-solving skills to ventures that matter to him\u2014perhaps advising a local non-profit or a startup focused on urban sustainability."
