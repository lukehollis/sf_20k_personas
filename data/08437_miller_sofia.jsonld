The only child of first-generation Mexican immigrants, she was raised in a small, bustling home where the scent of her mother\u2019s cooking mingled with the earthy smell of her father\u2019s backyard garden. Her parents, a seamstress and a mechanic, instilled in her a profound respect for resourcefulness and a deep, unspoken connection to the land they had left behind.\n\nA scholarship to UC Santa Barbara was her ticket out, where the coastal beauty ignited a passion for environmental science. This path led her to Duke University for a Master of Environmental Management, a world away from her working-class roots. It was there she honed her conviction: true environmental change required influencing the engines of industry, not just protesting from the outside.\n\nSofia moved to San Francisco for a junior consultant role, trading idealism for pragmatism. The corporate world was a culture shock, but she was effective, quickly rising through the ranks by translating complex ecological data into actionable, profitable business strategies. Her turning point came during a tense negotiation with a plastics manufacturer. Instead of feeling compromised, she felt a surge of power, realizing she had successfully argued for a multi-million-dollar investment in bioplastics from inside the boardroom.\n\nIn San Francisco, she met Mark Miller, a laid-back software engineer whose calm temperament balanced her intensity. They married and bought a cozy Edwardian flat in the Inner Sunset. Her commute is non-existent; she works from a home office overlooking the fog rolling in from the Pacific. Her days are structured: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, deep-focus work sessions advising Fortune 500 companies, and evenings spent testing new recipes with Mark or volunteering at a local community garden, a nod to her father's legacy.\n\nNow 42 and a Senior Sustainability Consultant, Sofia feels a pull toward her next chapter. She dreams of launching her own boutique consultancy, one that focuses on regenerative, community-based projects. Her ambition is no longer just to make corporations less bad, but to help them do genuine good, weaving the lessons of her East LA childhood into the fabric of global business."
