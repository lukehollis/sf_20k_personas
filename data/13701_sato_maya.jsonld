Born and raised in the Mission District, she is the daughter of a quiet, second-generation Japanese-American father, a graphic designer, and a vibrant Peruvian immigrant mother who ran a small, beloved catering business from their home. Growing up, Maya\u2019s world was a blend of her father\u2019s thoughtful minimalism and her mother\u2019s passionate, community-focused spirit. The air in their flat was a constant mix of frying yuca, simmering adobo, and the faint, clean scent of her father\u2019s ink pens. This upbringing instilled in her a deep empathy for the struggles and joys of navigating disparate worlds.\n\nHer path to social work felt less like a choice and more like a calling. While her friends dreamed of tech jobs, Maya was drawn to the community centers and support networks that held the city\u2019s diverse population together. A pivotal moment came in high school when she helped a non-English-speaking family, friends of her mother, navigate the city\u2019s complex housing aid forms. The gratitude in their eyes was a revelation, solidifying her decision to enact change on a personal level. She attended San Francisco State University, earning her Bachelor's in Social Work while working part-time at a local cafe.\n\nNow 24, Maya works as a case manager for a non-profit that supports first-generation high school students. Her daily 2.5-mile commute on the J-Church Muni line takes her from her shared apartment near Dolores Park to the organization's office. Her days are a whirlwind of school visits, family meetings, and connecting students with resources. She lives with two roommates\u2014a teacher and a barista\u2014and their evenings are often spent cooking together and decompressing from the emotional toll of their service-oriented jobs.\n\nMaya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she feels its pulse, both its vibrant, creative energy and the painful inequalities that push people to the margins. While she's currently focused on stabilizing her career, she dreams of one day launching a program that specifically addresses the needs of mixed-status immigrant families. For Maya, success isn\u2019t a high-rise office but a stronger, more equitable community, built one family at a time."

Her father was at one end, the clean lines of his sketchbook contrasting with the joyful chaos of her mother at the stove, the scent of cilantro and soy sauce mingling in the air. He\u2019d look up and smile quietly as her mother sang along to a cumbia on the radio. It wasn't a clash; it was a perfect, warm harmony. That feeling became her definition of home, teaching her that disparate parts could create a beautiful whole.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, she sat for hours at the library with the Rojas family, translating dense housing aid forms. The parents, friends of her mother, looked exhausted and defeated. When they finally signed the last page, Mrs. Rojas gripped her hand, her eyes shining with a gratitude so profound it felt like a physical force. In that moment, the vague idea of \"doing good\" crystallized into a tangible calling. It was the first time she truly understood the immense power held within a bridge of language and trust.\n\n3.\nDuring her SF State years, she worked the morning shift at a cafe. An elderly man would come in daily for the cheapest coffee, nursing it for hours. One morning, his frail hands fumbled his wallet, coins scattering. Maya quietly told him it was on the house, slipping a pastry into his bag. His nod of thanks was barely perceptible, but heavy with dignity. The memory cemented her belief that care wasn't just in policies, but in preserving the small, quiet moments of grace for people worn down by the city.\n\n4.\nJust last month, on a foggy J-Church ride home, the train lurched to a stop above Dolores Park. She watched a tech worker in expensive headphones, a mother juggling groceries and a stroller, and a musician with a worn guitar case. The stark differences in their worlds, all contained in one rattling train car, hit her hard. Instead of feeling despair, a quiet resolve settled in her chest. This was her city, this was her work\u2014to see everyone on this train not as strangers, but as neighbors.\n\n5.\nLast Sunday, she was chopping onions alongside her mother for a big batch of aj\u00ed de gallina. Her mother was talking about how she used her cooking to build community, to welcome people, to offer a piece of home. Maya suddenly saw her future with perfect clarity: not just a program, but a place. A kitchen, like this one, where mixed-status families could find resources, legal aid, and a hot meal. It was her mother\u2019s legacy and her father\u2019s thoughtful design, all in one."
