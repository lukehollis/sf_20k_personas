            "value": "Sarah Jenkins understands San Francisco in blueprints and memories. Adopted as an infant from Seoul by a loving academic couple from Davis, California, her childhood was a comfortable but culturally bifurcated experience. She was Sarah Jenkins, a bright girl who excelled in math and loved the planned, bike-friendly layout of her hometown, yet always felt a quiet pull towards the dense, chaotic urban landscapes she saw in photographs of her birthplace.\n\nThis pull became a calling during a junior year abroad in Seoul. The city\u2019s vibrant, vertical existence was a revelation, awakening a passion for understanding how millions of people could coexist and thrive in such a complex organism. This experience solidified her path, leading her to a Master's in Urban Planning from UCLA. After a few frustrating years working in Los Angeles, a city she felt was beholden to the automobile, she leaped at a chance to move north. San Francisco, with its unique geography and historic urban fabric, felt like a place where good planning could make a tangible difference.\n\nNow a Senior City Planner, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply entwined with the city she serves. From her apartment in Hayes Valley\u2014a neighborhood she loves for being a living example of successful urban redevelopment\u2014her commute is zero miles. Her days are a cycle of Zoom meetings debating zoning ordinances, poring over environmental impact reports, and analyzing demographic data.\n\nHer key turning point came five years ago, when a large-scale affordable housing project she\u2019d championed for years was mired in bureaucratic red tape and ultimately downsized. The defeat was crushing, transforming her from a bright-eyed idealist into a pragmatic realist who now fights smaller, winnable battles for bike lanes, parklets, and community gardens. Her personal life is quiet; a long-term relationship ended under the weight of her professional devotion. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow civil servants and neighborhood friends she meets walking her rescue terrier, Buster.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is twofold: professionally, she hopes to shepherd one last, significant housing project to completion before she retires. Personally, she aspires to finally return to Korea, not as a wide-eyed student, but as a woman seeking a deeper connection with the part of her identity she has only ever understood from a distance."
