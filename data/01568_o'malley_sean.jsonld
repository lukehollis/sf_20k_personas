Raised in Daly City, his father was a union plumber who taught his sons the value of a skilled trade and a firm handshake. Sean\u2019s childhood was filled with the sounds of tools and the smell of sawdust from the garage. School was never his arena; he was a kinetic learner, restless in a classroom but focused and adept when working with his hands. He barely graduated high school, with no interest in college, much to the quiet relief of his pragmatic parents.\n\nHis turning point came at 19 when his uncle, a master electrician, offered him a spot as an apprentice. It was grueling work, pulling wires through old Victorian walls and learning the intricate logic of the electrical code. Yet, for Sean, it was a revelation. He found a deep satisfaction in bringing light to a dark room and power to a silent building. He moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Outer Richmond, drawn to the ocean air and the neighborhood\u2019s unpretentious vibe.\n\nThe journey to Journeyman was his university. He worked through the lean years of the recession, taking any side job he could find, and eventually earned his full status. Now 37, Sean\u2019s life is one of disciplined routine. His 0.0-mile commute means his work van is parked outside his apartment; his day starts the moment he steps out the door. He works on everything from trendy new restaurants in the Mission to faulty outlets in Sunset family homes. He feels a tangible connection to San Francisco\u2014he is literally part of the city\u2019s circulatory system.\n\nSean\u2019s social life is centered around a tight-knit group of friends, mostly other tradespeople, who meet for beers at a no-frills pub near Golden Gate Park. A long-term relationship ended years ago over a classic San Francisco dilemma: she wanted to move to the suburbs for a bigger house, and he couldn\u2019t imagine leaving his city. His dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but something more grounded: to start his own small firm, \u201cO\u2019Malley Electric.\u201d He wants the autonomy to choose his jobs and the security of being his own boss, building a legacy of quality work, one circuit at a time, in the city that shaped him."
