Raised in Sacramento by an Irish-American family, her father, a mechanic, taught her the logic of tools and the satisfaction of building something that works. While her family valued practicality, Sarah was drawn to aesthetics, a conflict she resolved by enrolling in San Francisco State University\u2019s Set Design program in the early 1990s.\n\nShe spent her twenties and early thirties in the frenetic world of Bay Area fringe theater, building ephemeral worlds on shoestring budgets. The work was exhilarating but exhausting. A turning point came when a gallery-owner friend, desperate for help with a complex installation, hired Sarah for her problem-solving skills. She discovered a deep satisfaction in the quiet, precise work of a gallery space\u2014the careful lighting, the meticulous mounting, and the permanent impact of the art. She had found her niche.\n\nSarah leveraged her skills and a small inheritance to buy a live/work loft in the Dogpatch during the dot-com bust, a move that secured her future in the city. Her life is now seamlessly integrated. Her 0.0-mile commute means walking from her upstairs living quarters down to her ground-floor workshop, filled with tools, lumber, and fabrication equipment. Her days are a mix of planning in her loft, building custom mounts in her workshop, and overseeing installations at galleries across the city, from established SoMa spaces to pop-ups in the Mission.\n\nNow 50, Sarah is single after a long, amicable partnership with a musician ended a decade ago. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a handful of curators, artists who trust her implicitly with their work, and old friends from her theater days. Her dreams are no longer about grand artistic statements but about continuity and legacy. She hopes to mentor a younger generation of technicians, passing on the craft she has perfected. Her deepest aspiration is simply to remain in her loft, a quiet, essential force behind the scenes, the skilled hands that allow San Francisco\u2019s art to be seen in its best light."
