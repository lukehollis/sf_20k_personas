Growing up in a small town near Fresno, her childhood was defined by her younger brother\u2019s chronic illness. Sarah became a fluent translator of medical jargon and an expert at managing the family\u2019s anxieties, developing a profound empathy that would become her life\u2019s calling. This experience steered her toward a psychology degree at UC Davis and ultimately to San Francisco for her Master of Social Work.\n\nShe began her career in the trenches of a bustling downtown hospital, providing crisis intervention and discharge planning. The work was grueling but validating, affirming her purpose. The true turning point came with the global pandemic, which shifted her entire practice to telehealth. Now, her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to a carefully arranged corner of her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHer days are a structured rhythm of virtual sessions with patients, their faces pixelated windows into lives grappling with illness, grief, and fear. Between appointments, Sarah forces herself to leave the apartment, walking the foggy avenues to a favorite Clement Street bakery or seeking solace under the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. This ritual is crucial for separating the weight of her work from the sanctuary of her home.\n\nSocially, Sarah maintains a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly fellow healthcare workers who understand the unique pressures of their field. Though dedicated to her career, she yearns for a deeper personal connection, a challenge in a city where her work-from-home life limits casual encounters. Her dream is to eventually open a small private practice focused on supporting families of chronically ill children, a direct homage to her own origins. For now, she finds meaning in her daily work, a quiet anchor in a city of constant change, offering compassion one video call at a time."
