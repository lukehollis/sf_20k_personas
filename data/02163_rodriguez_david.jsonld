            "value": "David Rodriguez is a product of an older, grittier San Francisco. Born in the Mission District to hardworking parents from Jalisco, Mexico, his childhood was scored by the rhythm of MUNI buses and the aroma of carnitas from neighborhood taquerias. He was the first in his family to attend college, earning a practical Bachelor's in Business Administration from San Francisco State University, a degree his father, a lifelong cook, viewed with a mix of pride and confusion.\n\nDavid entered the workforce just as the first dot-com wave was cresting. While his peers were chasing stock options as coders, David found his calling in the less glamorous but essential world of operations. He wasn\u2019t the architect of the code, but the one who made sure the servers were ordered, the offices ran smoothly, and the product actually shipped. He weathered the dot-com bust by being indispensable, a steady hand who knew how to manage chaos and tighten a budget. For over two decades, he navigated the booms and busts of Silicon Valley, evolving into a respected Operations Manager for a now-stable enterprise software company.\n\nA key turning point was meeting his wife, Sarah, a pragmatic elementary school teacher, who anchored him outside the tech world's volatility. Together, they bought a home in the foggy Inner Sunset, a world away from the Mission's sun and noise, and raised their daughter, now away at college. The pandemic-induced shift to remote work was another seismic event. The grueling commute vanished, replaced by a 0.0-mile walk to his home office.\n\nNow 51, David\u2019s days are a quiet routine of Zoom calls, navigating global logistics from his keyboard, and taking afternoon walks with his dog around Golden Gate Park. He feels a profound, sometimes melancholic, connection to the city. He\u2019ll still drive to the Mission for a proper burrito, observing the gentrification with a pragmatist's sigh. His ambitions are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. He dreams of traveling more with Sarah, perfecting his backyard grilling, and one day mentoring young, first-generation students trying to find their own non-coding path into the complex world of tech."
