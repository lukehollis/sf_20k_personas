Raised in the post-Soviet industrial haze of Varna, Bulgaria, his childhood was defined by resourcefulness. His father, a laid-off factory mechanic, taught him that anything could be fixed with patience and the right leverage. His mother taught him stoicism. Ivan\u2019s formal education ended at a technical high school, but his real learning took place in the greasy engine bays and sputtering electrical panels of his family\u2019s apartment block.\n\nAt 21, lured by a cousin\u2019s exaggerated tales of opportunity, Ivan arrived in the U.S. with a sparse vocabulary and hands already calloused from work. His first years were a blur of under-the-table construction jobs in New York, learning the language through shouted instructions on loud job sites. A turning point came when an older contractor, seeing Ivan\u2019s innate talent for diagnosing problems others missed, took him on as an apprentice, teaching him American building codes and the art of client communication.\n\nHe followed a job to San Francisco seven years ago and never left. The city\u2019s frantic energy was overwhelming, but he found his anchor in the Inner Richmond. Here, his 0.0-mile commute is a function of his life: Ivan is the live-in superintendent of a classic, bay-windowed 1920s apartment building. His small basement unit is both his home and his workshop, the scent of sawdust and machine oil a constant comfort.\n\nHis daily routine is the building\u2019s rhythm. He\u2019s the quiet guardian of its aged plumbing and wiring, a familiar figure to the dozen tenants who know him as the man who can fix anything. His social connections are forged over leaky faucets and jammed windows; he\u2019s closer to the elderly Mrs. Chen in 3B than anyone his own age. He keeps to himself but is never truly alone, the building\u2019s hum a constant companion.\n\nIvan\u2019s dream is simple and solid: to save enough to buy a small, rundown multi-unit property of his own somewhere in the Bay Area. He spends his quiet evenings sketching out floor plans and watching home renovation shows, fantasizing about the day he\u2019ll be fixing his own foundation, building a life as sturdy and reliable as his repairs."

When the lights in their Varna flat finally held steady, his father didn't smile, but nodded once\u2014a shared acknowledgment. It wasn't just about electricity; it was about imposing order on decay. Ivan learned then that reliability was a kind of quiet love, a promise kept against the encroaching chaos. That single nod from his father became the bedrock of his work ethic.\n\n2.\nIn a dusty Brooklyn brownstone, he saw the foreman yelling about a new junction box that kept tripping. Terrified, Ivan pointed to the schematic, then to the crossed wires, his English too broken to explain. The older contractor, Marcus, silenced the foreman and watched Ivan work. After, Marcus clapped him on the shoulder and said, \"Kid, you see the bones of a place.\" For the first time in America, Ivan felt his mind was valued more than his muscles. It was the beginning of his real education.\n\n3.\nHis first night in the San Francisco basement unit, the city outside was a roar of sirens and foghorns. It felt alien and vast. But inside, he heard the low hum of the boiler and the gentle groan of the building's old bones settling. He placed a hand on the cool concrete wall, feeling the structure's faint pulse. This, he understood. The building wasn't just a job; it was an anchor. He wasn't lost in the city; he was at its very foundation, keeping it steady.\n\n4.\nMrs. Chen\u2019s heirloom teapot was chipped, but the jasmine tea she poured was fragrant and warm. He had just spent an hour unsticking her painted-shut bay window, expecting only a polite nod. Instead, she insisted he sit. She didn\u2019t speak much English, and he spoke no Cantonese, but she pointed at pictures of her grandchildren. In that small kitchen, he wasn't the super. He was a guest. That simple act of being offered a seat felt more significant than any payment he\u2019d ever received, softening his stoicism.\n\n5.\nIt was a small, neglected duplex in the Outer Sunset, salt-scarred and sagging. Most saw blight; Ivan saw good bones. He got off the bus and stood on the sidewalk, mentally gutting the interior, rerouting the plumbing, and reframing the porch. He could already smell the fresh paint and sawdust. That decaying building wasn't an eyesore; it was a blueprint for his future. The vague dream of \"a property\" suddenly had an address, giving his daily work a powerful, tangible purpose."
