Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving Caucasian couple, his surname was his first lesson in being different. He grew up cherished but perpetually navigating a subtle sense of otherness. His well-meaning parents, an engineer and a dental hygienist, encouraged a practical path. Following their advice, Alex enrolled in the Computer Science program at UC Davis, trying to code his way into a future that felt secure, yet profoundly alien.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. Staring at lines of Python code, Alex felt a complete and total emptiness. He dropped out, a decision that fractured his relationship with his parents, and spent a year drifting through temp jobs. One of those gigs was a last-minute request to help supervise an after-school program at a community center. Surrounded by the chaotic, unfiltered energy of young children, something clicked. He wasn\u2019t just good with them; he felt a sense of purpose he\u2019d never found in a computer lab. This was his calling.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco, drawn by its promise of acceptance and community. He settled in a small in-law unit in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood where he could finally blend in and stand out on his own terms. He found a job as a teacher's aide at a small, play-based preschool just three blocks from his apartment. His zero-mile commute is a cornerstone of his life, allowing him to be deeply embedded in his community. His days are a whirlwind of tying shoes, mediating disputes over toy dinosaurs, and finding wonder in sidewalk chalk art.\n\nNow 31, Alex\u2019s life is simple but rich. His social circle revolves around fellow teachers and the families from the school, a found-family that feels more authentic than any he's known. He spends his weekends exploring Golden Gate Park or trying new restaurants on Clement Street. His dream is no longer about financial success but about impact. He\u2019s slowly saving and taking online classes, hoping to earn his Early Childhood Education credential and one day open his own small, community-focused preschool. For the first time, Alex feels completely, unreservedly, himself."
