The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small grocery on Taraval Street, Kevin\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese tradition and American aspiration. His parents preached the gospel of hard work and education, seeing it as the only ladder out of their grinding, seven-day work week. Kevin, a quiet and observant boy, found his own world in the glow of a Commodore 64, a gift from a savvier uncle.\n\nHe followed the prescribed path, earning a computer science degree from UC Davis and landing a coveted software engineering job at a behemoth in Silicon Valley. For a decade, he was a model employee, climbing the corporate ladder. Yet, he felt like a highly-paid cog in a vast, impersonal machine. Seeking a new perspective, he enrolled in the part-time MBA program at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. It was there, surrounded by ambitious thinkers, that he realized his true value wasn\u2019t in writing code, but in translating complex technical concepts for business leaders.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. After seeing a promising project he\u2019d poured a year into get unceremoniously axed by a new VP, he resigned. He cashed in some stock options, traded his soul-crushing Caltrain commute for a home office, and launched Wong Digital Strategy from his Hayes Valley condo.\n\nNow 43, Kevin\u2019s life is defined by a deliberate sense of scale. His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to a spare bedroom overlooking a shared courtyard. His clients are mid-sized companies that value his direct, no-nonsense approach. He lives with his partner of eight years, Alex, a landscape architect whose love for native plants provides a welcome analog balance to Kevin\u2019s digital world. Mornings are for strong coffee from a local roaster and deep work; afternoons often include a walk through the neighborhood to clear his head. As a native, he feels a deep, sometimes fraught, connection to the city\u2019s constant evolution. His dream isn\u2019t to build a unicorn startup, but to grow his business sustainably, mentor a few promising local entrepreneurs, and enjoy the city he\u2019s always called home, on his own terms."
