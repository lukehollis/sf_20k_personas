Born in Daly City to a stoic Lebanese machinist and a warm, community-minded Filipina nurse, he grew up a quiet observer, translating not just languages but entire worldviews at the dinner table. This upbringing instilled in him a deep fascination with the systems\u2014both seen and unseen\u2014that allow disparate communities to function side-by-side.\n\nHis path was set during his time at UC Berkeley, where he was studying political science when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake struck. Witnessing the city\u2019s infrastructure fail while its communities rallied together solidified his calling. He pursued a Master's in Public Policy and dedicated his career to the City of San Francisco, methodically climbing the ranks to become a Senior Policy Analyst. He analyzes the city he loves not through a poet's eyes, but through data sets and zoning codes, specializing in the intractable problem of housing.\n\nHis personal life has been quieter. An amicable divorce over a decade ago left him living alone in the Hayes Valley condo he wisely purchased in the late '90s. His world is now largely confined to these walls, evidenced by his 0.0-mile commute. His days are a disciplined routine of coffee, policy memos, and Zoom calls, punctuated by evening walks through his neighborhood\u2019s manicured chaos. His primary connection is his daughter, Maya, a tech engineer in Oakland with whom he shares a weekly Sunday dinner, a ritual he guards fiercely.\n\nAt 53, David feels like a permanent fixture in a city defined by transience. He\u2019s seen booms and busts, utopian ideals and harsh realities. While he appears content in his structured life, he secretly dreams of leaving the bureaucratic maze. He pictures a small consulting firm, helping nonprofits cut through the red tape he knows so well. More personally, he hopes to one day travel to Beirut and Manila with Maya, finally connecting the endpoints of the map that shaped him."

His mother countered with a soft but firm response in Tagalog, her hands never ceasing their motion as she served rice. He was the quiet fulcrum, translating not the words, but the intent\u2014the pride, the worry, the exhaustion. In the silence between their languages, he learned to see the invisible structures that held his own small world together. It was his first, most vital systems analysis.\n\n2.\nOctober 17, 1989. The ground didn\u2019t just shake; it roared. From his dorm room window at Berkeley, the city seemed to be tearing itself apart. But in the hours that followed, he saw something else entirely. He watched neighbors, strangers moments before, forming human chains to clear debris and check on the elderly. The city\u2019s physical infrastructure had failed catastrophically, but its human infrastructure held fast. The abstract theories of his political science classes evaporated, replaced by the profound, tangible truth of community resilience. He knew then what he had to do.\n\n3.\nThe Hayes Valley condo felt immense and silent after the divorce. His daughter, Maya, then twelve, spent her first weekend in the new quiet. David found her taping glow-in-the-dark stars to her ceiling. She peeled one off the sheet and handed it to him. \"For your room, Dad. So you have a map.\" That night, lying in bed, he stared at the single, faint star. The gesture didn\u2019t erase the loneliness, but it gave it a focal point. The condo stopped being a piece of real estate and started being a home.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a contentious public hearing in the Mission around 2015. He presented his team's housing density plan, every slide backed by impeccable data and equitable zoning logic. He felt prepared, correct. Then, an elderly woman stood up, her voice trembling, and spoke not of floor-area-ratios but of the bakery she could no longer smell, of neighbors long since displaced. In that moment, his elegant charts felt like a foreign language, and he realized with a sinking heart the vast, unquantifiable distance between a policy and a person\u2019s life.\n\n5.\nJust last Sunday, Maya was explaining some intricate piece of code, her brow furrowed with the same concentration his father had on the factory floor. Mid-sentence, she looked out his window towards the Bay Bridge and said, \"I wonder if the coffee tastes the same in Beirut.\" The casual question landed with the force of a revelation. His secret dream wasn't a departure from his life, but the fulfillment of it. It wasn't about leaving\u2014it was about arriving, finally, with the most important part of his world beside him."
