Born in Fremont to parents who had left Mumbai for the promise of California\u2019s tech boom, Priya grew up amidst expectations of a lucrative career in engineering or medicine. However, from a young age, she was more drawn to the human systems than the computerised ones, often translating for neighbors and helping their children navigate the school system. This innate pull towards service created a gentle friction with her parents' dreams for her.\n\nHer decision to pursue a Bachelor's in Social Work at UC Berkeley was a definitive turning point. It was there she found her language and purpose, solidifying her belief that true progress is measured by a community's well-being. After graduating, Priya didn\u2019t chase a high salary; she dove into the challenging world of frontline case management in Oakland, working with newly arrived families. The burnout was real, but witnessing the systemic barriers firsthand ignited a new ambition: to fix the system, not just patch its wounds.\n\nThis ambition propelled her into program management. She moved to San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district 15 years ago, drawn to its diversity, proximity to Golden Gate Park, and reliable Muni lines. Now 48, Priya is the Program Manager for a non-profit that integrates health and wellness services into public schools. Her daily routine is grounded. It begins with a walk to a small bakery on Clement Street for coffee, followed by a 2.5-mile Muni ride where she listens to policy podcasts. Her days are a demanding mix of grant writing, staff management, and advocating for her students.\n\nPriya is single, having amicably ended a long-term relationship years ago. Her family is a tight-knit circle of friends from the non-profit world. Evenings are for unwinding with a walk through the park, cooking, or enjoying potlucks with her chosen family. Priya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; she sees its flaws but fiercely believes in its potential. Her dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of impact\u2014to secure enough funding to see her health program implemented city-wide. She hopes one day to mentor a successor and take a long-overdue trip to India, not as a tourist, but to reconnect with the world her parents left behind, having built a meaningful one of her own."

She was 19. \"Social Work,\" she had said, the words feeling both fragile and monumental. She saw the disappointment in her father\u2019s eyes, not anger, but a deep, quiet grief for the daughter he had imagined. In that silence, Priya felt the first true, painful, and liberating cost of her own conviction. It was the moment she chose her path, not in rebellion, but in quiet alignment with herself.\n\n2.\nYears later, in a cramped Oakland office, Priya remembers holding a crumpled eviction notice for a family she\u2019d worked with for months. A translation error on a form had unraveled everything. The mother\u2019s weary resignation was more devastating than tears. Priya felt a cold, clarifying anger rise through her exhaustion. It wasn't enough to be a bandage; the wound was systemic. That day, she stopped wanting to just help people navigate a broken system and started planning how to tear down its walls from the inside.\n\n3.\nHer first Thanksgiving in the Inner Richmond, around age 36. Her apartment was too small for the dozen friends from the non-profit world who crammed inside, balancing plates on their laps. The air was thick with the smell of roasting turkey, saag paneer, and tamales. Laughter echoed off the walls. Looking around at this patchwork family\u2014built on shared purpose, not blood\u2014Priya felt a profound sense of peace settle over her. This, she realized, was the life she had built. She was truly home.\n\n4.\nIt was just a folded piece of construction paper, left on her desk two years ago. Inside, in a child\u2019s careful cursive, it said, \u201cThank you Ms. Joshi. The nurse helped me feel brave.\u201d The note was from a shy third-grader who, through her school wellness program, had finally gotten glasses and the confidence to speak in class. Priya has kept it ever since. On days buried in spreadsheets and grant proposals, she touches the paper and remembers the one, tangible reason she fights so hard.\n\n5.\nOn a difficult evening last year, after losing a major grant, she walked deep into Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. The world dissolved into a soft, grey quiet. Then she heard it: the low, mournful call of a foghorn from the bay. It was a sound that didn't demand anything, simply stated its presence. In that moment, the city felt less like a problem to be solved and more like a companion, breathing alongside her. Her frustration softened into a familiar, fierce resolve."
