Born in Daly City to a Filipino father who served in the U.S. Navy and a second-generation Basque-American mother, his heritage is as layered as San Francisco itself. Growing up, his world was one of practicality; college was a distant concept compared to the immediate need to earn a living. After graduating high school, Joaquin drifted through a series of service jobs, finding a comfortable anonymity in the background hum of restaurants and cafes.\n\nHis turning point came in his mid-twenties, while working a forgettable job at a dive bar in the Tenderloin. An old-timer bartender, a man named Sal, saw a flicker of potential in Joaquin\u2019s quiet efficiency. Sal took him under his wing, teaching him that bartending wasn't just pouring drinks\u2014it was a craft of chemistry, history, and psychology. Joaquin became obsessed, devouring books on spirits and memorizing classic recipes. This newfound passion became his career ladder, leading him from dives to respected lounges, and finally to his current role as Lead Bartender at a sophisticated, jazz-infused cocktail bar in Hayes Valley.\n\nNow 48, Joaquin\u2019s life has a quiet, established rhythm. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a cherished sanctuary from the city's churn. His commute is a daily ritual: the N-Judah streetcar, where he reads or simply watches the diverse cross-section of the city roll by. His evenings are his stage. Behind the polished mahogany bar, he is calm, precise, and a masterful listener, known for his perfect Sazeracs and his ability to hold the stories of his regulars in confidence.\n\nHe has a close-knit circle of industry friends and is respected as a mentor by younger staff. While the dream of owning his own bar has faded\u2014he\u2019s seen the stress break too many good people\u2014a new aspiration has taken its place. Joaquin is saving to take a long-overdue pilgrimage, to visit both the small villages of the Basque Country and the coastal towns of the Philippines. He wants to walk the lands of his ancestors, to understand the disparate parts of himself, and perhaps, write down the stories he\u2019s collected over a lifetime of serving the city, one drink at a time."

Sal just grunted, \"Read it. All of it.\" For Joaquin, then in his mid-twenties, it wasn't just a book; it was a map. That small, stained volume transformed pouring cheap whiskey from a dead-end job into a discipline, a history, a craft. It was the moment someone finally saw a potential in him that he hadn\u2019t yet seen in himself.\n\n2.\nHe was maybe ten, standing in the doorway of his father\u2019s bedroom in Daly City. His dad, home from the ship, sat on the edge of the bed, meticulously polishing his black service shoes to a mirror shine. The smell of the wax and the rhythmic sound of the brush were a ritual of quiet dignity. Joaquin never forgot the precision in his father's hands. He feels that same focus now in his own hands\u2014not with a brush, but with a bar spoon, stirring a drink with the same deliberate, practiced care.\n\n3.\nThe day he got the keys to his Inner Richmond apartment, he walked in and just stood in the empty living room. It was 1999. Through the bay window, he could see the fog starting to creep over Golden Gate Park. The air smelled of old wood and floor wax. After years of drifting and sharing cramped spaces, the feeling was overwhelming: it was safety. This small, rent-controlled square was his anchor in a city that was constantly changing. It gave him the peace to build a life, not just a living.\n\n4.\nThe first perfect Sazerac wasn't for a critic, but for a notoriously stoic old man at a lounge where he'd just started. Joaquin performed the ritual: the absinthe rinse, the perfect dilution of the rye, the expressed lemon peel. He slid the chilled glass over, and the man took a slow sip. He didn\u2019t speak, but his eyes closed for a moment, and he gave a single, deliberate nod of approval. That silent acknowledgment felt more valuable than any shouted praise. It was the moment he knew he had truly arrived.\n\n5.\nA high-powered lawyer, one of his regulars, sat at the bar one Tuesday, her usual confident armor completely gone. She spoke in a low whisper about her mother\u2019s sudden illness, the words catching in her throat. Joaquin just listened, polishing a glass, his silence a container for her grief. He realized then, in his late thirties, that his most important job wasn't mixing drinks. It was holding the city\u2019s stories\u2014its triumphs and its heartbreaks\u2014and knowing when the most crucial ingredient was simply to be present and say nothing at all."
