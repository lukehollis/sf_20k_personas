The son of a civil engineer father and a librarian mother, his childhood was a quiet blend of structured logic and the boundless worlds found in books. While his parents appreciated his elaborate LEGO cities and stop-motion films, they viewed his artistic inclinations as a hobby, not a future. This gentle, unspoken skepticism fueled a quiet determination in Joshua to prove that design was a viable, tangible craft.\n\nHis educational journey took him from the University of Oregon's digital arts program to the competitive halls of Parsons in New York for his MFA. The shift from the laid-back Pacific Northwest to the relentless energy of NYC sharpened his ambition. He cut his teeth designing small interactive installations for Brooklyn galleries, a period marked by creative freedom and financial precarity. A key turning point came during a visit to San Francisco in the early 2010s; he saw the nascent fusion of tech and art not as a corporate sell-out, but as a new, well-funded canvas.\n\nHe moved west, initially taking a job as a UI designer that he found creatively stifling. He realized his passion wasn\u2019t for screens, but for the space between the screen and the person. This led him to a small experiential design agency, a perfect fit for his talents. Over a decade, he rose from senior designer to the creative director he is today, shaping immersive pop-up museums and interactive restaurant concepts.\n\nNow, Joshua lives in a tastefully renovated Victorian flat in the Mission with his partner, Lena, an architect. Their home is a testament to their shared aesthetic, filled with contemporary art and well-worn design books. His 3.8-mile bike commute through the city is a non-negotiable daily ritual, a time to observe the urban landscape that inspires his work. While professionally successful, Joshua aspires to create something with more permanence than a temporary brand activation\u2014a permanent public art piece or a museum wing. He dreams of leaving a lasting, joyful mark on the city he now calls home."

It wasn't just art in a building; the building *was* the art. For a kid who built LEGO cities, it was a profound revelation. In that moment, the hustle of Brooklyn felt small and the sterile white walls of its galleries, limiting. He knew his future canvas wasn't a frame, but the very fabric of this city.\n\n2.\nIt was 1 AM at his first SF startup job, around 2014. The glare of the monitor burned as he nudged a login button three pixels to the left for the fifth time. He felt his vibrant, ambitious MFA self shrinking to fit inside a hex code. Looking out at the sleeping city, he felt utterly disconnected from it, a ghost in the machine. That acute feeling of creative suffocation was the catalyst. He vowed then to design for hands, for senses, for the real world\u2014not just for clicks.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the opening night of the \u2018Lumiflora Garden,\u2019 his first lead project, in 2018. He stood anonymously in the crowd at Ghirardelli Square, watching a young girl touch one of the interactive petals. It bloomed with light and sound, and her gasp of pure delight was the most tangible metric he\u2019d ever experienced. In her joy, he felt the validation he'd craved since his childhood\u2014proof that his abstract ideas could create real, tangible wonder. This was why he had fought so hard.\n\n4.\nHe recalls the weekend he and Lena designed and built the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in their Mission flat. There was sawdust in their hair and a shared vocabulary of measurements and aesthetics that needed no translation. As they placed the final book\u2014a well-worn treatise on Bauhaus\u2014he saw their future. It wasn\u2019t just a shared home, but a seamless collaboration of life and art. The quiet satisfaction of that moment felt more profound and permanent than any professional award.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, during his morning commute, he stopped his bike at the peak of Dolores Street. He watched the fog peel back from the downtown skyline, a collection of permanent, steel ambitions. He felt a surge of pride for the fleeting joy his pop-ups brought to these streets, but it was followed by a quiet, determined yearning. He didn\u2019t just want to temporarily activate the city; he wanted to become a part of its permanent grammar. His dream of leaving a lasting mark was no longer abstract; it had a skyline."
