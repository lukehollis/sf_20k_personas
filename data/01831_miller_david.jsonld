As the Assistant Manager of a stylish North Beach home goods boutique, his commute is nonexistent, a fact that is both a practical blessing in San Francisco and a metaphor for his current stasis.\n\nBorn and raised in a quiet suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, David was the son of a plumber and a secretary. His parents valued stability and hard work, and were cautiously proud when he enrolled in Ohio State\u2019s graphic design program. For two years, David thrived, his world expanding with color theory and typography. But that world collapsed when his father suffered a major heart attack. David dropped out to return home, taking a grueling job at a local manufacturing plant to help with the bills. The dream of design was packed away like a college textbook.\n\nFive years later, with his father recovered but his own spirit languishing, David sold his car and bought a one-way bus ticket to San Francisco, a city that had only ever existed for him in photographs. He was drawn by the promise of reinvention. He found work in retail, initially as a stockroom employee. His quiet competence and innate eye for placement didn\u2019t go unnoticed. He was promoted, then promoted again, finally landing his current role.\n\nNow 37, David is a fixture in his North Beach neighborhood. The baristas at Caffe Trieste know his order, and the local bakery owner saves him a morning bun. His life is a loop of opening the store, managing inventory, helping tourists find the perfect gift, and closing up before climbing the stairs back to his quiet apartment. His relationships are pleasant but shallow, mostly confined to colleagues and the familiar faces of regular customers.\n\nLate at night, surrounded by the city's hum, David sometimes opens an old sketchbook, the pages filled with logos for imagined companies and layouts for non-existent magazines. His great, unspoken hope is to one day save enough to open his own small shop\u2014perhaps a bookstore combined with a gallery for local artists. It\u2019s a distant dream, but it's his. It represents a future where the commute, however short, is one of genuine passion, not just proximity."
