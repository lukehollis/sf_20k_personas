The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a successful engineering consultancy, Sarah grew up in the cradle of Silicon Valley. Her parents championed a path toward a lucrative, stable career in engineering or medicine, but Sarah was more fascinated by the social ripple effects of the technology her parents\u2019 generation was building. She saw both the immense opportunity and the growing disparity it created in the Bay Area.\n\nThis fascination led her to UCLA for an undergraduate degree in Political Science, followed by a pivotal internship with a state assemblymember. There, she realized her true calling was at the intersection of public service and emerging technology. She enrolled at UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy, earning a Master of Public Policy with a focus on tech ethics and urban development. Landing a role as a Policy Analyst for the City of San Francisco felt like a destiny fulfilled\u2014a chance to shape the governance of the very industry that had defined her upbringing.\n\nNow 33, Sarah lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins with a short walk from her coffee maker to the desk tucked into her bay window. Her days are a mix of dense data analysis, virtual stakeholder meetings, and drafting policy briefs on issues like digital privacy and equitable AI implementation for city services.\n\nHer life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Lunch is often a sandwich from a local deli eaten at Patricia's Green, and she unwinds with evening yoga classes nearby. Her close-knit circle of friends, a mix of grad school peers and work colleagues, often meets for drinks at a nearby wine bar. Though she enjoys dating, she finds it a challenging landscape but remains hopeful of finding a genuine partnership.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. She feels a profound responsibility to help steer its technological future towards a more inclusive path. Her dream is to author a landmark piece of local legislation that becomes a model for other cities, ensuring that technology serves all residents, not just the privileged few. She hopes to one day trade her rent for a mortgage, cementing her place in the city she is trying so hard to improve."
