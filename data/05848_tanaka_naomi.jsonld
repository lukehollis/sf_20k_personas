A third-generation Japanese American, she was born and raised in San Jose by parents who embodied the *gaman* spirit\u2014enduring hardship with stoic silence. They were loving but reserved, having absorbed the anxieties of their own parents who had been interned during WWII. Growing up, Naomi sensed a profound, unaddressed sorrow in her home, a feeling that drew her to understand the inner lives of others.\n\nHer path became clear during her time at UC Berkeley. While she excelled in her sociology coursework, it was her younger brother\u2019s struggle with severe depression, met with her family\u2019s bewildered inaction, that became her turning point. Witnessing their inability to offer emotional support, Naomi committed herself to a career where she could provide the empathy and tools her own family lacked. She earned her Master of Social Work from Berkeley and dedicated herself to healthcare, eventually becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker.\n\nNow 46, Naomi lives a contained life in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development; after years in a hospital setting, she transitioned her practice entirely to telehealth during the pandemic and never looked back. Her small, meticulously kept apartment is both her sanctuary and her office. Her days are a structured sequence of virtual sessions, guiding patients through trauma, grief, and anxiety. To decompress, she takes long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park, the fog-laced cypress trees offering a quiet companionship.\n\nHer social circle is small but deep, consisting mainly of a few other healthcare professionals who understand the toll of compassionate work. She is single, having found that building the kind of partnership she desires requires an emotional availability she has long dedicated to her clients. Naomi\u2019s dream is to write a book exploring intergenerational trauma in Asian American families, translating her clinical insights into a resource for people like her parents. For now, she finds fulfillment in her work, a quiet mending of wounds, both for her clients and, in a way, for herself."
