The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1970s, she was raised under the immense weight of her parents\u2019 expectations. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a pharmacist, saw education as the only path to stability. Priya, a quiet, methodical child, excelled, finding solace in the clean logic of mathematics and computer science. She absorbed the Bay Area\u2019s burgeoning tech culture by osmosis, seeing it not as revolutionary but as the family business.\n\nHer educational journey took her to Carnegie Mellon for a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction. It was there she met Robert Miller, a charismatic fine arts student whose chaotic, paint-splattered world was the antithesis of her own. He taught her to see beauty in imperfection, and she gave his creative spirit a gentle anchor. They married and moved to San Francisco, a city that could hold both of their ambitions. Priya quickly made a name for herself, securing a foundational patent in haptic feedback technology that would later become ubiquitous.\n\nThe turning point came fifteen years ago when Robert died suddenly from a brain aneurysm. The loss shattered her world, leaving her to rebuild with the only tools she trusted: logic and code. She poured her energy into her work, becoming a senior research scientist at a leading tech firm but opting to work remotely long before it was common.\n\nToday, Priya lives in a minimalist SoMa loft that doubles as her lab. Her commute is the ten steps from her kitchen to her workstation. Her days are a disciplined routine of yoga at dawn, followed by long, focused hours manipulating complex data and mentoring junior researchers over video calls. Her social life is sparse\u2014a weekly dinner with her brother, a chef in the Mission, and occasional attendance at a symphony or gallery opening, a quiet homage to Robert. San Francisco is less a city she inhabits and more of a backdrop to her insulated existence. Now, at 51, she feels a new restlessness. Her current aspiration is to pivot, using her expertise to develop technology for artistic expression or aiding memory care patients\u2014a project that seeks to bridge the two worlds she has loved, finally finding a way to make them whole."
