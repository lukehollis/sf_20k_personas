Raised in a small town outside Portland, Oregon, she was the daughter of a meticulous custom cabinetmaker. While her father shaped wood with his hands, Megan was drawn to the digital world, spending hours creating intricate structures in early computer-aided design (CAD) programs. Her upbringing was a quiet push-and-pull between tangible craft and digital precision, a duality that would come to define her entire career.\n\nShe pursued Industrial Design at the University of Oregon, where she discovered her true passion in the campus\u2019s fledgling maker space. A key turning point was a project to design and build a complex cantilever chair. Her digital model was flawless, but the physical prototype, assembled from 3D-printed joints and laser-cut plywood, collapsed under its own weight. This failure was a profound lesson: the beauty was in bridging the gap between the digital dream and physical reality. It was this challenge that propelled her to San Francisco after graduation, the epicenter of innovation and fabrication.\n\nNow, at 30, Megan is a Digital Fabrication Specialist at a prototyping firm in Dogpatch. She spends her days translating the concepts of engineers and artists into tangible objects, operating industrial-grade 3D printers and CNC machines. Her 2.1-mile bicycle commute from her bright but compact apartment in the Mission is a daily ritual, a gust of wind and kinetic energy before a day of intense focus. She knows the best taquerias and coffee shops along her route intimately, feeling more connected to the city\u2019s streets than to its skyline.\n\nSocially, Megan maintains a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow makers, a rock-climbing partner, and a former roommate who\u2019s now a chef. After a long-term relationship ended a year ago, she\u2019s poured her energy into her craft. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder but to save enough to open her own specialized fabrication studio, a space where independent creators can access high-end technology. It would be the perfect synthesis of her father\u2019s workshop and a Silicon Valley lab, a place where she can finally help others make their own digital dreams real."

The air was thick with the sharp, clean scent of cedar as he hand-sanded a cabinet door, his calloused fingers tracing the grain. On her lap, an old laptop displayed the perfect, sterile lines of a digital house she was building. She felt a quiet, powerful pull between his tangible world and her glowing screen. It wasn\u2019t a conflict, but a question planted in her mind\u2014a question she would spend her entire life trying to answer.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the sharp, hollow crack of plywood in the university maker space. Her cantilever chair, so impossibly elegant on the monitor, lay in a pathetic heap of splinters and fractured joints. A hot flush of failure and public shame rose in her cheeks. But looking from the glowing, perfect model to the physical ruin, she felt a new kind of purpose click into place. The real art wasn't just in the digital dream; it was in the messy, frustrating, beautiful work of making it hold.\n\n3.\nShe remembers a bike ride home six months after moving to San Francisco. She wasn't looking at the skyline, but at the street. The heavy scent of frying carnitas from a taqueria, the flash of a new mural in Clarion Alley, the specific rattle of her tires over a utility cover. A sudden gust of wind pushed her up Valencia Street. In that moment, she realized she hadn\u2019t just moved to a city; she had found her frequency, a connection forged by velocity and vibration.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the night after her long-term relationship ended, when the silence in her apartment felt structural, like it might bring the walls down. Instead of sinking into it, she biked to the empty firm. Under the hum of the machines, she designed and fabricated an intricate, latticed lampshade. Assembling it in her living room, placing a warm bulb inside, she watched it cast complex shadows on the walls. She wasn\u2019t just filling the space; she was building her own light.\n\n5.\nShe remembers an artist who came in with files for a sculpture so delicate it seemed impossible to print. Megan spent a full day meticulously calibrating, tweaking supports and material temperatures. When she finally handed the finished, flawless object to the artist, the woman\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \"I only thought it could exist on my screen,\" she whispered. In that moment of shared victory, Megan felt the purest form of her ambition crystalize: to build a place that gives a physical body to other people's dreams."
