Born and raised in the fog-dampened streets of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, he was the son of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business. Their dreams for David were straightforward: a stable, high-earning career in engineering or finance. For years, David tried to fit that mold, but his heart was never in it. The true turning point came during his teenage years, watching his older sister battle a severe depression that his parents, through a lens of cultural stoicism, dismissed as weakness. Witnessing her struggle against an invisible illness, and the system's failure to adequately support her, ignited a fierce, protective empathy in him.\n\nThis experience rerouted his entire educational journey. After a brief, uninspired stint in business at a state university, he pivoted dramatically, earning a BA in Psychology and then a Master of Social Work from SF State. His early career was spent in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s underfunded community health clinics, dealing with the raw, complex trauma of the city's most vulnerable populations. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, leading to a period of burnout that almost drove him from the profession. Instead of quitting, he adapted.\n\nNow, at 44, David works from a converted bedroom in his Inner Richmond flat. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate act of self-preservation. As an LCSW in private practice, he provides telehealth therapy, his days a series of carefully managed video calls. His daily routine is structured around emotional regulation: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, sessions with clients, and a long, decompressing walk through Golden Gate Park in the late afternoon. He is a native who feels both deep love and profound sorrow for his city, seeing the macro-level crises of homelessness and mental health reflected in the micro-level stories his clients share.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted friends, mostly fellow healthcare workers who understand the weight of their work. His greatest aspiration isn\u2019t wealth or recognition, but the steady, cumulative impact of helping others find their footing. His dream is simple: to continue his work sustainably, and perhaps one day, to take a long sabbatical to walk the Camino de Santiago\u2014a pilgrimage not of faith, but of quiet restoration."
