She arrived in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District from St. Petersburg at age seven, a quiet girl clutching her father\u2019s hand, overwhelmed by the fog and the foreign sounds. Her parents, both engineers in Russia, poured their life savings and relentless energy into a small Russian restaurant in North Beach, which they named \u201cThe Caspian.\u201d Isabelle grew up between the kitchen\u2019s heat and the dining room's hushed conversations, her childhood a blur of polishing silverware and translating for her parents.\n\nAfter high school, she dutifully enrolled at San Francisco State University, intending to study business. However, midway through her sophomore year, her father suffered a major stroke. Without hesitation, Isabelle left college to help her mother run The Caspian, which was struggling. What began as a temporary duty became her life\u2019s calling. She discovered a natural talent for hospitality\u2014an innate ability to remember a regular\u2019s favorite wine, to soothe a frantic chef, and to make every guest feel like family.\n\nOver the next two decades, Isabelle became the soul of the restaurant. After her parents retired, she took over completely. Her single-minded dedication came at a cost; a serious long-term relationship ended years ago, her partner unable to compete with the demands of the restaurant. Today, at 45, her life is contained within a few city blocks. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs from her small apartment above The Caspian. Her days begin before sunrise with market runs and end long after the last table is cleared. Her staff is her family, her regulars her closest friends.\n\nIsabelle\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not one of tech booms or trendy pop-ups, but of legacy and resilience. She is a steward of her family\u2019s American dream. While a part of her sometimes longs for a quiet life, her true aspiration is to see The Caspian earn a James Beard nomination\u2014a validation of her parents' sacrifices and her own life\u2019s unwavering work."
