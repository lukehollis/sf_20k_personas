Raised in the East Bay by two aloof historians, Ethan\u2019s childhood was quiet and solitary. His parents were more captivated by the dead than the living, and Ethan found his own history to excavate not in books, but on the glowing screens of early home computers. While other kids were outside, he was navigating dial-up bulletin board systems and nascent internet forums, discovering a world built of pure information, a world he could organize and understand.\n\nHe never pursued formal education. For Ethan, the university was an outdated institution. His classroom was the internet, his curriculum the source code of defunct websites and the file structures of abandoned servers. His career began organically when a family friend, a photographer, passed away, leaving behind a chaotic jumble of hard drives and memory cards. Ethan painstakingly recovered, cataloged, and preserved the artist's life's work. The process gave him a profound sense of purpose: he could prevent people from becoming ghosts in the machine.\n\nNow, from his rent-controlled apartment in the foggy Inner Richmond, Ethan works as a freelance digital archivist. His clients are disparate\u2014the children of deceased writers, defunct tech startups wanting to preserve their legacy, families desperate to save corrupted home videos. His 0.0-mile commute from his bedroom to his desk is a fortress of solitude. His daily routine is a quiet ritual: a morning walk to a Clement Street bakery for coffee, long hours immersed in the digital lives of others, and an evening spent listening to vinyl records, a tangible connection to the past.\n\nSocially, Ethan is reserved. His connections are few but meaningful: the baker who knows his order, a handful of online collaborators, and a single close friend he meets for dim sum on weekends. His greatest aspiration is to create a secure, open-source digital vault for personal histories, a \"Library of Alexandria\" for the common person, ensuring no one's story is lost to bit rot or a forgotten password. In a city obsessed with the next big thing, Ethan Miller finds his calling in meticulously preserving what has already been."
