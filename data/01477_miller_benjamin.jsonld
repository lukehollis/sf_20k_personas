Raised in a pragmatic, working-class family in California's Central Valley, the emphasis was always on a steady hand and a reliable paycheck, not a university degree. For Ben, college felt like a detour from the real world. He was drawn to the texture of things\u2014the grain of wood, the weave of good denim, the heft of well-made leather. San Francisco, with its vibrant aesthetic and pockets of specialized craft, called to him as a place where that appreciation could become a life.\n\nHe arrived at 19 with little more than a strong work ethic. His journey began not in a classroom, but in the stockroom of a menswear boutique. He was a natural, quickly moving to the sales floor where his genuine passion for the product resonated with customers. His turning point came when he met the aging owner of \"Trestle & Co.,\" a small, curated lifestyle shop in Hayes Valley. The owner saw in Ben not an employee, but a successor\u2014someone who understood the store\u2019s soul. Ben spent five years as his apprentice before taking over as manager when the owner semi-retired.\n\nNow, at 31, Ben\u2019s life is a self-contained ecosystem. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a flight of stairs; he lives in a small flat directly above the shop. His daily routine is a ritual: brewing coffee from the roaster next door, meticulously arranging displays, and advising regulars who have become friends. His social life is woven into the fabric of his neighborhood; he knows the chefs, the baristas, and the gallery owners by name. He is respected as a curator of taste in his small corner of the city, a quiet counterpoint to the tech-driven hustle elsewhere.\n\nBen\u2019s primary aspiration is to one day purchase the store outright. It\u2019s not a dream of wealth, but of ownership and permanence. He wants to ensure Trestle & Co. remains a haven for quality and craftsmanship. In a city constantly reinventing itself, Benjamin Miller finds his purpose in preserving a small piece of it, proving that a deep knowledge of one\u2019s craft can be as valuable as any degree."
