The only son of Indian immigrants, his father an engineer and his mother a librarian, David was raised on a diet of high expectations and quiet diligence. He was pushed towards medicine, a stable and respectable path. He began his undergraduate studies as a pre-med major, but a volunteer position at a local youth crisis center irrevocably altered his course. The systemic cracks he witnessed\u2014in mental healthcare, in the social safety net\u2014ignited a passion far stronger than any desire to set a bone or prescribe medication.\n\nThis newfound calling led him to the West Coast and a Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area\u2019s vibrant, complex social fabric felt like the right place to build a career and a life. David started on the front lines, working as a case manager for at-risk youth in the Mission District. For over fifteen years, he navigated the trenches of social work, the burnout tempered only by the small, profound victories of helping a family secure housing or guiding a teen into a stable program.\n\nThe key turning point was his promotion to a leadership role. While he missed the direct client interaction, he realized he could effect greater change by shaping policy and securing funding. Now, as the Director of Behavioral Health Services for a large non-profit that partners with city schools, his work is a landscape of spreadsheets, virtual meetings, and grant proposals.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute anchors him firmly in his Inner Sunset neighborhood. David and his partner of twenty years, a landscape architect named Leo, have cultivated a tranquil life. His mornings begin with a walk through the misty expanse of Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears his head before logging on. His days are a blur of coordinating services for thousands of students from his quiet home office. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t for more power or a higher salary; he hopes to build a sustainable model of care that will outlast his tenure. He aspires to mentor the next generation of social workers, ensuring the city\u2019s most vulnerable children have advocates as passionate as he once was, fresh out of Berkeley and ready to change the world."
