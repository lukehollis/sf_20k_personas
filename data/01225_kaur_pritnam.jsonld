Her upbringing was traditional, rooted in Sikh faith and strong family obligation. She was a bright student, but opportunities for girls were limited. Her father, dreaming of a better future for his children, saved for years to immigrate. At seventeen, the family arrived in the Bay Area, settling initially in Hayward. The culture shock was immense, and Pritnam\u2019s plans for higher education were shelved. With a sense of duty, she immediately took a job at a fabric store to help support her parents and younger siblings.\n\nHer meticulous nature and honesty got her noticed. A customer, the owner of a small financial services firm, offered her an entry-level job as a mail clerk. She proved a quick study with an affinity for numbers and order. Over three decades, she worked her way up through dedication and reliability, becoming the Senior Accounting Assistant she is today. Her career wasn't a passion project but the bedrock of her family\u2019s stability. In her early twenties, she entered an arranged marriage with a kind, hardworking man from her community. They moved to San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district for its close-knit feel and raised two children there.\n\nNow 50, Pritnam\u2019s life has found a comfortable rhythm. The pandemic shifted her a decade-long commute to the Financial District to a zero-mile commute from a corner desk in her bedroom. Her days are structured: morning prayers, making chai for her husband, and then logging into work. At lunch, she walks along Clement Street, enjoying the fog and the familiar faces. Her San Francisco isn't the Golden Gate Bridge or tech startups; it\u2019s the Third Avenue Gurdwara, the Indian grocers, and the peace of Golden Gate Park. Her children are now young adults, and her greatest pride is seeing them navigate American life while honoring their heritage.\n\nPritnam doesn\u2019t dream of a career change or a lavish retirement. Her hopes are grounded in family and faith. She looks forward to her children marrying and having families of their own. She and her husband dream of taking an extended trip back to Punjab, to reconnect with relatives without the pressure of a short vacation. For Pritnam, a successful life is measured in love given, duties fulfilled, and the quiet contentment of a home built far from where her story began."
