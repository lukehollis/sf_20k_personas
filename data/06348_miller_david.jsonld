A far cry from his upbringing in suburban Ohio, where his parents, an accountant and an engineer, had envisioned a straighter path for him. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration, a degree he rarely mentions, as it represents a life he consciously abandoned.\n\nThe pivotal moment came during a post-graduation trip through Europe. Standing in a small, starkly modern gallery in Berlin, confronted by a chaotic yet mesmerizing installation piece, David experienced a profound shift. The predictable world of spreadsheets and profit margins dissolved, replaced by a yearning for expression, curation, and the raw power of art.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco on a whim, drawn by its reputation for reinvention. He started not as a curator, but as a gallery assistant, his business degree unexpectedly useful for managing budgets and sales. For years, he absorbed everything, developing a keen eye for emerging talent and a deep understanding of the art world's ecosystem. His passion, paired with his practical acumen, propelled him up the ladder.\n\nNow, at 42, David is the Creative Director of \"Juxtapose,\" the very gallery housed below his apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his life and work are inextricably woven. Mornings begin with coffee on his mezzanine overlooking the silent gallery, planning installations before the doors open. His social circle is a tight-knit community of artists, collectors, and critics who gather for impromptu dinners in his loft after gallery openings. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his complete immersion in his work.\n\nConnected deeply to SoMa\u2019s industrial-chic pulse, David rarely feels the need to leave his neighborhood. His dream is no longer about personal ascent but about legacy: to discover and launch an artist whose work will be remembered for decades. Privately, he wonders if he can ever carve out a space in his life that the gallery doesn't touch, a quiet corner for a love that doesn't have to compete with a canvas."
