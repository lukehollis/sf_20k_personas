The son of a physicist father and a literature professor mother, his upbringing was a quiet battle between numbers and narratives. When the family emigrated to the United States in the early 90s, a teenage Boris brought this internal conflict with him, excelling in math while finding solace in the dense fatalism of Russian novels.\n\nHis educational journey was a tribute to his mother. He pursued a graduate degree not in economics, but in Comparative Literature, writing a dissertation on the theme of moral compromise in Dostoevsky. But the Ivory Tower proved to be a cold, impractical refuge. Facing a bleak academic job market, Boris made a pivotal choice. He applied the same analytical rigor he used to deconstruct texts to the financial markets. Pragmatism, sharp and cold, won out over passion. He discovered the narratives of human fear and greed were just as legible in stock tickers as they were in novels, and his career in finance took off with ferocious speed.\n\nNow 50, Boris lives a life of calculated precision. His 0.0-mile commute is from his bedroom to his home office in a sterile, high-rise apartment in Rincon Hill. His days are a blur of data streams, global conference calls, and economic modeling. His one marriage crumbled under the weight of his ambition years ago, leaving him with a polite but distant relationship with his college-aged daughter. His social circle consists of a few colleagues with whom he occasionally shares an expensive bottle of wine.\n\nBoris is a man who lives above San Francisco, not within it. The city is an abstraction viewed through his floor-to-ceiling windows\u2014the Bay Bridge a string of diamonds, the fog a silent, encroaching entity. His true connection is not to the streets below, but to the past. After the markets close, he doesn't turn on a television. He pours a small glass of vodka and reads Tolstoy in its original Russian, the complex Cyrillic a secret code that only he understands. His quiet aspiration is no longer about wealth, but about synthesis. He dreams of writing a book\u2014not about portfolio diversification, but about the soul of the market, a work that would finally unite the physicist\u2019s son with the literary scholar."
