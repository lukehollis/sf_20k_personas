Born in Modesto to a proud Mexican-American mother and a pragmatic white father, Claudia was raised in a home where handmade tortillas shared a table with meticulously repaired machinery. Her identity was a blend of her mother\u2019s vibrant heritage and her father\u2019s steady, blue-collar work ethic.\n\nHer path seemed straightforward: community college with a vague notion of a business degree. But two years in, her father suffered a debilitating work injury, and Claudia dropped out without a second thought. She took on administrative jobs to help support her family, her dreams deferred by duty. It was during these years she discovered an innate talent for organization, for seeing the complex parts of a project and seamlessly fitting them together.\n\nAt 28, with her family stabilized, Claudia felt a pull for a life that was entirely her own. She followed a friend to San Francisco, initially finding a shoebox apartment in the Mission District. The neighborhood\u2019s murals and the scent of panader\u00edas felt both new and deeply familiar. She landed a job as an assistant for a small firm that organized large-scale public art installations. Excelling at coordinating artists, permits, and suppliers, she was eventually promoted to Project Coordinator, a role she now performs remotely from her quiet apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHer days are structured yet flexible. A 0.0-mile commute means her morning starts not with traffic, but with strong coffee and a view of the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park. She manages timelines and budgets from her sunlit desk, her work a digital tapestry of creativity and logistics. Afternoons are often spent on long walks through the park, her sanctuary and backyard. Her social life is a close-knit circle of friends, a chosen family met through work and neighborhood potlucks.\n\nAt 37, Claudia hopes to finally finish her degree online, perhaps in project management or art history, to validate the skills she\u2019s already mastered. Her deeper dream is to one day lead a project that honors her roots\u2014a bi-cultural festival that celebrates the intersection of art and community, much like her own life."
