Though he works from home, his life\u2019s journey has been anything but stationary. Born in San Jose to Mauritian Creole immigrants, Aamin\u2019s upbringing was a vibrant fusion of Sega music, the aroma of spicy curries, and his parents\u2019 stories of a multicultural island in the Indian Ocean. This background, officially categorized as \"Other,\" gave him a nuanced perspective on identity and belonging from a young age.\n\nHe pursued a Bachelor's in Urban Planning at UC Santa Cruz, fascinated by how systems and infrastructure shape human communities. His career path seemed set until a key turning point: his mother's prolonged battle with a misdiagnosed illness. Aamin witnessed firsthand how fragmented data and communication gaps could profoundly impact patient care. The experience ignited a new passion within him. He spent a year obsessively teaching himself SQL, Python, and data visualization, pivoting from city grids to patient pathways. He landed his first analyst role at 26 and has since dedicated his career to making healthcare more efficient and humane.\n\nNow 31, Aamin\u2019s daily routine is one of disciplined solitude. Mornings start with a run through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, followed by hours spent transforming chaotic data into coherent insights for a major hospital network. To counteract the isolation of remote work, he belongs to a bouldering gym in the Dogpatch, where the physical problem-solving offers a welcome contrast to his digital world. He maintains a small, devoted circle of friends, a mix from college and his climbing hobby, though a recent breakup has left him feeling more introspective.\n\nAamin\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal. He sees the city as a complex system, much like the ones he analyzes, full of potential and inequality. He dreams of one day leading a team to develop predictive models that could identify at-risk patients before their conditions become critical\u2014a tribute to his mother\u2019s struggle. Personally, he hopes to build a lasting partnership and find a deeper sense of community, transforming his quiet corner of the city into a true home."
