The only son of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who ran a small grocery store, his childhood was steeped in the values of hard work, community obligation, and family honor. While his parents hoped he would pursue medicine or engineering, Jaspreet was quietly observant, noticing the unspoken anxieties and silent depressions that settled upon friends and family members, often dismissed with a simple directive to \u201cbe stronger.\u201d The turning point came when a close uncle, after a significant business loss, fell into a deep despair that the community had no language for, offering prayers but no practical support. Jaspreet, then a teenager, saw a deep need for a bridge between cultural stoicism and mental wellness.\n\nThis conviction guided his educational journey. He pursued a psychology degree at UC Davis, staying close to home, before making the definitive move to the Bay Area for his Master of Social Work. San Francisco, with its progressive ethos and diverse population, felt like the right place to build a new kind of life. After earning his MSW and completing the rigorous process to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), he accepted a position with a major healthcare provider, specializing in telehealth services.\n\nNow 30, Jaspreet\u2019s life is centered in his quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Richmond District. His commute is a walk from his bedroom to the small, thoughtfully arranged office nook in his living room. His days are a carefully scheduled succession of video calls with clients navigating trauma, anxiety, and life transitions. To decompress from the emotional weight of his work, he has a strict routine: a morning run through the cypress-lined trails of Golden Gate Park, a mandatory lunch break away from his screen, and evenings spent either cooking complex Punjabi dishes from his mother\u2019s recipes or meeting friends at a low-key pub.\n\nHe feels a profound connection to San Francisco as a city that allows him to be fully himself\u2014a man deeply proud of his heritage but unbound by its more rigid expectations. His dream is to eventually open a private practice or non-profit focused on providing culturally competent mental healthcare to the Bay Area\u2019s South Asian communities. Jaspreet remains a bridge, just as he intended to be: connecting people to healing, his past to his present, and his quiet life in the city to the bustling valley that shaped him."
