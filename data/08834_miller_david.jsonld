Adopted at six months old by a loving Caucasian couple from Sacramento, he was raised with the quintessentially American surname that never quite seemed to match his face. His childhood was stable and happy, filled with suburban comforts, but a quiet sense of cultural displacement simmered beneath the surface. He knew his parents\u2019 pot roast and casserole recipes by heart, but the flavors of his birth country remained a mystery.\n\nHis path after high school was uncertain. He enrolled in a community college with a vague idea of studying business, but the structure of academia felt hollow. To pay his bills, he took a job as a busser at a bustling downtown restaurant. There, amidst the controlled chaos of the dinner rush\u2014the symphony of clanking pans, shouting orders, and satisfied diners\u2014David found his calling. He dropped out of college and dedicated himself to the hospitality industry, rapidly climbing the ranks from server to bartender to shift supervisor.\n\nThe turning point came at 28 when he moved to San Francisco, drawn by its world-renowned culinary scene. The city\u2019s energy was intoxicating, and he landed a management position at a high-end restaurant in the Mission District. For the past decade, this has been his world. His 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in the small apartment directly above the restaurant, his life dictated by the rhythms of prep, service, and cleanup.\n\nAt 41, David is a consummate professional, respected by his staff and the industry regulars who form his primary social circle. His daily routine is a loop of inventory checks, staff meetings, and long nights on the floor, often ending with a solitary drink at his own bar. Lately, a dream has been taking shape: to open his own place. Not another trendy Californian eatery, but a small, intimate bistro serving modern Korean-American food\u2014a tangible way to connect with the heritage he\u2019s slowly exploring through trips to Koreatown and late-night recipe experiments. This restaurant represents more than a career move; it is his hope for a legacy, a community, and a way to finally reconcile all the parts of himself."
