Born in Alameda to a Filipino father who served three decades in the U.S. Navy and an Irish-American mother from Boston, David grew up with the scent of adobo and the sound of The Chieftains in a home disciplined by naval precision. His ethnicity, officially \"Other,\" was simply \"home\" to him. He was a pensive child, more interested in the intricate systems of history than the emerging world of computers. This led him to San Francisco State University, where he earned a Bachelor's in History, dreaming of a quiet life as an archivist.\n\nThe tech boom of the mid-90s had other plans. With archivist jobs scarce, David took a temp position doing basic IT support for a small software company. He discovered a surprising aptitude for it; troubleshooting a network wasn't so different from tracing the causal chains of a historical event. He was a natural. While others chased stock options, David found satisfaction in stability, becoming the indispensable systems administrator who kept the servers humming through the dot-com boom, its subsequent bust, and the Web 2.0 resurgence.\n\nA key turning point was the amicable end of a fifteen-year relationship a decade ago. The separation prompted him to sell their shared condo in Noe Valley and find a smaller apartment for himself in the Inner Richmond. It was a move toward solitude and self-reliance. Now, at 54, his life is a testament to quiet routine. His 0.0-mile commute means his workday begins after a ritualistic morning walk through the fog-dampened trails of Golden Gate Park. He works diligently from a corner of his living room, his world contained within firewalls and the calls of the gulls outside his window.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. He doesn\u2019t frequent the trendy downtown bars but is a regular at a weekly trivia night at a pub on Clement Street and knows the family who runs his favorite dim sum spot by name. His dream isn't a promotion but a journey. He spends his evenings meticulously planning a six-month trip to trace his roots\u2014to the small villages of the Philippines his father left and the coastal towns of Ireland his mother romanticized. For David, a man who has spent his life managing systems, the ultimate goal is to finally log off and connect to his own."
