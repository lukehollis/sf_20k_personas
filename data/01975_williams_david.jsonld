Born and raised in a quiet suburb of Boston, David was an intellectually curious but directionless young man. He earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History, fascinated by the narratives of the past, but found himself unemployable and unfulfilled, stocking shelves at a bookstore.\n\nThe defining turning point came in his late twenties. His father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and David became his primary caregiver. He spent countless hours in hospitals, witnessing the profound impact of the registered nurses. Their combination of clinical skill, empathy, and resilience struck him as the most meaningful work a person could do. After his father passed, David felt a seismic shift in his purpose. Studying history was about understanding the dead; he wanted to help the living.\n\nAt 30, he used a small inheritance to enroll in an accelerated nursing program in San Francisco, drawn by the city\u2019s reputation for progressivism and the promise of a complete reinvention. He excelled, his maturity and life experience giving him an advantage. Upon graduating, he took a position at a major medical center and, to simplify his life, moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment directly adjacent to the hospital campus, making his commute nonexistent.\n\nNow 48, David is a veteran of the ICU. His days are a blur of 12-hour shifts, alarms, and the intense emotional labor of caring for critically ill patients. His social circle is small, composed almost entirely of fellow nurses who share the same dark humor and understanding of the job's toll. He\u2019s been single for years, a past relationship having crumbled under the weight of his demanding schedule.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is not through its booming tech scene or culinary delights, but through the quiet refuge of Golden Gate Park on his days off and the diverse faces of the patients he serves. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t for a promotion or a larger home. He\u2019s quietly saving for an early retirement where he can travel\u2014not to resorts, but to the historical sites in Greece he once only read about in textbooks, finally merging the two halves of his life."
