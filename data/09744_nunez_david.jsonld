He was raised in a modest household in Daly City by his mother, a resilient Filipina immigrant who worked tirelessly as a nursing assistant. His father, who passed away when David was a teenager, was a thoughtful, albeit reserved, Filipino-American who instilled in him a deep appreciation for design and the power of observation. Their small apartment, efficient and meticulously organized, provided an early lesson in maximizing space and function, a concept that would later define his career.\n\nDavid\u2019s aptitude for math and art led him to pursue architecture at UC Berkeley. He thrived in the collaborative studio culture, his meticulous nature finding a perfect home in the demanding curriculum. Post-graduation, he initially worked in private architectural firms, designing commercial spaces. However, a growing fascination with large-scale urban development and its social impact shifted his focus. This led him to pursue a Master's in Urban Planning, a move that proved pivotal.\n\nJoining the San Francisco Planning Department ten years ago was a homecoming of sorts. He rose steadily through the ranks, now serving as a Principal Urban Planner. His work, overseeing complex projects from infrastructure upgrades to affordable housing initiatives, demands strategic thinking and political acumen. He finds immense professional satisfaction in contributing to the city's evolution, navigating the delicate balance between preserving historical charm and embracing modern needs.\n\nOutside of work, David cycles daily from his Outer Sunset home to his downtown office \u2013 a 3.5-mile journey that offers a meditative start to his day and allows him to observe the city's changing textures firsthand. He finds solace in the rhythm of the ride and the coastal fog. His personal life is centered around a small but close-knit group of friends, primarily former colleagues and fellow urban planning enthusiasts, with whom he often discusses city issues over dinner. While not married, he maintains a warm relationship with his mother and a younger sister who lives outside the city.\n\nDavid's hopes for the future are intertwined with San Francisco's. He dreams of facilitating truly equitable development, creating neighborhoods that are vibrant, sustainable, and accessible to all residents. He envisions a city where diverse communities can thrive, and where his years of expertise can contribute to meaningful and lasting change. His current focus is on a challenging project involving transit corridor development, and he's determined to see it through, believing in the transformative potential of thoughtful urban design. San Francisco is not just his place of work; it's the landscape he helps curate, the city he feels a deep responsibility to shape for generations to come."

It ignited a nascent fascination with how things were built and connected, a seed of his future career.\n\n2. Walking through Chinatown with his mother after a long shift, the vibrant chaos comforting in its familiarity and the scent of roasted duck a Proustian trigger for countless memories of their small, efficient apartment. It grounded him in his roots and the resilience passed down through generations.\n\n3. The late-night studio sessions at UC Berkeley, fueled by coffee and shared passion, debating urban theory and sketching ideas until dawn. These collaborative hours solidified his love for urban planning and forged friendships that continue to enrich his life.\n\n4. Standing on Potrero Hill, overlooking the twinkling city lights at night, feeling the weight of responsibility as a principal planner \u2013 the intricate web of lives and infrastructure he helps guide. It reinforced his commitment to shaping a city that works for everyone.\n\n5. Riding his bike home through the Outer Sunset fog, the cool mist on his face and the rhythm of the waves a calming counterpoint to the day's complexities. This daily ritual became a moving meditation, a quiet space to observe the city breathe and reflect on its enduring spirit."
