Raised in a quiet, car-dependent Sacramento suburb, her childhood was defined by waiting for rides and the monotonous landscape of strip malls. The bus was unreliable, and cycling was a recreational activity, not a form of transport. This early experience forged in her a deep-seated belief that communities should be built for people, not vehicles.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco at 21, not for a prestigious university, but for the freedom of a city where she didn\u2019t need a driver's license to live a full life. Lacking a formal degree, Sarah\u2019s education came from the city itself. She became a passionate observer, volunteering for the SF Bicycle Coalition and attending countless city planning meetings. Her sharp, practical insights on pedestrian safety and transit flow, born from lived experience rather than academic theory, got her noticed. A local community planning non-profit hired her, valuing her on-the-ground perspective over a traditional resume.\n\nA key turning point was helping design the city\u2019s first \"slow street\" in her own neighborhood during the pandemic. Seeing families reclaim the asphalt from cars solidified her life's mission. Now 36, Sarah lives and breathes her work. Her 0.0-mile commute is a point of pride; she works from a sunlit desk in her Mission District apartment, overlooking a vibrant mural. Her daily routine is a testament to her ideals: a morning walk to a local bakery, video calls with city officials, and an evening stroll with her partner, Alex, a graphic designer she met at a neighborhood cleanup.\n\nSarah's connection to San Francisco is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She knows the names of the shop owners on her block and has a favorite bench in Dolores Park. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder but to see a future where every San Franciscan has the same freedom she found: the ability to access everything they need within a short, safe, and pleasant walk from their front door."
