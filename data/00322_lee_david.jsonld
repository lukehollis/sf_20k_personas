Born and raised in the city\u2019s foggy Sunset District, he was the only child of Hong Kong immigrants who arrived in the late 1970s. His parents ran a small neighborhood grocery, instilling in him a relentless work ethic and the familiar immigrant dream: a stable, respectable profession. David\u2019s childhood was a split-screen reality\u2014the lively cacophony of Cantonese at home and the English-speaking world of school, the scent of dried seafood from his parents' shop mixing with the salty air off Ocean Beach.\n\nHe initially pursued a conventional path at UC Davis, but the dot-com boom of the late '90s was an irresistible siren call. He witnessed San Francisco transforming before his eyes, a city of systems being radically rewritten by technology. This fascination led to a pivotal shift. He abandoned his parents\u2019 vision of a steady engineering job for a graduate degree in Urban Planning and Systems Engineering from UC Berkeley. It was his way of understanding, and perhaps controlling, the chaotic evolution of the city he loved.\n\nDavid\u2019s career mirrored the city's tech trajectory. He worked for a municipal transit agency before being poached by a burgeoning tech giant. Now, as a Transportation Systems Manager, he works from the quiet of his Noe Valley condo, his 0.0-mile commute a symbol of the very future he helps design. His days are a disciplined routine of data analysis and virtual meetings, spent optimizing algorithms for autonomous delivery drones and last-mile logistics. He is, ironically, an architect of the same disruptive change that sometimes pains him.\n\nAt 45, his life has settled. His social circle is small, composed of a few trusted friends from his university days and a weekend cycling group that tackles the formidable hills of the Marin Headlands. He holds a deep, complicated affection for San Francisco\u2014nostalgic for the city of his youth but driven by a desire to solve its modern problems. His ultimate dream isn't a C-suite title, but to see his work result in a greener, more efficient, and more equitable transportation network for the city that has been his entire world."

David translated, bridging the gap with his still-clumsy Cantonese. He felt a hot flush of embarrassment and a sharp pang of pride. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t just a son; he was a necessary link. It was his first taste of being a systems engineer, connecting two incompatible worlds. This sense of being a translator would define his life.\n\n2.\nIt was 1999, and he was home from Davis for the summer. Standing at a Castro Muni stop, he watched a packed F-line streetcar groan past, a relic struggling against the city\u2019s frantic new energy. All around him, the dot-com boom was rewriting the landscape. He saw it not as chaos, but as a system breaking down, a puzzle to be solved. He didn't want to build circuits in a lab; he wanted to fix *this*. He changed his major the next semester.\n\n3.\nHis first day at the tech campus felt like stepping into the future. After years in a beige municipal cubicle that smelled of stale coffee, this world of glass walls, free lunch, and limitless ambition was intoxicating. He felt a surge of power, the feeling that he could finally implement the ideas he\u2019d only dreamed of. But as he looked at the catered platters, he felt a flicker of guilt, thinking of his parents\u2019 simple lunch counter. It crystallized the compromise he was making.\n\n4.\nLast Saturday, from the top of Hawk Hill, the city was a jewel box laid out below. The fog still clung to the Sunset, his childhood neighborhood a soft, grey blanket. But the downtown skyline was sharp, a testament to the new San Francisco he was helping build. He felt a familiar ache\u2014a deep love for the whole sprawling, contradictory thing. It was this view, full of memory and data points, that fueled his quiet and relentless mission to make it work better.\n\n5.\nHe saw one of his delivery drones last month, humming over the avenues of the Outer Sunset. It flew a perfectly optimized path just blocks from the shuttered storefront that was once his parents\u2019 grocery. The sight was a punch to the gut\u2014a collision of his two lives. The efficient, sterile future he was programming into existence felt so profound and so alien in the neighborhood that held his past. It was the deepest, most personal reminder of what his work both created and erased."
