Born and raised in the city\u2019s foggy Sunset District, he was the only child of Hong Kong immigrants who arrived in the late 1970s. His parents ran a small neighborhood grocery, instilling in him a relentless work ethic and the familiar immigrant dream: a stable, respectable profession. David\u2019s childhood was a split-screen reality\u2014the lively cacophony of Cantonese at home and the English-speaking world of school, the scent of dried seafood from his parents' shop mixing with the salty air off Ocean Beach.\n\nHe initially pursued a conventional path at UC Davis, but the dot-com boom of the late '90s was an irresistible siren call. He witnessed San Francisco transforming before his eyes, a city of systems being radically rewritten by technology. This fascination led to a pivotal shift. He abandoned his parents\u2019 vision of a steady engineering job for a graduate degree in Urban Planning and Systems Engineering from UC Berkeley. It was his way of understanding, and perhaps controlling, the chaotic evolution of the city he loved.\n\nDavid\u2019s career mirrored the city's tech trajectory. He worked for a municipal transit agency before being poached by a burgeoning tech giant. Now, as a Transportation Systems Manager, he works from the quiet of his Noe Valley condo, his 0.0-mile commute a symbol of the very future he helps design. His days are a disciplined routine of data analysis and virtual meetings, spent optimizing algorithms for autonomous delivery drones and last-mile logistics. He is, ironically, an architect of the same disruptive change that sometimes pains him.\n\nAt 45, his life has settled. His social circle is small, composed of a few trusted friends from his university days and a weekend cycling group that tackles the formidable hills of the Marin Headlands. He holds a deep, complicated affection for San Francisco\u2014nostalgic for the city of his youth but driven by a desire to solve its modern problems. His ultimate dream isn't a C-suite title, but to see his work result in a greener, more efficient, and more equitable transportation network for the city that has been his entire world."
