Born in 1982 to a Jewish family of intellectuals\u2014an engineer father and a librarian mother\u2014his childhood was bookended by scarcity and upheaval. He remembers the hushed conversations about emigration, the fading posters of Lenin, and the bewildering chaos that followed the Soviet Union's collapse. This formative experience with a failing state instilled in him a lifelong fascination with how systems of governance either serve or betray their people.\n\nHis family finally emigrated in 1995, landing in Sacramento. The transition was jarring. Misha, then 13, watched his highly educated parents take on cleaning and assembly jobs, their expertise rendered irrelevant. He channeled this frustration into academics, excelling with a quiet, fierce determination. He was drawn to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate studies, finding a home amongst its political fervor, before earning his Master's from the Goldman School of Public Policy.\n\nHis career was a direct response to his past. Rejecting cynicism, Misha dedicated himself to fixing systems from within. He started in Oakland's city government before being recruited by San Francisco to become its Director of Civic Innovation. His mission: to use technology and community-focused design to make bureaucracy more human and efficient.\n\nNow 42, Misha lives in a tidy one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His daily routine is disciplined: an early morning run, reading international news, and taking the 21-Hayes Muni bus to his office at City Hall. He\u2019s divorced\u2014a brief marriage in his early thirties that buckled under the weight of his professional dedication. He is now in a stable, loving relationship with a landscape architect who understands his intensity. His connection to San Francisco is profound; he sees the city\u2019s complex, often-contradictory nature as the ultimate challenge. Misha\u2019s dream isn\u2019t personal power, but to build a municipal model so responsive and effective that it stands as a testament to the idea that government, when functioning properly, can be a profound force for good."

His father, the engineer who built things, looked small and powerless, his face a mask of weary patience. Misha felt a cold knot of dread; this wasn't just about hunger. It was watching the architecture of their world crumble into dust. He vowed then, unknowingly, to spend his life building systems that wouldn\u2019t betray the people they were meant to serve.\n\n***\n\n2.\nHe was 15, staying late for a science club meeting in his Sacramento high school. He saw his mother\u2014his brilliant librarian mother who knew Pushkin by heart\u2014pushing a janitor\u2019s cart down the empty hallway. She gave him a small, tired smile. The sight burned into his memory, a stinging indictment of a system that discarded expertise. Every straight 'A' he earned after that night was an act of defiance, a promise that their knowledge would not be wasted.\n\n***\n\n3.\nIn Oakland, his first government job, he spent a week helping an elderly woman navigate a labyrinthine permitting process for a simple porch railing. When he finally hand-delivered the approved form, she gripped his hand, tears in her eyes. \"You\u2019re the first person who listened,\" she said. In her relief, Misha felt a jolt of purpose more powerful than any policy debate at Berkeley. This was it. This was fixing the machine, one human gear at a time.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe came home late from a City Hall budget meeting to find a suitcase by the door. There were no shouts. Just a quiet note on the kitchen counter next to his keys. Looking around the silent Hayes Valley apartment, he felt not anger, but a profound, hollow sorrow. He had been so focused on optimizing the city\u2019s interconnected systems that he had completely failed to maintain his own. The loneliness of that failure was a heavy, quiet education.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast spring, sitting on a bench in the SF Botanical Garden with his partner. The fog was rolling in, muting the city's noise. \"You\u2019re designing a more efficient Muni line in your head, aren't you?\" she asked, not as an accusation, but with a gentle smile as she sketched a fern. He exhaled a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. To be seen so completely, his intensity held with affection instead of tolerance, felt like the most stable structure he had ever known."
