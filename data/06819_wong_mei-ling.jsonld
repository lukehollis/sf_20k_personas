            "value": "Mei-Ling Wong is a daughter of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, born to parents who emigrated from Guangzhou in the late 1980s. Her childhood was shaped by the rhythms of their small grocery store: the early morning deliveries, the scent of fresh produce, and the constant, quiet emphasis on hard work and practicality. For her parents, success was a stable job and a secure future, a dream they pinned on their bright, dutiful daughter.\n\nMei-Ling excelled, earning a place at UC Berkeley where she pursued a degree in Cognitive Science. She was fascinated not by code, but by the \"why\" behind human choice and behavior. However, the pressure to secure a lucrative career led her to pivot. A post-graduation data analytics bootcamp was the perfect compromise\u2014it leveraged her interest in patterns while satisfying her parents\u2019 desire for a respectable tech job. She was hired by a mid-size e-commerce company and proved to be exceptionally good at her work, translating user clicks into compelling narratives of consumer desire.\n\nHer life is now centered in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a world away from the foggy avenues of her youth. The 0.0-mile commute is both a blessing and a curse. Her days are a disciplined cycle: log in at 8 AM, analyze datasets until lunch, take a brief walk for an overpriced coffee, and dive back into spreadsheets until evening. Her apartment is her office, her gym, and her sanctuary, creating an insulated existence.\n\nSocial connections are maintained through scheduled video calls with college friends and dutiful Sunday dinners back in the Sunset. While she loves her parents, she feels a widening gap between their definition of success and her own growing sense of detachment. She spends her days observing humanity through data points but feels increasingly removed from real, tangible community. Her secret aspiration is to use her analytical skills for a cause\u2014perhaps for a climate non-profit or a civic tech project\u2014to find a story in the data that doesn't just increase profit, but actively improves the city she has always called home."
