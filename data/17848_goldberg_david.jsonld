Adopted at eight months old by a loving Jewish couple\u2014a history professor and a sociologist in Berkeley\u2014David\u2019s upbringing was a vibrant mix of academic inquiry, cultural traditions, and a constant, quiet negotiation of identity. He was the Asian kid with the Jewish last name, a reality that fostered a keen sense of observation and an appreciation for things that were thoughtfully constructed, from Shabbat dinners to the elegant mechanics of a well-made watch. This fascination with how things fit together led him to dismantle toys, radios, and eventually, to a Bachelor's in Industrial Design from California College of the Arts.\n\nHis career began in the trenches of product design, creating ergonomic office furniture and later, sophisticated medical equipment. David\u2019s talent wasn't just in aesthetics, but in understanding human interaction\u2014the satisfying click of a button, the intuitive feel of a handle. He rose steadily, moving from a hands-on designer to a manager, and finally to his current role as Director of Product Design for a high-end consumer electronics manufacturer. The promotion was a major turning point, shifting his focus from his own creations to nurturing the talent of his team, a role he finds unexpectedly rewarding, though he sometimes misses the tactile joy of prototyping.\n\nNow 47 and divorced for five years, David\u2019s life is one of structured intention. He lives in a meticulously organized Potrero Hill condo with sweeping views of the city he now calls home. His daily 3.5-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa office is a non-negotiable ritual, a time to observe the urban landscape and clear his head. Evenings are for experimenting with new recipes, video calls with his daughter in college, or quiet nights sketching in his Moleskine notebook. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few old friends from the design world.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is rooted in its appreciation for craft and innovation. He sees the city as a living product, constantly being iterated upon. His dream isn\u2019t to climb higher up the corporate ladder, but to step off it. He fantasizes about opening a small workshop, perhaps in the Dogpatch, where he can design and build bespoke, minimalist furniture\u2014a return to the hands-on work that first sparked his passion. He is content, but yearns for a future defined less by management and more by making."

The candlelight flickered across the polished silverware, and in the reflection of a soup spoon, he saw his own Korean face looking back\u2014a small, distinct island in a sea of loving, Caucasian family. It wasn't a moment of alienation, but of profound awareness. It was the first time he understood he was a unique component in a beautiful, complex assembly, a realization that would quietly guide his entire life\u2019s work in fitting things together.\n\n2.\nAt twelve, his father let him hold his prized mechanical watch. David felt the surprising heft, the cool steel against his palm. He listened not to the tick, but to the impossibly smooth sweep of the second hand. He clicked the clasp open and shut, mesmerized by the perfect, satisfying snap. In that moment, an object ceased to be just a thing; it became an experience, a system of elegant solutions. This tactile revelation ignited the obsession with thoughtful design that would become his career.\n\n3.\nThe first day in his Director's office felt vast and quiet. He sat in the expensive ergonomic chair\u2014one his old team might have designed\u2014and looked at his hands. They were clean. Too clean. There was no residue from modeling clay, no faint scent of the workshop. The pride of the promotion wrestled with a sudden, aching nostalgia for the simple, tactile joy of making something real. He realized then that climbing the ladder meant moving further away from the ground he loved.\n\n4.\nHis daughter\u2019s first weekend visit to his new Potrero Hill condo after the divorce was quiet and awkward. The space was sparse, echoing with potential. Instead of talking, they built a bookshelf together, the simple Swedish instructions spread across the floor. As they tightened the last screw, the shared, focused task filled the silence. It wasn't just furniture; they were constructing the new shape of their family, one deliberate piece at a time. It marked the start of his intentionally built life.\n\n5.\nCycling home through Dogpatch last fall, a flash of orange\u2014a \"For Lease\" sign\u2014caught his eye on an old brick warehouse. He stopped, straddling his bike. He could almost smell the sawdust and coffee, could visualize the light pouring through the industrial windows onto a slab of unfinished walnut. The vague fantasy of a workshop suddenly clicked into place, becoming a clear, tangible future. It was no longer an escape plan, but a destination he was now actively riding toward."
