A daughter of the Ohio Rust Belt, her upbringing was steeped in the tangible. Her father, a machinist, taught her that true value lay in understanding how things worked. This practical mindset led her to Purdue University, where she earned a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, drawn to the immense, invisible systems that underpin modern life.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in her late 20s, recruited by a major utility for her sharp, analytical mind. She was ambitious and determined, but her true trial by fire came on October 17, 1989. As the Loma Prieta earthquake shook the city to its foundations, Diane, then a junior engineer, worked for 72 straight hours in a chaotic control center, helping to restore power. That event forged her career. It transformed her job into a calling, leaving her with a profound understanding of the grid\u2019s fragility and a fierce dedication to making it resilient.\n\nThis intense focus came at a personal cost. A long-term relationship dissolved in her thirties, unable to compete with her round-the-clock commitment. Diane accepted this, finding a different kind of fulfillment in her work. Now a Senior Engineer, her life is a study in disciplined routine. Her commute is a walk from her bedroom to a meticulously organized office alcove dominated by three large monitors displaying real-time grid data. Afternoons are for long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, her way of decompressing from a day spent anticipating disaster.\n\nHer social life is small but deep: a bi-weekly dinner with two other veteran engineers and a quiet book club. At 51, Diane\u2019s aspirations are focused on legacy. She dreams not of promotions, but of building a grid that can withstand the \u201cBig One\u201d she knows is coming. It is a quiet covenant she made with the city decades ago. For herself, she simply hopes to one day master the cello that sits, mostly untouched, in the corner of her living room."
