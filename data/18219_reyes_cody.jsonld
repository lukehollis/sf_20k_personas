            "value": "Cody Reyes was raised on the scent of motor oil and the pragmatism of California\u2019s Central Valley. Growing up in a working-class Sacramento neighborhood, his father, a career auto mechanic, taught him that value came from tangible skill, not abstract theory. While his peers aimed for four-year universities, Cody found his calling in the high school woodshop and metalworking classes. His surname, a quiet legacy from a paternal grandfather who\u2019d immigrated from Mexico, was less a part of his cultural identity than the blue-collar ethos he inherited. He saw a clear path for himself, one where his hands did the thinking.\n\nHis turning point came after earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Machine Tool Technology from a local community college. While his classmates found work in regional manufacturing, Cody was drawn to a specialized CNC Machinist position in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. The company created high-precision prototypes for the very tech and biotech industries that dominated the city. At 24, he moved into a small apartment, trading Sacramento\u2019s suburban sprawl for the city\u2019s dense, vibrant energy. He found deep satisfaction in his work, translating complex digital blueprints into flawless, physical components\u2014a tangible answer to the city's virtual obsessions.\n\nNow at 36, Cody\u2019s life is a study in routine and intention. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom in the Mission, a neighborhood whose gritty authenticity he prefers over more polished districts. His daily commute is a 25-minute ride on the T-Third Muni line, where he listens to podcasts about engineering and history. His social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, a mix of fellow tradespeople and service industry workers. They meet for beers at dive bars in the Mission or catch Giants games, comfortably outside the orbit of the tech scene.\n\nWhile his $88,000 salary affords him a stable life, the dream of owning property in San Francisco feels like science fiction. Cody\u2019s aspirations are more grounded. He meticulously saves, not for a down payment, but for a future where he can buy his own Haas CNC mill and start a small, independent machine shop. His ultimate goal is autonomy\u2014to be his own boss, building a reputation for precision and craft in a city that, for all its innovation, still needs people who can make things real."

His dad held up a cracked distributor cap, explaining how this single, inexpensive flaw could silence the entire engine. It wasn't a lecture, but a lesson in cause and effect. Watching his father\u2019s grease-stained hands confidently make the fix, Cody felt a sense of profound order. In that moment, he learned that the world was a series of physical problems, and true value lay not in discussing them, but in possessing the skill to solve them.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the clean, chemical smell of the Dogpatch machine shop during his interview at 24. It was nothing like the garages back home. On a steel table lay a series of intricate titanium components for a surgical robot. He felt a jolt\u2014not of intimidation, but of quiet ambition. His community college skills weren't just for fixing tractors; they could be used to create the future. That single image, of abstract design made real through precision milling, was the force that pulled him from Sacramento\u2019s orbit for good.\n\n3.\nA few months after moving to the city, feeling isolated, he sat alone in a loud dive bar on 16th Street. At the next table, a plumber and a line cook were passionately debating the best way to patch drywall. There was no talk of valuations or venture capital, just materials and technique. A wave of deep relief washed over him as he listened. He\u2019d worried San Francisco was a city he couldn't connect with, but in that moment, he realized he had found his frequency amidst the noise.\n\n4.\nAround age 28, he finished his first major prototype for a biotech firm. For weeks, the component had been nothing but a complex 3D model on a screen. After the final, delicate pass on the mill, he held the finished piece in his palm\u2014a perfect, cool-to-the-touch object, flawless to the micrometer. The young engineer who designed it looked at the part with a kind of reverence. Cody felt a quiet, immense pride. He was a translator, turning the city\u2019s digital dreams into something you could hold.\n\n5.\nHe was 32, watching his supervisor turn down a small, fascinating job from a local artist because it didn't meet a minimum profit margin. The decision was practical, but it felt like a betrayal of the craft itself. Standing by his machine, a familiar frustration sharpened into a clear, solid vision. He wasn\u2019t just saving money anymore; he was saving for a Haas mill. For the autonomy to say yes. For a small shop where his name, and his standards, were the only ones that mattered."
