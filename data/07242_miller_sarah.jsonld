Born in the East Bay to a Korean mother and a white American father, her childhood was a delicious fusion of cultures. She remembers the comforting scent of her grandmother\u2019s kimchi jjigae simmering on the stove alongside her father\u2019s meticulously smoked brisket in the backyard. For Sarah, food was never just sustenance; it was the language of her family, a bridge between two distinct heritages.\n\nAfter high school, she dutifully enrolled in community college with a vague plan for a business degree, but the sterile quiet of the lecture hall felt alienating. The part-time job she took as a prep cook in a local bistro, however, felt like coming home. The heat, the pressure, the disciplined chaos of the kitchen\u2014it was there she found her purpose. She dropped out of college after two semesters, a decision that disappointed her parents but ignited a fire within her.\n\nSarah worked her way up through sheer grit, moving from suburban kitchens to the demanding culinary scene of San Francisco. Now 27, she is the Sous Chef at a respected Cal-Italian restaurant in North Beach. Her life is a testament to her dedication; she lives in a small studio apartment directly above the restaurant, making her commute a simple walk downstairs. Her social circle is her kitchen crew\u2014a tight-knit, profane, and fiercely loyal family forged in the heat of service.\n\nHer daily routine is punishing but rewarding. She\u2019s at the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market by dawn, hand-selecting produce, followed by twelve-hour shifts of managing staff, perfecting sauces, and plating hundreds of dishes. In her rare moments of quiet, staring out her window at the neon lights of North Beach, Sarah dreams of her own place. Not a fine-dining temple, but a small, welcoming eatery serving the Korean-American comfort food of her youth. It\u2019s a dream she\u2019s building one long, exhausting, and perfectly seasoned day at a time."
