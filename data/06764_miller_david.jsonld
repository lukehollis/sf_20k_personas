The only son of Korean immigrants who ran a small, perpetually steamy dry-cleaning business in Los Angeles, he grew up understanding that success was a non-negotiable expectation. He was the vessel for their American Dream, and he carried that weight with dutiful determination.\n\nInitially, David resisted the predictable path. Instead of medicine or law, he pursued a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown, dreaming of shaping legislation and working for the public good. However, a disillusioning internship on Capitol Hill, mired in bureaucratic inertia, soured his idealism. A recruiter from a top-tier consulting firm offered a different kind of impact: fast, decisive, and highly lucrative. David took the job, seeing it as a pragmatic pivot. The move to San Francisco a decade ago was for a promotion, another logical step up the corporate ladder.\n\nNow, at 44, David is a Senior Management Consultant, a fixer of other companies' vast, complex problems. The pandemic eliminated his commute, shrinking his world to the sleek, minimalist confines of his Hayes Valley condo. His days are a disciplined blur of strong espresso, back-to-back Zoom calls, and dense PowerPoint decks. The lines between his living room and his office have completely dissolved. His professional life is a success, but his personal life bears the scars of his ambition; a long-term relationship withered years ago, unable to compete with 80-hour work weeks.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is functional. He appreciates the world-class restaurants he can get delivered and the proximity of Golden Gate Park for his weekend runs\u2014his primary method of de-stressing. His social circle is small, comprised of a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique pressures of their field.\n\nLately, a familiar restlessness has returned. The financial security his parents dreamed of for him has been achieved, yet a void remains. David finds himself dreaming of applying his strategic skills to a non-profit, or perhaps mentoring young entrepreneurs. He aspires to build a life where success is measured not by billable hours and stock options, but by genuine connection and meaningful impact\u2014a return to the idealistic young man he once was."
