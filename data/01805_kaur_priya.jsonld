The only daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who found a new life farming peaches near Yuba City, Priya grew up between two worlds: the spiritual community of the local gurdwara and the demanding rhythm of American farm life. She witnessed firsthand how language barriers and cultural gaps created health inequities, watching elders in her community struggle with diabetes and heart disease without culturally competent guidance.\n\nThis early exposure fueled her path to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a Master's in Public Health. For over a decade, Priya dedicated herself to the non-profit sector, creating wellness programs for underserved communities in Oakland and San Francisco. She was fulfilled but perpetually frustrated by the lack of resources and scale.\n\nThe turning point came in her early forties. A burgeoning health-tech startup, flush with venture capital but lacking public health expertise, recruited her. Priya was initially skeptical of their \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d ethos, but she saw the undeniable potential to reach millions. She made the leap, trading grant proposals for stock options, and found a new calling: becoming the human conscience inside the machine.\n\nNow 51, Priya works from her serene Cole Valley apartment, her 0.0-mile commute taking her from her yoga mat to her standing desk. Her days are spent on Zoom, patiently translating the nuances of behavioral science and preventative health to brilliant, data-obsessed engineers. She is the bridge, ensuring the wellness app her company develops is effective, ethical, and accessible.\n\nDivorced in her late thirties and with no children, Priya has cultivated a rich, independent life. Her small circle of friends consists of old colleagues from her public health days and neighbors she\u2019s met walking her rescue terrier up to Tank Hill for sunrise views. Her ambition has shifted from climbing a ladder to building a legacy. She dreams of using her position to fund and mentor young women of color entering public health, ensuring the next generation has the resources she once lacked, and proving that technology, guided by humanity, can truly heal."
