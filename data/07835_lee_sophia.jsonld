Raised in a practical, hardworking Korean-American family in San Jose, her path was expected to lead toward medicine or law. Her father, a software engineer, and her mother, who ran a successful dry-cleaning business, viewed art as a pleasant hobby, not a viable career. Sophia, a diligent and respectful daughter, initially enrolled as a pre-med major at UC Davis, dutifully memorizing biology terms while her spirit quietly starved.\n\nThe turning point was an elective: Art History 101. A lecture on the emotional chaos and sublime structure of Abstract Expressionism felt like a key turning in a lock she hadn\u2019t known existed. It was a language that made more sense than cellular mitosis. Against her parents\u2019 gentle but firm protests, she switched her major. This quiet act of rebellion defined her twenties. She pursued her passion with the same work ethic her parents had instilled in her, earning a Master's in Curatorial Practice from the San Francisco Art Institute.\n\nAfter a grueling but illuminating internship at SFMOMA, she found her niche. She accepted an Assistant Curator position at a small, ambitious contemporary gallery in Hayes Valley. The modest salary was offset by a unique perk: a small studio apartment directly above the gallery space, explaining her zero-mile commute.\n\nHer days are a blend of meticulous research, writing wall texts, handling delicate artworks, and drinking too much coffee from the artisanal shop down the block. Her social circle consists of a tight-knit group of artists and writers she met in grad school, their conversations at late-night ramen spots fueling her creative drive. While her parents now boast of their \"curator daughter,\" a hint of confusion remains in their voices.\n\nSophia\u2019s great ambition is to become a head curator, with a focus on showcasing emerging West Coast artists from the Asian diaspora. She wants to build bridges between the traditional art world and the vibrant, often-overlooked creators in her own community. For Sophia, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it's the living gallery she curates daily, her life and her work inextricably intertwined."
