Raised in West Oakland by a single mother, a tireless nurse's aide, he learned early about resilience. He watched her come home, exhausted but never broken, her life a quiet testament to caring for others. His world was one of close-knit community bonds and the visible fractures of systemic neglect, an environment that instilled in him a deep-seated empathy and a powerful desire to bridge the gaps he saw every day.\n\nInitially, he floundered at CSU East Bay, chasing a business degree that felt hollow. A single elective in social welfare, however, ignited a passion. It gave a name and a framework to the injustices and unspoken struggles he had witnessed his entire life. The true turning point came when his mother suffered a serious health crisis. As he navigated the bewildering healthcare bureaucracy on her behalf, he encountered a hospital social worker\u2014a calm, compassionate force who translated medical jargon, coordinated care, and treated his mother not as a case file, but as a person. In that moment, his future crystallized. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work.\n\nNow 34, Omar is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker at a major San Francisco medical center. His 0.0-mile commute is a core feature of his life; he lives in a cozy Inner Sunset apartment just three blocks from the hospital. His days are a hybrid of telehealth calls from his sunlit living room and in-person sessions with patients and families grappling with life-altering diagnoses. He is the person he once needed.\n\nHis life is intentionally calm to offset the emotional weight of his work. Mornings often start with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual of clearing his head. Evenings are for decompressing with his long-term partner, a public school teacher named Lena, sharing stories and quiet meals. While he finds immense fulfillment in his individual cases, Omar dreams of building something bigger: a community-based mental health initiative for young men of color, offering preventative care long before they reach a crisis point. It\u2019s his way of honoring his roots, using the stability he\u2019s built in San Francisco to reach back and fortify the foundations for others."
