The only child of Hong Kong immigrants, she spent her childhood stocking shelves and running the register at her parents\u2019 small neighborhood grocery store on Taraval Street. She learned Cantonese, the value of a dollar, and the quiet resilience required to thrive. While her parents envisioned a stable career in medicine or law, Sarah was drawn to stories. She consumed films voraciously, fascinated by how narratives were constructed.\n\nThis passion led her to UCLA for film studies and then to a Master of Fine Arts in Documentary Film Production. She had a clear dream: to tell the nuanced stories of immigrant communities like her own. However, the reality of the industry\u2014unpaid internships and fierce competition for funding\u2014proved jarringly impractical against her pragmatic upbringing. A pivotal moment came during a freelance gig editing corporate videos when a project manager noticed her knack for organizing chaotic timelines and managing creative personalities.\n\nOn a whim, she applied for a junior producer role at a burgeoning tech startup. The \u201cstructured chaos\u201d of product launches felt surprisingly familiar, echoing the rhythms of her family\u2019s store. She excelled, translating her filmmaking skills of managing crews and budgets into delivering software.\n\nNow 38, Sarah is a successful Production Manager, working entirely from her meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute affords her a lifestyle of intention. Mornings begin with a strong coffee and a walk through Patricia\u2019s Green before her first virtual stand-up meeting. Her days are a blur of Slack messages, video calls, and digital roadmaps. She has a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and old film school peers who keep her grounded.\n\nThough successful, a part of her still holds onto her original dream. Sarah sees her tech career not as a detour, but as the engine that will one day fund her own documentary film company. She is a quintessential San Franciscan: a product of immigrant grit, shaped by creative ambition, and now navigating the city\u2019s ever-evolving digital frontier, hoping to one day merge her two worlds."
