Raised in the small, arts-centric town of Ashland, Oregon, by a librarian mother and a high school drama teacher father, her childhood was filled with books and creative expression. This environment naturally led her to the University of Oregon, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, imagining a future in publishing or academia.\n\nReality, however, required a paycheck. After graduating, Sarah moved to San Francisco in her early twenties, drawn by its magnetic pull of opportunity and culture. Her first job was writing product descriptions for a small, independent home goods boutique in Hayes Valley. It was here she had her epiphany: the narrative skills she\u2019d honed dissecting novels could be used to tell the story of a brand, to create a feeling and a connection with a customer. She discovered a passion for weaving stories around objects, transforming a simple ceramic mug into a vessel for a quiet morning ritual.\n\nThis discovery propelled her career. She moved to a larger sustainable fashion brand, climbing the ranks from copywriter to her current role as a Retail Marketing Manager. The pandemic shifted her work entirely remote, shrinking her commute from a crowded MUNI ride to a 0.0-mile stroll from her bedroom to the desk in her light-filled NoPa apartment.\n\nA key turning point came three years ago with the end of a seven-year relationship. The breakup, coinciding with the city\u2019s lockdown, forced an uncomfortable but ultimately clarifying period of introspection. She had to rebuild her social life and her sense of self, independent of a partner. Now, at 38, her life is her own. Her days start with a foggy morning run in the Panhandle and coffee from The Mill. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of friends, forged through book clubs and shared dinners.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep; she feels a part of its fabric. She dreams of one day starting her own consulting agency, helping small, ethical brands find their voice. For now, she finds contentment in the life she has carefully authored for herself, a quiet narrative of resilience and cultivated joy, set against the backdrop of her chosen city."
