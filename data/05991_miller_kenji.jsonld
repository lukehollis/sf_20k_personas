The son of a Kyoto-born ceramicist and a pragmatic white architect from Ohio, Kenji grew up in the quiet, foggy avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. His childhood was a gentle negotiation between two cultures: the precise, patient artistry of his mother and the structured, civic-mindedness of his father. This duality fostered a deep-seated empathy and a powerful sense of responsibility.\n\nHe sought escape from the city\u2019s academic pressure cookers at UC Santa Cruz, initially exploring a psychology degree with vague intentions of clinical practice. His turning point came during his junior year while volunteering at a shelter for unhoused youth. There, the abstract theories from his textbooks collided with the raw, urgent needs of people his own age. The systemic failures were glaring. He realized he didn't want to just listen to problems in an office; he wanted to be on the ground, actively dismantling them.\n\nAfter graduating, Kenji took a demanding role as a live-in Case Manager at a non-profit providing supportive housing for young adults aging out of foster care. His 0.0-mile commute means his life is a constant immersion. Mornings are for check-ins and paperwork, afternoons for connecting his residents with job training and mental health services, and evenings are often spent de-escalating conflicts or just being a stable presence. He is perpetually on-call, a reality that strains his personal relationships. His social life is compressed into bi-weekly trivia nights in the Mission with a tight-knit group of college friends\u2014his only true escape.\n\nKenji still feels a profound connection to the city that raised him, though he now inhabits one of its most challenging epicenters. He dreams of eventually pursuing a Master's in Social Work to move into policy, hoping to address the root causes of the crises he manages daily. For now, his aspiration is simpler: to not burn out, and to help the young people in his care build a foundation solid enough to call this complex, beautiful, and demanding city their own."
