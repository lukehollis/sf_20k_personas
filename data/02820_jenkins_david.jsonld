Raised in a practical, working-class family, his father, a lifelong mechanic, never quite understood David\u2019s quiet, observant nature. To please his family and find a stable path, David pursued an Associate's degree, initially in computer-aided design, hoping to merge his artistic sensibilities with a trade. However, he found the work sterile and unfulfilling, a world of lines and measurements that lacked a human touch.\n\nThe pivotal moment of his life arrived not in a classroom, but in a hospital room. When his mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, David became one of her primary caregivers. The experience was harrowing, but through the pain, he found a profound sense of purpose. He saw firsthand the immense impact of a skilled, compassionate nurse\u2014the one who could offer comfort with a quiet word, adjust a pillow just right, or simply bear witness to a family\u2019s grief. This grueling period reshaped him completely. He abandoned design and enrolled in a Licensed Vocational Nurse program, trading pixels for people.\n\nSeeking a place that valued both community and individuality, David moved to San Francisco in his early thirties. He found work\u2014and his home\u2014at a long-term palliative care facility in the quiet Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a simple walk from his small staff apartment to the patient wing. His days are a structured rhythm of medication schedules, wound care, and gentle conversations. He is a steady presence for those in their final chapter, offering dignity when little else is left.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few fellow nurses with whom he shares a dark humor and deep bond. On his days off, he walks through Golden Gate Park or takes the N-Judah to the ocean, finding solace in the vastness of the Pacific. His dreams are no longer grand; he simply hopes to continue his work, maybe save enough to one day see the Northern Lights. For David, a fulfilling life isn't about ambition, but about providing a quiet, human anchor in life's most turbulent waters."
