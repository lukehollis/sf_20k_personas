Raised in Sacramento, the daughter of a high school history teacher and a state accountant, she grew up with a deep-seated belief in the power of public service. Her childhood was stable and academically focused, a world away from the dynamism she would later embrace.\n\nHer educational journey took her to UC Davis for her undergraduate degree in Political Science, but it was at UC Berkeley\u2019s Goldman School of Public Policy where her life\u2019s trajectory was set. There, she not only honed her skills in quantitative analysis but also met Amir Rahman, a charismatic engineering student from a Pakistani immigrant family. Their connection was immediate and profound, a meeting of two different worlds united by a shared vision for a better future. They married shortly after graduation and settled in San Francisco.\n\nSusan\u2019s career began with an entry-level analyst position in the city administrator\u2019s office. She arrived just in time to witness the chaos of the first dot-com boom and the subsequent bust, an experience that cemented her focus. She saw the city government struggle to react, and she dedicated herself to creating proactive policies for technological change. Her rise through the ranks was steady, driven by her sharp intellect and unwavering work ethic.\n\nThe defining turning point of her life came fifteen years ago when Amir died suddenly from an aggressive cancer. The loss was devastating, leaving a void that she filled with her work. She poured her energy into her career, finding purpose in tackling the city\u2019s complex challenges.\n\nToday, Susan lives in a tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. Her daily routine is disciplined: a morning read of policy briefs, a 4.5-mile commute on the Muni, and long days at City Hall navigating the delicate dance between tech giants and community needs. Her social life is a small, tight circle of long-time friends, with whom she shares dinners and visits to the SFJAZZ Center. The name Rahman is a cherished link to the great love of her life. Her hope is not for power, but for legacy\u2014to build a framework for San Francisco that responsibly harnesses innovation for the public good, a quiet tribute to the future she and Amir once planned together."

He spoke of structural elegance serving human connection, and Susan saw her own ideals reflected in his design. That single conversation fused her world of policy with his world of creation. It became the blueprint for her life's work: building bridges between technology and community. This was during her first year at UC Berkeley.\n\n2.\nIn their first year in the city, Amir took her to the top of Bernal Hill at dusk. The city lights flickered on below, a vast circuit board of life. \"Look,\" he'd said, his arm warm around her, \"It's all potential, waiting for a better operating system.\" She felt an overwhelming sense of hope, a belief that together, they could help write that code. That hope became the anchor she holds onto now. This was 25 years ago.\n\n3.\nShe vividly remembers watching movers haul Aeron chairs out of a defunct startup on Townsend Street. The young CEO looked utterly defeated. It wasn't the failure of the company that struck her, but the failure of the city to create a safety net or a sustainable plan. It was chaos. That image ignited a cold, clear resolve in her: she would never again let the city be so unprepared for the tides of innovation. This was during the dot-com bust, twenty-two years ago.\n\n4.\nThe hospital room was silent except for the beeping monitors. Amir\u2019s hand felt frail in hers. He turned his head and, with a final surge of clarity, whispered, \"Keep building, Susan. For both of us.\" The words were a gut-wrenching gift and a burden. In the shattering quiet after he was gone, that gentle command became her only purpose. His death didn't just break her heart; it forged her legacy. This was fifteen years ago.\n\n5.\nJust last week on her morning Muni ride, she watched a young programmer across from her coding furiously on a laptop, oblivious to the city outside. Instead of annoyance, a wave of profound purpose washed over her. She wasn\u2019t just a policy maker; she was a container builder, creating a stable framework for that raw, chaotic energy. It was a silent, ongoing promise to Amir\u2014to protect the city they both loved from the very forces that made it great."
