The son of an Irish immigrant ironworker and a second-generation Irish-American schoolteacher, Liam\u2019s upbringing was steeped in pragmatism and the value of a sharp mind. He was taught that intellectual rigor was the surest path away from the physical toil that defined his father\u2019s life. He excelled, leaving Boston for an East Coast university where he pursued a graduate degree that surprised his practical family: Urban Planning. He was fascinated by systems, by the flow of people and resources, and how deliberate design could shape a community\u2019s future.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn not by the gold rush of the dot-com boom, but by the city\u2019s complex urban fabric. However, he quickly realized the most dynamic, chaotic new \"city\" being built was the internet. He pivoted, discovering his skills in systems-thinking were uniquely suited for technology strategy. While others chased fleeting IPOs, Liam survived the dot-com bust by building a reputation for clear-eyed, sustainable strategy, becoming the calm voice of reason for founders high on ambition.\n\nHis life is now one of cultivated precision, lived from his minimalist condo on Telegraph Hill. A key turning point was his amicable divorce five years ago; his dedication to his career had crowded out the space for his marriage to breathe. Now, his 0.0-mile commute defines his existence. His days begin with a brisk walk up the Filbert Steps before settling in front of his monitors, the bay and Alcatraz a serene backdrop to the high-stakes digital chess he plays for his clients. He is the disembodied voice of logic on a dozen daily video calls.\n\nLiam\u2019s social connections are few but deep\u2014a monthly poker game with other industry veterans, a quiet dinner in North Beach. He observes the city more than he participates in it, a strategist watching from his perch. Though financially secure, a hollowness pervades him. He dreams of applying his skills to civic tech or advising municipal projects, to feel the concrete impact of his work again. He wants to pivot one last time, from optimizing virtual systems to helping build a better, more equitable San Francisco\u2014the city he originally came to study."
