The son of Korean immigrants, he was raised behind the counter of his parents' Daly City dry-cleaning business, the scent of steam and chemical solvents a constant backdrop to his childhood. He learned early that success was a fortress built of tireless work and academic excellence, a lesson he absorbed completely.\n\nHis path was a direct ascent: an economics degree from UCLA, followed by a prestigious MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. This credential was his golden ticket into the demanding world of management consulting. For years, his life was a blur of airport lounges, client boardrooms, and late-night PowerPoint decks. He was a rising star, lauded for his sharp, analytical mind and his ability to streamline any corporate process into a model of ruthless efficiency. He thrived on the pressure, believing it was the life he was meant to lead.\n\nThe turning point wasn't a single event but a slow-dawning realization during the pandemic-enforced stillness. Grounded from travel, the glamour of his career evaporated, leaving only the stark reality of endless Zoom calls and isolating work. His long-term relationship, already strained by his punishing schedule, finally fractured under the weight of his emotional absence. Alone in his pristine apartment, with the Bay Bridge glittering impersonally outside his window, Ethan realized he was optimizing everything but his own happiness.\n\nToday, his routine is disciplined but hollow. He remains a top-tier consultant, but the work feels transactional. Mornings are for client calls, afternoons for data analysis, and evenings are often spent on long, solitary jogs along the Embarcadero, wrestling with a future he can\u2019t yet define. While he lives in the heart of modern San Francisco, he feels detached from its vibrant, chaotic soul. Ethan dreams of breaking away from the corporate ladder and building something with tangible, human impact\u2014perhaps a social enterprise or a mentorship program. He yearns to apply his formidable skills not just to a client\u2019s bottom line, but to a purpose that finally feels like his own."
