Raised by an accountant father and a high school teacher mother, his path was pre-paved with expectations: good grades, a four-year degree from a UC school, and a stable, respectable career. Eli obliged, enrolling at San Francisco State University to study communications, a major he chose with a shrug. He felt adrift in lecture halls, the theories disconnected from the vibrant city just outside his classroom window.\n\nTo cover rent for a shared Sunset District apartment, he took a busser job at \"Madrone,\" a bustling, farm-to-table restaurant in Hayes Valley. The controlled chaos of the dinner rush felt more real and vital than any textbook. He loved the immediate feedback\u2014a cleared plate, a customer's smile, the shared sigh of relief with the kitchen crew after a slammed service. He was a quick study, observant and calm under pressure. Within a year, he was promoted to server, then bartender.\n\nThe turning point came during his junior year. Juggling a full-time course load and nearly 30 hours a week at Madrone became untenable. When his mentor, the restaurant\u2019s owner, saw his potential and offered him an assistant manager track with a consistent salary, Eli made a choice. He dropped out of college, a decision that strained relations with his disappointed family.\n\nNow 25, Eli\u2019s world is the restaurant. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs from the small studio apartment above Madrone, a key part of his compensation package. His days start with inventory and vendor calls and end long after the last customer has gone home, sharing a staff meal with the people who have become his de facto family. His social life is a tight orbit of service industry folk, bonded by late nights and shared frustrations.\n\nHe loves the energy of San Francisco, feeling its pulse most acutely during the neighborhood\u2019s evening hum. Eli dreams of one day opening his own small, unpretentious wine bar in a neighborhood like the Richmond or Bernal Heights. He meticulously saves money and mentally catalogues every operational success and failure at Madrone. Yet, in the quiet moments after the last table has cleared, he questions if he has the stamina for the long haul, or if the restaurant that gave him a purpose will ultimately be the one to consume him."
