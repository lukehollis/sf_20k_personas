The only child of Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Irving Street, her childhood was a world of steam, folding tables, and the constant hum of machines. She watched her parents work tirelessly, their lives confined to a few city blocks. She also watched as rising rents and redevelopment eventually forced them to sell the business they had built, a pivotal moment that planted the seeds of her future career.\n\nDetermined to understand the forces that shaped her city, Mei Lin was the first in her family to attend university, earning a degree in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. She began her career at a non-profit, fighting for affordable housing, but grew frustrated by the slow pace of change. Driven by a pragmatic desire to build, she transitioned to the private sector, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. Her sharp intellect and deep understanding of San Francisco\u2019s complex political landscape made her an invaluable asset in the high-stakes world of real estate development.\n\nNow a Senior Real Estate Development Manager, Mei Lin lives the life she helped create. Her home is a spacious condo in a Mission Bay tower she personally oversaw from groundbreaking to completion. Her commute is zero miles; she works from a sleek home office overlooking the bay, her days a whirlwind of Zoom calls with architects, tense negotiations with city officials, and financial modeling. Her demanding career contributed to a divorce a decade ago, and she now leads a solitary but structured life. Her social circle consists mainly of professional colleagues, with whom she shares expensive dinners and industry gossip.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is a complicated one. She walks the same streets as her parents but sees them through a developer\u2019s eyes\u2014as parcels of land, zoning opportunities, and potential projects. Her current dream is to spearhead a legacy project: a large-scale, mixed-income community that is both profitable and socially conscious, a way to reconcile the working-class world of her past with the powerful one she now occupies. She hopes to build a piece of the city that doesn\u2019t displace families like her own, leaving a permanent, positive mark on the skyline she knows so intimately."
