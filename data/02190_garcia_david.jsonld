The son of Mexican-American farmworkers from Fresno, he was raised on the gospel of hard work and the promise of education as an escape from the fields. His parents poured their savings into his future, and David, with a quiet, artistic soul, surprised them by choosing to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz. He spent four years immersed in the world of Renaissance frescoes and Dutch masters, a world utterly removed from his own.\n\nThe reality of post-graduation, however, was stark. A B.A. in Art History didn\u2019t pay the bills. His first real job was in the facilities department of a struggling Oakland museum\u2014a compromise that kept him near art while offering a steady paycheck. It was there David discovered his true, marketable talent: an uncanny ability for logistics and problem-solving. He could diagnose a failing HVAC system, manage a team of custodians, and negotiate with vendors with a calmness that bordered on stoic.\n\nThis practical skill set led him from the non-profit world to the lucrative heart of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District. For the past fifteen years, David has been the Facilities Manager for a major investment firm. He\u2019s the man who ensures the lights stay on, the servers stay cool, and the multi-million dollar deals happen in a comfortable, secure environment. He lives in a sleek, modern SoMa condo, a deliberate choice that allows him to walk to his high-rise office, his commute a non-existent 0.0 miles.\n\nHis life is ordered and solitary. A quiet divorce years ago left him with a cherished, long-distance relationship with his college-aged daughter, Maya. His daily routine is one of maintenance, both for his building and himself. He finds satisfaction in his work\u2019s concrete results, a tangible counterpoint to the abstract world of finance he serves. Yet, on lonely weekends, he strolls through SFMOMA, not as a manager, but as the young man who once believed his life would be about beauty. His dream is no longer to be a curator, but simpler: to one day retire and work as a museum docent, finally uniting the practical man he is with the art historian he almost was."

The raw, human grief on the painted faces\u2014nearly 700 years old\u2014struck him with the force of a physical blow. It was the moment art ceased to be a subject and became a vital, living truth. That silent, profound connection was a secret he would carry with him for decades, a foundational piece of a life he would never fully live. (When: Age 20, during an Art History survey course).\n\n***\n\n2.\nA pipe had burst in the archives of the Oakland museum, threatening a collection of stored drawings. While the curator panicked, David, then just a junior facilities assistant, waded into the ankle-deep water, found the main shut-off valve, and calmly began damage control. The curator\u2019s tearful gratitude wasn't for his knowledge of art, but for his knowledge of plumbing. In that damp basement, he felt the first, undeniable pull of practical competence, the satisfaction of fixing what was broken. It was the day his compromise began. (When: Age 23, his first job post-college).\n\n***\n\n3.\nHe held his daughter Maya's small hand as they stood before a massive Rothko at SFMOMA. She was eight. He tried to explain color theory, but she just whispered, \"It feels warm, Papa. Like a hug.\" In her simple, honest reaction, he felt a flicker of his old self. He wasn't a failed art historian; he was a father passing on the gift of seeing, of feeling. It was a quiet, potent reminder that the beauty he loved wasn't trapped in books, but could be shared. (When: Thirteen years ago).\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt was the first night in his SoMa condo after the divorce was finalized. The silence was absolute, amplified by the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city\u2019s electric grid. He wasn\u2019t sad, just hollowed out. He looked at his hands\u2014clean, capable, the hands that managed complex building systems\u2014and felt the ghost of his father\u2019s calloused, earth-stained hands. He had successfully escaped the fields for this sterile peace. The moment was a quiet reckoning of his pragmatic choices and their deep, solitary cost. (When: Eight years ago).\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast spring, he watched an elderly docent at the Legion of Honor explain a Dutch still life. She spoke not of technique, but of the fleetingness of life, the *vanitas*. A small crowd listened, their hurried day paused for a moment of shared reflection. David realized with sudden, piercing clarity that this was it. This was the final shape of his dream. Not to be an authority, but to be a guide\u2014a quiet, steady presence ushering people toward a moment of beauty. (When: Last year)."
