The son of Mexican-American farmworkers from Fresno, he was raised on the gospel of hard work and the promise of education as an escape from the fields. His parents poured their savings into his future, and David, with a quiet, artistic soul, surprised them by choosing to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz. He spent four years immersed in the world of Renaissance frescoes and Dutch masters, a world utterly removed from his own.\n\nThe reality of post-graduation, however, was stark. A B.A. in Art History didn\u2019t pay the bills. His first real job was in the facilities department of a struggling Oakland museum\u2014a compromise that kept him near art while offering a steady paycheck. It was there David discovered his true, marketable talent: an uncanny ability for logistics and problem-solving. He could diagnose a failing HVAC system, manage a team of custodians, and negotiate with vendors with a calmness that bordered on stoic.\n\nThis practical skill set led him from the non-profit world to the lucrative heart of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District. For the past fifteen years, David has been the Facilities Manager for a major investment firm. He\u2019s the man who ensures the lights stay on, the servers stay cool, and the multi-million dollar deals happen in a comfortable, secure environment. He lives in a sleek, modern SoMa condo, a deliberate choice that allows him to walk to his high-rise office, his commute a non-existent 0.0 miles.\n\nHis life is ordered and solitary. A quiet divorce years ago left him with a cherished, long-distance relationship with his college-aged daughter, Maya. His daily routine is one of maintenance, both for his building and himself. He finds satisfaction in his work\u2019s concrete results, a tangible counterpoint to the abstract world of finance he serves. Yet, on lonely weekends, he strolls through SFMOMA, not as a manager, but as the young man who once believed his life would be about beauty. His dream is no longer to be a curator, but simpler: to one day retire and work as a museum docent, finally uniting the practical man he is with the art historian he almost was."
