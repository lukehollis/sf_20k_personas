            "value": "Chloe Petrova\u2019s world is measured in centimeters and centuries. The daughter of a pragmatic engineer and a high school teacher from Walnut Creek, her life was meant to follow a stable, suburban trajectory. Her fascination with the past, however, was kindled by a single object: a small, dark, icon painting of Saint Nicholas that her Russian grandparents had brought with them to America. It was unsigned, cracked with age, and held the silent history of a world away. This artifact became her first, lifelong appraisal project.\n\nWhile her parents encouraged more practical studies, Chloe pursued her passion, earning a BA in Art History from UC Berkeley. She then obtained a Master\u2019s in Art Business, learning the cold mechanics of a world she loved for its soul. Her first job was with a prestigious international auction house, a whirlwind of high-value transactions where masterpieces were treated as assets. The turning point came when she handled a beautiful, albeit minor, Impressionist piece being sold off briskly to cover an estate tax. She felt a profound disconnect, realizing she was more interested in the story being lost than the commission being made.\n\nAt 26, she took a leap and founded Petrova Appraisals, operating out of her apartment. This explains her zero-mile commute; her Russian Hill studio is both her office and her sanctuary, surrounded by reference books, valuation guides, and archival tools. Her days are a quiet ritual: a morning spent researching provenance or examining a piece under magnification, followed by afternoons of client calls and report writing.\n\nChloe\u2019s life is deeply integrated with her neighborhood. She knows the baristas at her local cafe by name and takes long, head-clearing walks up to Ina Coolbrith Park for its panoramic views. Though her work is solitary, her social life is curated. Her closest friend is a curator at SFMOMA, and their conversations over wine in North Beach are a vital exchange of industry gossip and genuine artistic passion. Chloe\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to discover another Warhol; it\u2019s to help a family in the Sunset District understand the value\u2014both monetary and emotional\u2014of a painting their grandfather bought in Paris after the war. For Chloe, San Francisco is a city of hidden heirlooms, and she is their dedicated storyteller."
