The only son of hardworking Gujarati immigrants, he grew up in the fog-dusted suburbs of Daly City. His parents, who ran a small dry-cleaning business, instilled in him the values of stability and pragmatism. They saw education not as a path to passion, but as a means to a secure job. Brandon, an agreeable and dutiful son, followed this advice without question.\n\nHe attended community college, earning an Associate's degree in Office Administration\u2014a practical choice that led to a series of administrative roles. He eventually landed a position as a Data Entry Clerk for a mid-sized tech company. It wasn\u2019t glamorous work, but it was a steady paycheck with benefits, the very definition of his parents\u2019 American dream for him.\n\nThe true turning point in Brandon\u2019s life was not a promotion, but the company\u2019s shift to permanent remote work post-pandemic. His 0.0-mile commute from his bed to his desk in his small Inner Richmond apartment initially felt like a blessing. The freedom from office life, however, slowly curdled into a deep-seated isolation. San Francisco, with its vibrant culture and bustling streets, became something he observed through his window, a backdrop to a life lived almost entirely online. His social connections frayed; friendships that were once maintained through after-work drinks now rely on sporadic text messages. A long-term relationship ended a year ago, her ambition clashing with his comfortable stasis.\n\nNow, Brandon\u2019s days are marked by the rhythmic click of his keyboard. His connection to his neighborhood is through solo walks to Golden Gate Park and nodding acquaintances at his local corner store. He harbors quiet dreams that feel monumental to him: joining a local Dungeons & Dragons group, learning how to bake sourdough from scratch, or simply having a meaningful, in-person conversation that isn\u2019t about a work ticket. He dreams not of climbing the corporate ladder, but of building a small, tangible life beyond his screen, hoping to one day feel less like a data point and more like a resident of the city he technically never leaves."
