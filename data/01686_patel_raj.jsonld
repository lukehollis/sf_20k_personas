The son of Gujarati immigrants who ran a small convenience store in Fremont, Raj grew up surrounded by the tangible metrics of success: long hours, steady income, and providing for family. While his parents championed the stability of engineering, Raj secretly filled sketchbooks and found solace in museums, eventually pursuing an Art History degree at UC Santa Cruz\u2014an act of quiet rebellion.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco after graduation, full of dreams of curating for a small gallery or working at SFMOMA. The reality was a series of unpaid internships and part-time caf\u00e9 jobs that barely covered the rent on his tiny room. The turning point came at 26, when a mountain of student debt and a family friend\u2019s offer led him to a training program for an insurance firm. He told himself it was temporary. Eight years later, he is a senior claims adjuster, working remotely from his rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nHis days follow a predictable rhythm. He starts with strong coffee, logs into his system, and spends his hours immersed in a world of digital files and calculated loss\u2014car accidents, water damage, stolen property. It\u2019s an analytical job that uses a part of his brain he respects but doesn't love. His 0.0-mile commute gives him no separation between work and life, so his apartment has become his sanctuary. The walls are covered not in family photos, but in prints from artists he studied in college, a constant reminder of the life he once envisioned.\n\nHis social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few college friends who understand his internal conflict. They meet for dim sum on Clement Street or long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. Though he feels like an observer of San Francisco's frantic energy rather than a participant, he loves his neighborhood's foggy tranquility. Raj\u2019s quiet dream is to save enough to finally leave the world of risk assessment and open a small bookstore dedicated to art and photography. It\u2019s this future\u2014a life surrounded by beauty instead of loss\u2014that fuels him through each claim he closes."
