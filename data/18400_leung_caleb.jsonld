His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small but beloved herbal medicine shop on Clement Street. From a young age, Caleb spent his afternoons stocking shelves and translating for elderly customers, witnessing firsthand the quiet struggles of his community\u2014navigating complex healthcare forms, facing language barriers, and trying to maintain dignity on a fixed income. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a more lucrative career, like engineering, these early experiences planted a different seed in him.\n\nHis turning point came during his freshman year at San Francisco State University. He volunteered at a nonprofit where he was assigned to help a monolingual Cantonese family whose son was facing a severe, undiagnosed mental health crisis. Caleb spent weeks bridging the gap between the terrified parents and an overwhelmed, under-resourced public health system. Securing a proper diagnosis and care plan for the boy felt like a monumental victory, cementing his decision to major in Social Work.\n\nNow 28, Caleb works as a Community Health Worker for a clinic serving low-income families. His life is a testament to his values, though it comes at a cost. On his $68,000 salary, homeownership is a distant fantasy; he shares a cramped three-bedroom apartment with two other public service professionals just a few blocks from his childhood home. His daily routine is grounded and predictable: a 1.2-mile ride on the 38 Geary MUNI bus, a day spent fighting for his clients, and evenings unwinding with friends over cheap pho or a hike in the Presidio.\n\nCaleb\u2019s relationship with San Francisco is one of deep, complicated love. He resents the tech-fueled displacement he sees daily, yet he can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow nonprofit warriors who understand the burnout and the passion. His dream isn't wealth, but efficacy. He hopes to eventually get his Master's in Public Health, aiming to move from direct service to policy, to fix the systemic cracks he spends his days patching over for others. He remains a crucial, albeit underpaid, thread in the city\u2019s social fabric, dedicated to caring for the San Francisco that raised him."

Standing in the aisle of his parents\u2019 shop, he translated the formal, unforgiving English that announced a rent increase she could never afford. He saw the quiet terror bloom in her eyes, replacing her usual smile. In that moment, the weight of his community's silent struggles settled on his small shoulders, planting a seed of protective anger that would later grow into his life\u2019s purpose.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the fluorescent hum of the clinic room during his freshman year of college. For weeks, he\u2019d been the sole bridge between a terrified Cantonese-speaking mother and the medical system. When the doctor finally gave a name to her son's torment\u2014schizoaffective disorder\u2014Caleb translated the words, and the mother\u2019s raw, whispered \u201cthank you\u201d felt like a physical force. It wasn't a moment of joy, but of profound clarity. He finally understood that being a bridge wasn't just about language; it was about leading people out of chaos.\n\n3.\nIt was the first time telling his parents felt like a betrayal. Seated at their small kitchen table, he announced his major was Social Work. His father stared at his hands, while his mother\u2019s voice was soft but sharp, \u201cHow will you live?\u201d He heard their immigrant dream for him\u2014stability, security\u2014cracking under the weight of his choice. He couldn't explain the pull he felt, the sense of duty. He only knew he was disappointing them to become the person they had inadvertently raised him to be.\n\n4.\nLast winter, riding the 38 Geary home, the city\u2019s changes felt like a personal insult. Another beloved bakery on his street was gone, replaced by a soulless, minimalist cafe. A wave of bitter exhaustion washed over him; he felt like a man bailing out the ocean with a thimble. Then, through the window, he saw an elderly couple he\u2019d spent a month helping secure housing, walking hand-in-hand, laughing. The ocean was still there, but he\u2019d helped that one family build a raft. It was enough.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, high in the Presidio with his two roommates, the fog swallowed the city below. They passed around a cheap flask, trading stories of impossible caseloads and bureaucratic absurdities. Looking at their faces, lit by the glow of the distant city lights, Caleb felt a fierce rush of love. They were all broke, all tired, all bound to this beautiful, heartbreaking place by a shared, stubborn sense of duty. This group, this view, this feeling\u2014this was the San Francisco he fought for."
