The son of Punjabi immigrants, he grew up in the sweltering heat of Sacramento, where his parents ran a bustling laundromat. From a young age, Malik learned the rhythms of customer service and the weight of family responsibility. He was the first in his family to attend college, enrolling at Sacramento State with a burgeoning passion for graphic design, dreaming of creating logos and art for a living.\n\nThat dream was cut short during his sophomore year when his father suffered a severe heart attack. Malik dropped out and returned home to help run the family business, shelving his artistic ambitions for a more practical reality. He discovered a natural talent for management and inventory, but the creative spark dimmed.\n\nSeeking a life of his own after his father recovered, Malik moved to San Francisco five years ago. He found a job as an assistant manager at a high-end, artisanal grocery store. The position came with a rare perk: a small but clean one-bedroom apartment directly above the shop. This is the source of his non-existent commute; his workday begins by walking down a single flight of stairs.\n\nMalik's daily routine is a metronome of city life. He unlocks the store at dawn, oversees deliveries, and knows most of his regular customers by name. He\u2019s a fixture of the neighborhood\u2014a friendly, reliable presence. His social life is interwoven with his work; friendships are with coworkers, and his closest confidante is his younger sister, now a successful lawyer, whom he calls every Sunday.\n\nThough content, Malik feels a quiet pull toward the life he abandoned. In his off-hours, he fills sketchbooks with designs and layouts, a private hobby that fuels a persistent dream. He hopes to one day save enough to open his own small business\u2014perhaps a curated gift shop or a print store\u2014where he can finally merge his hard-won business acumen with the artistic passion he was forced to set aside. His life in San Francisco is stable and secure, but he sees it as a foundation, not a final destination."
