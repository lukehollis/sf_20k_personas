The only child of immigrants who ran a small laundromat in Daly City, his world was circumscribed by long hours, the clatter of coins, and his parents' fierce hope that he would transcend their life of toil. They envisioned him as an engineer or doctor, a path paved with financial security. David, however, was drawn to the stories he overheard between the spin cycles\u2014tales of housing struggles, health crises, and the quiet desperation of navigating a new country.\n\nHis rebellion was a quiet one. At UC Berkeley, he majored in sociology instead of computer science. The true turning point came during a volunteer stint at a Tenderloin drop-in center. He saw the city\u2019s deep inequalities not as an abstract concept but as the lived reality of individuals with names and histories. This experience solidified his path. He pursued a Master of Social Work, a decision that created a rift with his parents that took years to mend. His early career was a grueling climb through city agencies, marked by crushing caseloads and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nNow 45, David manages a supportive housing facility in SoMa, a role that perfectly explains his zero-mile commute: he lives in a small manager's apartment on the ground floor. His life is inextricably woven into the fabric of the building. His mornings are for budgets and staff meetings; his afternoons are for mediating resident disputes or connecting someone with mental health services. The line between work and home is porous\u2014a late-night knock on his door about a broken pipe is as common as a quiet evening reading.\n\nThough dedicated to his work, David is privately lonely. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his demanding career. His social life consists of occasional dinners with a few college friends and the deep, if sometimes draining, connections he has with his residents. His dream isn't grand; it's tangible. He hopes to see the city invest in proactive care rather than reactive crisis management. For himself, he harbors a quiet wish for a partner who understands his purpose, and perhaps, a small home with a garden, somewhere just far enough away that he\u2019d finally have a commute."

He had only ever heard his parents talk about bills and machines, but in that moment, he felt the immense, unseen weight of the lives cycling through their laundromat. It wasn't just about clean clothes; it was about holding things together. That day, the path his parents laid out for him\u2014safe, sterile, and predictable\u2014began to feel like someone else's road.\n\n2.\nHe was 20, a volunteer in the Tenderloin. An elderly resident named Maria was distraught, having lost a small packet of faded photographs\u2014her only link to family in another country. David spent two hours helping her retrace her steps, finally finding them tucked inside a newspaper. Her joyful, tearful gratitude felt more real and vital than any textbook theory. It was the moment \u201csocial issues\u201d became people with names and histories, and he knew, with unshakable certainty, that this was his work.\n\n3.\nHe was 38. Sarah stood in the doorway of his manager\u2019s apartment, her keys resting on the small counter. \"Your residents are your family, David,\" she\u2019d said, not angrily, but with a bone-deep sadness. \"There's just no room left for me.\" After she left, the silence of the apartment was louder than the usual late-night shouts from the hallway. He understood the sacrifice then. His purpose had a price, and that price was the quiet intimacy of a shared life lived outside those walls.\n\n4.\nHis father, visiting from Daly City, had never approved of his career. He walked the halls of the SoMa facility, his face a mask of confusion. Then, a resident stopped David, thanking him profusely for help with a complicated benefits application. Later, as his father was leaving, he simply placed a hand on David's shoulder. \"You work hard,\" he said in Mandarin. \"You take care of people.\" It wasn't the blessing for a lucrative career he once craved, but it was acceptance. It was everything.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a resident named Michael, who\u2019d been in and out of shelters for a decade, qualified for his own subsidized apartment. The day Michael got the key, he just held it in his open palm, staring. \"I forgot what these felt like,\" he whispered, his voice thick. In that simple, profound moment, all of David's exhaustion and bureaucratic fatigue vanished. This was the proactive care he dreamed of\u2014one person, one door, one key at a time. It was why he stayed."
