            "value": "Rohan Miller is a product of two distinct worlds. Born in Berkeley to a pragmatic structural engineer from Mumbai and a free-spirited ceramicist from Mendocino, his childhood was steeped in the scent of clay and blueprints. This duality defined him: a deep appreciation for both inviolable physical laws and boundless artistic expression. He initially followed his father\u2019s path, enrolling in civil engineering at UCLA, but found the rigidity stifling.\n\nA semester abroad in Berlin was his turning point. Immersed in the city's vibrant installation art scene and radical architecture, he discovered his true calling. He returned to the States and switched his focus, ultimately earning a Master of Fine Arts in Scenography and Spatial Design from a prestigious East Coast university. This unconventional path equipped him not to build skyscrapers, but to craft experiences.\n\nRohan\u2019s career began in theatrical set design, but he quickly gained a reputation for his larger, more ambitious projects. His breakthrough was a temporary, interactive light pavilion at a major art festival that garnered critical acclaim. Now, he is a sought-after architect of ephemeral and immersive spaces. He designs everything from museum exhibits that guide patrons through a narrative to technologically infused pop-up installations for tech companies looking to make an artistic statement.\n\nHe lives and works in a sprawling SoMa loft, a space with exposed brick walls that are part studio, part home. The 0.0-mile commute allows him to seamlessly blend life and work; sketches and 3D models share table space with his morning coffee. His days are a mix of intense focus, client video calls, and long walks through the Mission or Dogpatch, drawing inspiration from the city's textures and energy. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow artists, programmers, and designers.\n\nRohan feels a deep connection to San Francisco's spirit of innovation and reinvention. His ultimate dream is not to build a permanent monument, but to design a piece of public art for the city\u2014perhaps along the Embarcadero\u2014that changes with the seasons, a dynamic landmark that truly lives and breathes with its people."
