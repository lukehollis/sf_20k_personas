Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, he is the son of a Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) architect and an immigrant mother from Buenos Aires who arrived in the 80s as a tango instructor. His childhood was a gentle blend of his father\u2019s quiet precision and his mother\u2019s passionate expressiveness, a dual heritage that fostered a deep capacity for observation and empathy.\n\nInitially, Elias followed his father\u2019s path, enrolling in UC Berkeley\u2019s urban planning program. He was fascinated by how physical structures could shape human experience. However, a turning point came in his junior year when a close friend, struggling silently with severe depression, took their own life. The tragedy shattered Elias\u2019s blueprint for the future. He realized his true calling wasn't in designing buildings, but in helping people reconstruct their internal worlds. He changed course, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nAfter years of demanding but rewarding work at a community health clinic in the Mission District, Elias transitioned to private practice. He now runs his practice entirely from his Cole Valley apartment, explaining his zero-mile commute. His days are structured by back-to-back teletherapy sessions, where he specializes in helping clients navigate cultural identity issues, trauma, and anxiety. To decompress, he relies on a strict routine: morning runs through Golden Gate Park and the meditative process of cooking meals that often blend Japanese and Argentinian flavors.\n\nElias shares his life and home with his partner, Chloe, a landscape designer whose work with living things provides a soothing counterpoint to his own. He remains deeply connected to the city that raised him, seeing its boundless energy and hidden pains reflected in his clients. His dream is to eventually establish a small, collaborative wellness practice with other therapists, focused on providing culturally competent mental healthcare for the diverse communities that make San Francisco whole."

Her laughter echoed as his father, the architect, moved with a rigid geometry she tried to dissolve with her fluid grace. It wasn't just a dance; it was a negotiation between passion and precision. In that moment, watching them find a clumsy rhythm, Elias felt the first inkling of his life's work: understanding how disparate, beautiful worlds could learn to hold each other.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe memory from his junior year at Berkeley isn't of the phone call, but of the silence afterward. He was in the architecture library, surrounded by blueprints for perfect structures, when he realized he had completely missed the collapsing scaffolding of his friend\u2019s mind. The sterile lines on the page felt like a mockery. That profound sense of failure became a foundation. He left the library that day knowing he wasn\u2019t meant to design physical spaces, but to help people find their way out of broken internal ones.\n\n***\n\n3.\nEarly in his career at the Mission clinic, he sat with an elderly man who had survived political trauma in El Salvador and had not spoken for weeks. Elias simply brought two cups of tea, day after day. One afternoon, the man finally met his gaze and whispered a single word in Spanish: \"Gracias.\" The weight of that one word, offered from across a chasm of pain, was more affirming than any academic praise. It taught him that healing isn't always about fixing, but about the quiet, persistent act of showing up.\n\n***\n\n4.\nA few years ago, after a particularly draining week of sessions, he watched Chloe repotting an orchid on their Cole Valley patio. Her hands moved with a calm expertise, gently untangling the roots and settling the plant into fresh soil. She wasn\u2019t rushing or forcing it; she was creating the conditions for it to thrive again. Watching her tend to a living thing with such tangible care grounded him, reminding him that growth is a slow, quiet process that requires a gentle and patient hand.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a recent morning run, the fog in Golden Gate Park was a thick, silent blanket. He ran by memory, his feet knowing the familiar path. As he crested a small hill, the sun burned through, revealing the dewy silhouette of the Japanese Tea Garden\u2019s pagoda. The reveal felt like a therapy session\u2014moving through the dense fog of a client\u2019s anxiety to find that one, hard-won moment of clarity. In that instant, he felt an immense gratitude for the city that raised him and the people he was privileged to help navigate its fog."
