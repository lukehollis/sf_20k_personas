Fleeing post-Soviet instability, Anya and Dmitri Khakimov landed in Daly City, shortening their name and pouring their anxieties into their only son. For them, success was a predictable formula: discipline, STEM, and financial security. Ivan, quiet and observant, absorbed their fears and ambitions, excelling in the structured world of mathematics and logic.\n\nHis first act of rebellion was subtle. At UC Berkeley, instead of pure computer science, he chose a graduate program in Computational Linguistics. It was a compromise\u2014marrying the elegant chaos of human language with the rigid order of code. Here, he met Clara, an art history major who became his personal chaotic variable. She introduced him to the Mission\u2019s vibrant murals, hole-in-the-wall taquerias, and the messy, unpredictable beauty of a life lived without algorithms. Their passionate relationship ended when Ivan\u2019s ingrained need for predictable outcomes clashed with her spontaneity. The breakup was a critical failure in his personal data model, and he retreated.\n\nNow, Ivan lives a life of calculated precision. As a data scientist for a SoMa tech giant, he works from his minimalist Hayes Valley apartment, his commute a flat 0.0 miles. His days are a closed loop: coffee, code, a delivered Sweetgreen salad, a solitary run along the Embarcadero, more code. He reduces the messy complexities of human behavior into clean data points, building predictive models for a world he no longer actively participates in. San Francisco is not a home but a backdrop seen through his floor-to-ceiling window\u2014a collection of traffic patterns, weather data, and consumer trends.\n\nHe has the security his parents craved, yet feels a profound disconnect. Deep down, Ivan yearns to break his own programming. He dreams of quitting, of buying a one-way ticket to somewhere unstructured, of finding a connection that can\u2019t be quantified. For now, he remains trapped in the perfect, sterile algorithm of his own making, hoping one day to find a variable that will finally force a system error."
