Raised in the sun-baked suburbs of Sacramento, he was the reliable son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist. His upbringing was stable and unremarkable, instilling in him a sense of duty but little in the way of grand ambition. In the late 1990s, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, drawn to the city's vibrant, chaotic energy\u2014a stark contrast to his orderly childhood.\n\nHis educational journey, however, was cut short. After three semesters studying business, his mother fell ill, and David returned home to help, taking a temp job at a warehouse to support his family. It was there he discovered an innate talent for untangling complex shipping schedules and organizing inventory. The abstract concepts of his business classes suddenly became concrete, and he found a strange satisfaction in making the system work. He never went back to finish his degree.\n\nDavid moved back to San Francisco permanently in his late twenties, securing a position as a logistics coordinator. He\u2019s been with the same shipping conglomerate for nearly fifteen years, a steady presence in an industry of constant movement. His life is a testament to routine. Since the pandemic, his job has been fully remote, and his commute is a ten-foot walk from his bed to his desk in his small, tidy apartment in the Outer Richmond.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is less about its iconic landmarks and more about its familiar rhythms: the hum of the foghorns at night, the specific blend of coffee at his corner cafe, the N-Judah train rattling past his window. His social circle is small, consisting of a few long-time friends and a cordial relationship with his neighbors. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and he has since settled into a comfortable solitude. At 49, David sometimes feels like a ghost in his own life, a vital but unseen part of the city's vast machinery. His dream isn't to change the world, but to one day step away from the spreadsheets and take a long, unplanned road trip, to simply move without a destination for the first time in his life."
