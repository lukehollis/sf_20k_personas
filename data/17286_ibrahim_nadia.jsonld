Born to Lebanese immigrants who ran a bustling bakery in Dearborn, Michigan, her upbringing was steeped in the values of hard work, mutual aid, and the specific health challenges facing a community navigating a new country. She saw firsthand how language barriers and cultural differences impacted access to care, a formative experience that guided her toward a career in public health.\n\nAfter earning her Master of Public Health from the University of Michigan, Nadia began her career in Chicago. However, the turning point came in the late 1990s when she was recruited by a San Francisco non-profit at the forefront of the HIV/AIDS response. Drawn to the city's innovative and compassionate approach to the crisis, she moved across the country and dedicated herself to harm reduction and prevention programs. It was here she found her professional home, rising through the ranks over two decades to become a Program Director.\n\nToday, at 54, Nadia\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of San Francisco. She lives in a bright, modern-classic apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of high culture and stark social need mirrors the city she serves. Her daily routine is disciplined: a morning walk for coffee, followed by the 2.1-mile Muni ride to her SoMa office, where she manages budgets, mentors a young, diverse staff, and strategizes with city officials. An amicable divorce in her forties left her with a close circle of dedicated friends, many of whom are also service-minded professionals.\n\nNadia\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; she sees its street-level problems not as a nuisance, but as the complex public health puzzles she has spent her life trying to solve. Her aspiration is not retirement, but legacy. She dreams of building sustainable programs and mentoring the next generation of leaders who will continue the fight for health equity long after she\u2019s stepped down, ensuring the city that became her home is a healthier place for all."

In a support group, she listened to a young man describe caring for his dying partner, his voice cracking with love and exhaustion. It wasn't just a crisis; it was a community holding itself together with ferocity and grace. In that moment, Nadia knew this wasn't just a job. It was a covenant with the city she would come to call home.\n\n2.\nShe recalls being twelve, watching her father gently explain a prescription label to Mrs. El-Amin over the counter of their Dearborn bakery. The woman\u2019s relief was as palpable as the scent of warm bread. Nadia felt a hot spark of anger\u2014not at Mrs. El-Amin, but at a system that made health so confusing. That day, she understood that care wasn't just clinical; it was communication, trust, and community. It was the work she was born to do.\n\n3.\nIn 2005, a city official called their new needle exchange program \"enabling.\" Nadia remembers standing her ground in that sterile meeting room, her voice steady as she presented the data\u2014the lives saved, the transmissions prevented. When the funding was finally approved, it wasn't triumph she felt, but a profound, quiet validation. It cemented her belief that true public health requires not just compassion, but a righteous, evidence-based stubbornness. She learned to fight with facts, not just feelings.\n\n4.\nThe day her divorce was finalized in her mid-forties, there were no tears, just a shared cup of tea and a mutual, quiet sadness. That evening, her friends appeared at her Hayes Valley apartment with takeout and a bottle of wine, no questions asked. They just sat with her. In the comfortable silence, Nadia realized that family wasn't something you lost, but something you continually build. It fortified her understanding of support systems, both personal and professional, as an active, ongoing creation.\n\n5.\nJust last year, she watched her mentee, a brilliant young woman named Sofia, present a new outreach strategy to the board. Nadia had seen the spark of the idea in Sofia and helped her shape it, but the poise and passion on display were all her own. A powerful sense of peace washed over Nadia. It was the feeling of a baton being passed, not in retirement, but in active partnership. This, she realized, was the beginning of her legacy: ensuring the fight would be in capable hands."
