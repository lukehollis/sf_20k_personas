The daughter of a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a stoic, Irish-American union plumber, she grew up in Daly City, a landscape of fog-draped hills and blended cultures. In a home where love was shown through action rather than words, Kaia found her voice not in speech, but in sketchbooks. Drawing was her private language, a way to process the subtle complexities of her dual heritage and the unspoken emotions that filled their small house.\n\nThis affinity for non-verbal expression led her to study Psychology at San Francisco State University. While she excelled in her studies, she felt a disconnect between clinical theory and the messy reality of human trauma. The turning point came during an internship at a youth center, where she met a recently immigrated child who had witnessed severe violence and refused to speak. Frustrated, Kaia one day simply sat with him and began to draw. The boy picked up a crayon and, through stark, powerful images, told his entire story. In that moment, Kaia knew her path. She pursued a graduate certification and became an Art Therapist.\n\nNow a Lead Art Therapist, Kaia helps children navigate trauma that has stolen their words. Her work is emotionally taxing but deeply fulfilling. A divorce five years ago, after a long and gentle marriage to her college sweetheart, marked another key transition. Rather than a failure, she sees it as a necessary evolution, leaving her with a profound sense of self-reliance and peace.\n\nHer life is now rooted in the routines of her Inner Richmond neighborhood. Her morning commute is a 3.5-mile ride on the 5-Fulton Muni bus, book in hand. Her modest income affords her a cherished rent-controlled apartment filled with plants and art supplies. Weekends are for walks in Golden Gate Park, browsing the Clement Street Farmers Market, and quiet evenings with a small, devoted circle of friends. Kaia\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth or status; she aspires to open a small, independent community art space, offering free therapeutic art sessions for families. For Kaia, San Francisco isn't a city of tech booms, but a city of survivors, a place where, with the right tools, anyone can find a way to draw their own picture of hope."

Her mother, home from a 12-hour shift, quietly removes her worn nursing shoes. No one is talking, but the air is thick with unspoken exhaustion and care. Kaia sketches them both as sturdy, quiet giants. This was the moment she understood that drawing was not just a hobby; it was her native tongue, the only way to translate the dense, silent language of her family\u2019s love.\n\n2.\nThe institutional beige of the youth center felt hopeless. The boy, a small refugee, hadn\u2019t spoken a word in weeks. Theories from her SF State textbooks felt like useless dust. On instinct, Kaia slid a piece of paper and a single red crayon across the floor. He stared, then his small hand gripped the crayon and drew a chaotic, violent storm. It was a confession, a scream, a story. In that silent, shared moment, the entire framework of clinical psychology shattered and reformed into a single, profound truth: art was the bridge across unspeakable trauma.\n\n3.\nThe final box wasn't a box at all; it was the giant monstera plant they\u2019d bought together. Her husband, soon to be her ex, carefully handed it to her. \u201cIt always grew better for you,\u201d he said, with a smile that ached with kindness. There was no shouting, only a deep, mutual sadness for a love that had run its gentle course. That gesture crystallized the divorce not as a failure, but as a peaceful, honest evolution. It was the moment her self-reliance took root, strong and quiet, just like the plant.\n\n4.\nIt had been six months of greys and blacks. The little girl in her therapy session would only draw shadows, her family a collection of indistinct smudges. Kaia waited, holding the space. Then one Tuesday, the girl tentatively picked up a yellow marker. She drew a tiny, brilliant sun in the corner of the page, a small act of defiance against the darkness. Looking up, she gave Kaia the faintest smile. That sliver of yellow light was a universe of hope, reaffirming why Kaia endures the weight of her work.\n\n5.\nThe 5-Fulton bus groans up the hill, pulling her away from her book for a moment. Through the window, the morning fog spills over the trees of the Panhandle, softening the city's edges. She sees the other passengers, a cross-section of San Francisco\u2019s true heart\u2014nurses, cooks, students\u2014each lost in their own world, together in a quiet, shared solitude. A deep sense of belonging washes over her. This is her city, not of booms and busts, but of resilient people simply making their way home. It\u2019s a peace money could never buy."
