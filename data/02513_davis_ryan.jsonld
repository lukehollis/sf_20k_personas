For him, the city is a view from a floor-to-ceiling window, a backdrop to the endless cycle of video calls that define his life as a senior tech consultant.\n\nRaised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Ryan was the product of a pragmatic household. His father, an automotive engineer, and his mother, a university librarian, instilled in him a love for systems and order. This led him not to a conventional MBA, but to a Master's in Information Science, where he became fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and digital architecture. He understood not just how technology worked, but why people chose to use it.\n\nHis career began at a large, staid tech firm in Chicago. While stable, he felt he was merely a cog. The real turning point was a move into consulting, where his ability to diagnose systemic corporate problems made him a star. The promotion to the San Francisco office was the prize, but it came at the cost of a long-term relationship that couldn't survive the ambition and distance.\n\nNow, at 41, Ryan\u2019s life is a highly optimized routine. A 6 AM run through the Panhandle, coffee from a local roaster where the baristas know his order but not his story, and then a ten-hour day advising global tech giants from his meticulously organized desk. His social life consists of curated industry networking events and occasional dinners with colleagues. He observes the vibrant, chaotic life of Hayes Valley from a slight remove, an analyst studying a complex system he\u2019s not fully part of.\n\nWhile he has achieved the success he once craved, a quiet dissatisfaction has taken root. The PowerPoints and strategic roadmaps feel increasingly ephemeral. Ryan\u2019s secret dream is to step away from advising giants and use his capital and expertise to mentor a small, ethics-focused startup. He yearns to build something tangible and meaningful, to finally close the distance between his apartment window and the dynamic city just outside."
