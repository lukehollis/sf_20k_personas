Born on a military base in Hawaii to a Korean father and a second-generation American mother of Irish-Italian descent, Jina never felt she fit into any single demographic box. Her parents encouraged this, raising her to see identity as a mosaic of experiences rather than a label to be checked. This upbringing forged a deeply independent and observant nature, making her a citizen of the world before she ever owned a passport.\n\nHer formal education ended with high school. She had no interest in the structured confines of a university. Instead, her \"degree\" was earned through a decade of travel and apprenticeship. Following the untimely death of her mother from a stress-related illness, Jina committed herself to understanding the mind-body connection. She studied Reiki in Kyoto, traditional Thai massage in Chiang Mai, and aromatherapy in Provence. Each certification was a piece of a puzzle, a language of healing she was determined to master.\n\nThis global pursuit eventually led her to San Francisco, a city that felt like a spiritual home. She began as a massage therapist at a small, holistic spa called AURA Wellness. Her intuitive touch and quiet, calming presence quickly made her a client favorite. Recognizing her innate leadership and organizational skills, the owners promoted her, and for the last eight years, she has been the spa\u2019s manager.\n\nJina lives in a minimalist studio apartment directly above AURA, explaining her zero-mile commute. Her days are a seamless blend of personal ritual and professional duty. They begin with silent meditation and end with reviewing the next day\u2019s appointments, the scent of lavender and eucalyptus a constant in her life. Her social connections are woven into her work; clients have become confidantes, and her staff are like family. She isn't driven by ambition for wealth but by a desire for impact. Jina\u2019s dream is to establish a non-profit wing of the spa, offering subsidized treatments to caregivers and hospice workers\u2014a quiet tribute to the mother whose memory is the source of her life\u2019s calling."
