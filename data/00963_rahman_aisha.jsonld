Raised in Berkeley by an immigrant father, a quiet professor of comparative literature, and a first-generation American mother, a vibrant and expressive ceramicist, Aisha grew up as the bridge between their two worlds. Her childhood home was a fusion of calmly-read poetry and the messy, passionate work of the kiln, teaching her early how to navigate differing emotional languages. This role as a mediator was solidified during her teenage years when her younger brother began a harrowing struggle with a severe anxiety disorder. Aisha became his fierce advocate, fighting to find him culturally competent care within a system that often felt impersonal and opaque.\n\nThis experience was her turning point. Witnessing the profound impact of one empathetic social worker on her family\u2019s trajectory, Aisha found her calling. She pursued a degree in sociology at SF State, staying close to home, before earning her Master of Social Work. Now, at 29, she is an LMSW, but the city\u2019s demands have shaped her practice. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of necessity and modernity; she conducts her therapy sessions entirely via telehealth from a small, sunlit room in her Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHer days are a structured rhythm of intense empathy and crucial self-care. Mornings are for client sessions, helping adolescents and young adults navigate the pressures of modern life. Afternoons are her own. She recharges with long, quiet walks through Golden Gate Park, losing herself among the ferns and redwoods, or by grabbing a Vietnamese coffee on Clement Street. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends from her graduate program who understand the unique toll of their work.\n\nAisha\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of purpose. She sees the city not as a tech playground, but as a dense ecosystem of need. Her dream is to eventually open a small, sliding-scale private practice dedicated to serving bicultural and \"third-culture\" youth, creating the safe space she once so desperately sought for her own brother."
