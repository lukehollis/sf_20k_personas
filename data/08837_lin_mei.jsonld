A first-generation American, she was raised on the twin pillars of unwavering hard work and the quiet, immense pressure to succeed. While her parents hoped for a doctor or a lawyer, Mei was fascinated by systems and order. She found her calling not in medicine, but in the quiet logic of libraries, earning a Master of Library and Information Science from UC Berkeley.\n\nHer career started in the pre-boom era, organizing corporate archives for an established hardware company. But as the dot-com gold rush began, Mei saw the digital chaos of startups for what it was: a new kind of library in desperate need of a cataloger. She adeptly pivoted, earning a project management certification and translating her skills of categorization and process into the language of sprints and deliverables. She survived the bust by being indispensable\u2014the calm, organized center in a storm of brilliant but scattered engineers.\n\nA key turning point was an amicable divorce in her late thirties, which solidified her fierce independence and channeled her focus into her career and personal well-being. Today, Mei is a senior IT Project Manager for a major tech firm. Her 0.0-mile commute from her bedroom to her standing desk in her serene Inner Sunset condo is a deliberate choice, a boundary against the city's frantic energy. Her days are structured: green tea at sunrise overlooking the fog-draped Sutro Tower, deep work until noon, a restorative walk through Golden Gate Park, and evenings dedicated to pottery classes or hosting a small book club.\n\nShe remains deeply connected to her roots, visiting her now-retired parents every weekend. She has a complicated love for the city of her birth, appreciating its beauty while mourning the loss of the humbler, grittier San Francisco she grew up in. Her dream isn't a larger title, but a small cabin in Sonoma for quiet weekends. Her current personal project speaks volumes: meticulously digitizing her father\u2019s collection of antique calligraphy scrolls, using the skills of her new world to preserve the treasures of the old."
