The daughter of immigrants from Guangzhou, she grew up amidst the fragrant bustle of Clement Street, where her parents ran a small, beloved grocery store. They instilled in her the values of hard work and practicality, hoping their bright daughter would become a doctor or an engineer. Mei Lin, however, was always drawn more to people than to formulas.\n\nHer academic journey at UC Berkeley started on a pre-med track to appease her parents, but a single elective in urban planning changed her trajectory. It gave language to her innate understanding of community, inequity, and the invisible systems that shaped her neighborhood. This became her quiet rebellion and true passion. She pursued a Master\u2019s in Public Policy, a choice her parents initially struggled to understand but came to respect as they saw her dedication.\n\nThe pivotal moment in her career was during the first dot-com bust. While her peers chased fleeting stock options, Mei Lin took a low-paying job with a nonprofit providing legal aid to tenants facing eviction. She found her calling there, translating complex policies into tangible help for people like her own neighbors. For over two decades, she has dedicated herself to the city\u2019s nonprofit sector, eventually becoming a Program Manager for an organization focused on food security for seniors.\n\nNow at 50, Mei Lin\u2019s life is deeply rooted and intentionally local. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this; her rent-controlled apartment, where a rescue cat named Clementine reigns supreme, doubles as her office. Her daily routine involves Zoom calls with community partners, interspersed with walks through Golden Gate Park and grocery runs to the same family-owned shops from her childhood. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends from college and former colleagues, sharing dinners and debating city politics.\n\nHer dream is not one of wealth or recognition, but of endurance\u2014for her programs to create lasting stability for the city's vulnerable, and for San Francisco to retain its soul. She hopes to one day mentor young activists, ensuring the fight for a compassionate and equitable city continues long after she\u2019s gone."
