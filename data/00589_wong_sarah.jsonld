Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, she was the only child of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store. Her childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty, her afternoons spent stocking shelves and her evenings absorbing her parents\u2019 pragmatic worldview: work hard, be practical, and build something stable.\n\nThis pragmatism led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. She was fascinated by how people organized themselves into groups and systems, a passion that seemed destined for a career in non-profits or community organizing. However, the dot-com boom of the late 90s presented an irresistible, chaotic allure. She took a job as a project coordinator at a burgeoning startup, more out of curiosity than a defined career plan. Thrown into the fast-paced world of software development, she discovered her true talent: she was a natural at translating the needs of engineers to management and clearing obstacles for her team.\n\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, Sarah, then in her early 30s, faced a turning point. Instead of retreating, she doubled down. She saw value in the collaborative chaos and sought to bring order to it. She formally trained and became a Certified Scrum Master, finding a perfect synthesis of her sociology background and her on-the-ground tech experience.\n\nNow 52, Sarah lives in a meticulously kept condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute offers a quiet, structured life. Her days begin with a walk to a local bakery for coffee before her first virtual stand-up meeting. Divorced for over a decade, her social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014other women in tech\u2014and her weekly pottery class. She has watched her city transform, feeling both nostalgia for the past and appreciation for the opportunities it afforded her. Her aspirations are no longer about climbing a corporate ladder but about mentorship. She dreams of using her experience to guide young women entering the tech field, helping them navigate the complex systems she has spent a lifetime learning to master."
