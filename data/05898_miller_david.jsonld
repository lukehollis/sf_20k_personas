Raised by a stoic union electrician and a practical secretary, emotions in the Miller household were something to be managed, not explored. This emotional scarcity fueled a deep curiosity in David, a desire to understand the internal worlds his family kept so guarded.\n\nHe fled the East Coast\u2019s structured expectations for San Francisco in the late 1990s, initially drifting through service jobs and soaking in the city's vibrant, freewheeling culture. A period of personal uncertainty led him to therapy, an experience that proved transformative. It not only helped him unpack his own past but also illuminated a professional path. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work and dedicating himself to the craft of healing.\n\nFor two decades, David worked within the city's sprawling healthcare systems, providing counsel to people weathering crises. A key turning point came with the pandemic, which shifted his entire practice to telehealth. Now, his commute is a 0.0-mile walk from his kitchen to a meticulously organized home office in his small apartment.\n\nDivorced for over a decade, David\u2019s social life is intimate and curated. He maintains a close circle of friends, most of them fellow therapists or academics, for quiet dinners and long talks. His daily routine is structured around his remote sessions. Mornings begin with strong coffee and a walk through the foggy avenues of the Inner Sunset, often ending in Golden Gate Park. He finds solace in the city's muted, atmospheric side, a stark contrast to the boisterous tech culture downtown.\n\nAt 51, David's aspirations have shifted from career climbing to seeking deeper contentment. He dreams of mentoring new social workers, finding more time for his neglected photography hobby, and perhaps traveling, a freedom his remote work now allows. He is a man who spends his days helping others navigate chaos, and in turn, has carefully built a life of quiet, intentional peace for himself."
