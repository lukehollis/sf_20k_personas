Raised by a pragmatic high school science teacher and an accountant, Liam was encouraged to follow a stable, linear path. He was a quiet, observant child, more interested in the narratives within his history textbooks than the certainties of a calculator. This love for stories led him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts in History, much to his parents' gentle bewilderment.\n\nUpon graduating, Liam felt adrift. His degree felt more like a passion project than a career key, and he spent two years navigating the quintessential post-grad grind: pulling espresso shots in the Mission, stocking shelves at a bookstore in the Haight, and questioning his decision to stay. The turning point came unexpectedly through a volunteer gig as a docent at a small SoMa gallery. While guiding visitors, he discovered a powerful intersection of his skills: he could use historical context and narrative to make art accessible and exciting. He wasn't just describing a painting; he was telling its story.\n\nThis revelation became his north star. He devoured online courses in digital marketing and social media strategy, leveraging his storytelling ability to craft compelling copy. After a series of internships, he landed his current role as a Marketing Coordinator for a mid-sized nonprofit, the Embarcadero Theatre Collective. His 0.0-mile commute is to the bay window in his cozy Richmond District apartment, where he crafts email campaigns and social media content that bring audiences to the theatre.\n\nLiam\u2019s life is deeply woven into the city\u2019s cultural fabric. His days are a routine of foggy morning walks in Golden Gate Park, focused work, and evenings spent attending gallery openings or seeing plays\u2014often for work, but always for pleasure. His social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow creatives met through his various jobs. Though he cherishes his independence, he hopes to one day find a partner who shares his passion for the arts. His future aspiration is clear: to become a Marketing Director at a major San Francisco cultural institution, proving to himself, and perhaps his family, that a life built on stories can be as stable and impactful as any other."
