As the only son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, perpetually busy tailor shop on Clement Street, David grew up with the scent of sewing machine oil and the expectation of practicality. His parents, having traded uncertainty for stability, envisioned a respectable career for him\u2014an architect, perhaps, or an engineer.\n\nHe partially obliged, earning a graduate degree in Urban Planning from UC Berkeley. David was fascinated by how cities functioned, by the elegant systems that governed public life. But as he graduated in the late 1990s, a different kind of system was reshaping San Francisco: the internet. While his degree spoke of physical infrastructure, his friends were building digital empires. A key turning point came when a startup paid his friend more in stock options than David\u2019s projected yearly salary. Recognizing that the city\u2019s future was being written in code, not blueprints, he pivoted. He leveraged his understanding of systems and user needs to land a junior role in tech, beginning a steady, two-decade climb.\n\nHis career saw him through the dot-com bust, the rise of mobile, and the SaaS explosion. He became a Senior Product Manager, known for his calm pragmatism and ability to execute. This professional success, however, came at a personal cost. A marriage, strained by long hours and the relentless pace of the industry, ended amicably ten years ago. His proudest achievement is his daughter, Maya, now a sophomore at UCLA, with whom he shares a close, if long-distance, relationship.\n\nToday, David's 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to his home office in a quiet flat just blocks from his childhood home. His routine is disciplined: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by a day of Zoom calls and strategy documents. He\u2019s financially secure but feels a growing disconnect from the tangible world he once planned to build. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. Instead, he aspires to use his tech expertise and planning background to serve his community, perhaps by joining a local merchant association or mentoring young entrepreneurs from the neighborhood. David Lee wants to close the loop, to finally build something lasting in the city that made him."
