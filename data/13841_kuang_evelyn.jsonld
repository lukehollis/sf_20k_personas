She was raised in the Outer Sunset, a world of misty mornings and the muffled roar of the Pacific. Her parents, first-generation Taiwanese immigrants, ran a small dry-cleaning business, and the scent of starch and the constant hum of the press became the backdrop to her youth. Seeing their relentless toil instilled in her a formidable work ethic and a quiet determination to build a different kind of life, one defined by strategy rather than labor.\n\nThis drive propelled her to UCLA for her undergraduate degree in Economics and then to UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business for her MBA. Graduating with honors, she dove into the high-stakes world of management consulting. For years, her life was a blur of airports, boardrooms, and boilerplate PowerPoints. She was brilliant and successful, but the relentless pace left her feeling disconnected from the city she called home and the person she wanted to be.\n\nThe turning point came at 34. After a major project launch, she realized she hadn't had a meaningful conversation with her parents in months and her friendships were sustained by text messages. She abruptly quit her job, trading her platinum airline status for a Director of Corporate Strategy role at a mid-size tech firm based in SoMa. The position offered her the intellectual challenge she craved without the soul-crushing travel.\n\nNow, at 38, Evelyn lives in a sleek Hayes Valley condo, her 0.0-mile commute consisting of a walk from her bedroom to her home office. Her days are a disciplined mix of intense virtual meetings and deliberate breaks. She starts with a run through the Panhandle and ends her workday by exploring her neighborhood, enjoying a solo dinner at a new restaurant or picking up fresh flowers from a local shop. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few close friends from her MBA program who understand her ambition.\n\nEvelyn\u2019s connection to San Francisco is twofold: she holds the nostalgia of her Sunset childhood and embraces the dynamic energy of her new life. Her dream is no longer just about climbing the corporate ladder, but about achieving synthesis\u2014using her strategic mind to build a life of meaning, community, and balance, right in the city that shaped her."
