Born Renato to a young, overwhelmed mother in Los Angeles, he was adopted at eight months old by the Satos, a third-generation Japanese-American couple who raised him in the foggy, quiet avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. His upbringing was a warm fusion of cultures: Japanese holidays and language school on Saturdays, punctuated by the vibrant Latinx culture of the city he absorbed through friends and school. The loving stability of his home life stood in stark contrast to the unanswered questions about his origins, planting an early seed of empathy for those navigating complex family systems.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in psychology from SF State, Ren felt adrift. He took a sterile administrative job at a tech startup, but found the work hollow. The turning point came during a volunteer shift at a community clinic, where he witnessed a social worker skillfully de-escalate a crisis involving a frightened, non-English-speaking family. In that moment, he saw his path. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work with a focus on health and crisis intervention.\n\nNow 27, Ren\u2019s life is contained within the gleaming glass-and-steel confines of Mission Bay. He lives in a modern apartment building and works in the same building\u2019s ground-floor integrated health clinic, making his commute a simple elevator ride. His days are a relentless cycle of therapy sessions, case management, and advocating for patients facing everything from new diagnoses to housing insecurity. The emotional weight is immense, and he often unwinds by running along the waterfront, the Bay Bridge a stoic, silent companion.\n\nThough dedicated to his clients, Ren maintains a small circle of friends from grad school and sees his parents in the Sunset every Sunday for dinner. His dream is to eventually establish a non-profit providing counseling and resources for adoptees and foster youth. Privately, he carries a quiet hope of one day learning about his birth mother\u2014not to replace the family that raised him, but to finally connect the first and second halves of his own life story."
