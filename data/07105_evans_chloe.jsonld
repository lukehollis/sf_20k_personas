Growing up in a tranquil East Bay suburb, her world was reoriented at age twelve when her younger brother was diagnosed with a severe chronic illness. While her parents focused on the endless cycle of treatments and hospital stays, Chloe became a premature observer, learning to read the emotional undercurrents in a room and provide support without being asked. She was the steady anchor in her family\u2019s storm, a role that felt both natural and burdensome, and it planted the seed for her future career.\n\nHer path led from a B.A. in Psychology at UC Davis to a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley, where she specialized in healthcare settings. She felt a calling to help patients and families navigate the same bewildering medical systems that had defined her adolescence. After earning her license (LCSW), Chloe worked at a major San Francisco hospital, but the pandemic shifted her practice entirely online. This unexpected change was a turning point; she found she could provide more focused care without the bureaucratic drain of the hospital environment.\n\nNow, Chloe lives and works from her quiet one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within a few hundred square feet, a reality she manages with strict routines. Mornings are for herself: tea, meditation, and a walk to a local bakery before she opens her laptop. Her days are a series of telehealth sessions, where she provides emotional scaffolding for individuals grappling with illness, grief, and trauma.\n\nHer primary source of decompression is Golden Gate Park, just blocks away. The park is her pressure valve, where long runs along its trails shake off the residue of her work. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few friends\u2014mostly other healthcare workers who understand the need for dark humor and unwavering support. While she hopes for a romantic partnership one day, her demanding career and remote work make meeting new people a challenge. Chloe\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s one of sustainable balance. She aspires to eventually open a small group practice focused on medical trauma, while creating more space in her own life for art, travel, and the simple joy of being untethered from the needs of others."
