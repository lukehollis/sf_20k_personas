Born and raised in suburban Cleveland, the son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, David\u2019s upbringing was one of practicality and quiet intellectual curiosity. He inherited his father\u2019s passion for the past, earning a Bachelor's degree in History from Ohio State University with dreams of a life in academia.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis unceremoniously rerouted his future. With academic jobs scarce, David took a temporary position at a distribution warehouse to make ends meet. There, amidst the seeming chaos of pallets and forklifts, he discovered an unexpected talent: seeing patterns. He found a strange satisfaction in optimizing warehouse layouts and streamlining receiving processes. This temporary gig turned into a career. He leveraged his knack for systems into a full-time logistics role, finding that managing a supply chain was like solving a complex, high-stakes historical puzzle in real-time.\n\nA job offer from a major shipping company brought him to San Francisco twelve years ago. He moved with his then-girlfriend, embracing the city\u2019s energy, a stark contrast to his Ohio roots. While the relationship eventually dissolved, David\u2019s connection to the city solidified. He found his niche not in the flashy tech scene, but in the city's vital, unseen circulatory system of goods.\n\nNow 43, David\u2019s life is a study in routine. His 0.0-mile commute gives him time for a morning run through Golden Gate Park before his screen lights up with global challenges. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends, mostly met through a now-lapsed rock climbing gym membership. His social life consists of quiet dinners and weekend hikes in Marin. He feels a deep, settled affection for the fog-laced streets of his neighborhood, a peaceful anchor in a career defined by constant movement. His dream isn't a promotion, but a long sabbatical\u2014a year to travel the Mediterranean, finally walking through the ancient port cities he once only studied in books."
