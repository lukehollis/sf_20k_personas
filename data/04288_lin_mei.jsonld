The only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store, she learned the city's rhythms through the concerns of her neighbors over the price of produce and the chatter of the N-Judah streetcar rattling past their storefront. Her parents, pragmatic and hardworking, hoped she would pursue medicine or engineering, a stable path far from the uncertainties of retail.\n\nHowever, Mei was always fascinated by the invisible structures that shaped their lives. A contentious zoning debate during her high school years, which threatened to displace several local businesses including her parents\u2019, became her catalyst. She saw firsthand how policy translated into real-world anxiety and opportunity. This ignited a passion that led her to pursue a Master of Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, disappointing her parents initially but ultimately setting her on a path she knew was hers.\n\nNow, at 31, Mei is a Policy Analyst for the City Planning Department. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her philosophy; she lives and works in the dense urban core she is dedicated to improving. On days she goes into the office, City Hall is a five-minute walk past the opera house. Other days, her small but bright apartment, filled with maps and policy briefs, is her office.\n\nHer key turning point was helping draft the early framework for a new affordable housing initiative in the Mission District. Seeing the project move from an abstract concept to a tangible plan solidified her purpose. Her social life is woven into the city\u2019s fabric; her long-term partner, David, is a landscape architect, and their dates often involve critiquing new public spaces or biking along the Embarcadero.\n\nMei\u2019s ambition isn't a corner office but a better-designed city. She dreams of mitigating the displacement that once threatened her own family and creating genuinely livable, equitable neighborhoods. Her days are a cycle of data analysis, community meetings, and quiet evening walks, always observing, always thinking about the lines on the map and the lives they represent. She is, in every sense, building her home."

Her mother was humming along to a Taiwanese radio station when the N-Judah rumbled past, its familiar metallic screech a punctuation mark in her day. A neighbor stopped in, not just to buy milk, but to talk. Mei didn't understand policy then, only the deep, comforting rhythm of this small corner of the world. It\u2019s the feeling of that specific, irreplaceable community she chases now in every policy document she writes.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the heat of the fluorescent lights in the high school auditorium. She was sixteen, sitting beside her father, whose hands were clenched tight on his knees. As a city official spoke about \u201ceconomic revitalization,\u201d Mei saw only the raw fear in her neighbors' eyes. The abstract lines on a map suddenly represented her family\u2019s entire life. In that moment, a quiet fear ignited into a cold, clear focus. She wouldn't just watch the city change; she would learn its language and fight back.\n\n3.\nThe phone call to her parents felt heavier than her UC Berkeley acceptance letter. She was twenty-two. \"Urban Planning,\" she said, the words tasting of both betrayal and freedom. The silence on the other end was a familiar fog of their disappointment. But as she looked out her window, she felt a profound sense of rightness. This wasn't their dream for her, but for the first time, she was building her own foundation, even if they couldn't see the blueprints yet. It was the first decision she made entirely for herself.\n\n4.\nIt wasn't a groundbreaking, just a late night in the office. Mei, then twenty-nine, unrolled the final architectural draft of the Mission affordable housing plan. The lines and numbers she'd agonized over for months suddenly coalesced into homes, courtyards, and storefronts. For the first time, her work felt not like theory, but like brick and mortar. She touched the paper, tracing the outline of a future playground, and felt the immense, quiet weight of creating a place where a family like hers could stay.\n\n5.\nShe remembers stopping her bike on the Embarcadero, the bay breeze cool on her face. David was excitedly pointing out how the new waterfront planters were designed to manage stormwater runoff. He wasn't just her partner; he saw the city with the same eyes. They didn't need fancy dinners, just this\u2014a shared language of curb cuts and public access. In his excitement over something so practical, so essential, she felt deeply seen and profoundly at home, not just in San Francisco, but with him."
