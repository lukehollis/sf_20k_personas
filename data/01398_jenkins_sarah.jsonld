Raised in a quiet Central Valley town by parents who were avid collectors of historical ephemera, she learned to read not from books, but from forgotten postcards, handwritten letters, and diary entries found at flea markets. Her home was a chaotic archive of personal histories, and she became its first, unofficial curator.\n\nForegoing a traditional university education, Sarah moved to San Francisco at 19, feeling an irresistible pull toward a city rich with layered pasts. She supported herself with a string of jobs\u2014barista, bookstore clerk, archival assistant\u2014while every spare moment and dollar went toward expanding her own collection. She was obsessed with the stories objects told: a tarnished silver locket, a ticket stub from a 1950s rock show, a single baby shoe found under the floorboards of a Victorian home.\n\nThe turning point came at 32, when a modest inheritance from her grandmother provided just enough capital to take a risk. Sarah leased a ground-floor, live-work loft in SoMa and opened \"The Museum of Found Objects,\" a small, intimate space dedicated to preserving the narratives of everyday people through their discarded belongings. Her 0.0-mile commute is a simple walk down a spiral staircase from her apartment into the gallery below.\n\nNow 41, Sarah\u2019s life is her work. Her days are spent meticulously cataloging acquisitions, writing descriptive placards that tell compelling stories, and hosting small groups of visitors who seek a different kind of history. Her social circle is tight-knit, composed of artists, writers, and fellow preservationists who understand her quiet dedication. While she sometimes yearns for a deeper personal partnership, she finds profound connection in the echoes of the lives she safeguards.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream isn't expansion, but permanence\u2014to secure her museum\u2019s future as a permanent fixture in a city that is constantly erasing its own past. She is a guardian of sentimental artifacts, the quiet keeper of San Francisco's forgotten whispers, ensuring that even the smallest lives are not lost to time."
