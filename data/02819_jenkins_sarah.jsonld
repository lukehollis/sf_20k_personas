Raised in a quiet Sacramento suburb by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, Sarah was an imaginative child who found solace in museums. This passion led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History, dreaming of a life curating exhibits and surrounded by beauty.\n\nUpon graduation, the reality of the Bay Area\u2019s cost of living hit hard. A low-paying gallery assistant job barely covered her rent in a shared Oakland apartment. Pragmatism, a trait she inherited from her mother, won out. She took a temporary entry-level position at a large insurance firm, promising herself it was just to build savings. Twenty years later, she\u2019s a senior claims adjuster, an expert at dissecting the financial aftermath of disasters from the quiet of her apartment.\n\nThe key turning point was the company-wide shift to remote work during the pandemic. For Sarah, it was a revelation. The draining commute and forced office pleasantries vanished, replaced by a structured, self-contained world she could control. Her 0.0-mile commute from bedroom to desk suits the methodical, solitary nature her job has fostered. Dealing with other people\u2019s worst days has honed her analytical mind but also built a protective wall around her emotions.\n\nNow 43, Sarah lives a deliberately small life in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are ruled by the rhythm of incoming claims and the distant sound of the N Judah line. Her social circle is limited to a biannual dinner with two college friends and brief chats with her neighbor over the recycling bins. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, and she hasn't felt the urge to dive back into the dating scene.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. She loves the fog rolling down Arguello Boulevard and finds peace in long, winding walks through Golden Gate Park. Her dream isn\u2019t a promotion, but a quiet rebellion against her own pragmatism. On her desk, next to her monitor, sits a brochure for volunteer docent training at the de Young Museum\u2014a tangible reminder of the art history student she once was, and a future she quietly hopes to reclaim."
