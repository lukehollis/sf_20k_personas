            "value": "Ethan Johnson considers himself a blank slate, a man deliberately unwritten. His official documents are a study in null values, a philosophical choice rooted in a radical upbringing. Born to two nomadic sociologists, Ethan\u2019s childhood was a global experiment in identity formation. He spent his formative years shuttling between an intentional community in Mendocino County, a research outpost in coastal Japan, and an artists\u2019 collective in Berlin. His parents, fiercely idealistic, raised him without the constructs of race, nationality, or formal religion, hoping to create a truly post-modern human.\n\nThis upbringing meant his education was equally unconventional. There were no school districts or diplomas; instead, he was an autodidact, building his own curriculum from a universe of online resources, pirated university syllabi, and the dense libraries of his parents\u2019 academic peers. He never attended a university, finding the institutional structure stifling. By 20, he had an education more eclectic and arguably more profound than any Ivy League graduate, but with no paper to prove it.\n\nHis career grew organically from this foundation. Drawn to the abstract systems of the corporate world, he began offering his services as an independent management consultant. He doesn't work for a firm or specialize in a specific industry; he consults on \"nothing,\" or more accurately, on the foundational principles of a business. Startups hire him to deconstruct their core assumptions, to see their problems from an outsider\u2019s perspective, free of ingrained industry dogma.\n\nNow 24, Ethan lives a life of curated minimalism in a sterile, high-rise apartment in Mission Bay. With a 0.0-mile commute, his days are a disciplined cycle of client video calls, deep reading, and long, solitary walks along the Embarcadero. He finds a strange kinship with San Francisco, a city that perpetually reinvents itself and attracts others living outside conventional norms. His few friends are fellow tech-philosophers and artists he meets at obscure lectures. While he projects an aura of intellectual self-sufficiency, he privately grapples with a profound sense of rootlessness. His greatest aspiration is to build a framework\u2014a company or a philosophy\u2014that helps others find clarity, hoping that in designing a home for their ideas, he might finally build one for himself."
