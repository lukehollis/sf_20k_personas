The son of a second-generation Japanese-American hardware store owner and a mother of mixed European heritage who taught ESL, David never felt he fit a simple category. To the census taker, he was \"other\"; to himself, he was simply a San Franciscan. His upbringing was a quiet blend of cultures, defined more by the city's rhythms than any single tradition.\n\nHis true education didn't happen in a formal institution but in the city's streets. The defining crucible of his youth was the HIV/AIDS crisis. As a teenager, he witnessed fear and bigotry curdle his vibrant city, but he also saw profound community resilience. He wasn't a loud activist but the quiet volunteer who delivered meals, listened to stories in hospice wards, and saw firsthand how organized, compassionate systems could mean the difference between dignity and despair. This experience became his calling.\n\nDriven by this mission, David pursued his public health degrees at night from state universities while working entry-level jobs at community clinics. He learned grant writing, program management, and epidemiology not as abstract concepts, but as tools to help the people he saw every day. His career was a steady, methodical climb through the city's non-profit and public health sectors, earning respect through competence and unwavering dedication rather than a prestigious pedigree.\n\nNow 49, David directs public health programs from his tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute gives his life a focused, neighborhood-centric rhythm. The day begins with coffee from a local cafe and ends with long walks, where he observes the city's ongoing struggles with addiction and homelessness not as professional problems, but as deeply personal challenges. He is long-divorced, a quiet casualty of a career that demanded everything, but maintains a close circle of old friends who share his history. His aspiration isn\u2019t for a higher title, but for a future where the city he loves provides the same compassionate safety net for its most vulnerable that he witnessed being built decades ago."
