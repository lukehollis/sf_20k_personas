Raised in the quiet predictability of a Central Valley suburb, Robert was the artistic son of a mechanic and a school secretary. He escaped to San Francisco at 19, enrolling in the film program at SF State, convinced he would one day capture the city\u2019s soul on celluloid. He lived in a cramped Sunset apartment with three roommates, fueled by cheap burritos and cinematic theory.\n\nThe turning point came during his third year. His father suffered a debilitating stroke, and the family\u2019s modest savings evaporated under a mountain of medical bills. Robert dropped out of college and returned home, taking on odd jobs to help support his parents. The creative fire was banked, replaced by the cold reality of necessity. When he returned to San Francisco two years later, it wasn't to chase dreams but to find stability. He landed an entry-level clerical job with the Department of Building Inspection, a world away from his former aspirations.\n\nNow 37, Robert is a Building Inspector Assistant. He traded celluloid dreams for the solid certainty of building codes. His 0.0-mile commute is the defining feature of his life; he is the resident manager of a pre-war, rent-controlled apartment building in the Inner Richmond, a position that provides a significant rent subsidy. His days are a meticulous routine of reviewing permit applications from his small apartment office, walking the building to check on the boiler, and logging tenant maintenance requests. He knows the building\u2019s groans and sighs better than any person.\n\nRobert\u2019s social life is quiet, consisting of polite but distant relationships with the tenants and a weekly beer with a fellow inspector. He is an observer, cataloging the lives unfolding in the apartments he helps maintain. Hidden on his laptop is his one remaining link to his past: a half-finished screenplay. His ambition isn't fame anymore, but simply to type \"FADE OUT\" on the final page. He hopes one day to see the city not just as a series of code violations and structural concerns, but as the grand, complicated story he once came here to tell."
