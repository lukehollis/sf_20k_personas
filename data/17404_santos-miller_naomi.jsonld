Raised near the Klamath River in Northern California, her identity was forged by her mother\u2019s Yurok heritage\u2014the traditions, the reverence for the salmon, and the deep connection to the land. Her father, a white high school teacher named Miller, instilled in her a pragmatic drive and a belief in education as a tool for change. This dual upbringing created a quiet but powerful resolve within her: to honor her roots while succeeding in a world that often overlooked them.\n\nShe attended UC Berkeley, initially drawn to Ethnic Studies to academically understand the cultural history that pulsed through her veins. However, she grew restless, feeling a desire to build bridges rather than just study them. This led her to pursue an MBA at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, a calculated move to gain the language and skills of corporate power. Her career in tech began steadily, but she found her true footing when she joined a B Corp focused on sustainable technology. As Director of Product Management, she now shepherds products that align with her values, a role she finds both challenging and deeply fulfilling.\n\nA key turning point was marrying her husband, David Santos, an architect who shared her passion for creating meaningful change. They chose to hyphenate their names, a symbol of their equal partnership. They live in a bright, airy apartment in NoPa, where Naomi\u2019s daily routine begins with a strong coffee and a view of the morning fog. Her 3.8-mile commute on the N-Judah is a cherished ritual, a time for podcasts and mental preparation for the strategic demands of her day. She finds solace in Golden Gate Park, its curated nature a tamed echo of the wild forests of her youth.\n\nNaomi\u2019s success has provided comfort, but not contentment. Her ultimate dream is to leverage her experience and capital to create a venture fund dedicated to supporting Indigenous-owned businesses, particularly those focused on environmental stewardship and cultural preservation. She envisions a future where she is not just a director in San Francisco, but a direct force for empowering the community that shaped her."

            "value": "1.\nShe was seven, standing ankle-deep in the cold Klamath, her mother\u2019s hand firm on her shoulder. The salmon, iridescent and powerful, thrashed upstream. \"We don't just take,\" her mother said, her voice a low hum against the river's rush. \"We are part of its life, and it is part of ours.\" It wasn't a lesson, but an imprinting of sacred reciprocity. This memory became her internal compass, a deep-seated understanding that any success she had must give back, nurturing the source from which it came.\n\n2.\nIn a fluorescent-lit Berkeley seminar room, listening to a brilliant lecture on post-colonial theory, Naomi felt a profound sense of restlessness. The words were validating but inert, describing the world\u2019s problems from a safe, academic distance. A quiet, fierce impatience rose in her. She didn't just want to analyze the system of power; she wanted to wield its tools. This moment of frustration was a turning point, propelling her from the world of ethnic studies toward the unapologetic pragmatism of an MBA, determined to build rather than just deconstruct.\n\n3.\nIt was late, and they were talking about their future in their tiny first apartment. When Naomi hesitantly mentioned the complexities of her name, David simply looked at her and said, \"Then let's both be Santos-Miller. We're a new thing.\" The immense relief and love she felt in that moment was staggering. It wasn't just a solution; it was a testament to a partnership so equal it would create space for all of her identities. It cemented her belief that she didn't have to choose between her worlds.\n\n4.\nShe remembers the day the first impact report came through for a water-saving technology she had championed at her B Corp. Scrolling through the metrics\u2014the millions of gallons conserved, the direct benefit to a specific watershed\u2014was more validating than any promotion. It was the first tangible proof that her unconventional path worked. She had successfully translated her corporate skills into a result her Yurok family would understand and her father would respect. It was a moment of quiet, powerful synthesis, silencing any lingering doubts about her career choice.\n\n5.\nOn a solo walk through Golden Gate Park\u2019s Japanese Tea Garden, she admired the meticulously sculpted trees. They were beautiful but tamed, a curated echo of the wild forests of her youth. A sharp, undeniable longing for the untamed Klamath struck her. This park was a comfort, but her home was a source of life. In that instant, her ambition crystallized from a vague dream into a concrete plan. She wouldn\u2019t just work within a system of good; she would create a new one to fund the wild, enduring strength of her own people."
