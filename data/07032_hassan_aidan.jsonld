            "value": "Aidan Hassan is a product of San Francisco\u2019s cultural confluence, born to a pragmatic Lebanese immigrant father and an Irish-American mother with a love for city history. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset, his childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s workshop\u2014filled with the scent of sawdust and machine oil\u2014and his mother's weekend historical walks through neighborhoods like North Beach and the Presidio. He inherited his father's skillful hands and his mother's observant, thoughtful nature, making him a quiet kid who preferred disassembling old radios to playing sports.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State University, drawn to urban studies, hoping to understand the complex systems that made his city tick. However, his academic path was cut short after three semesters when his father, a self-employed contractor, suffered a debilitating back injury. With family finances strained, Aidan dropped out to find steady work. He leaned on the practical skills his father had taught him, moving from odd jobs to a full-time position as a Building Maintenance Technician.\n\nThis career shift proved to be a pivotal turning point. Now 26, Aidan\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a defining feature of his life; he is the live-in maintenance technician for a sprawling, pre-war apartment building in the Inner Richmond. His world is contained within these walls. He knows the rhythmic hiss of old radiators, the specific groan of the elevator, and the life stories of tenants told through leaky faucets and clogged drains. His daily routine is a solitary patrol through the building\u2019s veins\u2014the basement, boiler room, and rooftops. His social circle is small, consisting of his parents, whom he visits for Sunday dinner, and a few tenants who\u2019ve become friendly acquaintances.\n\nAidan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and subterranean. He doesn\u2019t see the gleaming skyline but the aging infrastructure that holds it up. He dreams of eventually saving enough to start his own small business, one focused on retrofitting old buildings with sustainable technology. It\u2019s a quiet ambition, a way to merge his father's practical legacy with his own unrealized passion for shaping the city he calls home, one pipe and wire at a time."
