His world is one of carefully preserved paper, the scent of old ink, and the muted sounds of the city filtering through the single-pane window of his apartment, situated directly above the small gallery that employs him.\n\nRaised in Portland, Oregon, Ethan was the quiet son of a pragmatic engineer and a librarian mother who fostered his love for stories held within objects. He felt perpetually caught between his father\u2019s logic and his mother\u2019s romanticism. Seeking a world that valued both precision and narrative, he pursued an education on the East Coast, culminating in a Master's in Art History with a niche focus: 20th Century California Ephemera. He imagined a career as a university archivist or museum curator.\n\nHowever, Ethan graduated directly into a recession that had decimated arts funding. His ambitious applications went unanswered. Defeated but not broken, he moved to San Francisco\u2014the very heart of his academic obsession\u2014and took the only job he could find: a hybrid Gallery Assistant/Archivist position at a tiny, legacy gallery. The owner, an aging Beat poet sympathizer, couldn't pay much, but offered the small apartment upstairs as part of the compensation.\n\nTen years later, Ethan remains. His daily routine is a quiet ritual: waking early, cataloging new acquisitions in the silent morning hours, and spending afternoons assisting the few collectors who wander in. His social life is insular, consisting of the gruff gallery owner, a couple of local artists, and the barista at the Caffe Trieste. His relationships have been fleeting, often burning out against the reality of his financial and physical confinement.\n\nEthan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intensely academic. He loves the city\u2019s history more than its present-day reality. His dream isn't to leave, but to transcend his position. He spends his nights poring over forgotten artists\u2019 letters and flyers, hoping to uncover a lost story worthy of a major exhibition\u2014a discovery that would finally validate his quiet, consuming passion and make his name mean something in the city he so painstakingly documents."
