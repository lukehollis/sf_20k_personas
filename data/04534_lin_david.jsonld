The son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store, David grew up stocking shelves and translating for his parents. They championed a pragmatic path for him\u2014business, perhaps, or engineering\u2014a stable career far removed from the unpredictability they had known. However, coming of age in the 1990s, David witnessed the lingering shadow of the AIDS crisis, seeing the profound, unaddressed grief in his community. This silent suffering, ignored by many, sparked a quiet defiance in him.\n\nInstead of pursuing a business degree, he enrolled at San Francisco State University, eventually earning a Master of Social Work. His early career was a trial by fire in a community clinic in the Tenderloin, working with individuals grappling with addiction, homelessness, and chronic illness. There, he honed his ability to listen not just to words, but to the deep currents of trauma beneath them. This work taught him the necessity of boundaries for survival, a lesson that would later define his professional life.\n\nThe key turning point came a decade ago when, after a period of burnout working within the rigid hospital system, he decided to open his own private practice. He converted the garden-level in-law unit of his Inner Richmond home\u2014the very house he grew up in\u2014into a serene office space. Now, his commute is a walk down the stairs. His days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, providing therapy to healthcare professionals and adults navigating grief.\n\nAt 49, David\u2019s life is one of structured empathy. He lives with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Marcus, and their rescue terrier, Buster. Mornings are for walks in Golden Gate Park, evenings for cooking and quiet conversation. He\u2019s no longer trying to save the world, but to offer a steady anchor for those caught in its storms. His aspiration is no longer grand but deeply personal: to maintain his own peace, to mentor one or two new therapists a year, and to continue being a quiet, reliable presence in the city that shaped him."

Mr. Henderson, a kind man from two blocks over, came in looking thin as a scarecrow, his usual boisterous laugh gone. David\u2019s father wordlessly added a bag of oranges to the man's meager purchase, never meeting his eyes. In that heavy, unspoken gesture of compassion, David felt the vast weight of suffering the city tried to ignore. It was the first time he knew he wanted to face it, not look away.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the chill of a concrete bench at SF State after a phone call with his mother. The words \u201cA social worker? David, be realistic,\u201d echoed in the fog. He clutched his textbook, the guilt warring with a fierce, quiet resolve. Looking at the stream of students, he realized he wasn't rejecting his parents' desire for stability, but redefining it. For him, stability meant building a life around a purpose he chose, not one he was given. That decision felt both lonely and liberating.\n\n3.\nThe breaking point in the Tenderloin clinic came after a 14-hour day. A young client he\u2019d worked with for months had relapsed, and David felt the failure in his own bones. His supervisor, a woman with impossibly tired eyes, found him staring at the wall. She didn't offer platitudes. She just said, \u201cYou are the shore, David. Not the lifeboat. You can\u2019t carry them, you can only give them a place to land.\u201d That brutal lesson in boundaries saved his career, teaching him how to care without drowning.\n\n4.\nTwelve years ago, Marcus stood in the damp, musty in-law unit of David's childhood home. \u201cThis is it,\u201d Marcus said, sketching on a notepad. \u201cA separate entrance, a garden view. It could be a sanctuary.\u201d Looking at his partner's confident vision, David felt the fog of his burnout begin to lift for the first time. The idea of healing people in the very space that raised him\u2014of reclaiming it on his own terms\u2014felt like the deepest kind of homecoming. That conversation was the blueprint for his second act.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, walking Buster near the Dutch Windmill. Marcus was explaining the structural integrity of the blades when their terrier flopped onto his back in the grass, demanding a belly rub. In the quiet morning light, watching the simple, happy scene, David felt a profound sense of peace. There was no crisis to manage, no trauma to dissect. It was just a small, perfect moment of joy he had carefully cultivated, the quiet reward for a life of structured empathy."
