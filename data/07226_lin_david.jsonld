Born and raised in the apartment directly above the store, his life has been shaped by the scent of sawdust and the familiar clang of the bell on the shop door. His parents, immigrants from Taiwan, established the store as their foothold in a new country, a legacy built with sweat and pragmatism.\n\nGrowing up, David saw a different future for himself. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, majoring in Communications, dreaming of a life in marketing or media, far from the aisles of plumbing fixtures and paint cans. But in his sophomore year, his father suffered a major heart attack. With his mother\u2019s English still limited, David made the decision to drop out and manage the store. What was meant to be a temporary measure slowly, imperceptibly, became his permanent reality.\n\nNow 39, David is the heart of the family business. His father has passed, and he is the primary caregiver for his aging mother, who still lives with him upstairs. His \"0.0 mile commute\" is a testament to this life of duty\u2014a walk down a flight of stairs each morning. He knows his regulars by name, from Mrs. Chen who needs help with her garden to the new tech couple struggling to hang a TV. He is a neighborhood institution, a friendly face who can always find the right screw or offer sound advice.\n\nWhile respected and well-liked, David\u2019s personal life has been a quiet casualty of his responsibilities. Dating is difficult when your life is tethered to a single city block. His social circle consists of customers and other local merchants. His enduring hope is not for wealth, but for survival\u2014to keep Lin's Hardware afloat against the tide of big-box stores and Amazon Prime. He dreams of one day finding a partner who understands his rooted life, and perhaps taking a real vacation, one where he can\u2019t hear the shop bell from his bedroom window. His story is one of quiet sacrifice, his connection to San Francisco woven into the very fabric of his small, essential corner of the city."
