            "value": "Arjun Miller is a product of two worlds. Born in Cupertino to an Indian mother who was a software engineer and a white American father who taught high school history, he grew up surrounded by the hum of burgeoning Silicon Valley. Yet, his father's influence instilled in him a deep appreciation for the human stories behind progress. This duality defined his path. He eschewed a pure computer science track, instead earning a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from UC Berkeley, fascinated by the intersection of psychology, design, and technology.\n\nHis early career during the post-dot-com boom was a whirlwind of long hours at a promising but volatile startup. The 2008 financial crisis was his turning point. Witnessing mass layoffs and the emotional toll of a success-at-all-costs culture, Arjun felt a profound sense of disillusionment. He decided to forge his own path, one that prioritized impact and balance over relentless growth. He pivoted to consulting, building a reputation for not just solving technical problems, but for understanding the human needs that drive them.\n\nNow a Principal Consultant, Arjun operates entirely from his spacious NOPA apartment, a decision he made long before it was commonplace. His 0.0-mile commute is a quiet rebellion against the burnout culture he once endured. His days begin not with a frantic BART ride, but with a walk to a cafe on Divisadero for an oat latte, followed by a stroll through the Panhandle with Buster, his scruffy rescue terrier. He lives with his partner, Chloe, a landscape architect whose work with native plants and public spaces provides a grounding, tangible counterpoint to his digital world.\n\nArjun\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and deliberate. He chose the city for its walkability, its cultural vibrancy, and its proximity to the wildness of the coast. He\u2019s not chasing a unicorn startup\u2019s IPO; his ambition is more nuanced. He dreams of using his influence to steer tech companies toward more ethical, human-centric design. At home, he and Chloe talk about starting a family, envisioning a future where they can raise a child with the same blend of technological optimism and humane wisdom that shaped Arjun\u2019s own remarkable life."
