A third-generation Japanese American, his grandparents\u2019 experience in the internment camps during WWII was a quiet but constant undercurrent in his family\u2019s San Jose home. His engineer father valued stability and logic, while his mother, a public school teacher, championed empathy. David inherited both traits, initially following his father\u2019s path by earning a business degree and taking a project management job in Silicon Valley during the first dot-com boom.\n\nHe was successful but unfulfilled, a feeling that crystallized as he witnessed the boom\u2019s fallout: the evictions, the widening chasm between the city\u2019s affluent newcomers and its long-term residents. This cognitive dissonance became his turning point. At 29, he quit his corporate job and enrolled in graduate school, earning a Master\u2019s in Public Administration. His thesis: innovative models for tackling urban homelessness.\n\nNow 46, David has dedicated his career to that very issue. He is the Program Manager for a non-profit in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin, overseeing transitional housing and support services. His 0.0-mile commute is no accident; he lives in a modest apartment just two blocks from his main office, intentionally embedding himself within the community he serves. His life and work are inextricably linked.\n\nMornings begin with coffee from a family-owned corner store before diving into grant writing and staff coordination from his home office. Afternoons are spent on his feet\u2014visiting shelters, meeting with city officials, or simply talking with clients on the street, his calm demeanor a source of stability for many.\n\nThough single, David is far from lonely. His chosen family consists of fellow advocates, social workers, and the resilient residents of his neighborhood. His dream is not one of personal wealth but of systemic impact: to launch a self-sustaining program that provides not just shelter, but holistic pathways to employment and wellness. He sees the soul of San Francisco not in its gleaming towers, but in the grit and compassion of its streets, and he works tirelessly to ensure that compassion translates into tangible change."
