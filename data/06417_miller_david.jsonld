Raised in a neat suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school principal father and a librarian mother, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and steeped in Midwestern pragmatism. They were proud when he went to Ohio State but perplexed when he chose to major in History. \"What's the career path for that, son?\" his father would ask, a question David didn't have a clear answer for.\n\nUpon graduating, he felt a magnetic pull westward, away from the life that seemed pre-written for him. He landed in San Francisco in his early twenties with two suitcases and a vague notion of finding \u201csomething more.\u201d The first few years were a blur of shared apartments in the Inner Richmond, barista jobs, and the humbling realization that a history degree didn\u2019t pay Bay Area rent. This period was his true education. He saw the city\u2019s economic tides ebb and flow and, ever the historian, grew fascinated by the patterns behind the financial headlines.\n\nThe turning point came at 26. Tired of financial instability, he methodically taught himself the language of markets, devouring books on economics and investment theory. He found that analyzing a company\u2019s balance sheet wasn\u2019t so different from deconstructing a historical event; both required spotting trends, understanding context, and predicting outcomes. He earned his CFA charter and landed an entry-level analyst role, beginning a steady climb up the corporate ladder.\n\nNow, at 38, David lives a life of disciplined comfort in a modern Hayes Valley apartment that doubles as his office. His 0.0-mile commute affords him a routine he cherishes: a morning jog through the Panhandle, coffee from his favorite local cafe, and hours of focused analysis at his standing desk. The pandemic solidified his remote work status, and while he sometimes misses office camaraderie, he values the autonomy. His social life is small but meaningful, centered on a weekly trivia night with a few close friends and occasional dates that remind him of his desire for a lasting partnership.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal; he knows the cashiers at his grocery store and the best benches in Patricia\u2019s Green. While financially secure, the historian in him still longs for a grander narrative. David\u2019s quiet dream is to eventually leverage his financial acumen to work for a B Corp or an endowment for historical preservation, finally merging the pragmatism he learned with the passion he was born with."
