The son of an African American jazz musician from Oakland and a second-generation Japanese American archivist from Japantown, Rashad grew up in a world of overlapping traditions. He spent his childhood navigating the space between two vibrant cultures, feeling not quite enough of either but uniquely a product of both. This upbringing made him a keen observer, a quiet presence who learned to listen more than he spoke.\n\nHis path after high school was uncertain until his mother was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disorder. The endless appointments and the mix of compassionate and indifferent healthcare professionals became his world. Witnessing his mother\u2019s struggle ignited a sense of purpose in him. He set aside vague artistic ambitions and enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate of Science in Medical Assisting. It was a practical choice, a direct route to being the kind of steady, reassuring presence he saw was so desperately needed in a clinical setting.\n\nNow 33, Rashad\u2019s life is deeply rooted in the neighborhood that raised him. He lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment just three blocks from the community health clinic where he works, making his commute a short walk past familiar murals and storefronts. His days are a steady rhythm of taking vitals, drawing blood, and translating complex medical jargon for elderly patients who have known him since he was a boy. He is the calm anchor in the often-chaotic clinic, known for his gentle touch and unflappable demeanor.\n\nWhile some friends chase tech fortunes, Rashad finds meaning in stability and service. His social life is small but solid, revolving around weekly dinners with his parents and pickup basketball games at Hamilton Rec Center. His great ambition isn't a promotion or a larger salary, but a quieter, more personal goal: to save enough money to take his mother on a trip to Kyoto, the city her grandparents left behind. For Rashad, success is measured in the health of his community and the comfort of his family."
