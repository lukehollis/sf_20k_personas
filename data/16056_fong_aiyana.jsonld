Born in the city\u2019s Inner Richmond district, she is the daughter of a Din\u00e9 (Navajo) mother who moved to the Bay Area for college and a second-generation Chinese-American father whose family ran a small grocery store. Her childhood was a tapestry of traditions: celebrating Lunar New Year with her father\u2019s family and spending summers on the Navajo Nation in Arizona, absorbing her mother\u2019s stories and language. This dual heritage instilled in her a profound understanding of how easily stories can be lost if they are not actively preserved.\n\nHer path was set after her mother\u2019s death when Aiyana was in her early twenties. The grief-stricken task of sorting through her mother\u2019s photographs, letters, and recorded oral histories of elders crystalized her calling. She enrolled at San Jos\u00e9 State University, earning a Master of Library and Information Science. Aiyana began her career in the physical archives of a local museum, but she foresaw the digital shift. She championed early digitization projects, becoming a vital bridge between traditional preservation and emerging technology. Today, as the Head of Digital Archives at a major university library, she manages vast collections, ensuring that the digital footprints of communities are as carefully curated as physical artifacts.\n\nAiyana lives in a quiet, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Sunset, a place she\u2019s called home for over two decades. Her daily routine is a comforting ritual: a walk to a local cafe for coffee, followed by the N Judah Muni line downtown. The 4.8-mile commute is her quiet time for reading. Though single, her life is rich with connection through a close-knit circle of colleagues and a book club that has met for fifteen years.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is one of both inheritance and stewardship. She walks streets that hold her father\u2019s history and works to protect the legacies of people like her mother. Aiyana\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to launch a collaborative project: a public digital archive of Bay Area oral histories from Asian American and Indigenous communities. For her, it\u2019s not just a career goal, but a way to honor her own story and ensure the city\u2019s memory remains as diverse as its people."

            "value": "1.\nShe remembers being eight, the air in the grocery store thick with ginger and the scent of her father\u2019s flour-dusted hands folding dumplings. For Lunar New Year, he told stories of his own father. Aiyana felt a profound, warm belonging, yet a quiet part of her mind drifted to the dry sage of Arizona. It was the first time she truly felt like a bridge between two worlds. This duality wasn't a conflict, but a calling to hold both histories with equal care.\n\n2.\nShe was fourteen, sitting on the shaded porch of her great-aunt\u2019s home in Arizona. The air was still and hot. An elder was speaking, his voice a low, rhythmic current in the Din\u00e9 language, and her mother translated softly. Aiyana didn\u2019t understand all the words, but she felt their weight, their history. A sudden, sharp fear seized her: what if no one was here to tell this story tomorrow? That fear never left; it became the quiet engine of her life\u2019s work.\n\n3.\nIn the dusty quiet of her mother\u2019s apartment, at twenty-two, she found a shoe box of cassette tapes labeled 'Stories.' She pressed play, and her mother's voice\u2014vibrant, alive\u2014filled the silent room, interviewing an elder. The wave of grief was crushing, but something else rose through it: a fierce, protective urgency. These weren't just tapes; they were lifelines. In that moment of profound loss, her grief found its purpose. She would not let these voices fade.\n\n4.\nShe recalls the brittle, yellowed page of a 19th-century Barbary Coast ledger, the ink fading to ghost-like whispers. Her supervisor was skeptical of the new flatbed scanner. Aiyana held her breath as the machine\u2019s light passed over it. When the crisp, perfectly preserved image appeared on her screen, relief washed over her, warm and sharp. It was more than a technical success; it was proof. She saw the future then, a way to make the fragile permanent, to give history a new, accessible life.\n\n5.\nJust last week on the N Judah, the fog broke as the train emerged from the Sunset Tunnel. The city spread out, a mosaic of rooftops and histories. Aiyana looked at the diverse faces of her fellow commuters, each a universe of stories. In that quiet, rumbling moment, she felt a profound sense of place. This commute wasn't a chore; it was a daily pilgrimage through the city she was tasked to remember. It affirmed that her work wasn\u2019t just a job, but her own story unfolding."
