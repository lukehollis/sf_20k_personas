            "value": "Robert Lee\u2019s life story is baked into the very walls of his Dogpatch home. At 49, his 0.0-mile commute is no tech-industry perk; he lives in the apartment above the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie factory his parents bought in the late 1970s. His earliest memories are not of playgrounds, but of the sweet smell of vanilla and toasted flour, the rhythmic clatter of the folding machine a constant lullaby. He is a third-generation San Franciscan whose world has shrunk to a single city block.\n\nHis parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, poured their life savings and relentless labor into the business, viewing it as the foundation for their son\u2019s future. They pushed him towards education, and he dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration from San Francisco State University. For a few years, he fantasized about a different life\u2014perhaps in logistics for a global shipping company, a world away from the sticky floors and temperamental ovens he knew. But when his father\u2019s health began to fail in his late twenties, the choice was made for him. Robert stepped in, not out of passion, but out of profound, unspoken duty.\n\nThat turning point defined his life. His role as Production Manager is an official title for what he truly is: the inheritor. The responsibility consumed his youth; a serious relationship in his early thirties crumbled under the weight of 3 a.m. maintenance calls and his inability to ever truly leave work. He has remained single since, his most consistent companions being his long-time employees and the delivery drivers who greet him by name.\n\nHis daily routine is a testament to predictability. He wakes to the hum of the ventilation fans, walks downstairs to the factory floor, orchestrates the production of thousands of cookies for restaurants across the Bay Area, and ends his day handling invoices in the same apartment where he did his homework as a child.\n\nRobert\u2019s connection to San Francisco is one of an anchor, not an explorer. He\u2019s a living piece of the city\u2019s disappearing industrial past, watching the neighborhood transform into sterile biotech labs and luxury condos. His hope is not for escape, but for survival\u2014to keep the family legacy alive against rising costs. His quiet, personal dream is to one day perfect a new matcha-flavored cookie, a small, modern twist on his parents\u2019 tradition. It is his own quiet way of finally making the factory his own."
