She lives in a small apartment directly above Harth & Home, the upscale retail store in Hayes Valley where she works as the assistant manager.\n\nGrowing up in Daly City, Sarah was the pragmatic daughter of third-generation Japanese American parents who prioritized stability. Still, she harbored a creative spark, enrolling at San Francisco State University to study graphic design. For two years, she thrived, her sketchbook filled with bold typography and minimalist logos. But when her father\u2019s health declined suddenly, a prolonged illness drained the family\u2019s savings. Sarah left school, telling herself it was temporary, and took a full-time job at a department store to help with bills.\n\nThe \u201ctemporary\u201d job became a decade. Sarah\u2019s innate sense of order and quiet competence made her a natural at retail management. Promotions came steadily, but each one felt less like a victory and more like a step away from her true passion. The turning point was the offer at Harth & Home. The job included the apartment, a coveted prize in San Francisco\u2019s brutal housing market. At 35, she accepted, cementing her path.\n\nNow, at 41, her life is a well-ordered routine. She wakes to the distant clatter of the cafe downstairs, spends her days managing inventory and staff, and knows the names of the delivery drivers and neighborhood regulars. Her social life consists of drinks with her small team after a busy Saturday or a quiet chat with the owner of the bookstore across the street. She is respected and professional, but a certain wall remains; few people know about the design student she once was.\n\nHer dream hasn\u2019t died, but it has changed. Late at night, in the quiet of her apartment, she still sketches. No longer logos for imaginary clients, but layouts for a small shop of her own\u2014a place that would feature local pottery and prints. Her aspiration is no longer to be a designer, but a curator. Sarah hopes to one day save enough to sign her own lease, finally merging the practical skills of her career with the artistic soul she has so carefully guarded."
