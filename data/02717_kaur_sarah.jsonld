The daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who ran a small trucking business in Fresno, she grew up with a deep appreciation for both the agricultural bounty of California and the engine roar of commerce. She spent her childhood witnessing the delicate, often fraught, balance between farming, water rights, and the environment. This upbringing planted a seed of purpose that would define her future.\n\nRejecting the family business for academia, Sarah pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Davis before earning a Master's in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. It was at Berkeley that she had a pivotal realization: real change wouldn't come from protest signs alone, but from working within the systems that had the largest impact. She set her sights on the Bay Area's tech industry, a sector renowned for innovation but also for its massive environmental footprint.\n\nNow 29, Sarah is a sought-after environmental consultant. From her bright, plant-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset, she works remotely, advising tech giants on sustainable practices, from reducing data center water usage to developing ethical e-waste supply chains. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her home office.\n\nHer days start with a run through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that reconnects her with the nature she works to protect. Her professional life is a series of video calls and complex data models, but her personal life is grounded. She shares her apartment with her partner, Alex, a graphic designer, and their social circle is a mix of college friends and fellow climbers from their bouldering gym.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. She sees the city as a living laboratory for the future she wants to build. Her ultimate dream is to launch her own B Corp, a consulting firm dedicated to creating symbiotic relationships between California\u2019s tech and agricultural sectors. For Sarah, it would be the perfect way to honor her roots in the valley while shaping a more sustainable future from her home in the city."
