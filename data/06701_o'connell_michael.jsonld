Born in the foggy Sunset District, he is the son of a Filipina nurse who arrived in the 1970s and an Irish-American Muni bus driver. His childhood was a mix of Catholic school, adobo on the stove, and foggy afternoons at Ocean Beach. Quiet and observant, Michael felt suspended between his parents\u2019 cultures, a feeling that defined his sense of self as \"Other.\"\n\nHe was the first in his family to attend a four-year university, enrolling at San Francisco State to study English Literature. He dreamed of becoming a teacher, captivated by stories and the power of language. However, during his junior year, his father suffered a debilitating stroke. Michael dropped out to help his mother, becoming a de facto caregiver. The abstract world of literary theory faded against the stark reality of helping his father eat, dress, and navigate their small home. It was exhausting, heartbreaking work, but in it, Michael discovered a profound, tangible sense of purpose he had never found in books.\n\nAfter his father passed away a few years later, the path back to college felt foreign. Instead, inspired by his mother\u2019s profession and his own recent experience, he earned his Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification. For two decades, he has worked in various facilities, known for his patience and gentle strength with the most challenging patients.\n\nNow 48, Michael\u2019s life is defined by a 0.0-mile commute. The city\u2019s brutal housing market led him to a unique role as a live-in caregiver for a frail, wealthy widow in her Pacific Heights Victorian. His world is the top floor of her grand, quiet house. His days are a structured routine of administering medication, preparing meals, providing companionship, and ensuring his client\u2019s comfort. His social life is spare, consisting of a weekly call with his sister and occasional coffee with an old friend from his SF State days. He is an invisible thread in the city\u2019s fabric, providing essential care within the walls of old money. His dream is no longer of academic acclaim, but of quiet stability\u2014perhaps one day affording a small condo of his own, a place to simply be Michael, not just someone\u2019s caregiver."
