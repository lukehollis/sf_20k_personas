The son of a pragmatic engineer and a meticulously organized homemaker, he grew up in a home where love was expressed through provision, not conversation. His path seemed set for a similar life until his younger sister\u2019s severe battle with an eating disorder shattered the family\u2019s placid surface. It was a compassionate, no-nonsense social worker who guided them through the medical and emotional turmoil, a figure who showed David that structured empathy could be a powerful tool for healing.\n\nInitially, David pursued an English degree, finding solace in the complex narratives of the human condition. But after his sister's crisis, fiction felt insufficient. He needed to be inside the story, not just an observer. He pivoted, earning a Master of Social Work from SF State in the late 1990s, drawn to San Francisco's promise of social progressivism and its robust public health systems. He spent fifteen years as a frontline clinical social worker at a bustling city hospital, navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system for patients facing catastrophic diagnoses and profound loss.\n\nNow, at 53, David\u2019s life is quieter. A decade-old amicable divorce prompted him to re-evaluate his own needs, leading him away from the hospital's relentless pace. He now operates a private practice entirely via telehealth from his serene Inner Sunset apartment. His zero-mile commute consists of walking from his kitchen to a small, dedicated office overlooking a fog-shrouded street. His days are a structured rhythm of back-to-back video sessions, broken up by long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. He skillfully holds space for the grief and anxiety of his clients, his calm demeanor a practiced anchor.\n\nHaving seen San Francisco through booms and busts, David feels less a participant in its frantic energy and more a quiet steward of its human core. His aspirations are no longer grand; he dreams of mentoring new social workers and perhaps one day finding a long-term partner who appreciates quiet evenings and the subtle beauty of a city at rest. He is a man who has made a career of listening, and has finally learned to apply that same gentle attention to himself."

She didn\u2019t coddle his parents; she gave them a plan. Watching his stoic father actually read the eating disorder pamphlet she handed him was like seeing a dam crack. In that moment, David understood. Empathy wasn't a feeling; it was a strategy, a tool. This memory, from his early twenties, set the course for his entire career.\n\n2.\nHis first few weeks in San Francisco, late 1990s. He\u2019d ride the N Judah from his tiny room to his classes at SF State. The train car was a moving tapestry of humanity\u2014punks, tech hopefuls, elderly Chinese women\u2014all crammed together. In Ohio, lives were parallel lines that never touched. Here, they collided with a messy, vibrant energy. He felt an exhale he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding. This was the real story, chaotic and alive, and he was finally inside of it.\n\n3.\nHe can still picture Mr. Henderson, a retired longshoreman with terminal cancer, around 2011. David spent weeks building rapport, only to have the man throw a chart at the wall, roaring, \"Stop trying to manage my death!\" David didn't flinch. He just sat, breathing in the sterile hospital air, until the rage subsided into ragged sobs. That day taught him the most vital lesson of his hospital career: his job wasn\u2019t to fix the pain, but simply to be willing to sit with it, unflinchingly.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a Tuesday night, about a year after the divorce became final. He came home from the hospital, the ghost of a dozen crises clinging to him. He stood in his silent apartment, too tired to even make tea. He had spent the day absorbing the grief of strangers, and realized he had no energy left for himself. The immense weight of his own unexamined sorrow landed on him. It wasn't a crisis, but a quiet, clear understanding: he needed to save a small piece of himself.\n\n5.\nJust last week, during a break between clients. He was walking a familiar path in Golden Gate Park, the fog so thick it muted the world to a soft gray. He stopped near the AIDS Memorial Grove, the air smelling of damp earth and eucalyptus. He felt the city's frantic pulse fade, replaced by the steady rhythm of his own breathing. He wasn't solving a crisis or chasing a dream. He was simply present, a quiet observer of his own life. It felt, finally, like enough."
