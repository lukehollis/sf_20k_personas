Adopted as an infant from an orphanage in Poland by a loving Vietnamese-American couple, she was raised in San Jose. Her childhood was a vibrant fusion of cultures\u2014summers spent perfecting her grandmother\u2019s ph\u1edf recipe and school years spent explaining why she didn't look like her parents. This upbringing gave her a unique lens on the world and an innate ability to navigate and celebrate diversity.\n\nAlways the organizer, she found her calling in the controlled chaos of creative production. She pursued a degree in Arts Administration at San Francisco State University, graduating in 2010. Her timing was challenging; the arts sector was still reeling from the 2008 recession. Jessica began her career not with a glamorous title, but with a series of scrappy, demanding internships and assistant roles. A key turning point was landing a junior coordinator position at a prominent SoMa cultural center. It was there her tenacity and grace under pressure shone, and over the next decade, she meticulously climbed the ranks.\n\nNow, as an Events Director, Jessica's life runs on carefully managed timetables. Her daily routine begins with a MUNI ride from her Hayes Valley apartment, a 3.8-mile journey that gives her just enough time to review the day's frantic schedule. Her days are a whirlwind of managing vendors, soothing artistic egos, and ensuring galas and festivals run flawlessly. Her social life is deeply intertwined with her career, consisting of a close-knit circle of colleagues and creatives. After a long-term relationship ended a year ago, she has poured her energy back into her work and friendships, rediscovering her independence within the city she adores.\n\nLiving in Hayes Valley places her at the epicenter of San Francisco's cultural heart, a short walk from the symphony, jazz clubs, and countless galleries. While she's proud of her professional success, her ultimate dream is to launch her own boutique agency, curating bespoke cultural experiences that blend art, food, and community\u2014a venture that would be the perfect expression of her own multifaceted identity."

She\u2019d stood beside her pot of ph\u1edf, the star anise and cinnamon fragrant in the stuffy gymnasium. When a boy asked why she didn't look like her dad, who was beaming beside her, she froze. But her father placed a hand on her shoulder and explained, \u201cFamily is made of love, not just looks.\u201d The moment wasn't one of shame, but of fierce, protective pride. It was the first time she learned to answer a complicated question with a simple, warm truth.\n\n2.\nHer first gala as a junior coordinator, around 2013. The main speaker's mic cut out. For ten agonizing seconds, silence stretched across the packed SoMa atrium. While her boss panicked, Jessica grabbed a wireless mic from the AV table, strode onto the stage, and charmingly announced an \u201cunplanned intermission.\u201d The audience laughed. In that moment of controlled chaos, she felt a surge of adrenaline and profound competence. It cemented her reputation for grace under pressure and proved to herself she belonged in the most demanding rooms.\n\n3.\nThe evening was cool and foggy, three months after her breakup. Walking home from a late event, she skipped the MUNI and decided to walk the whole way. Crossing Van Ness into Hayes Valley, the symphony hall was lit up and the sound of a saxophone drifted from a club. Instead of the familiar pang of loneliness, she felt a quiet sense of ownership. This city, in all its vibrant, beautiful complexity, was her partner now. That walk was the first chapter of her new independence.\n\n4.\nShe was overseeing a small gallery opening for a new sculptor. Afterward, she watched the artist sharing a meal with patrons, catered by a local pop-up restaurant she\u2019d hired. The art, food, and conversation blended into a single, beautiful experience. A spark ignited in her mind\u2014this was more than an event. It was curated community. That quiet, successful evening in a small gallery, probably two years ago, gave birth to the dream of her own agency, a business built around creating exactly that kind of magic.\n\n5.\nLast year, after the final night of a massive, exhausting outdoor festival she\u2019d managed, she collapsed into a seat on the N-Judah. Leaning her head against the cool glass, she watched the city lights blur through the fog. She was bone-tired but filled with a deep, quiet satisfaction. She wasn\u2019t just a tourist or a transplant; she was part of the city\u2019s working rhythm, one of the countless people who made its heart beat. In that tired, anonymous MUNI ride, she felt more at home than ever."
