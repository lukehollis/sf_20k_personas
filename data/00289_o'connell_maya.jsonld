The only child of a carpenter father and a ceramics artist mother, she grew up surrounded by sawdust and wet clay, taught to value the beauty in imperfection. Yet, Maya always found more comfort in logic and systems. While her parents saw chaotic abstracts, she saw the underlying geometry.\n\nThis inclination led her to the University of Oregon, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. She was fascinated by human behavior, but it was the quantitative analysis portion of her coursework that truly captivated her. In the final year of her program, a long-term relationship crumbled, leaving her feeling untethered from her hometown. Simultaneously, a data analytics bootcamp she\u2019d enrolled in out of curiosity began to feel more like a calling. Armed with a new set of self-taught coding skills and a diploma, she saw a job opening in San Francisco not just as a career move, but as a complete reset.\n\nNow, at 25, her life unfolds within a few square miles of her Inner Richmond apartment. The 0.0-mile commute means her day begins not on a bus, but with a walk to a small cafe on Clement Street for an oat milk latte before logging into a world of SQL queries and data visualizations. She works for a mid-size ad-tech firm, tasked with finding the human story within millions of clicks and impressions.\n\nHer evenings are a necessary escape from the screen. She sheds her analyst identity at Mission Cliffs, a rock-climbing gym where her small circle of friends was forged through shared challenges and chalk-dusted high-fives. San Francisco, for Maya, isn't about its iconic skyline; it's about the foggy tranquility of Golden Gate Park, the reliable warmth of her favorite pho spot, and the physical problem-solving of a bouldering route. Her future aspiration is to bridge her two worlds: to eventually use her data skills for a nonprofit or civic-tech project, applying the logic she loves to the societal questions that first sparked her intellectual curiosity."
