Raised in a quiet suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, she was the daughter of a high school history teacher and a city planner, a household where conversations about community and civic duty were as common as dinner itself. This pragmatic idealism propelled her to the University of Illinois for a degree in Public Administration, eschewing more lucrative paths for one she felt could build a better system.\n\nHer early career involved grant writing for smaller non-profits in Chicago. But the city felt constrained, and in her late twenties, she was drawn to San Francisco's progressive energy and robust non-profit sector. She arrived in 1998 with two suitcases and a job offer from an environmental advocacy group, eager to make her mark.\n\nThe decisive turning point came a decade later when her younger sister faced a difficult, year-long battle with cancer. Witnessing the compassionate, cutting-edge care she received at a major teaching hospital reshaped Susan\u2019s professional focus. The experience transformed her abstract belief in public service into a visceral, personal mission. She leveraged her fundraising expertise to land a role at a hospital foundation, finally finding the place where her ambition and empathy could fully align.\n\nNow, as the Director of Development, Susan is a master of translating medical breakthroughs into compelling narratives for philanthropists. Her days are a mix of high-stakes meetings and quiet strategic planning. Her commute is a cherished ritual: a 25-minute ride on the MUNI N-Judah line from her cozy Cole Valley apartment, a time she uses to read or simply watch the city wake up.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit \"chosen family\" of friends, many met through volunteer boards and cultural events. While a significant long-term relationship ended in her forties, she finds deep fulfillment in her independence and connections. Her dream is no longer just to meet fundraising goals, but to personally spearhead a capital campaign to endow a new pediatric oncology wing\u2014a permanent legacy of hope, born from a lifetime of service and a season of personal pain."

The air was cool and smelled of sea salt and eucalyptus as a streetcar rumbled past. For a moment, the sheer scale of the place felt overwhelming, a stark contrast to her flat Midwest hometown. But it was followed by a jolt of pure thrill\u2014the feeling of finally being in a place big enough to hold her ambitions. It was the moment San Francisco became hers.\n\n2.\nShe remembers sitting beside her sister\u2019s hospital bed in 2008, tracing the name of a family foundation etched onto the side of a state-of-the-art infusion pump. In that sterile, quiet room, her life\u2019s work clicked into focus. It wasn't about abstract policy anymore. It was about this machine, this medicine, this moment of care\u2014all made possible by someone's generosity. The abstract concept of \"public good\" suddenly had a face, a name, and a heartbeat. Her own.\n\n3.\nIt was a phone call in 2011. A notoriously frugal philanthropist she\u2019d been courting for months finally said \u201cyes\u201d to funding a new imaging machine. Susan hung up, looked out her office window at the city, and felt a quiet, profound wave of relief wash over her. This wasn't the fleeting victory of a grant proposal. This felt tangible, permanent. It was the first time she directly translated her sister\u2019s painful journey into a concrete\nlegacy of healing for others, proving she had found her place.\n\n4.\nA memory from her mid-forties, just months after her long-term relationship ended. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic event, just a Tuesday night potluck at her friend\u2019s Haight-Ashbury flat. Laughter echoed off the walls as they debated city politics over cheap wine and pasta. In that moment, surrounded by her chosen family, she felt a profound sense of completeness. She realized her foundation wasn't built on a romantic partnership, but on this rich, resilient network of friends. Independence finally felt like a gift.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, the N-Judah emerged from the Sunset tunnel, and the UCSF campus on Parnassus Heights appeared through the morning fog. Watching the flurry of doctors and nurses, she suddenly pictured it: a new pediatric oncology wing. It wasn't about ego, but about her sister, and all the children who would come after. The vague goal of \"doing good\" crystallized into a single, fierce ambition. Her commute was no longer just a route to work; it was a daily pilgrimage toward that future."
