Raised in a quiet Cleveland suburb by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his childhood was stable, predictable, and devoid of ambition beyond the picket fences of his neighborhood. He was an observant, quiet boy who found escape in books, which led him to pursue a path his practical parents found baffling: a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from the University of Michigan.\n\nArmed with his degree and a half-finished manuscript, Michael moved to Portland in his late twenties, convinced he was the next great American novelist. The reality was a series of barista jobs, shared housing, and a growing pile of rejection letters. The key turning point came at age 31, broke and disheartened, when he accepted that his dream wouldn\u2019t pay the rent. On a friend\u2019s advice, he took a technical writing course. He discovered an unexpected talent for translating complex engineering jargon into clear, human-centric language\u2014a skill, he realized, not unlike storytelling.\n\nThis new path led him to San Francisco during the tech boom of the early 2010s. He started as a technical writer, but his ability to understand user needs and craft compelling narratives for products propelled him into product management. Now 44, he works from home in his North of the Panhandle (NOPA) apartment. His 0.0-mile commute shapes his days: a morning coffee from The Mill, hours of Zoom calls managing teams across time zones, and a late afternoon run through the Panhandle to clear his head.\n\nDivorced five years ago from a short-lived \u201ctech marriage,\u201d his social life is a curated circle of colleagues and a few old friends who remember his writer days. He loves the city\u2019s vibrant energy but often feels like an observer, a transplant who mastered the language of his adopted home without ever feeling like a native. His secret hope is to finally finish that novel, not for publication, but for the quiet boy from Ohio he once was. Michael\u2019s aspiration is no longer fame, but balance\u2014to find a way for the successful product manager and the dormant novelist to coexist peacefully within the fog-dusted streets of San Francisco."
