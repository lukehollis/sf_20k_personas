Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he was the only child of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small laundromat on Irving Street. His childhood was a blend of his parents\u2019 tireless work ethic and his own quiet, artistic inclinations. He filled notebooks with intricate drawings, dreaming of a life beyond the hiss of steam presses.\n\nThat dream seemed within reach when he enrolled in the graphic design program at City College of San Francisco. For two semesters, his world expanded. He felt alive, inspired by typography and color theory. But his path veered sharply when his father suffered a severe stroke. The laundromat had to be sold to cover medical bills, and Thomas, then 20, dropped out of college to find steady work to support his mother.\n\nHe found it at the local hospital, not as an artist, but as an Environmental Services Technician. The job, cleaning and sanitizing patient rooms and operating theaters, was physically demanding and emotionally taxing, but it offered stability and good benefits.\n\nFifteen years later, Thomas\u2019s life is defined by the hospital\u2019s orbit. He lives in a small, rent-controlled studio apartment in a building adjacent to the medical campus, making his commute a literal walk across a courtyard. His world has shrunk to a few square blocks. His days are a meticulous routine: work his shift, sterilizing the spaces where life and death hang in the balance, return to his silent apartment, and prepare for the next day. His social life is limited to brief, friendly exchanges with nurses and the occasional shared lunch with fellow technicians.\n\nHis primary connection outside the hospital is his mother, whom he visits every Sunday in the Sunset, bringing her groceries and listening to her stories. In his solitary moments, Thomas still sketches. He no longer dreams of fame, but of a future with a bit more breathing room\u2014perhaps a one-bedroom apartment where he can set up a proper art desk. His hope is not to escape his life, but to carve out a small, sunlit corner within it, a private gallery in the shadow of the hospital he so dutifully serves."
