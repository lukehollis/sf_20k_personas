Raised in the intellectual pressure cooker of a Boston suburb, her path was seemingly laid out: a prestigious East Coast university followed by law or medical school, just like her parents\u2014a lawyer and a cardiologist\u2014had achieved. Rebecca, however, was always more interested in the texture of her mother\u2019s paint-by-numbers kits than the text of her father\u2019s legal briefs. For her, beauty was tangible, something to be touched and arranged.\n\nHer rebellion wasn't a shout but a westward migration. She enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, choosing to major in Museum and Curatorial Studies\u2014a compromise that felt both academic enough for her family and hands-on enough for her spirit. An internship at a small campus gallery was her turning point. While her peers wrote lengthy essays on artistic intent, Rebecca discovered a profound satisfaction in the meticulous work of hanging a show: the precise measurements, the careful handling of fragile frames, the quiet hum of the gallery before the doors opened. She wasn't the artist, but she was the one who made the art breathe in the space.\n\nAfter graduating, she moved to San Francisco, drawn by its vibrant, less-centralized art scene. She landed a job as an Art Technician at a contemporary gallery housed in a converted warehouse. The ultimate perk was the job's location\u2014directly beneath an affiliated live/work loft space. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down a single flight of industrial metal stairs.\n\nNow 27, Rebecca\u2019s life is contained within the industrial-chic confines of the Dogpatch. Her days are spent installing complex exhibitions, repairing sculptures, and managing art storage. Her apartment, filled with thrifted furniture and neatly organized art supplies, overlooks the bay, its windows often fogged over by the morning marine layer. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of artists and makers from her building, revolving around potlucks and project critiques. While she loves the creative energy of her immediate world, she sometimes yearns to break out of her self-contained bubble. Her quiet dream isn\u2019t to be a famous artist, but to become the Head Registrar at SFMOMA, managing a vast collection with the same care and precision she gives to a single painting."
