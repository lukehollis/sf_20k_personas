            "value": "Wei Zhang is a product of old San Francisco, forged in the fog of the Sunset District. The only son of immigrants from Hong Kong who ran a small, perpetually steamy laundromat on Taraval Street, Wei's childhood was a mix of Cantonese radio, the scent of detergent, and the quiet but immense pressure to achieve. His parents envisioned a doctor or a lawyer. Wei, in a gentle act of rebellion, chose Art History at SF State, fascinated by the stories objects could tell.\n\nHis degree, however, didn't pay the bills in the post-dot-com bust era. A temp agency placed him in a quality assurance role at a small tech startup, a world utterly alien to him. Yet, he discovered an unexpected aptitude. The chaos of software development cycles required the same meticulous eye for detail he\u2019d honed studying Renaissance frescoes. He wasn't a coder, but he could organize, anticipate problems, and manage the complex dance of personalities on a team. He found his niche, working his way up through grit and intuition. The key turning point was his promotion to Production Manager; it was the moment he finally told his father he wasn't going to grad school, cementing a career his parents didn\u2019t understand but learned to respect for the stability it provided.\n\nNow, at 47, Wei\u2019s life is a curated study in control. He lives in a minimalist condo in Mission Bay, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his bedroom to a standing desk in the living room. His days are a disciplined sequence of Slack notifications, Zoom calls, and Gantt charts. A brief, amicable divorce ten years ago, a casualty of his demanding career climb, left him a solitary but not lonely man. His social circle is small and tight-knit, composed of a few colleagues from his early tech days.\n\nHis connection to the city is layered. He appreciates the sleek efficiency of his modern neighborhood but drives to the Sunset every Sunday to have dinner with his aging parents, the familiar fog a comforting blanket. He sometimes misses the tactile world of art and books. His dream isn't to climb higher, but to find balance. He aspires to one day trade production timelines for a pottery wheel, to create something tangible with his own hands, and to finally tell a story of his own."
