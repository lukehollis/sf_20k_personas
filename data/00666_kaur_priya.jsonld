Born in Daly City to Punjabi immigrant parents who ran a small grocery store, Priya's upbringing was steeped in the values of hard work and community. In her youth, she dreamed of being a graphic designer, filling notebooks with intricate patterns inspired by her heritage, and enrolled in a local community college with that goal in mind.\n\nHer path veered sharply at twenty when her mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness requiring years of intensive treatment. Priya paused her education to become a primary caregiver, her world shrinking to the rhythm of hospital visits and home care. It was in the sterile, anxious waiting rooms of UCSF Medical Center that she discovered her true calling. She watched children, patients themselves or siblings of patients, navigate the terrifying environment with a resilience that humbled her. She saw the immense need for a space of joy and normalcy within the walls of healthcare.\n\nThis realization became her turning point. After her mother\u2019s condition stabilized, Priya didn't return to graphic design. Instead, she earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Early Childhood Education. For the past two decades, she has been a teacher\u2019s assistant at the hospital\u2019s integrated preschool, a haven for children of staff and those undergoing long-term care.\n\nPriya lives in a modest, university-owned apartment just a block from the Parnassus campus, making her commute a short, familiar walk. Her days are a blend of structured play, comforting tearful toddlers, and coordinating with medical staff to accommodate a child\u2019s treatment schedule. Her social life is woven into her work; her closest friends are nurses and fellow educators. Though she never married or had children of her own, she feels a deep maternal connection to the hundreds of little ones she has nurtured.\n\nHer San Francisco is not one of tech hubs or tourist landmarks, but the misty serenity of the Inner Sunset and the quiet refuge of the Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park. At fifty, Priya\u2019s dream is not to leave, but to deepen her impact. She hopes to develop a small art therapy program for the preschool, blending her old passion with her current purpose, convinced that a crayon and a piece of paper can be as healing as any medicine."
