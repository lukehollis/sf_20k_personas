Arriving in her early twenties, she settled into a new life in the Bay Area, marked by the challenges of cultural adaptation and a quiet, difficult marriage. To build a foundation for herself, she enrolled in a local community college, earning an Associate's degree in Office Administration\u2014a practical choice for a future she couldn't yet envision.\n\nThe true turning point in her life came with the birth of her son, Rohan. He was born with a congenital heart defect, and Priya\u2019s world shrank to the sterile hallways and waiting rooms of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. The administrative skills she had learned felt hollow as she navigated years of surgeries and treatments. During those stressful times, she witnessed the profound impact of the hospital\u2019s therapeutic preschool. She saw how the teacher assistants could coax a smile from a child in pain, offering moments of normalcy amidst chaos. It was a quieter, more essential form of healing.\n\nAfter her son\u2019s final successful surgery, a newly divorced Priya felt an unbreakable bond with the institution that had saved him. She let her administrative path go, completed the necessary certifications for early childhood education, and took a position as a Preschool Teacher Assistant right there at the hospital.\n\nNow at 50, Priya\u2019s life is deeply rooted in the Inner Sunset neighborhood surrounding the medical campus. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of a short walk from her modest, staff-subsidized apartment to her classroom. Her days are a gentle rhythm of wiping tears, guiding small hands in finger-painting, and offering a stable, loving presence to children battling serious illnesses. Her social circle is a tight-knit community of nurses and fellow hospital staff.\n\nHer hopes are no longer for personal advancement, but for the small victories she witnesses daily: a child eating after chemotherapy, or another taking their first steps after surgery. Her greatest dream is to watch her healthy son, now a student at SF State, live a full and happy life, perhaps one day saving enough to take him on a trip to Punjab to connect with the family he barely knows."

This was a foothold in a country that felt like quicksand, a practical shield for a life she was enduring, not yet choosing. It occurred in her mid-twenties, the first time she built something just for herself\u2014a quiet act of self-preservation in the lonely fog of her early marriage, long before she knew what true strength was.\n\n2.\nThe world dissolved into the hum of machines and the doctor's calm, devastating words. \"Congenital heart defect.\" Priya remembers clutching the plastic armrest of the hospital chair in her late twenties, the administrative terms she\u2019d studied turning to ash in her mind. All that mattered was the impossibly small son in the isolette. In that sterile room, her universe collapsed to the size of his tiny, broken heart. It was the moment she became not just a mother, but a warrior.\n\n3.\nOne afternoon during Rohan\u2019s long recovery, she saw a teacher assistant sit with a little girl who\u2019d lost her hair to chemo. The assistant wasn\u2019t doing anything remarkable; she was just holding a crayon, her hand over the girl\u2019s, guiding it in a shaky circle. The girl smiled. In that moment in her early thirties, Priya felt a profound shift inside her. This, she realized, was the most essential work\u2014not fixing, but simply *being with*. Her own path forward suddenly became clear.\n\n4.\nHer first day as a Teacher Assistant. She clipped the UCSF staff badge to her kurta. The crisp plastic felt heavier than any diploma. Walking into the therapeutic preschool in her late thirties, this time not as a terrified mother but as a caregiver, was a seismic event. The familiar smell of antiseptic was no longer frightening; it was the smell of her new purpose. She was no longer a visitor in the world that saved her son; she was a part of it.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, Rohan came home from SF State and spent an hour fixing her leaky faucet. He stood in her small kitchen, tall and effortlessly capable, humming along to the radio. Priya watched him, her heart aching with a quiet, overwhelming joy. This was the miracle. Not a dramatic surgery, but this simple, boring moment of domestic life. A healthy son, complaining good-naturedly about old pipes. This ordinary scene was the extraordinary dream she had fought for all those years."
