Raised in a comfortable, middle-class suburb of Columbus, Ohio, by a high school teacher and an accountant, she was encouraged to be practical. Sarah, however, was drawn to the grand, impractical beauty of the past. Her passion led her to an unlikely graduate degree: a Master of Arts in Renaissance Art History. She dreamed of a life as a curator, surrounded by the masterpieces she adored.\n\nThat dream collided with reality upon her graduation in 2009. The fallout from the financial crisis had decimated arts funding, and the job market was bleak. Facing staggering student debt and dwindling prospects, Sarah made a calculated, painful pivot. She enrolled in a grueling, accelerated program for a Master's in Financial Mathematics. It was a world away from Botticelli, but it was a world with a future.\n\nHer sharp, analytical mind, once used to deconstruct iconography, proved exceptionally adept at dissecting market trends. She was recruited by a top-tier consulting firm and began a rapid ascent. The career move brought her to San Francisco a decade ago, a city whose immense wealth and vibrant arts scene represented the two halves of her own life.\n\nNow, at 39, Sarah lives and works from her impeccably minimalist Hayes Valley condo. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to a home office overlooking a quiet courtyard. Her days are a disciplined sequence of international calls, data modeling, and strategy presentations for global financial institutions.\n\nHer social life is small but tight-knit, consisting of a few other high-achieving professionals. She is a benefactor at SFMOMA and finds a quiet solace in walking through the galleries, a ghost of her former self trailing behind. Sarah\u2019s ultimate aspiration is to finally merge her two worlds. She dreams of leaving consulting within the next five years to start her own advisory firm, one that specializes in helping art museums and large non-profits build sustainable endowments. It's her personal quest to ensure the beauty she once had to abandon can be preserved for others."
