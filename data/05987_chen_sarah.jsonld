The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, she was raised under the heavy expectation of a career in engineering or medicine\u2014a practical path to honor her parents\u2019 sacrifices. However, Sarah was always more of an observer than a builder. Resisting gently, she pursued a Bachelor's in Sociology at UC Davis, fascinated more by the \"why\" of human behavior than the \"how\" of building circuits. This choice was her first quiet act of independence.\n\nHer early career was a mosaic of unfulfilling jobs, from a non-profit coordinator to an administrative role at a traditional advertising firm. The turning point came at 31, after a difficult breakup and a layoff. Feeling adrift, Sarah realized her sociology background gave her a unique lens. She taught herself data analysis and leveraged her understanding of societal trends to break into tech, landing an entry-level market research role. It was the perfect fusion of her analytical mind and her fascination with people. She had carved her own version of a successful career, finally earning her parents' grudging respect.\n\nNow 39, Sarah lives a life of structured tranquility in her North of Panhandle (NOPA) apartment. Her commute is a 15-step journey from her bed to her standing desk, a privilege she never takes for granted. Her days are a rhythm of data sets, market trend reports, and Zoom calls deciphering user needs for a major software company. Evenings are for unwinding: either a run through the Panhandle greenbelt or cooking a complex meal from a new recipe.\n\nHer social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from college and her running club. She feels most connected to San Francisco in these quiet moments: picking up fresh sourdough on Divisadero, finding a quiet corner at Golden Gate Park, or the weekly ritual of the Clement Street Farmers' Market. While professionally content, Sarah dreams of a future with more direct impact. She aspires to eventually use her research skills for a social advocacy group, turning data into tangible change for the city that finally feels like home."
