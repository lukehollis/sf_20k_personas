Born in the Richmond District to hardworking Hong Kong immigrants, his childhood was defined by the scent of dried herbs from his parents\u2019 small grocery store and the persistent fog rolling in from the Pacific. His parents, pragmatic and sacrificing, envisioned a clear path for their only son: a prestigious degree leading to a lucrative career as a doctor or engineer. David, however, was a contemplative child, more interested in listening to the stories of the neighborhood elders than in excelling at calculus.\n\nHe dutifully tried to fit their mold, earning an Economics degree from UC Berkeley and landing a respectable but soulless job in corporate finance during the first dot-com boom. The work felt hollow, a daily exercise in abstraction that left him feeling disconnected and anxious. The turning point came not with a crash, but a whisper. After volunteering for a crisis hotline on a whim, he discovered a profound sense of purpose in offering a calm, empathetic ear to people in distress. It was the first time his innate skills felt valuable.\n\nAt 29, he quit his job, a decision that baffled his parents, and enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. After graduating, he spent fifteen years working within a large hospital system, honing his skills and weathering the systemic burnout.\n\nNow, at 52, David has cultivated the life he truly wanted. He runs a private therapy practice from a dedicated office in his peaceful Cole Valley condo, hence his zero-mile commute. His days are a structured rhythm of client sessions\u2014often helping tech workers navigate the very pressures he fled\u2014followed by long, meditative walks through the Presidio or Golden Gate Park. His connection to San Francisco is deep; he feels less like a resident and more like a quiet caretaker, tending to the city's unseen emotional wounds. His dream is not of wealth or recognition, but of continued sustainability: to maintain his practice, deepen his friendships over quiet dinners, and perhaps, finally adopt the rescue greyhound he\u2019s been visiting at the SPCA."
