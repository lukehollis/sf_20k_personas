Born in Daly City to a Mexican-American mother from Michoac\u00e1n and a second-generation Irish-American father, David grew up navigating two cultures. His mother\u2019s vibrant cooking and Spanish filled their small home, while his father, a city bus driver, instilled a pragmatic, hardworking ethos. David was the quiet observer, sketching in notebooks and dreaming of a more creative life.\n\nThat dream led him to San Francisco State University to study graphic design. For two years, he thrived, intoxicated by color theory and typography. However, his path veered sharply when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. As the eldest son, David dropped out of college to help support his family, taking a stockroom job at a men's lifestyle boutique in Hayes Valley. He told himself it was temporary, a bridge to get his family through the crisis.\n\nBut David discovered an unexpected gratification in retail. He had a natural eye for merchandising, and his calm, thoughtful demeanor made customers feel at ease. He climbed the ladder steadily: from the stockroom to the sales floor, then to assistant manager. When the company opened a new flagship store in the Mission District, they offered him the manager position and the rent-controlled apartment directly above it. It was an offer he couldn't refuse.\n\nNow, at 34, David\u2019s life exists within a ten-block radius. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs. His day starts with a coffee from the panaderia on the corner and ends with locking the store\u2019s gate, the sounds of 24th Street filtering up to his window. He\u2019s a neighborhood fixture\u2014the guy who knows everyone\u2019s name and can recommend the perfect gift. He\u2019s single, his long hours and dedication to the store having quietly ended his last serious relationship.\n\nHis design dreams haven\u2019t died but have been repurposed. He meticulously arranges the store displays, seeing them as living installations. His secret ambition is to one day buy the store from its current owner, rebranding it with his own unique vision\u2014a place that honors both the artisan craftsmanship of his heritage and the sleek modernism he once studied."
