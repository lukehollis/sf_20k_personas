Raised by a high school English teacher and a luthier, Nia\u2019s childhood was filled with books and the scent of sawdust, instilling in her a love for structured stories and handcrafted quality. She pursued a Bachelor's in Communications at the University of Oregon, assuming her future lay in publishing or public relations.\n\nHer key turning point came in 2002. Burnt out on low-paying internships, she followed a friend to San Francisco, landing an administrative assistant role at a fledgling tech startup struggling to survive the dot-com bust. The environment was chaotic, but Nia discovered she had a rare talent for taming it. While engineers built the product, she built the company, creating workflows, managing vendors, and organizing projects. She found her calling not in code, but in creating the operational scaffolding that allowed innovation to flourish. Over two decades, she built a reputation as the calm, indispensable force in the background, eventually becoming an Operations Manager at a successful mid-size tech firm.\n\nNow 42, Nia\u2019s life is centered in her quiet Inner Richmond apartment, where her commute is a ten-step journey from her bed to her desk. Lacking a formal office, she imposes her own structure. Mornings begin with a brisk, foggy walk through Golden Gate Park, followed by coffee from a favorite cafe on Clement Street. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014fellow veterans of the tech scene who prefer wine bars and long dinners to startup launch parties.\n\nThough financially secure, Nia feels a familiar restlessness. The tech world has been a vessel, not a destination. Her dream is to reconnect with her roots, aspiring to one day leave operations behind to open a small, curated bookstore-cafe in a quieter coastal town. She envisions a space that combines her father's appreciation for craftsmanship with her mother's love for stories\u2014a final, personal project built on a lifetime of organizing everyone else's."
