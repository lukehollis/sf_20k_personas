His parents, a lumber mill foreman and a diner waitress, were practical people who viewed his constant reading with a mix of pride and bewilderment. He found refuge in worlds far from his own, which led him to pursue a BA in Comparative Literature. Upon graduating, however, he realized his passion wasn't just for the stories themselves, but for their preservation and organization. This epiphany guided him to a Master of Library and Information Science, where he found his true calling: creating order out of the beautiful chaos of human knowledge.\n\nHis early career was a steady climb through the academic library systems of the West Coast. He arrived in San Francisco in his late twenties, taking a position as a reference librarian at the prestigious (and fictional) North Gate University. A key turning point came a decade later. Following a painful breakup with a long-term partner who found him \"too settled,\" the position of Head Librarian opened up. The role came with a unique, dusty perk: a small, forgotten custodian's apartment on the library's top floor. David accepted both the job and the residence, a decision that cemented his life\u2019s path. His commute became a 90-second walk down a spiral staircase.\n\nNow 48, David\u2019s life is one of quiet contentment. He wakes to the smell of old paper and binding glue, his routine governed by the academic calendar. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of his trusted library staff and a few tenured professors with whom he shares an occasional glass of wine. He is a quiet steward in a city of noise. From his apartment window, he watches the fog roll over Twin Peaks, feeling deeply connected to the intellectual history of San Francisco without needing to engage in its frantic pace.\n\nHis dream is not to travel the world, but to finish digitizing the library\u2019s collection of 19th-century San Francisco manuscripts. He hopes to one day write a small, scholarly book on the history of cartography, his private passion. David Miller has found his sanctuary not in a neighborhood, but in a building\u2014a guardian of stories, living a life bound and shelved with the very knowledge he cherishes."
