Born and raised in a quiet Oregon town, her path was forged not by ambition, but by necessity. Her younger brother\u2019s chronic childhood illness plunged their family into a world of bewildering hospital corridors, insurance paperwork, and hushed, clinical conversations. It was there, watching a compassionate social worker navigate the chaos for her parents, that Sarah found her calling. She saw a way to bring order and empathy to people\u2019s most vulnerable moments.\n\nThis drive led her to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, trading Oregon\u2019s green expanse for the city\u2019s dense, vibrant grid. She began her career at a large downtown hospital, thriving on the fast-paced, high-stakes environment. She was excellent at her job: a steady presence who could coordinate discharge plans, connect uninsured patients with resources, and hold a family\u2019s hand through a devastating diagnosis.\n\nThe turning point was the pandemic-era shift to remote work. What began as a temporary measure became permanent. Her 0.0-mile commute means her office is now a corner of her one-bedroom apartment, her patients reduced to voices on a headset and faces on a screen. The apartment, once a sanctuary from the emotional toll of her job, now contains it. Her world has become both efficient and profoundly isolating.\n\nHer social life exists in quiet pockets. A weekly video call with her brother, now a healthy adult in Portland; sporadic dinners with a few fellow social worker friends who are just as exhausted as she is. Her most consistent companion is Leo, a perpetually unimpressed ginger cat. Her connection to San Francisco is felt on her daily walks through Golden Gate Park, where she trades the sterile glow of her monitor for the damp smell of eucalyptus and the expanse of Ocean Beach.\n\nSarah, at 38, yearns for a life less curated by a work calendar. She doesn't dream of changing the world, but of re-entering it. Her hope is small, tangible: to join a pottery class, to feel the slick, grounding texture of clay in her hands, and to create something for no one\u2019s benefit but her own, in a room full of strangers who might just become friends."
