The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she was raised behind the counter of her parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Sunset District. Her childhood was a landscape of stacked boxes, the scent of dried herbs, and the unspoken rule of emotional resilience. Her parents, who poured their life savings and boundless energy into the store, preached a doctrine of hard work and stoicism; problems were to be endured, not discussed.\n\nThe turning point that shattered this stoicism came during her sophomore year at UC Berkeley. Her mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and Mei was thrust into the role of translator, advocate, and emotional anchor. She watched her proud father crumble in the sterile, confusing environment of a large hospital. It was a hospital social worker, a calm and compassionate woman, who finally provided a lifeline. She helped them navigate insurance, access support groups, and, most importantly, gave them the language to articulate their fear and grief. In those harrowing months, Mei found her calling.\n\nAfter completing her Sociology degree, she enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. Her career began in the chaotic trenches of a downtown hospital\u2019s oncology wing, the very place that had reshaped her life. For over a decade, she was a pillar for families in crisis. However, the relentless pace led to burnout.\n\nNow, at 41, Mei has recalibrated. She runs her practice entirely from her cozy apartment in the Inner Richmond, a 0.0-mile commute that preserves her energy for her clients. Her days are structured: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park, followed by back-to-back telehealth sessions with patients across the healthcare system. She is a pillar of her chosen family\u2014a tight-knit group of friends\u2014and a dutiful daughter to her aging father, with whom she now shares a bond deepened by a shared history of loss. Her dream is to one day open a small group practice specifically tailored to the AAPI community, creating a space to heal the intergenerational wounds she understands so intimately. For Mei, San Francisco is not just a city; it is the landscape of her entire story, from a child of silent struggle to a woman who helps others find their voice."

She watched her mother expertly weigh a bundle of herbs for a customer, their hands barely touching. The exchange was efficient, a silent language of necessity, not connection. It taught her that care could be transactional and non-verbal, a lesson she would later spend her life unlearning and reshaping into a new language of healing. (Childhood, ~age 8)\n\n2.  \nShe can still feel the cold vinyl of the hospital chair. Her father, a man of immense physical strength, looked shrunken and lost. Then, the social worker sat with them, her voice a calm island in a sea of beeping machines. She didn\u2019t just offer pamphlets; she offered a pause, a breath. In that small, sterile room, amidst their family\u2019s shattering, the woman handed Mei the first tool for rebuilding: the permission to be afraid, together. (College, sophomore year, ~age 19)\n\n3.  \nIt was a late Tuesday shift, years into her hospital career. She was holding the hand of a young man whose family, much like her own, spoke in a dialect of shared, silent grief. She translated the doctor\u2019s final, gentle words. Afterwards, sitting in her car in the hospital garage, the tears she\u2019d held for his family\u2014and for her own long-gone mother\u2014finally came. It was the moment she knew this relentless pace was consuming the very empathy she offered. (Early 30s)\n\n4.  \nLast Thanksgiving, crammed into her friend Aisha\u2019s tiny apartment, the air filled with loud laughter instead of unspoken tension. Someone made a joke, and Mei laughed so hard she cried, a messy, uncomplicated release. No one needed her to be the strong one; they just passed her a napkin. In that circle of chosen family, surrounded by mismatched plates and genuine warmth, she felt the profound peace of simply belonging, a gift she\u2019d never known in her youth. (Recent past, ~age 40)\n\n5.  \nLast month, she helped her father sort through photos from the store. He paused at one of her mother. \u201cShe would be proud,\u201d he said, his voice thick. \u201cYou talk about the things we couldn\u2019t.\u201d He placed his hand over hers on the photo album. In that quiet gesture, decades of stoicism melted away, replaced by a shared, acknowledged grief. It was the closure she never knew she needed, a conversation held in the space her work had created in the world, and in herself. (Within the last year)"
