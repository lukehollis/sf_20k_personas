            "value": "David Lee is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-shrouded avenues. Born and raised in the Outer Richmond, his childhood was scored by the clang of the N-Judah streetcar and the aromas of his father's small Cantonese diner. His parents, immigrants who poured their life savings and relentless energy into the restaurant, had simple hopes for David: a stable job and a life easier than their own. He was a quiet, observant child who preferred watching the city from his bedroom window to excelling in the classroom. At George Washington High School, he was neither a star athlete nor a standout student, graduating with a diploma but no clear direction.\n\nFor several years, David drifted through a series of jobs\u2014stocking shelves at a grocery store, making deliveries for a catering company, and working late shifts at a boba shop. He felt a growing sense of detachment, a feeling that he was merely a ghost in his own vibrant city. The turning point came when his mother suffered a serious fall. During her week-long stay at UCSF Medical Center, David spent countless hours by her side. He watched, fascinated, not by the doctors, but by the patient transporters. He saw how they moved people with a practiced gentleness, offering a calm word or a steady hand, becoming a brief, quiet anchor in a sea of medical chaos. In their work, he saw a tangible, immediate purpose that had eluded him.\n\nSoon after, David earned his certification and secured a position as a patient transporter at the same hospital. His 0.0-mile commute is no exaggeration; he lives in the small in-law unit of his family's home, just a few blocks from the Parnassus campus. His days are a rhythm of physical exertion and quiet empathy. He navigates the hospital's labyrinthine corridors, his presence a steadying force for anxious patients.\n\nNow 31, David\u2019s life has found its focus. His social circle is small, consisting of a few old high school friends and a quiet, unspoken crush on a compassionate ER nurse. He helps his now-retired parents with groceries and household chores. His dreams are practical: he\u2019s saving to get his EMT certification, seeing it as the next logical step. For David, San Francisco isn't about tech booms or Michelin stars; it\u2019s about the familiar weight of the fog, the responsibility to his family, and the quiet dignity he finds in moving his city\u2019s most vulnerable residents, one patient at a time."
