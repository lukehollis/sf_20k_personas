Raised in a quiet suburb of Grand Rapids, Michigan, he was the son of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist. His childhood was structured and stable, built on Midwestern pragmatism. While his peers chased engineering or business degrees, David, fascinated by how groups of people organized themselves, pursued a Bachelor's in Sociology. He wasn\u2019t interested in profits or products, but in the invisible architecture of society.\n\nA post-graduation move to San Francisco was less a career move and more an escape from predictability. He landed an entry-level operations job at a struggling startup, mostly answering support tickets. It was there his unique mind found its calling. David saw not just customer complaints, but patterns of failure in the company's workflow. On his own initiative, he began creating flowcharts and proposing small, elegant fixes that dramatically reduced ticket volume. Management, impressed by his unsolicited efficiency audits, created a new role for him: Process Improvement Engineer. He had found a way to apply sociology to technology, optimizing the human systems behind the code.\n\nNow 30, David lives a life of quiet containment in his Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his full-time office. His 0.0-mile commute is a blessing and a curse. Days are a structured routine: a morning walk to a bakery on Clement Street, hours of deep focus untangling digital workflows for a major tech firm, and a midafternoon run in Golden Gate Park to clear his head. This insular existence has made deep social connections challenging; his friend group is small, and dating feels like another system to optimize, often with poor results.\n\nHis dream isn't a promotion or a larger paycheck. David aspires to apply his skills beyond corporate tech, envisioning a future where he can streamline operations for a major nonprofit or a public healthcare system. He feels a growing disconnect between his work\u2014making a slick app incrementally better\u2014and his original passion for improving human lives. David Miller, the architect of efficiency, is searching for a process to improve his own sense of purpose."
