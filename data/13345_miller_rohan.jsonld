Born in Berkeley to a Punjabi Sikh mother, a computer science professor at Cal, and a white American father, a literary historian from Ohio, Rohan\u2019s childhood was a blend of cardamom and cinnamon, of spicy daal and Sunday roast. This fusion wasn't always seamless, but it was always home, planting the seed for his life\u2019s work in his family\u2019s bustling East Bay kitchen.\n\nInitially, Rohan tried to follow a more traditional academic path, studying economics at UC Davis. He felt adrift until a transformative semester abroad in Lyon, France, where he discovered that food could be both an art form and an intellectual pursuit. He dropped out of his PhD program, a move that disappointed his parents, and enrolled in an MFA in Culinary Arts program in San Francisco. This was his true turning point. He thrived, learning to articulate his unique heritage on a plate, treating ingredients with the reverence of a painter for his pigments.\n\nHis career was a slow, grueling climb through the demanding kitchens of San Francisco. He honed his skills, absorbed techniques, and saved voraciously. The key catalyst came after his mother\u2019s death five years ago. Grief-stricken, he channeled his inheritance and his sorrow into creating a space that would honor her legacy. He opened \"Sari,\" a Hayes Valley restaurant where Northern Californian ingredients are reinterpreted through the lens of modern Punjabi cuisine.\n\nToday, Rohan\u2019s life is his restaurant. His day starts with a 1.8-mile bicycle ride to the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, his panniers filled with produce on the return trip. He lives in a small, meticulously organized flat in SoMa, a short pedal from Sari. His life partner, a graphic designer named Chloe, understands his demanding schedule. Even with an income of $165,000, the city\u2019s pressures are immense, but Rohan feels a deep connection to San Francisco\u2014a city that, like him, is a remix of cultures. His aspiration isn't expansion, but perfection: a Michelin star for Sari, the ultimate validation that the two worlds of his childhood have become a singular, celebrated art."

At the same time, his mother was at the stove, the sharp, sputtering sizzle of mustard seeds and cumin hitting hot ghee for the daal. The two aromas didn't fight; they swirled into a third, unique scent that was simply *home*. It was the first time he understood his family wasn\u2019t two separate worlds, but a single, deliciously complex one.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, wandering through Lyon\u2019s March\u00e9 Saint-Antoine, he felt a jolt of clarity that his economics textbooks never gave him. He watched a woman in a crisp apron arrange Bosc pears as if they were jewels. He breathed in the earthy scent of chanterelles mounded in a wicker basket. It was a cathedral of ingredients. In that moment, he knew food wasn\u2019t just sustenance; it was a language, a history, an art. This quiet reverence for produce became the foundation of his entire philosophy, giving him the courage to abandon his parents\u2019 path.\n\n3.\nThe last time he saw his mother lucid, she was folding a peacock-blue silk sari, the fabric whispering through her frail hands. It smelled faintly of sandalwood and her. She told him it was the one she wore on her first date with his father. After she passed, that memory became his mission. Grief was a tangible thing, and he would weave it, along with her story and that lingering scent, into a place. The restaurant, Sari, became the fabric of her legacy, a testament to her vibrant life.\n\n4.\nHe can still feel the flush of shame from that night, eight years ago, working as a line cook in a celebrated restaurant. The chef had thrown his plate of improperly seared scallops into the bin, his voice a venomous whisper in the chaotic kitchen. Rohan felt small, a fraud. But as he wiped the station down, humiliation hardened into resolve. He swore he would one day run a kitchen built on respect, not fear, where his own voice would be the only one that mattered. That failure fueled his relentless drive.\n\n5.\nIt was 3 AM, the week before Sari opened. Exhausted and terrified, he plated his first real dish: pan-seared black cod with a turmeric-fennel crust on a bed of cauliflower pur\u00e9e spiced with amchoor. He took a bite. It was all there\u2014the Californian coast, the Punjabi spice rack, the French technique, his mother\u2019s kitchen. For the first time, it didn't feel like a fusion, but a singular, whole thought. It was the taste of arrival, the quiet, personal validation that preceded any hope of a Michelin star."
