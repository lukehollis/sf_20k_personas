The daughter of Cantonese immigrants, Mei\u2019s childhood was a blend of two cultures. She spent weekdays excelling in American schools and weekends helping at her father\u2019s modest herb shop, translating for customers and absorbing ancient remedies.\n\nHer life\u2019s trajectory was irrevocably altered when her mother was diagnosed with a chronic illness. As a teenager, Mei became her mother\u2019s primary advocate and translator within the bewildering American healthcare system. She witnessed firsthand the cultural gaps, the quiet desperation of non-English speakers, and the immense emotional toll on families. This experience was a crucible, forging a deep-seated desire not just to heal, but to help others navigate their own crises. While her parents hoped for a doctor, Mei chose a different path, earning her Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nNow 43, Mei works as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker for a major hospital network, conducting her sessions entirely via telehealth from a dedicated office in her apartment. This 0.0-mile commute allows her a quiet start to the day: a walk through the morning fog in Golden Gate Park, followed by strong tea. Her days are a cascade of video calls, holding space for patients grappling with new diagnoses, grief, and the stress of caregiving. She is the calm, empathetic voice she wished her family had thirty years ago.\n\nHaving dedicated much of her life to her career and caring for her now-widowed father, Mei\u2019s social life is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and childhood friends. She lives alone in a rent-controlled apartment just blocks from where she grew up, a constant witness to the city\u2019s relentless change. Her hope for the future is to create a pro-bono support group specifically for Asian-American caregivers, a project that would bring her life\u2019s work full circle, honoring her mother\u2019s memory by building the community support she never had."
