The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, he was raised in the sprawling suburbs of Fremont. His father, an electrical engineer, and his mother, a meticulous bookkeeper, instilled in him the virtues of precision, stability, and unwavering diligence. The glittering skyline of San Francisco, visible on clear days, was not a playground but a goal\u2014the physical embodiment of the success their sacrifices were meant to build.\n\nDavid followed the script perfectly. An economics degree from UC Berkeley led to an entry-level job in a downtown investment bank's back office, just as the first dot-com bubble was bursting. While his more daring peers lost fortunes, David learned a crucial lesson: wealth isn't just made, it\u2019s managed and protected. This realization spurred him to get his MBA in Organizational Behavior, focusing on how to make complex financial systems run more efficiently and humanely. He excelled not in the high-stakes drama of trading, but in the critical, unseen world of operations. He was the one who ensured trades settled, regulations were met, and systems didn't crash.\n\nHis career became his life, a fact that contributed to the amicable, yet lonely, end of his fifteen-year marriage two years ago. The relentless pursuit of professional perfection had left little room for personal connection. Now, at 48, David is a Regional Operations Manager, overseeing teams across the West Coast from the quiet of his minimalist Hayes Valley condo. His 0.0-mile commute is a double-edged sword; the efficiency is liberating, but the isolation is palpable. His days are a disciplined rhythm of Zoom calls, data analysis, and solitary walks to coffee shops on Patricia's Green.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco has matured. He no longer sees it as just a career destination. He finds peace in solo hikes through the Presidio and enjoys quiet, extravagant dinners a few times a month at worldly restaurants. Having achieved the financial security his parents dreamed of, David now quietly aspires for something more. He\u2019s begun mentoring first-generation college students entering finance, hoping to offer the guidance he never had. His ultimate dream is to one day step away from the corporate ladder entirely and use his operational acumen to help a local arts non-profit build a sustainable future."
