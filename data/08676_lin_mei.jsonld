Born and raised in an apartment directly above her family\u2019s restaurant, \u201cGolden Peony,\u201d in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, her life has always been interwoven with the business. Her parents, immigrants who poured their life savings and soul into the restaurant, saw it as their legacy. For Mei, it was just home.\n\nAs a teenager, she longed for a life beyond the lantern-adorned block she knew so well. She was sharp and creative, dreaming of a world filled with art and design. Defying her parents' practical expectations, she enrolled in a graphic design program at San Francisco State University. For two years, she thrived, discovering a passion for visual storytelling that felt entirely her own. However, her journey was cut short when her father had a sudden health crisis. Without hesitation, Mei put her education on hold to help her aging mother run the restaurant, promising herself it was only temporary.\n\nThat was fourteen years ago. Now 36, Mei is the formidable and respected manager of Golden Peony. The \"temporary\" arrangement solidified into a permanent reality rooted in love and duty. She has skillfully navigated the restaurant into the modern era, launching a delivery service, building an Instagram following, and subtly updating menu items without sacrificing the traditional flavors her loyal customers cherish. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a flight of stairs, her days a whirlwind of managing staff, placating demanding diners, and haggling with suppliers.\n\nThough she finds deep pride in preserving her family\u2019s legacy, a quiet yearning persists. Late at night, in the silence of her apartment, she sometimes sketches logos for imaginary caf\u00e9s on a tablet, a ghost of her former dream. Her greatest hope is to one day open a second, smaller location\u2014a modern tea house in a different neighborhood like Hayes Valley\u2014that would be entirely her creation. More than that, she dreams of finding a personal relationship that exists outside the orbit of Golden Peony, a life that begins when she finally locks the restaurant doors for the night."
