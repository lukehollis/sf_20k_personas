Raised by a carpenter father and a practical mother who managed a dental office, her childhood was defined by pine-scented air and the quiet pragmatism of a small town. She was expected to go to college, get a stable job, and settle down. Simone complied, enrolling at Oregon State University to study graphic design, a field that seemed a safe compromise between her creative spirit and her parents\u2019 desire for security.\n\nAfter two years, however, she felt adrift. The coursework felt impersonal, the future it promised sterile. A spontaneous weekend trip to visit a high school friend living in San Francisco became her pivotal turning point. She was instantly captivated by the city's chaotic energy, its distinct neighborhood personalities, and the feeling that identity was something you could build for yourself. She dropped out of college, a decision that caused a rift with her family, and moved to the city with less than a thousand dollars to her name.\n\nHer career began out of necessity, taking a job as a sales associate at a stylish, independent home goods and apparel boutique in Hayes Valley. To her surprise, she thrived. Simone discovered a natural talent for visual merchandising and an intuitive understanding of what customers wanted. She was organized, personable, and tirelessly dedicated. Within three years, she moved from associate to assistant manager, and was promoted to store manager at just 24.\n\nNow 25, Simone\u2019s life is a hyper-local bubble centered around Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute consists of walking two blocks from her small, rent-controlled studio apartment to the shop. Her daily routine is a walking tour of her world: morning coffee at a local cafe, a quick chat with the baker next door, and a full day managing staff, handling inventory, and curating the store\u2019s aesthetic. Her social life is woven from the same fabric\u2014drinks with coworkers, weekend hangs in Patricia's Green, and casual dates with people she meets in the neighborhood.\n\nWhile proud of her self-made success, a quiet insecurity about her unfinished degree lingers. Her dream is to transform her practical experience into ownership. Simone aspires to open her own boutique one day, a curated space that reflects her unique style and supports local artisans\u2014a tangible anchor in the city that allowed her to create herself."
