A second-generation Korean-American, she grew up in the Outer Sunset, a world away from the city's gleaming downtown. Her parents, who ran a small dry-cleaning business on Noriega Street, instilled in her a profound sense of duty and discipline. They hoped for a stable career in medicine or law for their daughter, a tangible return on their immigrant sacrifice.\n\nThe turning point for Serena came not in a classroom, but in her own quiet living room. Her younger brother, David, struggled with severe anxiety as a teenager, retreating into a silence her parents couldn't penetrate. Serena, then in high school, started leaving sketchpads and charcoal pencils out for him. Slowly, through shared drawings of shadowed cityscapes and fantastical creatures, they built a new language without words. Seeing David express his turmoil on paper was a revelation; art wasn't just decorative, it was a vital form of communication and healing.\n\nThis experience became her North Star. She pursued a psychology degree at UC Santa Cruz, then returned to the Bay Area for her Master's in Art Therapy. Now, at 25, she works for a non-profit that partners with schools and community centers. Her days are spent on a 3.5-mile Muni ride from her Inner Richmond apartment to a clinic in the Western Addition, where she helps children navigate trauma and developmental challenges through clay, paint, and collage.\n\nSerena shares her small, plant-filled apartment with a friend from grad school. Her life is a carefully budgeted balance of fulfilling work, Sunday dinners with her parents in the Sunset, and quiet evenings spent at a local ceramics studio. She is deeply rooted in this city, not for its tech glamour, but for its neighborhood resilience. Her dream is to one day open her own community art therapy studio, a welcoming space for immigrant families like her own, proving that sometimes the most profound connections are the ones drawn, not spoken."

At ten, she would watch her mother\u2019s hands, so careful and quick, folding a stranger's shirt. There was a quiet ache in seeing their exhaustion, a weight that settled on her own small shoulders. It wasn't a burden of resentment, but of profound love\u2014a silent promise that their sacrifice would mean something, that she would find her own way to build a life worthy of their endless work.\n\n2.\nShe can still feel the hush in the living room that afternoon. She was sixteen. For weeks, the charcoal pencils sat untouched. Then, one day, she found the sketchbook open. On the page was a dragon, its scales drawn with ferocious detail, coiled tightly around a shattered cityscape. It wasn't a cry for help; it was a map of David's inner world. In that silent, shared image, she felt her brother return to her, and her own future snapped into focus with crystalline clarity.\n\n3.\nIt was over galbi-jjim at the small kitchen table in the Sunset, the air thick with her unspoken decision. She was twenty. When she finally said the words \"Art Therapy,\" she saw the flicker of confusion and disappointment in her father's eyes. It hurt, deeply. But as she spoke about David's dragon, her voice didn't waver. It was the first time she had defended her own dream to them, translating her sense of duty into a language of healing they might one day understand.\n\n4.\nLast fall, at the clinic, a seven-year-old girl who hadn't spoken in weeks was working with grey clay. Serena sat with her in silence, just as she had with David. Suddenly, the girl pushed a small, lopsided clay bird into her hand. She then looked Serena in the eye and whispered one word: \"Fly.\" In that moment, the entire Muni ride, the tight budget, the parental worries\u2014it all dissolved into a profound, shimmering sense of purpose. Her choice was not just right; it was necessary.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy Tuesday night, her hands slick with slip at the ceramics studio, the city feels miles away. As she centers the clay on the wheel, she feels her own anxieties quiet. The gentle, repetitive motion is a meditation. In the shape emerging beneath her fingers\u2014a bowl, simple and sturdy\u2014she sees the future. She pictures a space just like this, filled with the hum of Korean and Spanish, welcoming families like her own. It\u2019s here, covered in clay, that her quietest dreams feel most solid."
