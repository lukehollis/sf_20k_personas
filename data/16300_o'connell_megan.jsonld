Raised in a quiet suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, she was the daughter of a pragmatic auto-mechanic father and a creative librarian mother. Her childhood was spent between the grease-stained order of her father\u2019s garage, where she learned the logic of how things work, and the endless worlds within her mother\u2019s books, which taught her the power of form and story. This duality became the foundation of her worldview: that the most beautiful objects are those that function flawlessly.\n\nShe channeled this passion into a degree from the University of Cincinnati's prestigious College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning (DAAP). After graduating, she cut her teeth at a product firm in Chicago before a senior designer role at a sustainable home goods manufacturer lured her to San Francisco eight years ago. The move was a personal and professional catalyst.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with the sudden passing of her father. Sifting through his meticulously organized tools, each one worn from decades of use, she felt a profound rejection of the throwaway culture her industry often promoted. This loss solidified her commitment to designing products with integrity, durability, and a tangible sense of purpose\u2014things he would have respected.\n\nToday, Megan lives in a vibrant, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. Her 3.5-mile bicycle commute to her SoMa office is a non-negotiable daily ritual, a moving meditation through the city\u2019s arteries. Recently out of a long-term relationship, she has reinvested her energy into her close circle of friends and her community, volunteering on weekends at a local youth maker-space. While she excels in her corporate role, her true aspiration is to launch her own small design studio focused on creating heirloom-quality, ethically sourced goods. For Megan, San Francisco isn't just a place to live; it\u2019s the workshop where she is carefully crafting a meaningful life, piece by piece."

Five years ago, standing in his silent Ohio garage, the air still smelled of oil and metal. Tracing the worn grip, she felt the ghost of his knuckles, the decades of purpose. In that moment, the slick, disposable products she designed felt like a betrayal. A profound clarity cut through her grief, setting a new, unshakeable foundation for her work: to create things worthy of his hands. This became her true north.\n\n2.\nIt was a Tuesday, two months after she\u2019d moved to San Francisco eight years ago. Cresting the Potrero Hill incline on her bike, the whole downtown skyline suddenly unfurled before her, sharp and gleaming in the morning sun. For the first time, she felt the city not as a place, but as a complex, breathing machine. The traffic, the buildings, the people\u2014all interlocking parts. A jolt of pure belonging shot through her. This was not just a commute; it was a pilgrimage.\n\n3.\nJust last fall, at the youth maker-space, a quiet teenager was struggling to join two pieces of wood. Megan knelt, showing her how to brace the joint, a simple trick her dad had taught her. She saw the flash of understanding in the girl\u2019s eyes\u2014the same logic that had thrilled her as a child. A different kind of pride, warmer and more vital than any corporate praise, bloomed in her chest. It was the first time she truly felt the blueprint for her own studio.\n\n4.\nThe relationship ended not with a bang, but with the quiet sound of packing tape. A few months ago, she and her ex spent a Saturday morning dividing their books, a final, respectful disassembly of their shared life. There was no anger, only a clean, melancholic sense of order. Handing him a ceramic bowl they\u2019d bought together, she realized some beautiful things are just not built to last forever. The acceptance of this truth, without blame, felt like a form of personal integrity.\n\n5.\nThere was a night last summer, huddled on her friend\u2019s Mission rooftop with a cheap bottle of red wine. The fog was rolling in, muffling the city\u2019s sounds into a gentle hum. Below, the vibrant chaos of Clarion Alley was muted to a soft tapestry of color. Surrounded by the easy laughter of her chosen family, she felt a profound sense of peace. This, she realized, was the life she was carefully building\u2014not just of objects, but of moments, anchored and true."
