Born in Seoul, she was adopted as an infant by a loving, working-class Irish-American couple in the Sunset District. Her father, a proud union longshoreman, and her mother, a public-school teacher, instilled in her a profound sense of civic duty and community. Growing up surrounded by the city's diverse cultures and persistent social challenges, Naomi felt a calling not to escape the system, but to improve it from within.\n\nThis conviction led her to San Francisco State University, where she earned a degree in Public Administration. She immediately joined the Human Services Agency, starting as a caseworker. Over three decades, her sharp mind and unwavering empathy saw her rise through the ranks. Now, as a Program Manager, she oversees initiatives aimed at housing security and family support, navigating the complex bureaucracy with a patience forged by years of dedication.\n\nA key turning point was her divorce in her early forties. The quiet dissolution of her fifteen-year marriage was a difficult but clarifying event. It forced her to rebuild her social life, strengthening bonds with a tight-knit circle of colleagues and friends. She channeled her energy into her career, finding stability and purpose in her work when her personal life felt adrift.\n\nToday, Naomi lives in a modest but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is a familiar city rhythm: the 38 Geary bus ride downtown, poring over budgets and reports, and mentoring younger staff. Evenings are for walks in Golden Gate Park or exploring the markets on Clement Street. Her connection to San Francisco is not one of glamour, but of deep, functional intimacy\u2014she knows its bus lines better than its landmarks.\n\nLooking ahead, Naomi isn't dreaming of retirement but of legacy. She hopes to see the programs she\u2019s nurtured become self-sustaining pillars of the community. Privately, she harbors a quiet dream of traveling to Seoul, not to find her past, but simply to see the place where her story began, finally connecting the two halves of her identity."

She watched her dad, his voice joining a chorus of longshoremen, a unified roar demanding fairness. Looking at the sea of determined faces\u2014Irish, Chinese, Filipino\u2014she didn\u2019t feel small, but part of something immense and powerful. That day, she learned that community was a verb, an action you take to protect your own. It was a lesson that became her life\u2019s foundation.\n\n2.\nThe eviction notice felt cold in her hands, a stark contrast to the humid air in the Tenderloin SRO. She was a new caseworker in her twenties, full of textbook solutions. But facing the single mother\u2019s quiet dignity as she packed her child\u2019s few toys, Naomi felt a profound sense of failure. It wasn't just losing a case; it was the system\u2019s gears grinding a family into dust. The heartbreak sharpened into a cold resolve: she wouldn\u2019t just work within the system, she would learn to command it.\n\n3.\nAfter the divorce papers were signed, her first night alone in the Inner Richmond apartment was deafeningly quiet. For fifteen years, her life had been a duet. Now, there was only the hiss of the 38 Geary\u2019s brakes outside her window. Staring at the empty walls in her early forties, she felt a terrifying wave of solitude. But as the night wore on, it settled not into despair, but into a quiet, clarifying space. She was her own foundation now. This was not an ending, but a complete, untethered beginning.\n\n4.\nA young analyst sat across from her desk, his face a mask of frustration over a failed grant proposal. Naomi, now in her fifties, recognized the look instantly. Instead of citing policy, she shared a story of her own most devastating career failure from decades ago. She watched the tension ease from his shoulders, replaced by a flicker of understanding. In that moment of mentorship, her focus shifted. Her legacy wouldn't just be the programs she built, but the resilience she nurtured in those who would one day lead them.\n\n5.\nJust last week, walking down Clement Street, she saw an elderly Korean woman gently guide her granddaughter\u2019s hand to pick the best persimmon. Naomi paused, the scent of kimchi and star anise in the air. For a fleeting moment, she wondered about another woman, in another city, four decades ago. There was no ache of loss, but a quiet, persistent curiosity. The abstract dream of visiting Seoul suddenly felt tangible\u2014not as a search for roots, but as a simple, human need to stand at her own beginning."
