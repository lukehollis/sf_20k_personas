Raised in the Outer Richmond, her childhood was defined by the scent of her parents' small grocery store and the expectation to work twice as hard for half the recognition. They were immigrants who equated success with stability\u2014a doctor, a lawyer. Sarah, however, was drawn to the art of connection, graduating from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor\u2019s in Communications, a practical degree she hoped would bridge her world with her parents'.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was indirect. She started in marketing for a small firm, but her innate ability to organize chaotic timelines and translate engineering jargon for clients quickly made her indispensable. She transitioned to a junior project manager role at a startup, thriving in the structured chaos. Over the next decade, she climbed the ladder, becoming a sought-after senior project manager known for her calm demeanor and flawless execution.\n\nThe true turning point in Sarah\u2019s life wasn\u2019t a promotion, but the global shift to remote work. The daily, soul-crushing commute from her Noe Valley apartment to a sterile SoMa office vanished overnight. That reclaimed time was a revelation. Her 0.0-mile commute became a non-negotiable part of her identity.\n\nNow at 39, her days have a gentle rhythm. Mornings begin not with a crowded MUNI bus but a walk to a local cafe on 24th Street, coffee in hand as she plans her day. Her apartment, once just a place to sleep, is now her sanctuary and command center, filled with plants and light. Work is a series of focused calls and strategic planning, managing teams across time zones from her quiet corner of the city. Evenings are for herself: a yoga class, cooking elaborate meals she never had time for before, or meeting her tight-knit group of friends for dinner.\n\nWhile content, Sarah dreams of more. She yearns to take a six-month sabbatical to travel through Southeast Asia, to connect with her heritage on her own terms. She is quietly confident in her career but hopes to find a partnership that values quiet evenings as much as ambitious goals. Sarah Wong has seen San Francisco from the inside out\u2014from a family counter in the Richmond to the epicenter of its tech boom\u2014and has finally carved out a piece of it that feels entirely her own."
