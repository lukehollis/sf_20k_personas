She grew up in a quiet suburb of Chicago, the only child of pragmatic Punjabi immigrants. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a high school math teacher, instilled in her a formidable work ethic and a deep respect for education. While they envisioned a stable career in medicine or law for their daughter, a childhood trip to the Art Institute of Chicago ignited in Zoya a fascination not with the art itself, but with the stories told around it\u2014the careful placement, the illuminating wall text, the silent dialogue between object and observer.\n\nThis passion led her to defy expectations, first pursuing Art History as an undergraduate and then moving across the country to attend the University of San Francisco for her graduate degree in Museum Studies. San Francisco was a shock and a revelation. The city\u2019s vibrant, chaotic energy was the antithesis of her orderly suburban upbringing, and she fell in love with it immediately. After graduating, she endured the requisite unpaid internships and contract work before landing a junior role at the prestigious Asian Art Museum\u2014a place that felt like coming home in more ways than one.\n\nHer turning point came three years ago when she was given the lead on a small but complex exhibition of contemporary diaspora artists. The project demanded long nights and meticulous research, but seeing it come to life, watching visitors connect with the stories she had helped shape, solidified her purpose. Now, as a Curatorial Manager, she orchestrates the complex dance between curators, conservators, and designers.\n\nZoya lives in a rent-stabilized one-bedroom in the Mission, a neighborhood whose vibrant murals and culinary diversity continually inspire her. Her daily routine begins with a 3.5-mile MUNI ride, her headphones filled with art history podcasts. Evenings are for yoga, exploring new restaurants with her tight-knit group of fellow arts professionals, or navigating the often-baffling San Francisco dating scene. Her ambition is clear: to one day become a Chief Curator, shaping the narrative of a major institution. More quietly, she hopes to find a partner who understands that a life\u2019s meaning can be found in the careful preservation and passionate sharing of beautiful things."

The words gave the canvas a history, a secret life. In that hushed moment, a profound understanding bloomed: the story *around* the object was its own form of art. It was the first time she felt a calling, a secret purpose that was entirely her own, separate from the stable future her parents imagined for her.\n\n2.\nFreshman year, from her sterile dorm room, she made the call. \"I'm declaring my major... Art History.\" The silence on the line was heavy with her father\u2019s disappointment and her mother\u2019s concern. \"What will you do with that?\" her father finally asked. Her heart pounded, but her own voice was steady. It was the first time she had actively chosen her passion over their pragmatism. The conversation was painful, but it cemented her resolve. Her life, she realized with a terrifying thrill, was hers to curate.\n\n3.\nHer first week in San Francisco for grad school, the 14 Mission bus was a glorious assault on her suburban senses. The scent of pupusas and exhaust, the competing rhythms of cumbia and hip-hop, the vibrant murals flashing by\u2014it was an overload of life. Pressed between strangers, Zoya felt not lost, but found. Her ordered, predictable world had cracked open, and in the dazzling chaos, she felt an exhilarating sense of freedom. This, she knew, was a place where she could finally build her own version of home.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, on the opening night of the diaspora exhibition, she stood invisibly in a corner. She watched a young woman weep silently before a photograph she\u2019d spent weeks researching. The artist was miles away, the subject a generation removed, but the connection was electric, real. It was no longer academic. This raw, human bridge\u2014built with wall text, lighting, and placement\u2014was everything. That night, her work ethic, inherited from her parents, finally fused with her passion. It was the moment her \"job\" became her \"vocation.\"\n\n5.\nLast year, on a clumsy date at a wine bar, the man asked what she did. She explained her work with a fragile textile, the thrill of its preservation. He nodded politely before saying, \"So you just put old things in glass boxes?\" The question wasn\u2019t malicious, just uncomprehending. Walking home alone through the foggy Mission streets, she wasn\u2019t sad, but strangely clarified. Her life\u2019s meaning was in that careful act of sharing. She knew, with quiet certainty, that she was waiting for someone who saw the story, not the glass."
