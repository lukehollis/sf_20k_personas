Born in Daly City to Indo-Fijian immigrants, his childhood was steeped in the values of resilience and practicality. His parents, who fled Fiji's political instability in the 1980s, built a new life from scratch\u2014his father as a mechanic, his mother at a sewing factory. They instilled in David a deep respect for tangible work and the logic of a well-run system. This led him not to Silicon Valley\u2019s code, but to the physical world of processes and efficiency, culminating in a Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering from San Jose State.\n\nHis career was a steady, deliberate climb. He started on the factory floor, learning the flow of materials and human labor firsthand. Over two decades, he rose through the ranks to become a Senior Operations Manager for a high-end sustainable furniture manufacturer in the Dogpatch neighborhood. He is the quiet engine of the company, the one who ensures that elegant designs become physical realities without waste or delay.\n\nThe key turning point in his life wasn't a promotion, but a breakup. At 38, his long-term partner left, calling his life \"a perfectly optimized but joyless spreadsheet.\" The criticism stung because it held a kernel of truth. This catalyzed a quiet rebellion against his own nature. He deliberately began to seek out life\u2019s beautiful inefficiencies. He started taking pottery classes in the Mission, finding a strange peace in the imprecise, messy creation of a simple bowl.\n\nToday, David lives in a tidy Potrero Hill apartment with views of the industrial waterfront. His routine is still structured\u2014a morning run along the bay, followed by the T-Third Muni line to his Dogpatch office. His social circle is small but loyal, revolving around a weekly trivia night at a local brewery. He remains a man who finds beauty in a flawless supply chain, but he's learning to find it elsewhere, too. His secret aspiration isn't to become a CEO, but to one day use his logistical skills for a non-profit, optimizing food bank distribution or disaster relief. He hopes to build a life that is not just efficient, but meaningful."

His dad had an engine block disassembled, the parts laid out on a tarp in a precise order David found beautiful. He watched his father\u2019s steady hands clean a piston, explaining its function. It wasn't about the car; it was the logic. In that moment, watching the complex puzzle become simple, David understood that the world wasn't chaos. It was a system that, with care and knowledge, could be understood and made to work right.\n\n2.\nAt 24, on his first job, he watched the factory\u2019s packing line for a week. He saw two wasted steps in every cycle, a half-second of hesitation as workers reached for tape. He drafted a simple proposal to move the dispenser eighteen inches. His manager was skeptical, then amazed. Seeing the line flow smoothly for the first time gave David a quiet, electric hum of satisfaction. It wasn\u2019t about power; it was about harmony. He realized his way of seeing the world could create tangible, elegant order from hidden friction.\n\n3.\nThe silence in his Potrero Hill apartment after she left was absolute. Her final words, \"a perfectly optimized but joyless spreadsheet,\" echoed off the impeccably clean surfaces. He looked at his organized bookshelf, his labeled pantry, his life scheduled to the minute. For the first time, he saw it through her eyes. The efficiency he\u2019d cultivated as a virtue suddenly felt like a sterile cage. The realization didn't come with tears, but with a cold, hollow ache\u2014a system failure in his own soul that he had no process to fix.\n\n4.\nHis hands, usually so steady with calipers and plans, felt clumsy covered in wet clay. In the Mission pottery studio, there were no schematics. He was trying to make a simple bowl, and it kept collapsing. Then, one evening, a lopsided, wonderfully imperfect form held. He stared at the thumbprint forever fired into its side. It was a flaw, a mark of inefficient humanity. Running his finger over it, he felt not frustration, but a profound and unexpected peace. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever made.\n\n5.\nHe was watching the news, a report on supply chain chaos following a hurricane. He saw pallets of water sitting on a tarmac while people in shelters were desperate. His mind, unbidden, started moving pieces. He sketched a flow chart on a napkin, rerouting trucks, optimizing volunteer schedules. It wasn't a work exercise. A jolt went through him, clear and bright. All his years of optimizing for profit felt like practice. This\u2014using his skills to stop suffering\u2014was the real work. It was the moment a vague hope became a necessary future."
