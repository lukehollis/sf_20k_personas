His commute is a seven-minute walk from his subsidized studio apartment to the cleanroom assembly line. Born in a bustling Guangdong province, Wei was brought to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown at age five. His parents, speaking little English, poured their lives into a laundromat, their hopes pressed into the clean folds of other people's clothes. They envisioned him becoming an engineer or a doctor, a familiar immigrant dream.\n\nWei was a dutiful son, bright but more practical than ambitious. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, aiming to transfer to SF State. However, his father\u2019s sudden illness during his second year changed everything. The dream of a four-year degree dissolved into the immediate need for a stable income. Wei pivoted, completing an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. This practical qualification landed him his current job as an Assembly Line Technician, calibrating the sophisticated machinery that sequences DNA. The position provided security, benefits, and, most importantly, the on-site housing that drastically cut his living expenses.\n\nAt 39, Wei\u2019s life moves with the precision of the machines he maintains. His weekdays are a quiet routine of work, meals in the campus cafeteria, and solitary evenings. He is respected by colleagues but has few close friends, the transient nature of tech work keeping relationships at a professional distance. His deepest connection remains with his widowed mother. Every Saturday, he takes the bus to Chinatown, the familiar cacophony a stark contrast to his silent weekday world. They share dim sum, and he helps with her errands, the weight of his unfulfilled parental expectations now a quiet, comfortable understanding.\n\nWei\u2019s private hope is small but fiercely held. In his apartment, he builds intricate kinetic sculptures from discarded electronic components\u2014a secret art form born from the scraps of his profession. He dreams of one day saving enough to rent a small workshop in the Dogpatch, a space where his name is on the door, not just on an employee badge. It\u2019s not a dream of wealth, but of creation\u2014a desire to assemble something that is entirely his own."
