The daughter of a pragmatic Iranian structural engineer and a free-spirited American ceramicist, her world was neatly divided between two workshops. In her father\u2019s garage, she learned the logic of load-bearing joints and the precise language of blueprints. In her mother\u2019s backyard studio, she learned how form follows feeling, her hands shaping unruly earth into something beautiful. This duality\u2014the technical and the artistic\u2014became the core of her identity, a creative tension that propelled her forward.\n\nInitially drawn to the conceptual side of design, Zoya pursued her undergraduate degree in Industrial Design at CCA. However, a pivotal internship at a high-end furniture company changed her trajectory. While her peers obsessed over digital renderings, Zoya found herself mesmerized by the workshop, spending hours with the fabricators. She discovered her true passion wasn\u2019t just in designing the object, but in mastering the materials and processes that brought it to life. This revelation led her to a specialized graduate program, focusing on materials science and sustainable fabrication, where she fell in love with the challenge of making beautiful things responsibly.\n\nNow, Zoya lives in a cozy converted warehouse apartment in the Dogpatch, a neighborhood whose industrial past and creative present perfectly mirror her own interests. Her 2.8-mile bike commute to a SoMa manufacturing lab is a cherished daily ritual, a foggy, windswept meditation before a day spent wrestling with 3D printers and CNC machines. As a Materials & Fabrication Specialist, she is the crucial link between concept and reality, her hands a tactile library of polymers, composites, and reclaimed woods. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow designers, engineers, and climbers, often found debating the merits of a new recycled filament over craft beer or mapping out a weekend trip to Pinnacles.\n\nZoya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tangible and deeply felt in the city\u2019s culture of innovation and reinvention. Her dream is to eventually launch her own small-batch design and fabrication studio, creating bespoke objects from locally sourced, sustainable materials. She envisions a space much like her childhood home: one part precision workshop, one part art studio, a place where practicality and poetry are forged into one."

Her father had pointed out the weak lap joints with a sigh, then wordlessly showed her how to reinforce them with hidden dowels. Her mother, ignoring the crooked shelves, ran a hand over the rough-sawn pine and praised its \u201chonest character.\u201d In that moment, holding a tool in one hand and feeling the grain with the other, Zoya felt a new kind of wholeness. It wasn\u2019t art versus engineering; it was two languages describing the same beautiful object.\n\n2.\nDuring her CCA internship, Zoya stayed late one night, long after the designers had gone. In the workshop, a fabricator named Luiz was wrestling a piece of white oak into a steam bender. The air was thick with the smell of hot, wet wood. There were no clicks, no renders, just the hiss of steam and the focused silence of a master\u2019s hands. Watching him, Zoya felt a pull so strong it was physical. She knew then that her future wasn\u2019t on a screen; it was here, in the sawdust and the heat.\n\n3.\nHer first autumn in Dogpatch, she biked to work in a dense morning fog. The silhouettes of the Pier 70 cranes were like slumbering dinosaurs against a grey sky. The cold mist dampened her face and jacket, and the world was muted to the sound of her tires on wet pavement and the distant clang of the shipyard. Instead of feeling small, she felt perfectly placed\u2014a moving part within a grand, industrial machine she was just beginning to understand. San Francisco finally felt less like a city and more like home.\n\n4.\nThe lead engineer called the new biopolymer composite \u201ca brittle nightmare.\u201d Three prototypes had cracked in the 3D printer. As the team debated abandoning it, Zoya remembered a paper on hydro-viscosity from grad school. On the fourth try, she manually adjusted the binder\u2019s flow rate and temperature mid-print, a delicate dance of intuition and data. Hearing the quiet hum of a successful print completing felt like a thunderous victory. It was the moment her niche expertise became her indispensable strength, solidifying her role as the lab\u2019s material whisperer.\n\n5.\nClinging to a volcanic rock face at Pinnacles, her fingers searched for a hold in the rough breccia. Her climbing partner, an architect, yelled encouragement from below. As she mapped her route, she felt a profound sense of connection. This was fabrication in its rawest form: reading a material\u2019s history, testing its integrity, and trusting its structure to hold her weight. The problem-solving was the same, whether with stone or recycled filament. In that sun-warmed moment, her work, her friendships, and her passions all fused into one exhilarating ascent."
