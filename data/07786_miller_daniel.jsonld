Born in Sacramento to a Korean immigrant mother and a white American father, he grew up navigating the space between two cultures. His mother, a pragmatic nurse, valued stability and education, while his father, a mechanic, taught him the satisfying logic of taking things apart to see how they worked. Daniel was a creative kid, more interested in sketching and art history than code. He enrolled in community college, aiming for a degree in graphic design, a path that felt like a perfect blend of his parents\u2019 influences: art and function.\n\nHis trajectory shifted abruptly at nineteen when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. Daniel dropped out of college to get a full-time job and help with bills, landing an entry-level help desk position. He discovered a surprising aptitude for the work; troubleshooting software glitches and hardware failures scratched the same problem-solving itch as fixing an engine. What began as a necessity evolved into a career. He earned certifications on his own time, and a decade ago, a lucrative offer from a major San Francisco tech firm brought him to the city.\n\nNow 42, Daniel lives and works in the same one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are defined by the glow of his monitors. His routine is methodical: coffee, log in, solve a river of support tickets, and a midday walk through the fog to clear his head. His social life, once anchored by a long-term girlfriend who grew tired of his quiet homebodiness, has become smaller, mostly revolving around a weekly online gaming session with old friends.\n\nLately, Daniel feels a pull toward the life he left behind. He\u2019s started carrying a camera on his walks, capturing the unique light filtering through the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. His hope is not to quit his stable IT job, but to find a way to integrate his lost creative self back into his life. He dreams of one day having a small gallery show\u2014a tangible result of his own vision, not just a series of closed support tickets on a screen. He remains a fixer, but now he\u2019s trying to fix the part of himself he long thought was broken."
