Her father, a retired Muni driver, and her mother, a bookkeeper, instilled in her a deep appreciation for public service and the city's intricate infrastructure. Summers were spent exploring different neighborhoods via bus lines, fostering her fascination with how people moved through the city.\n\nHer academic path led her to San Francisco State University, where she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning. During this time, she interned with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), solidifying her passion for improving the city's transit systems. Upon graduation, she secured a position as a project coordinator, a role where she thrives on the challenge of navigating complex projects and diverse stakeholders.\n\nA key turning point came after a particularly frustrating public meeting about a proposed bike lane project. The heated arguments ignited in her a stronger resolve to bridge the gap between transit professionals and the community. This experience fuels her current work, where she actively seeks community input and strives for transparent communication.\n\nSofia's personal life is grounded in close relationships. She still has Sunday dinners with her parents and a tight-knit circle of college friends who share her love for exploring new hiking trails and finding hidden gem restaurants in the city. She is currently single but open to finding a partner who shares her values and love for San Francisco.\n\nHer current lifestyle is centered around her work and her connection to the city. Her daily commute on Muni isn't just a means to an end; it's an opportunity to observe and connect with the diverse tapestry of San Franciscans. After work, she often takes walks through her neighborhood, enjoying the familiar streets and small businesses.\n\nSofia's future aspirations are intertwined with her professional goals. She dreams of leading impactful projects that significantly improve the lives of transit riders and contribute to a more sustainable San Francisco. Ultimately, she hopes to make a lasting positive mark on the city she calls home, a city that has always been a part of her story."

The rumbling bus an extension of her own growing autonomy, a tiny adventurer navigating a city suddenly much larger.\n\n2. Graduating from SF State, walking across that stage, felt less like an end and more like a validation of her path, a promise she'd made to the city and to herself that she\u2019d contribute to its intricate workings. A tangible sign her love for infrastructure could become her life.\n\n3. That heated community meeting about the bike lane, the raw frustration in people\u2019s voices, was a sharp jab to the gut. It solidified her purpose, not just to build projects, but to truly listen, to build bridges between policy and people.\n\n4. A quiet Sunday dinner at her parents' in West Portal, the familiar aroma of her mom\u2019s cooking filling the air. These moments, simple and consistent, are her anchor, reminding her of where she came from and grounding her aspirations in her roots.\n\n5. Discovering a hidden view of the city from a new hiking trail near Twin Peaks with her friends, the golden light catching the Salesforce Tower and the fog rolling in. It sparked a simple joy and a renewed appreciation for the city's unexpected beauty, a reminder of why she fights for it."
