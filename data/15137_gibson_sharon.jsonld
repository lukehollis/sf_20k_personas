Born in the Richmond District to Cantonese immigrants, she grew up in the back of her family\u2019s small laundromat. Her parents, who worked relentlessly, envisioned a future for their daughter in a stable, high-paying profession like medicine. But Sharon was drawn to the people on the margins\u2014the elderly neighbors who struggled with English, the kids who had nowhere to go after school. This deep-seated empathy led her to SF State, where she pursued a Bachelor's in Social Work, a choice that quietly disappointed her parents but set the course for her life.\n\nHer early career was spent in the trenches as a caseworker, navigating the city\u2019s complex bureaucracy to secure housing and aid for vulnerable families. It was during this time she met Mark Gibson, a kind, dedicated public defender who shared her passion for social justice. They married and settled into a rent-controlled apartment in Noe Valley, building a life centered on shared values, community potlucks, and long walks through the city.\n\nThe major turning point in Sharon\u2019s life was Mark\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack twelve years ago. The loss was profound, but instead of retreating, Sharon poured her energy into her work with renewed focus. She climbed the ranks through sheer competence and dedication, eventually becoming the Program Director for a non-profit serving at-risk youth.\n\nNow at 53, Sharon\u2019s life has a quiet, purposeful rhythm. She still lives in the same Noe Valley apartment, its walls filled with photos of Mark and art from local street fairs. Her 2.5-mile commute on the J-Church MUNI line is a daily ritual, a time to observe the city she has spent her life serving. Her days are long, filled with managing budgets, mentoring staff, and fighting for funding. Her six-figure salary provides stability, but her wealth is measured in the lives she impacts. Her dream isn\u2019t retirement, but to launch a sustainable mentorship program that will continue long after she\u2019s gone, a lasting legacy in the city that is both her home and her life's work."

Mrs. Wei, a neighbor from two floors up, was crying softly over an official-looking letter she couldn\u2019t read. While her parents worked, Sharon sat with her at a folding table, painstakingly translating the complex housing assistance form. The wave of relief and gratitude on the old woman\u2019s face was a revelation. In that small moment of service, she felt a profound sense of purpose that a perfect report card had never given her. It quietly set her against her parents' ambitions.\n\n2.\nIn her late twenties, after a soul-crushing day trying to find shelter for a family, she met Mark for cheap pho. He had just lost a case for a client he believed in. They were both drained, the city\u2019s indifference a heavy weight. He didn\u2019t offer platitudes. He just looked at her across the table and said, \u201cWe show up again tomorrow.\u201d In his exhausted eyes, she saw not just a shared passion for justice, but a partner for the long, hard fight. That quiet promise of mutual resilience was when she fell in love.\n\n3.\nThe day after Mark\u2019s funeral, she forced herself onto the J-Church MUNI. As it crested the hill by Dolores Park, the city sprawled below, indifferent and beautiful. People were laughing, playing with their dogs, living. The utter normalcy felt like a personal insult, a deep, hollow ache in her chest. That agonizing ride forged her grief into fuel. If the world kept moving, she had to move with it\u2014not by forgetting him, but by working twice as hard in his memory for the city they both loved.\n\n4.\nAbout eight years ago, she was leaving work when a young man stopped her. She recognized him as a volatile teenager she had placed in a residential program a decade prior. He was now a poised construction foreman, holding out his phone to show her a picture of his wife and daughter. \u201cYou were the only person who saw something in me,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion. That single encounter solidified her ambition to lead, shifting her focus from individual cases to building an organization that could create hundreds of such outcomes.\n\n5.\nJust last fall, she watched a quiet 16-year-old in her program patiently help a new arrival, a frantic 12-year-old, navigate the city\u2019s bus schedule online. In the older girl's focused competence and the younger boy's growing confidence, Sharon saw the future. The abstract idea of a mentorship program ceased to be a retirement dream and became an urgent, tangible mission. It was no longer about her legacy, but about empowering the city's youth to begin saving each other, long after she was gone."
