Raised in Daly City, just south of San Francisco, she is the daughter of a pragmatic Filipina nurse and a creative architect father. Her childhood was a blend of two worlds: the structured, hardworking immigrant ethos of her mother and the freewheeling, artistic sensibility of her father, who would often take her across the city line to wander through the de Young Museum or catch street performances in the Mission. These trips ignited her love for the arts, leading her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s in Arts Administration at San Francisco State University.\n\nHer dream was to curate exhibits for a small, scrappy gallery, championing emerging local artists. However, graduation presented a harsh reality. The arts-related jobs were few, fiercely competitive, and paid little\u2014not enough to sustain a life in the city she called home. A key turning point came when she declined a low-paying internship at a beloved community arts center for a stable, full-time position as a Grants Coordinator at a large biomedical research foundation downtown. It felt like a compromise, translating her passion for art into the meticulous spreadsheets and formal proposals of scientific funding.\n\nNow 26, Maya lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine is defined by the city's rhythms: a foggy morning walk to the 38-Geary bus stop, the 3.8-mile commute to her sterile office, and evenings spent unwinding with college friends or tending to her growing collection of houseplants. Weekends are for reconnecting with her original passion\u2014visiting galleries in the Dogpatch, taking long walks through Golden Gate Park, and sketching strangers at cafes.\n\nShe feels a quiet dissonance between the life she leads and the one she envisioned. Yet, Maya is not adrift. She sees her current role as an extended, well-paid apprenticeship. She is mastering the language of funding and philanthropy from the inside. Her ultimate dream is to one day leverage this corporate expertise to launch her own arts foundation, one that can provide the stable, meaningful grants to artists that she herself couldn't find. For now, she lives a divided but purposeful life, building a practical foundation for a future firmly rooted in art."

Her dad whispered, \u201cSee? Art doesn't need walls.\u201d The smell of sizzling bacon-wrapped hot dogs mixed with the afternoon sun. That memory became her north star: the belief that powerful art belongs to the streets, not just sterile rooms. It\u2019s why she dreams of funding public, accessible projects.\n\n2.\nAt 22, she sat on the floor of her Sunset District apartment, staring at two draft emails. One was a joyful \"yes\" to the scrappy arts internship. The other, a formal acceptance to the foundation. She pictured her mom\u2019s tired but relieved smile. With a deep, hollow breath, she deleted the first email and sent the second. It felt less like a choice and more like a quiet surrender, the day she learned to build a foundation before trying to build a gallery.\n\n3.\nShe was 24, lost in a budget spreadsheet, when she looked out her downtown office window. The fog wasn\u2019t just fog; it was a slow, deliberate erasure of the city, swallowing buildings in soft, grey gradients. It was a perfect, living watercolor. The beauty felt stolen, a secret she held against the sterile hum of the fluorescent lights. The moment was a quiet promise to herself: she would find her way back to a world where she could talk about gradients without a spreadsheet in sight.\n\n4.\nSix months ago, in a drafty Dogpatch gallery, she saw it: sculptures made from discarded Muni seats. They were raw, witty, and so deeply San Franciscan. She felt a jolt, not of envy, but of purpose. This was it. This was the kind of artist her future foundation had to exist for\u2014the ones telling the city\u2019s story with its own forgotten parts. Her weekend gallery crawls stopped being an escape and became homework for a future she was determined to build.\n\n5.\nJust last month in her Inner Richmond apartment, she noticed it\u2014a single, perfect, lime-green leaf unfurling on her temperamental fiddle-leaf fig. She\u2019d almost given up on the plant. Seeing that new growth felt like a quiet, personal triumph. It was proof that with patience and steady care, even in a small, contained space, life finds a way to push forward. The leaf was a small promise that her own constrained growth was still progress, slow and deliberate."
