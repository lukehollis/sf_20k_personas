Daniel, eager to please, enrolled at San Francisco State University and dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration. He followed the script perfectly, even landing a prestigious summer internship at a FiDi investment firm the year before he graduated.\n\nThat internship became the decisive turning point of his life. The sterile environment, the impersonal spreadsheets, and the relentless focus on profit felt profoundly empty. One afternoon, while tasked with finding \"workforce efficiencies\" (a euphemism for layoffs), he had an epiphany. He didn\u2019t want to subtract from people's lives; he wanted to add to them. He finished the internship, graduated, and to his family\u2019s deep disappointment, never applied for a corporate job.\n\nAdrift, Daniel began volunteering at a community center in the Inner Richmond. It was there, helping with an after-school program, that he discovered his calling. He was patient with the chaos, a natural storyteller, and found immense joy in the unfiltered honesty of children. He soon found a job as a teacher's assistant at a small, play-based preschool in the neighborhood.\n\nNow 31, Daniel\u2019s life is a testament to his pivot. He lives in a small apartment directly above the preschool, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. His days are a whirlwind of finger painting, mediating disputes over building blocks, reading stories, and wiping away tears. His world is small, contained within the blocks around his home and workplace. He knows the baristas at the local coffee shop by name and spends weekends hiking in Golden Gate Park or reading at Baker Beach. His social circle consists of fellow teachers and a few old college friends who admire his courage to walk away from a more lucrative life.\n\nDaniel\u2019s dream is no longer a corner office but a classroom of his own. He is slowly taking night classes to earn his full teaching credential. He hopes to one day run his own small preschool, a place focused on kindness and curiosity. For Daniel, true wealth isn't found in a stock portfolio, but in a four-year-old mastering the alphabet or a shy child finally making a friend."
