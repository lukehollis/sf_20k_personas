            "value": "Mei Lin Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-damp streets and the unyielding work ethic of her immigrant parents. Born and raised in the Sunset District, her childhood was a quiet rhythm of school and helping out at her family's small herbal medicine shop. From a young age, she learned the importance of duty and care, watching her father painstakingly measure herbs for his customers. Her parents, practical and focused on stability, envisioned a secure future for her, free from the uncertainties they had faced.\n\nThe turning point in Mei\u2019s life arrived not in a classroom, but at her grandmother's bedside. When her *p\u00f2h poh*\u2019s health declined due to dementia, Mei became a primary caregiver. She discovered a deep well of patience within herself, finding purpose in the small acts of comfort: spoon-feeding her congee, combing her hair, and simply being a calming presence. This experience eclipsed any vague career ideas she had. Instead of pursuing a four-year degree, she enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning her Associate\u2019s Degree in Vocational Nursing. It felt less like a choice and more like a calling.\n\nFor the past eight years, Mei has worked at a skilled nursing facility in the Inner Richmond, where she also lives in a small, subsidized staff apartment. Her commute is an elevator ride. This unconventional arrangement blurs the line between her personal and professional life, but the convenience allows her to save money aggressively. Her days are a structured cycle of medication rounds, checking vitals, and offering a kind word to the elderly residents, many of whom she knows better than her own extended family.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few close friends\u2014mostly other nurses\u2014and the occasional family dinner in the Sunset. Dating has proven difficult, as her life is deeply intertwined with her work. While fulfilled by her profession, Mei dreams of a life with more separation. Her deepest aspiration isn't a career change, but to save enough for a down payment on a small condo of her own, perhaps in the same neighborhood. It would be a quiet sanctuary, a space to finally be Mei Lin, not just Nurse Wong\u2014a testament to her own hard work, just a few blocks from the community she dedicates her life to serving."
