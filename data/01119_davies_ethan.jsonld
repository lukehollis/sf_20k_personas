            "value": "Ethan Davies is a product of Daly City, born just over the San Francisco line to a Welsh mechanic father and a Filipino-American nurse mother. His childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s quiet, methodical nature and his mother\u2019s warm, bustling energy. He grew up understanding systems\u2014not from textbooks, but from watching his dad meticulously organize a toolbox or listening to his mom explain hospital logistics. This pragmatic upbringing instilled in him a love for order and efficiency over abstract theory.\n\nSchool was a place of quiet endurance for Ethan. He was intelligent but uninspired by traditional academics. After graduating high school, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco with vague ideas of a business degree but dropped out after a single, unfulfilling semester. The turning point came unexpectedly through a temp agency that placed him in the shipping department of a small tech hardware startup. Surrounded by pallets, packing slips, and tight deadlines, he found a real-world puzzle he genuinely wanted to solve. He wasn't the strongest, but he was the most organized, creating streamlined processes that got him noticed. Within two years, he was promoted from the warehouse floor to a remote Supply Chain Coordinator position.\n\nNow 24, Ethan\u2019s world is largely contained within his Inner Sunset apartment, which he shares with two roommates. His 0.0-mile commute means his day starts not with a bus ride, but with a walk to a local cafe for a quality pour-over. He thrives in the structured autonomy of remote work, meticulously tracking international shipments and coordinating with suppliers from his modest desk. His afternoons often end with a long run through Golden Gate Park, a necessary escape to clear his head.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused rather than city-wide. He rarely ventures to tourist-heavy areas, preferring the quiet streets and diverse, low-key restaurants of his own district. His social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of high school friends, now scattered across the Bay Area but connected nightly through Discord for video games. While he longs for a deeper romantic connection, his introverted nature and home-based routine make it a challenge. Ethan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s grounded. He aspires to become an indispensable logistics expert, save enough for a down payment on a small condo, and build a life of stable, quiet satisfaction, one carefully managed shipment at a time."
