Raised by second-generation Japanese-American parents who ran a successful plant nursery, Aiko grew up surrounded by order, patience, and the silent diligence of growing things. Her parents instilled in her a profound work ethic, assuming she would pursue a stable, traditional career.\n\nHer path diverged during her sophomore year at UC Berkeley. The turning point wasn't a single explosive event, but the slow, heartbreaking erosion of her grandmother\u2019s memory due to Alzheimer's disease. Witnessing this process shifted Aiko\u2019s academic focus from general biology to the intricate puzzles of public health and neurodegenerative disease. She graduated with a Bachelor's in Public Health, driven by a quiet but fierce determination to contribute to the science that might one day prevent other families from experiencing the same loss.\n\nLanding a research assistant position at a prestigious UCSF lab felt like fate. It also dictated her new life; she found an apartment just a few blocks from the Parnassus campus, making her commute a short, often fog-shrouded walk. Her days are a structured rhythm of precision and data. She spends long hours prepping slides, running assays, and meticulously logging results, finding a strange comfort in the controlled environment of the lab. Her social life is a quiet hum, consisting mostly of shared lunches with fellow lab techs and occasional weekend dim sum with a college friend who works in finance.\n\nAiko\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. She knows the best time to get pastries at Arizmendi Bakery on 9th Avenue and treasures her solo walks through the nearby Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park, a nod to her family's nursery. Her dream isn't fame or fortune, but to see her name listed as a co-author on a published study. Beyond that, she aspires to pursue a Ph.D., hoping to one day lead research that uncovers a crucial piece of the Alzheimer's puzzle. For Aiko, her small apartment and demanding job aren\u2019t just a life in the city; they are the foundation of a promise she made to her grandmother\u2019s fading memory."
