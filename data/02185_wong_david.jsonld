The only child of Hong Kong immigrants, he grew up in the Inner Sunset, where the drone of the N-Judah train was his childhood soundtrack. His parents, who ran a small dry-cleaning business, preached the gospel of stability. For them, success was a predictable, upward-sloping graph, and they envisioned a secure future for their son in law, medicine, or finance.\n\nDavid, a contemplative boy, found his passion not in numbers but in narratives. He devoured books on California history, spending hours at the public library tracing the city\u2019s lineage from Gold Rush port to tech metropolis. He dutifully earned a Bachelor\u2019s in History from UC Davis, a degree his parents saw as a charming but impractical hobby. The pressure, both spoken and unspoken, mounted after graduation. Faced with limited job prospects and a desire to provide for his aging parents, pragmatism won. David took a series of financial certification courses, leveraging his sharp, analytical mind to muscle his way into the world of finance.\n\nNow, at 36, he is a successful financial analyst. His zero-mile commute is a testament to his success; he lives and works in a sleek SoMa high-rise, his desk overlooking the Bay Bridge. His days are a disciplined routine: a 6 AM espresso, a scan of global markets, and then a deep dive into spreadsheets until dusk. His life is ordered, profitable, and insulated. His connection to the San Francisco of his youth has become a panoramic but detached relationship, viewed from twenty floors up.\n\nSocially, his circle consists mainly of colleagues and ephemeral connections from dating apps. The deep, meaningful relationships he craves feel just out of reach. Lately, a turning point has been forming in his mind. The wealth he\u2019s accumulating is no longer just for security; it\u2019s becoming an escape fund. David\u2019s dream is to leave the corporate world behind and finally use his historical knowledge. He fantasizes about opening a small, curated bookstore in North Beach specializing in local history, or perhaps creating a guided walking tour company that tells the forgotten stories of the city\u2019s neighborhoods. He looks out his window, past the data on his screen, and sees not just a skyline, but a future where he is no longer just analyzing value, but creating it."
