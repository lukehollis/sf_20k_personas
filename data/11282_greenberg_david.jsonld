Raised in the Sunset District, his mother, a first-generation Filipina immigrant, worked tirelessly as a nurse, instilling in him a deep respect for healthcare and community. His father, of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, was a literature professor, fostering a love for learning and critical thinking. This dual heritage shaped David's perspective \u2013 a concern for social well-being tempered with intellectual curiosity.\n\nHe pursued his Bachelor's in Public Health at a local university, drawn to the intersection of science, social justice, and community impact. Early internships at non-profits serving marginalized populations solidified his career path. Upon graduation, he landed a position as a Health Program Coordinator within the city's health and education sectors, a role he\u2019s held for seven years, his income reflecting steady growth in the field.\n\nA key turning point was encountering the stark health disparities within the city he loved. This fueled his dedication and prompted him to advocate for more equitable health access in his programs. Another impactful event was the passing of his grandmother, which reinforced the importance of family and community support, pushing him to be more intentionally involved in the lives of his friends and his mother.\n\nDavid maintains a close-knit circle of friends, often meeting for dim sum in the Richmond or exploring Golden Gate Park. He values authentic connection and shared experiences. While currently single, he hopes to build a strong family unit one day, perhaps with someone who shares his commitment to social good. Professionally, he aspires to lead larger-scale public health initiatives, aiming to create tangible change in underserved communities.\n\nHis daily routine is a rhythm of public transit commutes from his Inner Sunset apartment to his downtown office, punctuated by project management, community outreach, and inter-agency coordination. He finds solace in reading and exploring the diverse culinary scene of the city on weekends. San Francisco, with its blend of cultures and progressive spirit, feels like an extension of himself \u2013 a place where his values and profession align seamlessly. He appreciates the city's dynamic nature, while also acknowledging its challenges and striving to contribute to making it a healthier place for all its residents, particularly those in his neighborhood."

It solidified his own desire to serve and speak for those who couldn't advocate for themselves, planting the seed for his public health career during his late teens.\n\n2. Walking through the Tenderloin during an early internship, witnessing the raw struggles of homelessness and addiction up close. The stark reality of health disparities hit him viscerally, moving him from intellectual understanding to a deep, gut-level commitment to equitable care in his early twenties.\n\n3. The quiet afternoon holding his Lola's hand in her hospital room, listening to her stories of arriving in San Francisco. Her peaceful passing underscored the preciousness of family and shared history, inspiring him to be more present for his friends and mother in the wake of his mid-twenties.\n\n4. Sharing a particularly satisfying dim sum feast with his closest friends after a challenging week at work. Laughter echoed around their table in the Richmond, a simple moment of connection that reminded him of the vital importance of chosen family and finding joy amidst the demanding nature of his career in his late twenties.\n\n5. Successfully securing funding for a new health education program targeting underserved youth in the Sunset. Seeing the genuine excitement and relief on the faces of community leaders made all the long hours and bureaucratic hurdles worth it, affirming the tangible impact of his work in his early thirties."
