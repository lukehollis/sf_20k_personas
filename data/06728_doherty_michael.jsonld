Adopted as an infant by a kind, working-class Irish-American couple from Concord, he was raised on hearty stews, Catholic hymns, and the A's playing on the radio. While he loved his parents, Sean and Mary, he always felt a quiet sense of dislocation, a name and a face that didn't quite match the story everyone else shared. School was a place he endured, not excelled in. He was restless, more interested in the tactile world than in textbooks, and graduated high school with no clear path forward.\n\nFor years, Michael drifted through odd jobs: warehouse stocker, construction laborer, delivery driver. It wasn't until he took a job as a dishwasher in an Oakland diner at 24 that something clicked. He was drawn to the chaotic rhythm of the kitchen\u2014the heat, the clang of steel, the raw meritocracy where hard work and speed were valued above all else. He watched the line cooks with fierce intensity, absorbing their techniques. He was promoted to prep cook, then finally earned his place on the line, his knife skills becoming his language.\n\nSeeking a more demanding culinary scene, Michael moved to San Francisco eight years ago. He found a line cook position at a bustling, well-regarded bistro and a small SRO (Single Room Occupancy) room a block away, on the border of Chinatown and North Beach. This is the source of his zero-mile commute; his life exists within a ten-block radius. His world is the pre-dawn quiet of Kearny Street, the clatter and fire of the dinner rush, and late-night beers with his kitchen crew\u2014his surrogate family, bonded by burns and pressure.\n\nNow 37, Michael\u2019s life is one of intense routine. His personal relationships are fleeting, casualties of 70-hour work weeks. Yet, a new dream has started to simmer. He has begun quietly exploring the Korean flavors of his birth heritage, experimenting on his days off. His quiet aspiration is to one day open a small food truck, one that serves dishes blending Irish comfort food with Korean spices\u2014a culinary reflection of his own identity. It\u2019s a dream he holds close, a plan simmering like a rich stock, waiting for the perfect moment to be served."
