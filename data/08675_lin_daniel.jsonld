At 49, his life unfolds not in a bustling office but through the soft glow of his monitor, his commute a mere 0.0 miles from his bedroom to his standing desk. A rescue terrier mix named Buster is his sole, and most demanding, colleague.\n\nBorn and raised in the foggy expanse of the Sunset District, Daniel is the son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store. They preached practicality and stability, and were therefore baffled when he chose to study English Literature at UC Berkeley. Daniel, however, was enchanted by stories and the elegant structure of language, a passion that felt worlds away from stocking shelves and balancing ledgers.\n\nHis career began not with a literary flourish, but with a pragmatic pivot. Graduating in the late 90s, he found few jobs for an English major but saw opportunity in the burgeoning dot-com boom. He took a job as a technical writer, his ability to clarify complex ideas making him invaluable. Over two decades, he slowly transitioned from writing documentation to managing the people who created it, becoming the dependable Project Coordinator he is today\u2014a logistical translator between engineers and executives.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce seven years ago. The event was quiet and amicable but left him with a profound sense of solitude. It coincided with his company going fully remote, solidifying a more isolated, introspective lifestyle. His social life now consists of a few old college friends and weekly video calls with his daughter, a sophomore at UCLA.\n\nDaniel feels like a fixture of an older San Francisco, even as he works in its dominant modern industry. He remembers the city before the tech gold rush and feels a gentle melancholy for its past. His aspirations are no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. Instead, he dreams of simpler things: finishing the half-written screenplay saved on his hard drive, taking a long trip to Taiwan to connect with his roots, and simply having more afternoons to walk Buster through Golden Gate Park, a quiet anchor in a city of constant flux."
