Raised in a working-class family in Portland, Oregon, she was expected to find a stable, sensible path. She enrolled in a community college for business administration, but the sterile world of spreadsheets felt alien. The real education began when she dropped out at 20 and followed a friend to San Francisco on a whim, drawn by the city\u2019s rebellious energy.\n\nHer entry into the culinary world was a baptism by fire: washing dishes in a bustling North Beach trattoria. But Sarah was captivated by the cacophony and rhythm of the professional kitchen. She watched, learned, and begged for a chance on the line. A tough but fair French chef saw her unyielding work ethic and took her under his wing, teaching her classic techniques. For two decades, Sarah honed her craft in various SF restaurants, her career developing alongside a tumultuous marriage to another chef, which eventually dissolved under the pressure of two egos in one kitchen.\n\nThe divorce was her pivotal turning point. With a modest settlement and a large loan, she poured everything into her own venture. Fifteen years ago, she opened \u201cHearth,\u201d a cozy, 30-table restaurant in the Mission District, focusing on seasonal, Californian comfort food. She lives in the apartment directly above it, making her commute a short walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nHer days are a blur of early morning trips to the farmers' market, prepping alongside her small team, and commanding the kitchen during the dinner rush. Her regulars are her chosen family, and the restaurant is her sanctuary. Though she\u2019s respected in the city\u2019s food scene, Sarah has no desire to expand into an empire. Her dream is simpler: to keep Hearth a beloved neighborhood institution, mentor the next generation of young, hungry chefs, and perhaps one day, find a sous chef she trusts enough to take a real vacation."
