            "value": "David Wong is a product of San Francisco\u2019s fog-laced avenues. The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, he grew up in the Richmond District to the soundtrack of clanking cable car bells and the hum of Cantonese and English mingling on Clement Street. His parents ran a small, beloved neighborhood grocery store, a place of constant work and community connection. From them, David inherited a deep sense of loyalty not to the city as a whole, but to the specific blocks that raised him.\n\nHis educational journey was a quiet rebellion. While his parents hoped for a lucrative, stable career, David pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Urban Studies at San Francisco State University. He was fascinated by how cities breathe and evolve, and how policy shapes the lives of people like his parents. After graduating, he briefly worked in corporate real estate, a soulless job that felt like a betrayal of his roots. The turning point came a decade ago when his parents, worn down by rising costs, finally sold their store. Seeing that piece of his family\u2019s history vanish galvanized him.\n\nNow, David is the Project Coordinator for his neighborhood's Community Benefit District, a non-profit dedicated to supporting local merchants and preserving the area's unique character. His 0.0-mile commute is a core part of his identity; he lives in a rent-controlled apartment above a bakery, just three blocks from his childhood home. His days are a whirlwind of grant writing, organizing street festivals, and mediating between old-school shop owners and new city regulations, all conducted from his small home office or over coffee at a local cafe.\n\nAt 47, David is single but deeply enmeshed in a community he considers family. He is the unofficial historian, the trusted mediator, the man who knows which plumber to call and which supervisor to lobby. His aspiration isn't wealth or fame, but something more fragile: ensuring the Richmond District remains a place where new immigrant families can still build a life. His quiet dream is to one day use his savings to help a young entrepreneur open a shop, continuing the cycle that once gave his own family their start."
