Raised by a pragmatic architect father and an empathetic high school English teacher mother, he grew up with a dual appreciation for structured systems and the human stories they contain. This blend defined his interests, leading him away from Portland\u2019s familiar creative scene to pursue a psychology degree at a state university, fascinated by the \u201cwhy\u201d behind human behavior.\n\nHis turning point came during a post-college data entry job, a soul-crushing experience with software so poorly designed it seemed actively hostile to its users. It was then he discovered the field of Human-Computer Interaction, a perfect marriage of his interests. He moved to the East Coast for a competitive graduate program, honing his ability to design technology that felt intuitive and humane.\n\nLured by the industry's epicenter, Cody moved to San Francisco a decade ago. He did his time at a large, impersonal enterprise software company, earning his stripes but feeling creatively unfulfilled. Four years ago, he made a deliberate career shift, joining a rising startup that develops a popular app for booking unique local experiences, from cooking classes to art walks. As a Senior Product Designer, he now spends his days ensuring the path to discovering a new passion is seamless and joyful.\n\nCody's life is woven into the fabric of the Mission District. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment filled with plants and books on design theory. His 2.5-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa office is a daily ritual, a thrumming tour of city murals, traffic, and taqueria smells. Evenings are for bouldering at Dogpatch Boulders, catching an indie film at the Roxie, or trying new restaurants with a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of tech colleagues and fellow creatives.\n\nAfter a long-term relationship ended last year, he\u2019s cautiously navigating the city\u2019s dating scene. Professionally, he aspires to lead a design team, shaping a product that genuinely enriches people's lives. Personally, he dreams of finding a partner to share his life with and, perhaps one day, finding a way to put down permanent roots in the city that, despite its flaws, feels unequivocally like home."

One afternoon, wrestling with a dropdown menu that wouldn't drop down, something inside him didn't just break\u2014it ignited. The sheer, soul-crushing frustration crystallized into a single, life-altering thought: *Someone designed this to be this bad, so someone can design it to be good.* In that moment, he found his mission. This occurred about twelve years ago, just before applying to grad school.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was a Tuesday evening about six years ago, biking home from his corporate job. He felt like a ghost, a cog in a machine he didn\u2019t respect. As he pedaled down Folsom, the setting sun lit up the murals in Clarion Alley with an almost holy light, and the scent of carnitas from a nearby taqueria was overwhelming. He stopped, straddling his bike, and was struck by the sheer, chaotic, vibrant humanity of the Mission. He realized he didn't just live here; he was a part of it. The city was home, even if his job wasn't.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe breakup happened on a painfully beautiful Sunday in Dolores Park last year. As she spoke the words, the world around him seemed to sharpen: the gleam of a distant kite, the laughter of a nearby picnic, the clang of the J-Church train. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, like a user abruptly logged out of a system he thought he understood. The memory isn't just of the heartbreak, but of the city's indifferent beauty carrying on without them. It taught him that stability is something you build, not something you find.\n\n***\n\n4.\nFour months after joining the startup, he watched a recorded user-testing session. An older woman, hesitant at first, used the app he designed to book a Japanese pottery class. As she confirmed the booking, her face broke into a smile of pure, unadulterated delight. Cody felt a jolt of purpose so intense it almost felt electrical. This was it\u2014the opposite of MatrixGold. He wasn't just building screens; he was building a pathway to joy. That moment validated his risky career change and defined his professional aspirations.\n\n***\n\n5.\nA few weeks after his relationship ended, he was canceling plans, spiraling in his quiet apartment. He heard a knock. It was his two closest friends, one from his bouldering gym and one from work, holding a bottle of mezcal and a bag of tacos. They didn't push him to talk. They just sat with him amongst his plants and design books, putting on a movie at the Roxie he\u2019d mentioned wanting to see. It was a simple, profound act that solidified his sense of belonging more than any lease ever could."
