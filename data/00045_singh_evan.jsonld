            "value": "# Evan Singh: A Curator's Journey\n\nEvan Singh was born to an unlikely pair\u2014his father, a second-generation Indian American surgeon, and his mother, a Swedish-American high school art teacher. Growing up in Portland, Oregon, Evan's childhood was a blend of academic expectations and artistic freedom. His mother's studio became his sanctuary, where he developed an eye for composition rather than creating art himself.\n\nAfter initially pursuing pre-med to please his father, Evan's sophomore year at Reed College brought a pivotal moment\u2014an art history class that rekindled his passion for visual expression. He switched majors despite family tension, finding mentorship in Professor Elaine Winters, who encouraged him to pursue curation rather than creation.\n\nUpon graduating, Evan worked at the Portland Art Museum while saving for graduate studies. At 23, he was accepted to San Francisco Art Institute's prestigious curatorial program, moving to the city that would become his home. During his studies, he interned at the de Young Museum, where he met Sophia, a conservation specialist who would become his partner of three years.\n\nAfter earning his MFA, Evan faced the competitive San Francisco art scene, taking small gallery jobs until landing an assistant curator position at a boutique Mission District gallery. Now, at 27, he's been promoted to curator at Threshold Gallery, specializing in emerging digital artists and traditional media that explores technology's impact.\n\nLiving in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Lower Haight, Evan's mornings begin with coffee at Ritual before taking Muni to work. His evenings often involve gallery events, artist meetings, or quiet nights researching upcoming exhibitions while his rescue cat, Rothko, keeps him company.\n\nEvan has built a tight network of artists, critics, and fellow curators who gather monthly for \"salon nights\" of intense debate about art's future. Though his relationship with Sophia ended amicably last year, they remain close friends and occasional collaborators.\n\nLooking ahead, Evan dreams of creating a residency program combining technology and traditional media. He's slowly mending relations with his father, who's beginning to respect his son's different but successful path. In a city of constant change, Evan works to preserve artistic expression while adapting to new forms\u2014much like San Francisco itself."

            "value": "# Evan Singh's Memories\n\n1. Evan remembers the day Professor Winters took him to the back rooms of the Portland Art Museum, letting him hold a small Rothko study. At 20, feeling the canvas's texture through white cotton gloves, something clicked\u2014this wasn't just art appreciation but a calling to preserve and present beauty. His hands trembled slightly, not from fear but recognition. Walking home through autumn rain, he rehearsed how to tell his father he was abandoning medicine. This moment of clarity became his professional north star.\n\n2. During his second year at the SFAI, Evan curated his first independent show in a converted garage in the Mission. Opening night brought unexpected thunderstorms, flooding the entrance. Rather than panic, he improvised\u2014placing tea lights along the makeshift pathway, creating an unintentional but magical entrance. The show received unexpected coverage in local arts blogs as \"Singh's Luminous Passage.\" This taught him that adaptation, not perfection, makes memorable experiences\u2014a philosophy that defined his curatorial approach.\n\n3. Evan vividly recalls his first major curatorial failure\u2014an ambitious 2019 exhibition pairing AI-generated art with indigenous craftwork that collapsed when several artists withdrew, citing cultural appropriation concerns. He spent three days alone in his apartment, blinds drawn, questioning his judgment. Sophia brought soup and harsh truths: \"You failed because you didn't listen.\" This humbling experience transformed his practice, cementing his commitment to artist collaboration rather than imposing his vision.\n\n4. On his 26th birthday, Evan's father visited his gallery unannounced. He found his dad standing transfixed before a digital installation mapping human heartbeats to light patterns. \"This reminds me of cardiac monitoring, but... beautiful,\" his father said quietly. They spoke about art and medicine's shared intimacy with human experience for the first time as equals. Later, his father admitted he'd been following Evan's reviews online for years. The revelation healed something Evan hadn't realized was still broken.\n\n5. Last autumn, during a particularly foggy week, Evan stumbled upon an elderly woman sketching in Golden Gate Park. Recognizing her as Mei Lin, a renowned artist whose retrospective he'd studied, he sat silently beside her. Eventually, she offered him her pencil. \"Your turn.\" Terrified\u2014he'd never been an artist\u2014he made hesitant marks. \"See?\" she said. \"Curators need to remember what it feels like to create.\" This unexpected lesson in vulnerability transformed how he approaches artists in his gallery."
