The only child of a tax attorney and a respected dentist, her upbringing was one of comfortable expectations. She was meant to follow a stable, professional path. To please them, she enrolled in Political Science at Boston University, a practical degree she found intellectually stimulating but emotionally sterile. Her true education happened in the wings of the university\u2019s student theater, where she discovered a love for the controlled chaos of production\u2014the hum of logistics, the puzzle of budgets, and the magic of bringing a vision to life.\n\nAfter graduating, she defied her parents\u2019 wishes for law school and took a low-paying job as a production assistant at an off-Broadway house. It was there she honed her skills. In 1999, seeking a more experimental and vibrant arts scene, she took a leap of faith, accepting a job with a burgeoning performance art collective in San Francisco. This move was her definitive turning point, trading East Coast tradition for West Coast invention. She quickly became known for her unflappable demeanor and her unique ability to translate the wild ideas of artists into actionable plans.\n\nNow 47, Naomi is a highly respected Production Manager, the calm center in the creative storm of the Bay Area arts world. She resides in a sprawling live/work loft in SoMa, making her commute a short walk across the polished concrete floor to her desk. Her days are a blur of Zoom calls with international artists, spreadsheet management, and hands-on problem-solving at rehearsal spaces. After a significant long-term relationship ended five years ago, she poured her energy into her work and her chosen family\u2014a tight-knit circle of directors, stagehands, and performers who rely on her as both a manager and a confidante.\n\nNaomi\u2019s connection to San Francisco is etched into the city\u2019s cultural fabric. She\u2019s seen the scene ebb and flow with tech booms and busts, always fighting to keep the arts alive. Her dream is to leverage her decades of experience to launch her own small arts foundation, one dedicated to providing grants and production support for emerging, underrepresented Bay Area artists. She envisions a future where she isn't just managing the production, but producing the future."

            "value": "1.\nShe remembers the exact moment her new life clicked into place, just weeks after arriving in 1999. Standing outside a chaotic warehouse space in the Mission, the air smelled of salt and roasting coffee. A director, mid-artistic-panic, handed her a mess of receipts and a wild idea involving live birds. Naomi felt a profound calm settle over her. She saw the puzzle, the solution clear in her mind. On that gritty sidewalk, trading East Coast tradition for West Coast chaos, she knew without a doubt that she was finally, irrevocably home.\n\n2.\nIt was 2007, opening night. A critical set piece, a massive kinetic sculpture, had short-circuited. The artist was weeping; the audience was waiting. Naomi felt the familiar surge, not of panic, but of intense focus. While others spiraled, she was on the phone with an industrial electrician, gaffer-taping down loose cables, and rerouting power herself. The curtain went up only ten minutes late. That night, she understood her job wasn\u2019t just logistics; it was the art of holding the storm at bay so others could create.\n\n3.\nThe morning after he left, the silence in her SoMa loft was immense. It was 2019, and the shared life they\u2019d built was suddenly gone. She stood by the cavernous window, watching the fog burn off the skyline, her chest a hollow ache. Instead of crying, she walked to her desk, opened her laptop, and built a new, impossibly complex budget spreadsheet for an international festival. In the precise, orderly comfort of the cells and formulas, she began to manage her own grief, pouring all that love into her work.\n\n4.\nShe recalls a late night in a Dogpatch rehearsal space after a major grant fell through. They were all gutted. She, the director, and the lead performer sat on the cold concrete floor, sharing a bag of stale chips and passing around a cheap bottle of ros\u00e9. No one offered platitudes. They just sat in the shared failure together. In that quiet, dusty moment of collective disappointment, Naomi felt a fiercely protective love. This was her family, forged not by blood but by shared struggle and unwavering belief.\n\n5.\nLast year, at a small Oakland venue, she watched a young dancer whose raw talent was staggering. After the show, Naomi saw the dancer quietly tell a friend they might have to drop the project to make rent. The disconnect between their immense gift and their precarious reality struck Naomi with the force of a physical blow. It wasn't just frustration she felt, but a clear, burning purpose. That was the moment her dream of a foundation became a non-negotiable plan."
