Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he is the son of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small, cluttered hardware store. His childhood was a mix of Chinese tradition at home and the scent of sawdust and metal in his father's shop, where he learned the language of tools and the satisfaction of building something with his hands.\n\nHis parents, valuing stability above all, pushed him toward a tech career. Kevin dutifully enrolled in computer science at SF State, only to find himself a square peg in a round hole. The abstract world of code felt hollow compared to the tangible craft he craved. The turning point came during a summer volunteer gig at a small SoMa gallery, helping set up a new exhibit. The precision of hanging art, the problem-solving of lighting, and the collaboration with passionate artists felt like coming home. He dropped out of college after his sophomore year, a decision that strained his relationship with his parents for years.\n\nKevin started at the bottom, sweeping floors and making coffee runs. But his quiet competence and natural skill with tools did not go unnoticed. He learned carpentry, electrical wiring, and the delicate art of handling priceless works. Over two decades, he built a reputation as one of the most meticulous and reliable exhibition technicians in the city, the person top galleries and museums called for their most challenging installations.\n\nToday, Kevin lives in a Dogpatch live/work loft, making his commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs to his workshop. His life revolves around the rhythms of the art world\u2014the frantic energy of an installation week followed by periods of quiet planning. His social circle is small and tight-knit, consisting of the curators and artists he collaborates with. His parents, now retired, have come to appreciate his unique mastery, often marveling at photos of the stunning exhibitions he helps create. Kevin\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of fame, but of quiet excellence. He aspires to one day have his own small workshop dedicated to building custom museum-quality furniture, continuing the legacy of craftsmanship that began in his father's dusty hardware store."

His father, smelling of WD-40 and sawdust, handed him a long, brass-edged level. \u201c\u770b,\u201d his father said, showing him how the bubble had to float perfectly between the two black lines. Kevin held his breath, adjusting a small shelf until the bubble settled. The quiet satisfaction of that perfectly balanced bubble was a feeling he would spend the rest of his life chasing. It was his first lesson in precision and purpose.\n\n***\n\n2. He was nineteen, a sophomore at SF State, drowning in code that felt like smoke. Volunteering at the SoMa gallery, he was tasked with lighting a single sculpture. As he adjusted the beam, the light hit the metal and the artist\u2019s vision exploded into life, casting dramatic shadows. The curator nodded, \"Perfect.\" In that simple, illuminated moment, a tangible reality clicked into place. He saw a future he could build with his hands, not just with abstract commands. He dropped out two weeks later.\n\n***\n\n3. It was a massive, impossibly fragile glass installation at SFMOMA. He was thirty-five, the lead technician. A hushed silence fell over the gallery as he and his team maneuvered the final, multi-ton pane into place on a custom rig he\u2019d designed. The piece settled with a barely audible sigh, fitting perfectly. There was no applause, just a collective, relieved exhale. In that silent moment of shared competence, he felt not pride, but a profound sense of rightness\u2014the quiet hum of a problem masterfully solved.\n\n***\n\n4. His parents, now retired, were visiting his loft. He hesitantly showed them a photo on his phone of a recent exhibition\u2014a room filled with soaring, illuminated forms he had constructed. His mother, who had cried when he left college, looked from the phone to him, her eyes wide with a new kind of understanding. His father simply nodded, tapping the screen. \u201cGood joinery,\u201d he said, the highest praise he knew how to give. The old chasm of disappointment finally closed, bridged by a shared language of craft.\n\n***\n\n5. Last week, late at night, he stood in his silent workshop. The city was quiet except for the distant foghorns. He ran his hand over a piece of claro walnut he\u2019d been saving, feeling the grain and heft. It wasn\u2019t the memory of a gallery opening that filled him, but the potential held in that slab of wood\u2014the promise of a table, a chair, an heirloom. This was it. Not the applause, but the quiet beginning, a direct line back to his father's dusty shop."
