As the only child of Korean immigrants, his upbringing was a constant lesson in efficiency and sacrifice. His parents, Hun-Seok and Min-Jee, worked relentlessly, their lives dictated by the rhythm of sorting, washing, pressing, and bagging. They instilled in David a profound sense of duty and the belief that a prestigious education was the only escape from such grueling labor.\n\nHe delivered on their hopes, excelling in math and science. He chose Industrial Engineering at Cal Poly, drawn to the logic of optimizing processes\u2014a more sophisticated version of watching his father arrange garments to maximize space. A Master's degree from Stanford followed, cementing his path into the Bay Area's high-tech manufacturing sector. For over a decade, David climbed the corporate ladder, becoming a master of supply chains and production schedules.\n\nThe turning point came at 38. After his father passed away from a sudden heart attack, David found himself sorting through his father\u2019s meticulously kept, but ultimately all-consuming, business ledgers. He saw his own future mirrored in that life of pure work and realized he was engineering a life devoid of joy. This epiphany prompted a seismic shift. He sold his suburban condo, moved into a modern Potrero Hill apartment with sweeping views of the industrial waterfront he helped manage, and bought a high-end commuter bicycle.\n\nNow, at 42, David\u2019s days are still about optimization, but with a human-centric focus. His 2.8-mile ride to his Director of Operations job in the Dogpatch is his daily meditation, a physical buffer between his personal and professional worlds. He\u2019s respected at work for his calm demeanor and ability to untangle any operational knot. His social life is intentional; a close circle of friends, including his partner Sarah, an architect he met at a local film festival. Weekends are for hiking in the Marin Headlands or exploring the city\u2019s culinary scene, not checking work emails.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tactile and sensory\u2014the burn in his legs cycling up Potrero\u2019s hills, the fog rolling over the bay, the hum of the factory floor. His dream is no longer just about career ascension. He aspires to one day launch his own consulting firm, helping smaller, ethical companies build sustainable manufacturing processes. It\u2019s his way of honoring his parents' work ethic while building a legacy that is distinctly his own."

His father, Hun-Seok, handled a delicate silk wedding dress, his movements a practiced, silent ballet. He explained how to position it on the press to avoid a single crease, a system of perfect efficiency. David saw not just skill, but a life boxed in by other people\u2019s clothes. That day, he internalized both the beauty of a flawless system and a fierce determination to engineer his own escape from one.\n\n2.\nThe week after the funeral, at 38, he sat with his father\u2019s ledgers. The columns were perfect, decades of tireless work reduced to neat, black ink. He saw his own life reflected in the sterile numbers\u2014a ledger of optimized schedules and career targets, devoid of joy. The grief was suddenly sharp, not just for his father, but for the man he was becoming. That night, sitting in the silence of his parents\u2019 home, David decided to tear up his own life\u2019s ledger and start a new one.\n\n3.\nHis first ride from his new Potrero Hill apartment was a baptism by fire. His legs screamed up the 18th Street climb, a brutal, unfamiliar burn. But at the top, gasping for air, he saw it: the industrial waterfront stretching below, the bay glinting under the sun. It wasn't an abstract system on a screen anymore; it was real, visceral. That pain, followed by that view, was the first true transaction in his new, intentional life. He was 38.\n\n4.\nIt was at the Roxie Theater, age 40. The film ended, and in the lobby, he started talking to Sarah about a scene\u2019s composition. He expected the conversation to be brief, transactional. Instead, it unfolded for an hour, easy and deep. He realized with a jolt that he hadn\u2019t mentioned his job once. For the first time in years, he felt interesting for who he was, not what he did. It was a quieter, more profound kind of systems optimization\u2014the re-engineering of his capacity for connection.\n\n5.\nLast year, a packaging line went down. The old David would have optimized the numbers from his desk. The new David, 41, went to the factory floor. Watching the workers\u2019 frustrated, tired movements, he suddenly saw his mother and father. He felt the true cost of inefficiency\u2014their exhaustion. He solved the logistical knot, but his solution prioritized their workflow, their physical ease. In that moment, his future crystalized: to build systems that honored the human element. It was no longer an escape, but a tribute."
