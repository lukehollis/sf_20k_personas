Adopted as an infant from the Philippines by a loving Caucasian couple, David grew up in the sun-baked suburbs of Fresno. His childhood was happy and quintessentially Californian, filled with bike rides and little league, though he was always conscious of the gentle cultural dissonance between himself and his kind, well-meaning parents.\n\nHe drifted through community college, earning an Associate's degree in Communications without a clear career path. The turning point came unexpectedly when his adoptive grandmother\u2019s health declined. David became her primary caregiver during her final months. He discovered a deep, surprising well of patience and empathy within himself, finding more fulfillment in helping her with daily tasks than he ever had in writing a press release. This profound experience became his calling. He quickly earned his Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) license.\n\nFacing Fresno\u2019s limited opportunities, David looked north. An unusual job listing caught his eye: a live-in CNA position in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. The arrangement solved the city\u2019s daunting housing costs and offered him a direct path into his new career. For the past two years, his commute has been a short walk down a Victorian hallway. He is the full-time caregiver for Eleanor, a sharp-witted but frail woman in her late eighties.\n\nHis days are a structured rhythm of medication schedules, meal preparations, and providing companionship, from reading the newspaper aloud to listening to stories of an older San Francisco. He has formed a deep, familial bond with Eleanor. On his two days off, David explores the city that is slowly becoming his own. He takes the bus to Clement Street for dim sum or connects with other Filipino healthcare workers, belatedly exploring the heritage he never knew. David is diligently saving his income. His dream isn't grand; it's practical and heartfelt. He plans to enroll in the nursing program at CCSF or SF State, hoping to become an RN. His work has given him not just a job, but an identity and a future firmly rooted in caring for others."
