Growing up, she was a quiet, observant child, keenly aware of the unspoken struggles of families in her community, which nurtured an innate empathy that would later define her career. She left for San Francisco State University in the early 1990s, seeking a world more aligned with her burgeoning ideals.\n\nHer Bachelor\u2019s in Social Work threw her directly into the city\u2019s complex heart. Her early career was spent in frontline case management during the lingering devastation of the AIDS epidemic, an experience that forged her resolve and deepened her compassion. It was at a community health coalition meeting that she met David Wei, a thoughtful architect who shared her commitment to social justice. They married and built a life in the Inner Richmond, their partnership a quiet pillar of support.\n\nThe defining turning point of Katherine\u2019s life came eleven years ago with David\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack. The grief was profound, but she channeled it into her work, transforming her pain into a fierce dedication to the systems that support vulnerable families. She climbed the ranks from caseworker to supervisor, eventually becoming the Clinical Program Manager she is today. In this role, she mentors a new generation, her leadership shaped by decades of on-the-ground experience.\n\nNow 51, Katherine\u2019s days follow a steady rhythm. Her 2.1-mile commute on the Muni N-Judah is a time for reflection, watching the city wake up. Her work is demanding but fulfilling, managing budgets and staff to ensure their programs have the maximum impact. Evenings often involve a walk through Golden Gate Park, a place rich with memories of David, or enjoying the quiet of the apartment they once shared. San Francisco is more than her home; it\u2019s the silent witness to her love, her loss, and her resilience. Her hope is not for dramatic change, but for continuity\u2014to see the programs she built thrive long after she retires, ensuring the city that holds her history remains a place of refuge for others."

He was describing a painting he\u2019d never finish. Katherine felt a wave of profound, useless sorrow. It wasn't just sadness; it was a cold, hardening anger at the injustice of it all. That day, her innate compassion developed a steel edge. It was no longer enough to simply care; she had to fight the systems that were failing him.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was a fluorescent-lit community room in the Mission, late 1997. She was tired, listening to arguments over funding. Then a man spoke\u2014an architect named David. He didn't talk about buildings, but about how thoughtful design could create dignity for unhoused families. Katherine was struck not by romance, but by a powerful sense of recognition. In his quiet, passionate logic, she saw a reflection of her own core beliefs. It was the first time she realized building a life with someone could also mean building a better world.\n\n***\n\n3.\nOne foggy Sunday in 2005, they sat on a bench in the Japanese Tea Garden. David sketched the drum bridge in his notebook, explaining how the negative space was as important as the structure itself. Katherine wasn\u2019t listening to the architectural theory; she was just watching his hand, the way his brow furrowed in concentration. The world fell away, leaving the scent of damp earth and the comfortable silence between them. That quiet, unassuming peace was the foundation of their life together, a feeling she still chases on her walks.\n\n***\n\n4.\nThe week after David\u2019s funeral, she walked into her office, the city outside a muted gray. Her own grief felt like a physical weight, vast and suffocating. A junior caseworker approached, voice trembling, about a family facing eviction. For a split second, Katherine felt nothing. Then, a fierce, protective instinct pierced the fog. This family\u2019s crisis was real, immediate, and solvable. Her work shifted in that moment from a career to a lifeline\u2014the only thing that made sense in a world without him.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, a young caseworker sat in her office, close to tears after a difficult home visit. Katherine saw her own 25-year-old self in the young woman\u2019s overwhelmed eyes. Instead of offering platitudes, she simply said, \u201cI know. It feels impossible,\u201d and then walked her through the paperwork, showing how to turn raw empathy into a concrete action plan. Seeing the flicker of resolve replace despair in the caseworker\u2019s face felt like a quiet victory. It was the legacy she wanted: not a name on a building, but strength passed on."
