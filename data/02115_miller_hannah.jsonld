Raised in a placid Columbus, Ohio suburb by a CPA father and a high school librarian mother, her childhood was one of quiet comfort and predictable rhythms. This idyllic but insular upbringing fostered in her a deep curiosity about the lives lived outside her bubble. At Ohio State University, she drifted into a Sociology major, fascinated by the frameworks of society but feeling disconnected from the human reality behind the theories.\n\nThe turning point came during the summer after her junior year. Seeking something more tangible than textbooks, she volunteered at a free health clinic in a struggling Cleveland neighborhood. The experience was a tectonic shift. For the first time, she witnessed firsthand how issues like housing insecurity, addiction, and lack of access to care were not abstract concepts but daily, life-or-death struggles for real people. That summer forged her abstract compassion into a concrete purpose.\n\nAfter graduating, she bypassed corporate recruitment fairs and grad school applications, instead seeking a role on the front lines. She found it in a Community Health Worker position with a non-profit in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin district. She packed two suitcases and moved into a small, rent-controlled studio apartment just three blocks from her office, making her official commute 0.0 miles.\n\nHer days are a walking tour of human need. She navigates the narrow hallways of SRO hotels, helping elderly clients manage medications, connecting unhoused individuals with shelters, and translating complex medical jargon for recent immigrants. Her social life is deeply entwined with her work; her closest friends are fellow case workers and nurses with whom she shares gallows humor over cheap beer after a draining shift.\n\nHannah doesn\u2019t dream of a house in the suburbs. Her aspiration is to see her clients achieve stability\u2014a consistent roof, reliable healthcare, a measure of peace. While she occasionally considers a Master's in Public Health to influence policy, she fears losing the vital connection she has on the ground. For now, her life is her work, her neighborhood is her world, and her greatest hope is measured in the small, hard-won victories of the community she serves."
