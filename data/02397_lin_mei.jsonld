The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she was raised in the bilingual hum of a small apartment above her parents\u2019 modest Cantonese restaurant. From them, she inherited a relentless work ethic and the quiet expectation of a practical, stable career. While her parents mastered the art of the wok, Mei\u2019s childhood fascination was with deconstructing things\u2014old radios, her father's pager, anything with screws and wires\u2014to understand the logic within.\n\nThis innate curiosity guided her educational path. She pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Industrial Design, but felt it was too conceptual. Seeking a more tangible skill set, she earned a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from an East Coast university, a degree that made her parents immensely proud. Her early career was a grind at a massive Silicon Valley corporation, designing iterative improvements for consumer electronics. It was stable but soulless, and after five years, she felt a profound disconnect from the physical objects she was creating.\n\nThe turning point was accepting a role at a smaller, more agile tech firm based in SF. The position, focused on early-stage product development, offered full-time remote work\u2014a game changer. Mei sold her car and moved into a sleek, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute transformed her life. Her days are now a disciplined rhythm of deep focus, moving between CAD software on her monitors and the 3D printer whirring in her dedicated home office. She prototypes everything from ergonomic controllers to smart home devices.\n\nOutside of work, her life is intentionally curated. After a significant long-term relationship ended three years ago, she has embraced a period of focused solitude. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of old university friends, with whom she shares dinners and hikes in Marin. Her connection to San Francisco is tactile; she knows the best coffee shops for sketching sessions and the quietest parks for clearing her head. Mei's dream isn't just a promotion, but to one day lead the development of an assistive technology product\u2014something that elegantly solves a real-world problem for people with disabilities, finally bridging the gap between her technical skill and a deeply human purpose."

While he frantically called the service, she took it, a tiny screwdriver in hand. The feeling of the casing popping open, revealing the green circuit board, was electric. She couldn't fix it, but in that moment of quiet disassembly, she felt a purpose separate from the steam and clatter of the kitchen. It was the first time she understood her hands were meant for a different kind of work.\n\n2.\nThe phone call home after her Master's acceptance felt heavy. She remembers the long silence on the line, then her mother's voice, thick with emotion, saying, \"Engineer.\" It wasn't just pride; it was relief, the sound of a sacrifice paying off. Mei felt the weight of that word settle on her. It was a validation that cemented her path, but it also became a benchmark she felt she had to live up to for years, long after the degree was framed.\n\n3.\nIt was the unboxing that broke her. She\u2019d spent six months optimizing a single plastic hinge on a new tablet. Seeing the final product in its slick packaging under the fluorescent lights of the office, she felt nothing. Not pride, not accomplishment, just a hollow echo. The object felt alien, a stranger she\u2019d spent countless hours with. That night, she updated her resume. The disconnect was no longer a feeling; it was a physical revulsion, a call to action she couldn't ignore.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, she spent the first night in her empty Hayes Valley condo. The silence was absolute, a stark contrast to the life she\u2019d just left. She sat on the floor, surrounded by boxes, and cried not just for the relationship\u2019s end, but for the unfamiliar quiet. Then, a sense of calm washed over her. This space, this silence, was hers to fill. It was the painful, necessary beginning of reclaiming her own geometry, of learning how solitude could be a foundation, not a void.\n\n5.\nLast year, in a cafe, she watched an elderly man with visibly trembling hands struggle to use a modern card reader. He was flustered, apologizing to the line behind him. Mei felt a jolt\u2014not of pity, but of purpose. All her knowledge of ergonomics, materials, and mechanisms focused into a single, sharp point. She didn't want to design another sleek gadget for the market. She wanted to design *for him*. It was the moment her technical skills finally found their deeply human home."
