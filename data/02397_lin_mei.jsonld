The only child of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, she was raised in the bilingual hum of a small apartment above her parents\u2019 modest Cantonese restaurant. From them, she inherited a relentless work ethic and the quiet expectation of a practical, stable career. While her parents mastered the art of the wok, Mei\u2019s childhood fascination was with deconstructing things\u2014old radios, her father's pager, anything with screws and wires\u2014to understand the logic within.\n\nThis innate curiosity guided her educational path. She pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Industrial Design, but felt it was too conceptual. Seeking a more tangible skill set, she earned a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from an East Coast university, a degree that made her parents immensely proud. Her early career was a grind at a massive Silicon Valley corporation, designing iterative improvements for consumer electronics. It was stable but soulless, and after five years, she felt a profound disconnect from the physical objects she was creating.\n\nThe turning point was accepting a role at a smaller, more agile tech firm based in SF. The position, focused on early-stage product development, offered full-time remote work\u2014a game changer. Mei sold her car and moved into a sleek, minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute transformed her life. Her days are now a disciplined rhythm of deep focus, moving between CAD software on her monitors and the 3D printer whirring in her dedicated home office. She prototypes everything from ergonomic controllers to smart home devices.\n\nOutside of work, her life is intentionally curated. After a significant long-term relationship ended three years ago, she has embraced a period of focused solitude. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of old university friends, with whom she shares dinners and hikes in Marin. Her connection to San Francisco is tactile; she knows the best coffee shops for sketching sessions and the quietest parks for clearing her head. Mei's dream isn't just a promotion, but to one day lead the development of an assistive technology product\u2014something that elegantly solves a real-world problem for people with disabilities, finally bridging the gap between her technical skill and a deeply human purpose."
