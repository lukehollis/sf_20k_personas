Raised by a pragmatic accountant father and a kind-hearted elementary school teacher mother, her childhood was stable, predictable, and saturated with the expectation that she would follow a similarly sensible path. That path was irrevocably altered during her sophomore year of college. Her grandmother, a vibrant woman, succumbed to complications from Type 2 diabetes, a battle Anya witnessed as a frustrating series of systemic failures, missed preventative care opportunities, and health inequity.\n\nThis personal tragedy became her professional calling. She pivoted her studies, earning a sociology degree from the University of Oregon before moving to the Bay Area for a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, specializing in epidemiology. It was there she discovered her affinity for data\u2014not as cold numbers, but as stories of human lives, patterns of suffering, and pathways to intervention. Upon graduating, she accepted a position as a data analyst for a San Francisco non-profit focused on health equity in underserved communities.\n\nNow 32, Anya\u2019s life is centered in her small but bright apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not with a bus ride, but with a walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears her head before she dives into datasets and predictive models. Her work is her passion; she finds deep meaning in tracing the narrative of a community\u2019s health through spreadsheets, knowing her analysis might inform a new mobile clinic route or a targeted wellness program.\n\nHer social life is a deliberate construction against the isolation of remote work. She maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from her Berkeley cohort and finds physical and mental release at a climbing gym in the Dogpatch twice a week. Though she values her independence, she sometimes feels the strange loneliness of being single in a city buzzing with transient energy.\n\nAnya\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused. It\u2019s the scent of eucalyptus in the park, the weekend bustle of Clement Street\u2019s farmers' market, and the satisfaction of her work directly impacting the city\u2019s populace. Her dream isn\u2019t a corner office or a venture-backed startup, but to lead a project whose data proves, unequivocally, the success of an intervention that saves lives\u2014turning her family's past tragedy into a future of better health for countless others."
