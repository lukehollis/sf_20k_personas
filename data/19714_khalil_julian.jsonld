Raised by an architect father and a history teacher mother, Julian grew up in a world of structured, intellectual pursuits. It was his grandfather, a loquacious importer of textiles and spices, who introduced him to a more vibrant, chaotic form of beauty.\n\nDuring his undergraduate studies in art history, Julian realized he was a better interpreter than a creator. He was fascinated by the dialogue between pieces, the story a collection could tell. This led him to a Master of Fine Arts in Curatorial Practice, where he honed his ability to craft narratives from objects and images. His early career was a series of curatorial roles in respected but underfunded galleries, first in Chicago and then, in 2003, in San Francisco.\n\nThe turning point came a decade ago. Frustrated by seeing brilliant artistic visions thwarted by poor financial management, Julian took a leadership course. He discovered a surprising aptitude for the business of art\u2014for donor relations, strategic planning, and galvanizing a team. The shift from curator to Executive Director was a pragmatic evolution, marrying his artistic soul with a newfound managerial acumen.\n\nNow 48, Julian lives in a tastefully minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of culture, cuisine, and design suits him perfectly. His 2.8-mile bicycle commute to his SoMa-based arts organization is a cherished daily ritual, a moment to observe the city\u2019s kinetic energy before diving into budgets and board meetings. His long-term partnership ended amicably years ago, a casualty of two demanding careers, and he now enjoys a close-knit circle of friends\u2014chefs, academics, and fellow arts professionals.\n\nJulian\u2019s driving ambition is one of legacy. In a city dominated by the ephemeral world of tech, he is fiercely dedicated to securing a permanent, thriving place for the arts. His dream is to launch an endowment that will ensure his organization outlives him, forever serving as a sanctuary for challenging, vital, and accessible creative expression in the heart of San Francisco."

The fabric shimmered, a river of color amidst the damask furniture, as his grandfather\u2019s booming voice told a story not of art, but of trade routes and a merchant's hard bargain. It was a sensory lesson, not an intellectual one. He learned then that beauty wasn't pristine or quiet; it was a loud, fragrant, living thing, a truth that has grounded his entire career.\n\n2.\nDuring his MFA final critique, around age 25, he\u2019d paired a stark photograph of a Chicago bridge with a fragile, cracked ceramic bowl. A professor noted their \"unspoken tension,\" and a current went through Julian. He wasn't failing to create; he was succeeding at interpreting. He saw the dialogue between the objects\u2014urban decay and delicate survival\u2014and realized his gift wasn\u2019t in making the thing, but in making it speak to another. That moment solidified his identity, silencing the insecure artist and awakening the confident curator.\n\n3.\nMonths after his 2003 move, he biked up to Twin Peaks on a clear afternoon. A wall of fog rolled in, silent and absolute, erasing the world. He stood alone in the damp chill, unnerved. Then, just as quickly, the fog broke, revealing the city grid illuminated by the setting sun. That sudden, dramatic shift from total isolation to breathtaking clarity felt like San Francisco itself giving him a private, curated viewing. It was the moment the city stopped being a new address and started feeling like his own.\n\n4.\nIt was the closing night of a young sculptor\u2019s show, about a decade ago. He\u2019d championed her powerful work, but the gallery was nearly empty, the lights dimmed early to save money. He saw the artist quietly packing her work, her face a mask of disappointment. Julian felt a hot surge of anger, not at the public, but at his own impotence. Art couldn\u2019t survive on passion alone. That night, aesthetics without infrastructure felt like a prayer in a hurricane. He enrolled in the leadership course the next week.\n\n5.\nA few years ago, after his partner had moved out, he hosted his first dinner in his spartan Hayes Valley apartment. The rich conversation with his friends\u2014a chef, an academic, a designer\u2014filled the quiet space. Looking at their faces in the warm light, Julian realized this was his foundation now. The ambition for a shared personal legacy had receded, replaced by a fierce, clear drive to build one for this arts community. His work wasn't a substitute for a family; it was in service of his truest one."
