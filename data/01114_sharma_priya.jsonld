Raised in Fremont by parents who had meticulously engineered their own success after arriving from abroad, she grew up in the shadow of Silicon Valley\u2019s ambition. Her father, a software architect, and her mother, who managed the family\u2019s investments, envisioned a similar path for her: a degree from a top UC school followed by a lucrative career in tech or medicine. Priya tried to want it, spending two uninspired years at UC Davis studying communications, a major she chose for its perceived practicality.\n\nThe turning point came during a summer volunteer position at a community arts camp. Surrounded by the chaotic, brilliant energy of five-year-olds, Priya felt a sense of purpose that had always eluded her in lecture halls. The joy of helping a child discover they could mix blue and yellow to make green felt more significant than any A- on a midterm. She never returned for her junior year, a decision that created a painful, years-long rift with her parents.\n\nAt 24, she moved to San Francisco with meager savings, finding a small, rent-controlled studio in the Inner Richmond. The move was an assertion of self. She took a job as an aide at a small, play-based preschool just three blocks from her apartment. Her world shrank in the best possible way. Her daily commute is a short walk past the Clement Street bakeries, greeting neighbors and shop owners along the way. Her life is measured not in promotions, but in the developmental milestones of the toddlers she cares for\u2014learning to share, mastering a zipper, or finally speaking a full sentence.\n\nHer social life is woven into her neighborhood. Her closest friend is the lead teacher at her school, a woman who serves as a mentor and encourages her professional growth. She has a standing weekly dinner with a few friends she met in a pottery class. Her relationship with her parents is slowly mending; they don't understand her choices, but they see her genuine contentment.\n\nPriya\u2019s dream is to get her early childhood education credentials and one day open her own small, arts-focused preschool in the neighborhood. She envisions a space filled with light, music, and finger paints, a haven where emotional intelligence is valued as much as academic readiness. For Priya, success isn't a stock portfolio; it\u2019s the quiet satisfaction of building a meaningful life on her own terms, one block at a time."
