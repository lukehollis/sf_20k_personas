Raised in a stable, middle-class Sacramento family, she was encouraged to be practical. However, drawn to beauty and history, she pursued an Art History degree at UC Santa Cruz, dreaming of a life curating collections, not property listings.\n\nUpon graduating, the magnetic pull of San Francisco\u2019s cultural vibrancy was irresistible. She arrived with high hopes, only to be met by the city\u2019s harsh economic reality. Her art history degree felt more like a romantic folly than a viable career path. After months of serving coffee and barely making rent, a desperate application landed her a job as a real estate assistant for a boutique firm in Pacific Heights. This was the turning point: a pragmatic pivot away from her passion and into the city\u2019s engine room of wealth and property.\n\nNow 25, Chloe\u2019s life and work are inextricably linked. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of her unique arrangement: she lives in a small, rent-stabilized one-bedroom in a building managed by her employer, receiving a modest discount for being on-site. Her days are a blur of scheduling showings for multi-million dollar flats, fielding calls from demanding clients, and updating listings with glossy photos of lives she can only observe. She is intimately familiar with the city's most beautiful homes but can never truly inhabit them.\n\nHer social life consists of weekend brunches in Hayes Valley or late-night drinks with a small circle of fellow transplants, all of them navigating the same struggle between their ambitions and their rent. Chloe\u2019s connection to San Francisco is a paradox; she loves the fog rolling over the Presidio and the architectural grandeur she witnesses daily, but feels alienated by the transactional nature of her existence. Her dream isn\u2019t to own one of the properties she helps sell, but to one day afford the time and freedom to step back into a museum as a creator, not just a guest."
