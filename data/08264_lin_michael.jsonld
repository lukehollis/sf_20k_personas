The son of a pragmatic Taiwanese immigrant engineer and a community-minded mother who volunteered at local cultural centers, Michael grew up navigating two worlds: the data-driven certainty of Silicon Valley and the nuanced, people-focused work of building a community. He was a dutiful son, heading to UC Davis with the initial intention of studying economics, a sensible path his father approved of.\n\nA turning point came during his junior year when a controversial housing development threatened a beloved local park in Fremont. Watching his mother and her friends organize, write letters, and speak haltingly but passionately at city council meetings ignited something within him. He saw how policy wasn't abstract; it was pavement, green space, and the feeling of home. This experience redirected his entire future. He switched his focus and, after graduating, earned a Master of Public Policy from UC Berkeley, eager to be the person who understood the levers of power.\n\nNow, at 36, Michael is a senior legislative aide for a San Francisco City Supervisor. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his dedication; his one-bedroom Hayes Valley apartment doubles as his command center. His days are a blur of drafting policy memos, analyzing budget reports, and navigating the complex web of neighborhood associations and lobbyists. He lives and breathes the city\u2019s problems, from homelessness to public transit woes.\n\nHis social life is intertwined with his work, consisting of happy hour strategy sessions with fellow aides and wonks. A long-term relationship recently ended, a casualty of his demanding schedule and the emotional toll of his job. Though sometimes jaded by the slow grind of bureaucracy, Michael\u2019s core idealism remains. He loves San Francisco fiercely, not for its scenic vistas, but for its messy, vibrant, and challenging reality. He dreams of one day authoring a landmark piece of housing legislation that creates tangible change. His greatest internal debate is whether he has the grit to eventually step out from behind the scenes and run for office himself, to become the face of the change he so meticulously works to create."
