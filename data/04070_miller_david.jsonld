Born to a Filipino father who had served in the U.S. Navy and an Ilocano mother who worked in hotel housekeeping, David grew up in a vibrant, working-class immigrant community. The \"Other\" on forms was his quiet nod to this mixed heritage and the feeling of straddling worlds. His childhood was a soundtrack of rattling cable cars, the smell of garlic rice from his mother's kitchen, and the shared struggles of neighbors in rent-controlled apartments.\n\nA bright but unfocused student at San Francisco State University, his trajectory was permanently altered in his sophomore year when his father suffered a debilitating stroke. David dropped out of college to become his family's primary navigator of the American healthcare system. He translated doctor\u2019s jargon into Ilocano, fought with insurance companies, and learned firsthand the cultural and linguistic gaps that could swallow a family whole. This grueling experience became his true education.\n\nAfter his father passed away, David never returned to finish his degree. The path had become clear. He took a job with a small nonprofit serving the local elderly and immigrant population. What began as translation and driving clients to appointments evolved into a formal role as a Community Health Worker. For nearly two decades, David has been the trusted bridge for countless families, the familiar face in the clinic, the calm voice on the phone.\n\nNow 53, David lives a life of purpose contained within a few square blocks. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his modest apartment\u2014the same one he grew up in\u2014to the storefront health clinic he helped establish. His days are a patchwork of visiting homebound seniors, helping new parents apply for aid, and running wellness workshops in the community room. His social life bleeds into his work; the *manongs* and *manangs* he serves are his surrogate family. He\u2019s been through relationships, but his most enduring commitment has been to his neighborhood.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t for a different life, but for a more secure version of this one. He hopes to see the clinic secure long-term funding and to mentor the next generation of health workers from the community. He sees the tide of gentrification lapping at SoMa\u2019s shores and aspires simply to help his people hold on, ensuring a place for their history and their future in the city they helped build."

His teacher pointed, \u201cJust pick one.\u201d But he saw his father\u2019s Navy picture and his mother's tired hands, and he drew his own box, labeling it \u2018Other.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t an act of rebellion, but of quiet truth. It was the first time he consciously chose to stand in the space between, a space he would inhabit for the rest of his life.\n\n2.\nIt was the neurologist\u2019s clipped, impersonal tone that broke him. He stood beside his father's bed, translating \"cerebrovascular accident\" into a gentle Ilocano phrase for his terrified mother. In that moment, college became irrelevant. He saw the vast, cold chasm between the medical system and his family, and he knew his job wasn't in a lecture hall. It was right here, building a bridge across that terrifying gap with his words, one diagnosis at a time.\n\n3.\nManang Rosa, who hadn't heard her grandchildren\u2019s laughter in years, finally got her new hearing aids. David had spent weeks fighting with Medi-Cal for them. When they were switched on, her face crumpled with a joy so pure it felt sacred. She gripped his hand, tears in her eyes, and called him *anak ko*\u2014my son. The paycheck from the nonprofit felt incidental. That single moment of connection, of being claimed by his community, was the only compensation he ever truly needed.\n\n4.\nHe still feels the cold brass of the key in his hand. The day the SoMa Community Health Clinic officially opened, he was the one to unlock the door. The smell of fresh paint mixed with the anticipation of the neighbors waiting outside. It wasn't just a clinic; it was a declaration. It was shelter. Looking at the simple sign they\u2019d all chipped in for, he felt a deeper sense of home than he ever had in his own apartment. They had built this. They belonged here.\n\n5.\nThe closing of the Folsom Street Laundromat hit him harder than any new high-rise. He remembered doing his family\u2019s wash there as a boy, the hum of the dryers a comforting constant. One day it was just gone, a sterile 'For Lease' sign in its place, hinting at a future of cold-brew cafes. It wasn't just a laundromat; it was a piece of their shared life being erased. That private grief hardened his public resolve. His work wasn\u2019t just about health, but about holding ground."
