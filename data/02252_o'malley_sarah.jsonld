Her 0.0-mile commute is not a tech-worker\u2019s perk but the reality of her life as a live-in Certified Nursing Assistant.\n\nRaised in Sacramento by a union electrician father and a school secretary mother, Sarah was taught the values of hard work and practicality. She was the first in her family to enroll in college, starting a liberal arts degree at a state school with vague dreams of becoming a teacher. However, her path veered sharply when her father suffered a debilitating stroke during her sophomore year. Sarah dropped out and moved home, becoming a primary caregiver alongside her mother. The experience was grueling but unearthed a deep-seated well of compassion and patience she never knew she had.\n\nAfter her father passed away, returning to school felt impossible. Instead, she leaned into her newfound skills, completing a CNA program. For years, she worked in understaffed nursing facilities, finding the work both draining and meaningful. The turning point came when she saw an ad for a private, live-in position in San Francisco. It promised better pay and a quieter environment\u2014a chance to escape the burnout and finally save money.\n\nNow, at 36, her life is a structured routine of medications, meal preparation, and quiet companionship for Arthur, a witty but frail 89-year-old widower. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate yet filtered; she knows the rhythm of the N-Judah streetcar by sound and experiences the neighborhood through daily walks to Golden Gate Park and grocery runs on Clement Street. Her social life is sparse, consisting mainly of long phone calls with her sister and brief, friendly chats with Arthur's visiting children.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is a quiet one. Every paycheck, a significant portion is transferred to a savings account earmarked for a nursing program at CCSF. She imagines a future where she has her own small apartment, maybe even in the Sunset, and a daily commute on the Muni. For Sarah, a commute isn't a hassle to be optimized away; it\u2019s a symbol of independence, a journey between a life she chooses and a home that is entirely her own."
