The son of a history professor and a librarian, he was raised on a diet of intellectual curiosity and quiet contemplation. This led him to pursue a PhD in Theoretical Physics, a quest for cosmic elegance far removed from the commercial world. He spent his twenties and early thirties chasing the ghost of grand unified theories, believing his life\u2019s work would be in academia.\n\nThe turning point came in the late 1990s. Faced with a scarce tenure-track market and the siren call of the first dot-com boom, a friend lured him west. Reluctantly, David discovered his knack for modeling complex systems was perfectly translatable to the burgeoning field of data analysis. He traded celestial mechanics for market mechanics, moving to San Francisco and quickly rising through the ranks. The intellectual rigor was still there, but the fundamental \u201cwhy\u201d had changed from universal truth to user engagement.\n\nNow 54, David lives a life of comfortable isolation in his meticulously tidy Noe Valley condo. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his espresso machine to an ergonomic chair with a view of the fog rolling over Twin Peaks. He is divorced, his marriage a casualty of long hours and a slow divergence of interests. His daughter is studying art history at NYU, a choice he quietly admires for its lack of commercial pragmatism. His social circle is small, consisting of a weekly dinner with two other tech veterans who, like him, remember a pre-Google San Francisco.\n\nThough successful, a sense of intellectual disillusionment haunts him. The work is challenging but feels spiritually blunt. His dream is no longer about a promotion or a larger stock option package. Instead, he aspires to reconcile the two halves of his life. He spends his evenings reading philosophy and auditing advanced physics courses online, nursing a quiet hope of one day writing a book that connects the cold logic of data with the humanistic search for meaning\u2014an attempt to find first principles once more, not in the cosmos, but within himself."
