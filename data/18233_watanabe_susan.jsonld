Born Susan Miller to a union electrician and a teacher\u2019s aide in suburban Cleveland, her upbringing was steeped in practicality and a quiet sense of social responsibility. She was the first in her family to seek a graduate degree, driven not by ambition for wealth, but by a nascent desire to fix systems she saw as fundamentally unfair.\n\nShe arrived in the Bay Area for her Master's in Public Administration at SF State in the late 90s, instantly captivated by San Francisco's chaotic beauty and its stark social divides. It was here, during a junior analyst role with the city, that she met Kenji Watanabe, a third-generation Japanese American urban planner who shared her pragmatic idealism. They married, and she took his name, building a life together rooted in a shared commitment to public service.\n\nHer career was a steady, determined climb through the city\u2019s bureaucracy. The turning point was a field project in the early 2000s, where she worked directly with a team moving families from a dilapidated SRO into stable housing. Seeing the profound, immediate impact on children\u2019s lives cemented her path. She wasn\u2019t a frontline revolutionary; she was a systems builder, someone who could navigate the labyrinth of policy and funding to make tangible change.\n\nNow, as Deputy Director for the Department of Homelessness, her idealism is tested daily against budget shortfalls and political headwinds. Her 3.8-mile Muni commute is a rolling survey of the very crisis she\u2019s paid to solve. At home, Kenji is her anchor, their conversations a blend of city planning jargon and the simple details of life. Their daughter, Maya, is now studying sociology at UC Santa Cruz, her choice of major a source of quiet pride for Susan.\n\nHer lifestyle is comfortable but not extravagant. Evenings are for unwinding with walks in Golden Gate Park or sharing dim sum on Clement Street. Susan\u2019s greatest aspiration isn't a higher title, but to see a measurable decrease in street homelessness before she retires. She dreams of a San Francisco that lives up to its compassionate mythology, and she carries the weight of that dream to work with her every single day."

Susan watched her open and shut it, mesmerized. The child wasn't just gaining a room; she was gaining privacy, dignity. In that small, repeated motion, Susan felt the abstract weight of policy reports dissolve into a single, profound truth. This was the work. It wasn\u2019t about data points; it was about doors.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the fluorescent buzz in the planning department office, sometime around 1999. She and Kenji were hunched over a map of the Western Addition. He wasn't just talking about setbacks and zoning; he was tracing the invisible lines of community, of displacement. He saw the city not as a grid, but as a living heart. In that shared language of pragmatic idealism, she felt a profound sense of recognition. She wasn't just falling for a man; she was finding her anchor in a city that could otherwise swallow you whole.\n\n3.\nHer first week in San Francisco, back in '97, she took the N-Judah outbound just to see where it went. When the train burst from the Sunset Tunnel into the startling California light, she gasped. The muraled walls, the steep pitch of the street, the palm trees\u2014it felt impossibly vibrant compared to the orderly grid of Cleveland. It was chaotic, beautiful, and broken all at once. In that moment, she knew she couldn\u2019t just study this city; she had to become part of its messy, ongoing story.\n\n4.\nLast year, it was a FaceTime call, Maya\u2019s face framed by a dorm room window overlooking the redwoods. \u201cMom, I\u2019m declaring. It\u2019s sociology.\u201d Susan felt a warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the tea in her hands. It wasn't the pre-law or business track other parents boasted about. It was a commitment to understanding people, to questioning systems. It was a quiet affirmation that the values she and Kenji had lived were the ones their daughter had chosen to carry forward.\n\n5.\nRiding the 5-Fulton home last winter, the bus was delayed. A woman, no older than her own daughter, was having a public, heartbreaking breakdown on the sidewalk. Susan felt the familiar, triple-pronged sting: the professional\u2019s assessment, the citizen\u2019s frustration, and the human\u2019s gut-wrenching empathy. She held her briefcase tighter, the weight of reports and budgets feeling both immense and utterly inadequate. That image became a touchstone for her resolve. The work was not abstract; it had a face, and it was waiting at a bus stop."
