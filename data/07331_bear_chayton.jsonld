The son of a Sicangu Lakota jeweler and an Irish-American social worker, he grew up with the scent of sage and sweetgrass mingling with the drone of the evening news. His father, a man of few words, taught him that hands could speak more eloquently than the mouth. Chayton watched him channel grief over a lost relative into the intricate, patient beadwork of a medallion, a lesson that lodged deep in his young soul. Art wasn't just decoration; it was a language for emotions too sacred or painful to name.\n\nThis understanding guided him away from the plains and toward a deeper study of the human mind. After earning a psychology degree, he sought a program that honored his belief in non-verbal healing. He found it in San Francisco, pursuing a Master's in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in Art Therapy. The city, with its culture of radical acceptance and its layered, vibrant communities, felt like a place where his own mixed heritage wasn't an anomaly but a norm.\n\nNow 39, Chayton has built a quiet, impactful life. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the sanctuary he\u2019s created in his Inner Sunset apartment, where a sunlit room serves as his private practice. His days have a gentle rhythm: a morning run through the misty eucalyptus groves of Golden Gate Park, followed by telehealth and in-person sessions where he helps clients navigate trauma through clay, paint, and charcoal. He guides them in finding their own visual language, just as his father taught him.\n\nHis social circle is small and intimate, comprised of fellow therapists and local artists. Evenings are often his own, dedicated to his personal art\u2014large canvases that blend Lakota symbolism with the foggy, abstract landscapes of the Pacific coast. Chayton\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he found his professional calling here, and the city\u2019s proximity to the vastness of the ocean provides a necessary echo of the wide-open skies of his youth. His quiet dream is to one day secure funding for a non-profit, bringing free art therapy to urban Native youth in the Bay Area, helping a new generation translate their own complex histories into a language of healing and hope."
