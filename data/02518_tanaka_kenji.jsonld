As the Operations Manager for a transitional housing non-profit in SoMa, his home and his office are one and the same.\n\nThe son of third-generation Japanese American (Sansei) parents, Kenji grew up in the quiet, foggy rows of the Sunset District. His father, a stoic gardener, preached practicality, while his mother instilled in him a deep, unspoken sense of community responsibility, a legacy of families who had supported each other through internment and resettlement. Following his father\u2019s advice, Kenji pursued a Bachelor\u2019s in Business Administration, viewing it as a stable path.\n\nHe found success in the late 90s, working in logistics for a booming tech startup. He had the salary, the downtown apartment, and the hollow feeling that came with optimizing supply chains for products he didn\u2019t care about. The dot-com bust of 2001 was his reluctant liberation. Laid off and adrift, he began volunteering at a local food bank to fill his days. It was there, sorting cans and talking with clients, that he found a sense of purpose the corporate world never offered.\n\nThis was his key turning point. He cashed in his remaining stock options and took a massive pay cut for an entry-level position at a small non-profit. His business degree, once a tool for profit, became invaluable for managing grants, budgets, and facility operations. He thrived, working his way up to his current role.\n\nNow 50, Kenji\u2019s daily routine is a blend of administrative rigor and human connection. Mornings are for spreadsheets and vendor calls; afternoons are for checking in on residents, coordinating repair work, or simply listening. His social life is woven into the fabric of the organization\u2014shared meals with staff, mentoring a young resident, and quiet evenings reading in his small apartment above the common area. His one personal indulgence is a small, meticulously-tended Japanese rock garden on the building\u2019s roof, a nod to his father and his heritage. Kenji\u2019s hope is not for personal wealth, but for the long-term stability of the shelter. His dream is no longer a corner office, but a secure roof for everyone else."
