Raised in the quiet, manicured suburbs of Walnut Creek by a high school math teacher and a dental hygienist, his childhood was defined by a profound, almost instinctual grasp of numbers. While his friends were playing video games, Alex was finding beauty in calculus proofs, seeing the world as a system of elegant, solvable equations.\n\nThis passion led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Theoretical Physics, dreaming of a life in academia chasing cosmic truths. The turning point was a junior-year internship he took on a whim at a San Francisco hedge fund. Initially, he was cynical, viewing finance as a soulless application of his craft. But he was quickly seduced by the sheer complexity and immediate feedback of the market. The problems were just as challenging as cosmology, but the results were tangible, displayed in real-time profit and loss. He had found a new, more ruthless, intellectual arena.\n\nUpon graduation, he accepted a lucrative offer as a quantitative analyst. Today, at 24, his commute is a ten-foot walk from his bed to his multi-monitor setup in a sleek Hayes Valley apartment. His world is largely digital. He rises before dawn to align with East Coast markets, spending his days building predictive models and writing algorithms. His colleagues are avatars on Slack; his connection to the global economy is more intimate than his connection to his own neighbors.\n\nWhile financially secure, Alex grapples with a burgeoning sense of isolation. His social life consists of occasional awkward dates and superficial chats with baristas. He lives in one of the world's most vibrant cities but experiences it mostly through food delivery apps and the view from his window. His quiet hope is to find a way to bridge the abstract and the real\u2014to apply his formidable skills to a problem with more human impact than market prediction. He dreams of logging off, walking out his door, and finally solving the equation of a meaningful life in San Francisco."
