A native of San Francisco\u2019s Outer Richmond district, she grew up surrounded by the salty air from Ocean Beach and the rhythmic clang of the N-Judah streetcar. Her parents, industrious and quiet, poured their lives into a small neighborhood business, instilling in Jiyeon a profound sense of duty and a pragmatic outlook. She was a bright, organized student on a clear path to a state university, with dreams of becoming an urban planner.\n\nThe turning point came at eighteen. Her father suffered a sudden, debilitating health crisis, requiring long-term care that the family\u2019s modest income couldn\u2019t support. Without a second thought, Jiyeon abandoned her college applications and took a temp job in a warehouse to help make ends meet. It was there, amidst the chaos of packing slips and shipping manifests, that she discovered an innate talent for creating order. She could see patterns in the logistical flow, streamlining processes with an efficiency that quickly caught her manager\u2019s eye.\n\nWithin two years, she turned the temp gig into a full-time position as a Logistics Coordinator for a Bay Area sustainable goods company. Now, at 25, her commute is nonexistent. She works entirely from her small, tidy apartment, a world away from the company's downtown hub. Her days are a disciplined routine of spreadsheets, emails, and video calls, managing a complex web of global shipments from her second-story window overlooking Fulton Street. Her social life is small but meaningful, centered on her parents and a few loyal high school friends who understand her obligations.\n\nWhile she feels a quiet pride in her self-sufficiency, a restlessness has begun to stir. Her San Francisco isn't the trendy nightlife of the Mission or the tech-fueled energy of SoMa; it's the foggy morning walks to Golden Gate Park and picking up groceries for her mother. Jiyeon dreams of translating her skills into something of her own\u2014perhaps a meticulously organized boutique plant shop or a small, efficient coffee bar. She aspires to build a life that is not just a reaction to circumstance, but a conscious, deliberate creation of her own design."
