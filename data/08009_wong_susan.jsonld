Her entire world exists within a single, three-story building in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District\u2014the same one her parents, immigrants from Guangdong, bought in the 1970s after years of scrimping and saving. Growing up, Susan was the quiet, dutiful daughter, helping in her family\u2019s ground-floor laundromat while dreaming of a life beyond the neighborhood fog.\n\nHer escape route was supposed to be a degree from San Francisco State University. For two promising years, she studied graphic design, captivated by color theory and clean lines. But when her mother suffered a stroke, Susan put her education on hold to come home. The hold became permanent. Her mother had run an informal daycare for neighborhood kids, and Susan took over, discovering an unexpected patience and joy in the controlled chaos of early childhood education.\n\nThe turning point was subtle. There was no single day she decided to give up on her art degree; it simply faded as the needs of the children in her care grew more pressing. She eventually formalized the daycare into the licensed \u201cLittle Sprouts Preschool,\u201d which she now runs out of the same ground-floor space where the laundromat once stood. Her commute is a single flight of stairs from her apartment above.\n\nSusan never married or had children of her own, but her life is full. She is a permanent fixture in the lives of dozens of local families, the keeper of their first words and scraped knees. Her social life revolves around the parents she chats with at pickup time and the owners of the Clement Street markets she visits daily. Her old dream of graphic design resurfaces in the vibrant, paint-smeared art projects that cover the preschool\u2019s walls. Her aspirations are now smaller, but no less profound: she dreams of installing a new, safer climbing structure in the small backyard and hopes to one day take a quiet trip to see the European art she once studied only in textbooks. Susan\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn\u2019t one of landmarks or cable cars, but of watching generations grow up on a single, well-loved block."
