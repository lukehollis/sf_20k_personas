Growing up in a small town near Fresno, she was acutely aware of the invisible forces that shaped people's lives. Her father, a farm equipment mechanic, battled chronic asthma, a condition Chloe later understood was exacerbated by the valley's poor air quality. This early, personal exposure to a public health crisis planted a seed of purpose in her. She watched her practical, hardworking parents navigate a flawed healthcare system, and she resolved to understand it from the inside out.\n\nAt UC Davis, Chloe bypassed more direct pre-med routes and pursued a Bachelor's degree in Public Health. She was fascinated by the data, the patterns, and the societal structures that determined health outcomes more than individual choices ever could. Her studies weren't just academic; they were a way to decode her own family's story. Upon graduating, she landed a coveted position as a Research Assistant at a prestigious UCSF lab, a move that brought her to San Francisco.\n\nNow, at 25, Chloe\u2019s life is a study in focus. Her 0.0-mile commute is a function of her small, rent-controlled studio apartment in Parnassus Heights, just a short walk from the medical campus where she works. Her days are structured and meticulous, spent analyzing datasets for studies on respiratory illnesses. She finds a profound sense of meaning in contributing, however minutely, to the very science that might one day help families like hers.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is centered in this academic bubble, but she finds her release in long, solitary runs through Golden Gate Park. On weekends, her small circle of friends\u2014mostly fellow grad students and researchers\u2014drags her out to explore the Mission for its vibrant food scene or to used bookstores in the Haight. Chloe\u2019s ambition is clear and unwavering: she is saving diligently to pursue a Master's degree, and eventually a PhD. Her dream isn't one of wealth or fame, but of authoring research that leads to policy change, ensuring that where a person lives doesn't have to be a determinant of how well they breathe."
