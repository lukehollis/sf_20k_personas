It\u2019s a peace he cultivated over a lifetime of navigating dualities. Raised in Cupertino, he was the son of a pragmatic Taiwanese immigrant engineer and a compassionate Filipina-American nurse. His childhood was a quiet tug-of-war between his father\u2019s expectation of a lucrative tech career and his mother\u2019s model of finding purpose in caring for others.\n\nHe initially followed his father\u2019s path, enrolling in computer science at UC Davis. However, the logic of code felt hollow. A volunteer stint at a youth crisis hotline became his turning point. The urgency and profound human connection of that work clarified his purpose. He switched his major, much to his father\u2019s initial disappointment, and went on to earn a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University. The city, with its mosaic of cultures and pronounced need for social services, felt like an immediate home.\n\nNow a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Kai-Wen's career is his calling. He specializes in helping adolescents navigate the same pressures he once felt: family expectations, cultural identity, and the anxieties of modern life. His 1.8-mile commute on the 5-Fulton MUNI bus provides a daily transition between his personal and professional worlds. He lives in a cozy, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect. Their evenings are spent walking through Golden Gate Park or trying new restaurants on Clement Street, a welcome respite from the emotional weight of his workday.\n\nAt 48, Kai-Wen feels a deep sense of contentment. He has reconciled the different parts of his heritage and found a career that honors both his father\u2019s desire for stability and his mother\u2019s call to service. His dream is not of wealth, but of impact. He hopes to one day establish a small mentorship program connecting older San Franciscans with first-generation students, creating the kind of support system he wishes he\u2019d had, right in the city that allowed him to build his own."

His father stood by, explaining the biological process of clotting and scab formation, wanting to fix the problem with logic. Kai-Wen felt both loved and misunderstood, caught between his mother's empathy and his father's analytics. It was the first time he recognized the two distinct worlds he was trying to live between, a duality he\u2019d spend years learning to balance. (Age 10)\n\n2.\nHe remembers the crushing silence on the other end of the line at the youth crisis hotline. A teen's voice, barely a whisper, had finally cracked open. Kai-Wen didn't offer solutions; he just listened, holding the space for their pain. In that shared stillness, the abstract logic of code dissolved, replaced by the urgent reality of human connection. For the first time, he felt not just useful, but necessary. He knew then that he could never go back to his old path. (Age 20)\n\n3.\nYears after Kai-Wen became a social worker, his father visited hisSF apartment for dinner. Looking at his son\u2019s framed LCSW license on the wall, he said quietly, \"Your mother would be so proud. You built something stable by helping others.\" The pragmatism in his father's voice was laced with an unfamiliar respect. It wasn't forgiveness for abandoning engineering; it was an acknowledgment of his son's purpose. The lifelong tension in Kai-Wen's chest finally eased, the two halves of his upbringing finally reconciled. (Age 35)\n\n4.\nLast autumn, he and his partner were walking through the AIDS Memorial Grove as the light faded. After a particularly heavy day at the high school, his mind was racing. His partner, a landscape architect, simply took his hand and pointed to the way the light filtered through a Japanese maple. They stood in silence, anchored by the quiet beauty. In that moment, he felt the profound peace of a balanced life\u2014a shared home, meaningful work, and this simple, grounding love that made it all possible. (Age 47)\n\n5.\nRiding the 5-Fulton home on a foggy evening, he overheard a high school student excitedly telling her friend about getting into SF State. She spoke Tagalog with a thick Bay Area accent. Kai-Wen saw himself in her\u2014a first-generation kid on the cusp of a dream, navigating the city's complex currents. He caught her eye and gave a small, encouraging nod. The brief, shared acknowledgment solidified his desire: he had to build that mentorship program, to help chart the waters for those coming right behind him. (Age 48)"
