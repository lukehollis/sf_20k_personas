The son of a detail-oriented German-American architect and a free-spirited Korean-American ceramicist who met at the California College of the Arts (CCA), Julian grew up in the fog-kissed Inner Richmond. His childhood home was a study in contrasts: drafting tables and blueprints in his father's office, and the earthy smell of clay and glaze from his mother\u2019s garage studio. This environment instilled in him a deep appreciation for both structured design and handmade form.\n\nHis path felt pre-ordained. While his friends were focused on coding, Julian spent his high school years obsessing over product design. A key turning point was building a custom longboard from scratch, using a friend\u2019s primitive CNC router to perfectly carve the deck. The thrill of turning a digital file into a physical, functional object of beauty set his career trajectory. He pursued his passion, earning an MFA in Industrial Design from his parents' alma mater, CCA, a decision that felt like coming home.\n\nNow 27, Julian lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District, a vibrant world away from his quiet upbringing. He works as a Digital Fabrication Specialist at a manufacturing and prototyping lab in the Dogpatch. His 3.5-mile bike commute is a daily ritual, taking him from the mural-lined streets of his neighborhood to the post-industrial workshops by the bay. At work, he is the crucial link between idea and reality, operating 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC mills to create prototypes for tech startups and independent designers.\n\nHis social life revolves around a tight-knit group of fellow makers and old city friends, often meeting for cheap burritos or beers at a local brewery. He\u2019s been in a steady relationship with Clara, a graphic designer he met in grad school. Though his $95,000 salary is comfortable, Julian is diligently saving. His ultimate dream isn\u2019t a mortgage, but the capital to launch his own small-batch fabrication studio, creating sustainable, beautifully designed furniture and home goods. For Julian, a true native, San Francisco isn\u2019t just a city; it\u2019s the material he\u2019s been shaping his entire life."

Her hands, stained with terra cotta, expertly centered a lump on the wheel. With a dusty finger, he traced the clean, sharp lines on one of his father\u2019s discarded blueprints. It wasn\u2019t a choice between two worlds; it was the quiet realization that they were one. That memory rooted his belief that precision and organic form could, and should, coexist beautifully.\n\n2.\nAt sixteen, in a friend\u2019s garage, he stood mesmerized by the CNC router\u2019s hum. After hours of tweaking a digital file, the machine slowly carved his vision into a blank of maple. When it fell silent, he lifted the longboard deck. The curve was perfect, the weight substantial. It was no longer just pixels; it was a physical thing of beauty he could ride. That tangible magic was a jolt, solidifying his path more than any career test ever could.\n\n3.\nFirst year of grad school at CCA. He and Clara were working late in the woodshop, the air thick with the scent of sawdust. He glanced from the familiar industrial machines to Clara, her brow furrowed in concentration. He realized he was standing exactly where his parents had met, surrounded by the same creative energy. It wasn't just continuing a legacy; it was the profound, comforting feeling of finally being in the right place, at the right time, with the right person.\n\n4.\nJust last week, biking down 17th Street. The morning light hit the vibrant murals of Clarion Alley to his left, while the industrial skeletons of the Dogpatch loomed ahead. He dodged a delivery truck, smelled roasting coffee from a cafe, and then felt the cool breeze off the bay as he coasted toward the lab. This daily ride isn\u2019t a commute; it\u2019s a cross-section of his SF. It\u2019s a physical reminder that the city's grit and beauty are his raw materials.\n\n5.\nOne Sunday morning in their Mission apartment, sunlight streamed through the bay window. Julian was sketching a chair design while Clara arranged thrift-store finds on their shelves. He looked from his drawing to their curated space and felt a surge of clarity. He didn\u2019t just want to *make* things; he wanted to build a life around them *with her*. He showed her the sketch, and the quiet, supportive nod she gave him wasn\u2019t just approval; it was the foundation he knew he was building on."
