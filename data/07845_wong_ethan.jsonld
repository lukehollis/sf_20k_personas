Born and raised in the Richmond District, Ethan is a product of a San Francisco that feels both distant and immediate. His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small, bustling laundromat where the scent of warm cotton and the rhythmic chime of the door defined his childhood. They instilled in him a quiet diligence, hoping he would pursue a career far from the grueling hours of a family business.\n\nHe began that path at San Francisco State University, tentatively studying graphic design. His future felt abstract and full of artistic potential until his sophomore year when his mother was diagnosed with a rapidly progressing form of cancer. College became an unaffordable luxury and a distant priority. Ethan dropped out, spending his days and nights at the UCSF Medical Center on Parnassus, navigating the confusing maze of corridors and appointments. It was there, watching the steady, calming presence of the patient transporters, that he found an unexpected direction.\n\nAfter his mother passed, Ethan, adrift and needing stable work, applied for the very job he had come to respect. Now, two decades later, he is a veteran transporter. His work is a physically demanding, emotionally delicate ballet of moving people at their most vulnerable. He has mastered the art of a gentle lift, a reassuring word, and the silent empathy that fills the space in a hospital elevator.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is from a small, rent-controlled studio apartment just a block from the hospital. His life is a routine of shifts, punctuated by solitary walks in Golden Gate Park or grabbing pho on Irving Street. His colleagues\u2014fellow transporters, nurses, and techs\u2014are his true family, bonded by shared stress and gallows humor. He has no grand dreams of wealth or fame. Instead, he hopes to one day finish his degree online, perhaps in sociology, not for a new career but for himself. His deeper aspiration remains unchanged each day: to be a small point of comfort and dignity in the overwhelming machinery of healing and loss, a quiet constant in his ever-changing city."
