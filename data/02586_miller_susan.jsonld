Raised in a quiet suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, by a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, her upbringing was stable, predictable, and miles away from the life she leads now. An introspective child, she developed a love for art and structure, which led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History. She imagined a life spent curating museum exhibits, a quiet world of dates and canvases.\n\nThe financial reality of the art world hit hard after graduation. In the late 1990s, drawn by the siren song of opportunity and a friend\u2019s spare couch, she moved to San Francisco. She took a temp job as an administrative assistant at a burgeoning dot-com, intending it to be a brief detour. Instead, it became her path. Susan discovered her talent wasn't in analyzing art, but in managing the chaotic process of its creation in a new medium: software. Her methodical nature and keen eye for detail made her a natural at coordinating projects and managing timelines. She rose through the ranks, from coordinator to manager, and is now a Production Supervisor, respected for her calm demeanor in the face of impossible deadlines.\n\nHer personal life mirrored the city\u2019s boom-and-bust cycle. A whirlwind marriage to a software engineer in the early 2000s ended as quickly as it began, leaving her with a hard-won sense of self-reliance and her rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley. She has remained there ever since, a veteran of tech\u2019s shifting tides.\n\nToday, Susan\u2019s 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from her bedroom to her home office. Her days are a blur of Slack messages and video calls, managing teams across different time zones. She finds solace in her routine: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee, an evening yoga class, and cooking elaborate meals. Her social circle is small but deep, comprised of other women who have carved out their own niches in the city. Her dream is no longer professional ambition but personal fulfillment. She fantasizes about early retirement, using her savings to travel not for work, but for pleasure\u2014perhaps to finally see the European masterpieces she only ever studied in books."
