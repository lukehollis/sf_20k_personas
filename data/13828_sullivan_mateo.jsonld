Born in Hayward to an Irish-American union carpenter and a meticulous first-generation immigrant seamstress from Oaxaca, Mexico, he grew up with hands that understood both the heft of a hammer and the precision of a needle. His upbringing was a blend of boisterous union hall picnics and quiet evenings watching his mother transform fabric into art. This duality\u2014pragmatism and artistry\u2014would define his path.\n\nHe excelled in math and science, earning a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Cal Poly. His early career was spent in the sprawling, impersonal manufacturing plants of the Central Valley. While competent, he felt like a cog in a vast machine, a frustration that led him to pursue an MBA at night from SF State. The degree was a tool, a lever to gain control not just over production lines, but over his own destiny.\n\nThe turning point came when he was headhunted by a boutique architectural hardware firm based in San Francisco. Here, engineering met high design. The company crafted exquisite, custom-milled door handles, faucets, and fixtures for high-end projects. It was the perfect synthesis of his father\u2019s practicality and his mother\u2019s artistry. He rose quickly, becoming Director of Production.\n\nTen years ago, the live-work loft directly above the company\u2019s Dogpatch workshop became available. Mateo seized the opportunity, eliminating his commute and weaving his life completely into his work. His home is now a sanctuary of clean lines and warm wood, overlooking the industrial cranes and shimmering bay. His daily routine is a short walk downstairs to the workshop floor, the scent of coffee from his kitchen mingling with the faint smell of metal oil. He manages global logistics from his sunlit home office but remains physically connected to the craftspeople he leads.\n\nAt 48, Mateo is divorced, a past casualty of his professional focus. His social life is small but meaningful, centered on a few friends from the neighborhood\u2014a brewer, a furniture designer. His dream is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder but perfecting the one he\u2019s on. He aspires to see his company\u2019s work as a hallmark of timeless San Francisco design, a small, tangible legacy of quality in a city obsessed with the ephemeral."
