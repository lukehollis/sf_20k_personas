The only son of first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong, his childhood smelled of Five-Spice and sounded of the clatter from his parents\u2019 small Clement Street grocery store. They envisioned a future for him in engineering or medicine\u2014stable, prestigious, and far from the grueling hours of retail. But Lawrence was the quiet, introspective one, more interested in the stories of the neighborhood regulars than in calculus.\n\nHis turning point came during his undergraduate years at UC Davis. While his parents believed he was pursuing a pre-med track, a volunteer position at a youth shelter exposed him to the systemic fractures running through society. He saw firsthand the impact of trauma, poverty, and neglect. It was a stark, undeniable calling. He changed his major, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State, a decision that initially caused a rift with his pragmatic parents.\n\nFor over two decades, Lawrence has been a licensed clinical social worker, finding his niche supporting adolescents within the city\u2019s public school system and affiliated health clinics. He is a steady, calming presence in the chaotic lives of teens navigating everything from academic pressure to housing insecurity. He earns a comfortable living, but in San Francisco, it affords a stable, not extravagant, life.\n\nHis daily routine is a testament to his roots. He leaves his rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond and catches the 5 Fulton Muni bus, a 2.5-mile journey that gives him time to mentally prepare for the day. He\u2019s married to a landscape architect, David, and they share a quiet life centered on walks in Golden Gate Park, cooking, and hosting small dinners for a close-knit circle of friends.\n\nLawrence feels a profound, almost familial, connection to San Francisco. He sees its beauty in the resilient kids he counsels, but he also carries the weight of its failures. His dream isn\u2019t to get rich or famous; it\u2019s the simple, monumental hope of seeing his most vulnerable students graduate and find a foothold in a city that is increasingly hard to call home. At 49, he is tired but deeply committed, a quiet anchor in the ever-turbulent tides of his city."

But Lawrence watches her gnarled fingers count out the coins, her gaze distant. In that moment, he isn\u2019t seeing a transaction; he\u2019s wondering about the photos on her mantelpiece and the sadness in her eyes. It was the first time he realized every person was a story, not a sale. This quiet curiosity would become the bedrock of his entire career. (Age 10)\n\n2.\nThe conversation happened over a bowl of his mother\u2019s congee. He was 22, home from SF State for the weekend. He finally told them\u2014no medical school, but a Master of Social Work. His mother stopped stirring. His father just looked at his hands, calloused from decades of stocking shelves. The silence was absolute, a chasm of broken expectation he had created. It was the loneliest he had ever felt, but it solidified his resolve. This path was his, and he would have to walk it alone. (Age 22)\n\n3.\nIt was a crumpled envelope in his school mailbox, years after he\u2019d given up hope. Inside was a graduation announcement from Maria, a student he\u2019d counseled through homelessness and an abusive home. She had disappeared a year before graduation. On the back, in hurried script: \u201cYou were the only one who didn\u2019t look away. Thank you.\u201d He held the card all the way home on the 5 Fulton, the quiet weight of it a more profound reward than any salary. It was proof that an anchor sometimes holds. (Age 38)\n\n4.\nStanding on the sidewalk outside a clinic, he watched one of his teens, a bright kid named Kevin, get shoved into the back of a police car. Lawrence had spent months building trust, arranging services, seeing a flicker of hope. And in an instant, the system consumed him. The feeling wasn't anger, but a deep, hollowing exhaustion. It was the moment he truly understood his job wasn't about saving children, but about bearing witness to their resilience in a city that was failing them. (Age 44)\n\n5.\nLast fall, on a rare clear evening, he and David were walking home through Golden Gate Park. The setting sun lit the Conservatory of Flowers like a jewel box. They didn't speak. The air was cool, smelling of eucalyptus and damp earth. He slipped his hand into David\u2019s, the familiar warmth a quiet comfort against the city\u2019s hum. It wasn\u2019t a grand moment, but it was everything: a shared peace, a simple life built together, a reason to face the turbulence of another day. (Age 48)"
