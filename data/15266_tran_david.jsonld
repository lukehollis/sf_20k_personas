The only son of Vietnamese refugees who settled in the Tenderloin in the late 1970s, David\u2019s childhood was a crash course in navigation\u2014not just of city streets, but of complex social systems. From a young age, he was the family\u2019s primary translator, filling out medical forms and mediating with landlords. He witnessed firsthand the quiet struggles of his community, a reality that planted the seed for his future career.\n\nThis experience led him to San Francisco State University, where a Bachelor's in Social Work felt less like a choice and more like a calling. His first job was as a case manager for a non-profit serving immigrant families, a role he was born to fill. The turning point came a decade into his career. He successfully guided a newly arrived family through a labyrinthine housing and healthcare crisis, preventing their homelessness. The profound relief on their faces solidified his purpose, but also made him realize he could have a broader impact by guiding other case workers.\n\nNow 48, David is a Case Manager Supervisor, a position that has shifted him from the front lines to a leadership role. His days are less about direct client interaction and more about managing his team, securing funding, and navigating bureaucracy\u2014a different kind of battle, but one he fights with the same tenacity.\n\nHis life is rooted in a steady rhythm. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with his partner of fifteen years, Maria, a public school teacher. His 2.8-mile commute on the 38-Geary bus is a time for reflection, watching the city he knows so intimately scroll by. Evenings are for home-cooked meals, walks in Golden Gate Park, and the quiet comfort of their shared life. He remains deeply connected to the city of his birth, finding solace in the familiar dim sum parlors of his neighborhood.\n\nDavid\u2019s dream isn\u2019t one of wealth, but of legacy. He hopes to mentor a new generation of empathetic, effective social workers. His aspiration is to ensure the systems that once bewildered his parents become more humane and accessible for the next wave of families seeking their footing in San Francisco."

His mother\u2019s hand gripped his as he translated the doctor's words about \u201cchronic inflammation,\u201d a term foreign on his tongue. He saw the confusion and fear in his mother's eyes, a look that made him feel impossibly old. A hot, adult weight settled on his small shoulders. In that moment, he understood that language could be a wall. He would spend his life learning how to tear those walls down for families just like his own.\n\n2.\nThe steam from the bamboo baskets at Clement Restaurant mixed with the pride of his first real paycheck. He was 23 and insisted on paying for dim sum. His father, a man of few words, gave a short, sharp nod, a gesture that contained a universe of approval. The taste of the har gow was different that day\u2014it was the flavor of providing, of beginning to repay a debt of love he could never fully settle. He wasn't just their translator anymore; he was a son standing on his own.\n\n3.\nHe was 36. The call confirming a family's housing approval came on a rainy Tuesday. He ran three blocks to their SRO, the official letter protected inside his jacket. When he explained the news, the mother simply wept, clutching a document she couldn\u2019t read but understood completely. Her profound relief was a physical force. In that moment, he felt the immense satisfaction of saving one family, but also an urgent need to fix the broken system so others wouldn't have to face that same precipice.\n\n4.\nFifteen years ago, after a brutal week, he and Maria walked through Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. Neither spoke of the eviction notice or the struggling student that haunted their respective days. He felt the tension in his shoulders ease, not from words, but from her quiet presence beside him. He understood then that love wasn't about grand passion, but about creating a shared, silent sanctuary from the city\u2019s harsh edges. Their bond became the anchor for his resilience.\n\n5.\nRiding the 38-Geary home last month, he watched a teenage girl patiently explain a Muni fare app to her grandmother in Cantonese. He recognized his own past in her tired focus and protective posture. The sight didn\u2019t bring sadness, but a profound sense of continuity. The struggle was the same, just with new technology. It solidified his resolve to mentor her generation, to ensure the systems they were forced to navigate would one day treat them with the dignity they deserved."
