The son of a Brazilian-Jewish jeweler and a Mexican-Catholic muralist, he grew up in Los Angeles in a home filled with the scent of simmering feijoada, the sound of multiple languages, and a deep appreciation for aesthetics and community. Watching L.A.'s endless sprawl, he became fascinated by the invisible lines that divide and connect neighborhoods, which propelled him to study Urban Planning at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.\n\nDrawn to its dense, human-scale urbanism, Rafael moved to San Francisco after graduation in the early 1990s. His key turning point came while working as a junior planner during the redevelopment following the Loma Prieta earthquake. Witnessing the removal of the Central Freeway and the subsequent rebirth of Hayes Valley was a professional crucible. It crystallized his belief that thoughtful design could heal a city. This experience guided his career path away from municipal bureaucracy and into private consulting, where he felt he could have a more direct impact. Now a Principal Environmental Consultant, he navigates the complex, often-fraught relationship between developers and California\u2019s stringent environmental regulations, specializing in sustainable, high-density infill projects.\n\nNow 52, Rafael lives a life of curated intention. An amicable divorce in his late thirties left him with a deep appreciation for quiet independence and a close circle of long-time friends. He resides, fittingly, in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, just blocks from the park that replaced the freeway that once defined his career. His daily routine begins with a strong coffee and a walk to the Muni stop for his 2.8-mile commute downtown. Evenings are often spent at SFJAZZ, volunteering on a neighborhood planning committee, or simply reading at a local wine bar.\n\nRafael has achieved professional stability, but his aspirations have shifted from personal advancement to legacy. He dreams of mentoring a new generation of planners who prioritize equity and ecology over pure profit. His ultimate hope is to see San Francisco successfully implement truly bold, sustainable housing solutions, leaving the city he loves more livable and resilient for the future."

His mother, stirring a pot of feijoada, explained that a good recipe, like her murals, was about layering. His father, polishing a silver ring, added that beauty comes from joining different elements\u2014just like his work. Rafael felt a profound sense of harmony in that moment, the blending of food, art, and family. It was his first, unspoken lesson in how disparate parts could form a cohesive, beautiful whole, a principle that would later define his approach to cities.\n\n2.\nHe was 24, a junior planner in a hard hat, standing where a section of the Central Freeway had just been demolished. Dust still hung in the air, but for the first time, he saw uninterrupted sky over Hayes Street. It wasn't just rubble; it was a wound healing. In that visceral moment of civic surgery, he understood that cities weren't static. They could be corrected and reborn. This raw, powerful potential for urban renewal became the cornerstone of his entire professional ethos, shifting his path forever.\n\n3.\nAt 39, after the papers were signed, he stood alone in his new, empty Hayes Valley condo. The divorce had been kind, but this was the moment it became real. He looked out the window at Patricia\u2019s Green, the park that had replaced the freeway he helped remove. There was no sadness, just a profound, quiet clarity. He was the sole architect of this new life. That evening marked the beginning of his true independence, teaching him to find contentment not in partnership, but in a well-chosen view and his own company.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a tense meeting in his mid-forties. A developer wanted to scrap a proposed public courtyard\u2014a \u201cvalue-engineered\u201d cut to maximize profit. Rafael calmly laid out the environmental impact report, but spoke from the heart about public space as the city's living room. He risked the contract, but the developer conceded. The victory felt less like a win and more like a quiet affirmation. This was why he\u2019d gone private: to have that specific fight, to defend the soul of a project, one small green space at a time.\n\n5.\nJust last year, after a long neighborhood planning meeting, a young Latinx student approached him, her notebook full of questions about equitable development. In her impassioned energy, he saw his younger self\u2014the kid from L.A. fascinated by invisible lines. As he answered her questions, a new sense of purpose clicked into place. His work was no longer just about buildings or regulations; it was about passing the tools to this next generation. This brief exchange reoriented his ambition from building a career to building a legacy."
