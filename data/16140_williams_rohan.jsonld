Born in Oakland to a Welsh-American architect father and a first-generation mother from Mumbai, his childhood was a blend of classic rock, Bollywood films, and spirited dinner table debates. This upbringing instilled in him a deep appreciation for storytelling and diverse perspectives, naturally guiding him to pursue a journalism degree at San Francisco State University in the early 1990s.\n\nHis career began in the ink-and-paper world of a local newspaper, covering city hall and community affairs. The key turning point came with the dot-com bust and the subsequent rise of digital media. While many colleagues resisted the shift, Rohan saw an opportunity. He taught himself basic HTML and content management systems, pivoting from print reporter to a pioneering digital editor. This foresight secured his career through years of industry upheaval, eventually landing him his current role as a Senior Digital Editor, where he manages a team of younger journalists covering Bay Area tech and culture.\n\nA significant personal turning point was his divorce five years ago. His wife of fifteen years, weary of the city's expense and relentless pace, moved to the quieter Pacific Northwest. Rohan, however, couldn't imagine leaving. San Francisco wasn't just where he worked; it was his anchor. The split was amicable but left him with a quiet solitude he has since learned to embrace.\n\nToday, Rohan lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Hayes Valley. His daily routine is a ritual: coffee from a local cafe, a short ride on the MUNI to his downtown office, and evenings often spent with a close-knit circle of friends, many of whom are fellow \"lifers\" in the city. He\u2019s a familiar face at neighborhood meetings and independent bookstores.\n\nHis professional ambitions have shifted from climbing the ladder to creating a legacy. Rohan dreams of launching a hyper-local history podcast, dedicated to documenting the stories of the city\u2019s disappearing landmarks and long-time residents. He feels a profound duty to preserve the memory of the San Francisco he grew up with, ensuring its soul isn't lost amidst the endless waves of change."

In the living room, his father put on a vinyl copy of Led Zeppelin\u2019s *Physical Graffiti*. The complex drum fills didn\u2019t clash with the drone of a Bollywood soundtrack still lingering in the air from earlier. For Rohan, this wasn't strange. It was a moment of perfect harmony, teaching him that disparate worlds could create something beautiful together. This occurred in the mid-1980s, forming the bedrock of his multicultural identity.\n\n2.\nThe thrum of the printing press vibrated through the concrete floor of the newspaper\u2019s basement in 1996. It was 2 a.m., and Rohan was watching his first front-page byline\u2014a deep dive on city hall corruption\u2014fly through the rollers. The smell of ink and the sheer, industrial power of it all felt sacred. This wasn't just information; it was a physical object, a tangible record. It solidified his belief in journalism as a public trust and a craft, a feeling he now strives to instill in his young digital team.\n\n3.\nIt was late 2001, and the newsroom felt like a tomb. Another round of layoffs had been announced, gutting the news desk. Instead of going home, Rohan sat in the fluorescent gloom and, on a slow dial-up connection, opened a tutorial for basic HTML. He felt a knot of fear, but also a surge of defiant energy. He wasn't just learning to code; he was building his own lifeboat. That night taught him that survival wasn't about holding on tighter to the past, but about having the courage to navigate the future.\n\n4.\nThe final conversation happened on their small Hayes Valley balcony, five years ago. His wife spoke of Oregon\u2019s quiet woods and rain. As she talked, Rohan\u2019s eyes fixed on the distant, stubborn glow of the Sutro Tower. The sadness was immense, but so was the clarity. He couldn\u2019t untangle his identity from the city\u2019s complex web. It was a quiet, heartbreaking choice: San Francisco was not just the backdrop of his life, it was his anchor. He learned then that some loves are etched into a landscape.\n\n5.\nTwo years ago, walking down a familiar street near his old SF State campus, he saw it: the funky, cluttered bookstore where he\u2019d spent countless hours was gone, replaced by a sterile, white-walled kombucha bar. The erasure felt like a physical blow. It wasn't just a store that had vanished, but a piece of his own story. In that moment of sharp grief, the podcast idea was born\u2014not as a hobby, but as an urgent mission to preserve the city\u2019s soul before it was all renovated away."
