The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a tapestry of diligent schoolwork and long hours spent helping her parents. She witnessed their tireless work ethic and their struggle to compete against a world that was rapidly digitizing. This early exposure to the human cost of disruption planted a seed of inquiry that would define her career.\n\nAcademically gifted, Sarah pursued an undergraduate degree at UCLA before returning to the Bay Area for a Master of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. It was here that she found her calling. A key turning point came during a research project analyzing how platform-based gig work was displacing traditional small businesses, an issue that mirrored her own family\u2019s experience. The theoretical suddenly became deeply personal. She decided to dedicate her career to navigating the complex intersection of technological innovation and societal well-being.\n\nNow 36, Sarah is a policy analyst for a major tech company, a role she finds both fulfilling and fraught with moral complexity. Working from her meticulously organized apartment in Hayes Valley, her 0.0-mile commute offers no separation between work and life. Her days are a blur of video calls, data analysis, and crafting policy briefs that attempt to steer her company toward more ethical practices.\n\nHer personal life is intentionally curated. She maintains a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly from her graduate program, with whom she debates ethics and explores the city's culinary scene. After years of casual dating, she longs for a deeper connection but finds the transient nature of San Francisco relationships challenging.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to the city is layered. She loves the vibrancy of Hayes Valley, starting her mornings with coffee from a local roaster and taking meditative walks through Patricia\u2019s Green. Yet, she remains acutely aware of the inequalities her industry helps perpetuate. Her ultimate dream is to leave the corporate world and join a federal regulatory agency or a non-profit, becoming a true public advocate. For now, she fights her battles from the inside, a quiet, determined force trying to code a better conscience into the machines shaping our future."
