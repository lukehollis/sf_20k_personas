His 0.0-mile commute is no tech-industry perk; he lives in a small, subsidized apartment on the top floor of the Sakura Senior Residence, the same building where he works as a healthcare assistant.\n\nBorn and raised in the Richmond District, Kenji is the only son of Japanese immigrants who instilled in him a powerful sense of duty, or *giri*. His father was a meticulous landscaper for the city\u2019s wealthy, his mother a seamstress whose fingers were never still. Kenji, however, dreamed of a different path. In his early twenties, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco, finding his passion not in pragmatic trades but in the stark, revealing world of black-and-white photography. He saw stories in the city\u2019s fog-draped architecture and the tired faces on the Muni bus.\n\nThat dream was cut short when his mother was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. Kenji dropped his classes without a second thought, becoming her primary caregiver. The years that followed were a blur of appointments, difficult nights, and stolen moments of clarity. He put his camera away. In tending to his mother, however, he discovered an unexpected wellspring of patience and empathy.\n\nAfter she passed, Kenji was adrift. The skills he\u2019d learned were not on a degree but were etched into his soul. A position at Sakura Senior Residence felt like a natural, if somber, progression. Now, at 48, his days are structured around the needs of others. He helps Mrs. Sato with her medication, reads the newspaper aloud to Mr. Kimura, and listens to endless tales of an older San Francisco he can only imagine. These residents have become his surrogate family, their trust his greatest reward.\n\nHis personal life is quiet. He has a few friends he meets for ramen, but his deepest connection is to the neighborhood. On his days off, he finally uses his old film camera again, capturing the dignified faces of his residents (with permission) and the changing light on the Peace Pagoda. His hope is no longer for gallery shows but for something simpler: to save enough money to visit his parents' home village near Kumamoto, to photograph the place they came from, and to continue providing comfort to those at the end of their own long journeys."
