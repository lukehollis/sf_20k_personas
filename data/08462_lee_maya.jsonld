Born in Busan, South Korea, she immigrated to Daly City with her parents at age nine. Her childhood was defined by the steam-filled air of her family\u2019s laundromat, a world of tireless work and parental expectations for a practical future she never felt was her own. While her parents envisioned her becoming a pharmacist or an accountant, Maya found solace in sketching the faces of customers in the margins of her notebooks.\n\nHer education ended with a GED, a pragmatic choice made while helping her family stay afloat. The turning point came at 22, after a tense, unspoken conflict over her refusal to enroll in community college for a \u201csensible\u201d degree. Seeking autonomy, she moved to San Francisco with meager savings, finding a line cook position through a temp agency. The job was meant to be temporary, but the location\u2014a bustling caf\u00e9 inside a major arts institution\u2014felt like fate. It placed her, an admirer of art, in its very temple, albeit through the service entrance.\n\nMaya\u2019s daily routine is a rhythmic loop. She walks to work before sunrise, tying on her apron to face the heat and relentless pace of the kitchen. She expertly plates quinoa salads and artisan sandwiches, observing the well-dressed patrons through the pass-through window. After her shift, she often uses her employee pass to wander the quiet galleries, her footsteps echoing on the polished floors. This is her San Francisco: not the landmarks, but the hushed, art-filled halls that offer respite from the clamor of her kitchen.\n\nHer social life is contained; she shares a bond of weary camaraderie with her fellow kitchen staff and exchanges polite nods with the museum guards. Her connection to her family is maintained through dutiful weekly phone calls. Maya\u2019s greatest dream isn\u2019t fame or fortune, but to save enough to enroll in a life drawing class at City College. Her most prized possession is a worn sketchbook, now filled with renderings of sculptures and the weary faces she sees on her walk home. For Maya, success would be trading her chef\u2019s knife for a charcoal pencil, finally moving from serving art to creating it."
