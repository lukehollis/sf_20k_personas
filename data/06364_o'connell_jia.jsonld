            "value": "Jia O\u2019Connell is a product of two deliberate worlds. She was raised in Corvallis, Oregon, by her mother, a meticulous materials scientist from Guangzhou, and her father, a third-generation Irish-American woodworker with a reverence for craft. Her childhood was a blend of her mother\u2019s precise, analytical approach and her father\u2019s tactile, intuitive one. While her friends were playing video games, Jia was often found sanding a piece of maple in her father\u2019s workshop or peering through a microscope at crystalline structures with her mother. This dual upbringing instilled in her a unique appreciation for how things are designed and how they are made.\n\nChoosing Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington felt like a natural extension of her upbringing. It was the perfect synthesis of molecular science and large-scale application. A summer internship at a hardware startup in the Bay Area was her pivotal moment. The frenetic energy, the challenge of scaling a prototype into a million-unit production run\u2014it was an intoxicating puzzle she knew she had to solve. Upon graduating, she accepted a position as a Process Engineer and moved into a modern, compact apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District.\n\nHer commute is nonexistent; her living room is her office. Jia\u2019s day is a digital tapestry of video calls with factories in Asia and data analyses on her dual monitors. To counteract the sterile nature of her work, she has immersed herself in the vibrant, tangible world of her neighborhood. Mornings start with a walk to a local panaderia for coffee, and evenings are often spent at a community ceramics studio, her hands covered in clay\u2014a connection back to the workshop of her youth.\n\nHer social life consists of a tight-knit group of fellow tech transplants. They explore the city's food scene and hike the Marin Headlands, all sharing a similar sense of being ambitious outsiders. Jia\u2019s dream is to spearhead a process that significantly reduces electronic waste, making technology more sustainable. Personally, she hopes to one day feel less like a resident of the tech industry who happens to live in the Mission, and more like a true San Franciscan, fully integrated into the complex, chaotic, and beautiful city she now calls home."
