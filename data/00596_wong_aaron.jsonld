He lives in the apartment above \"Wong\u2019s Kitchen,\" the Chinatown restaurant his immigrant parents poured their lives into. At 36, he is the establishment's manager, a title that feels both like an honor and a cage.\n\nGrowing up, Aaron\u2019s childhood was a mix of Cantonese spoken at home and the chaotic symphony of a busy kitchen. He absorbed the business by osmosis\u2014the rhythm of the lunch rush, the art of placating a difficult customer, the smell of roast duck hanging in the window. But he dreamt of a quieter life, one found in books. He escaped to UC Berkeley, losing himself in English literature, imagining a future as a writer or professor, far from the clatter of woks and plates.\n\nThe turning point came a decade ago. His father, the heart and soul of the kitchen, suffered a major stroke. With his mother overwhelmed, Aaron stepped in \u201ctemporarily\u201d to manage the restaurant. Temporary became permanent. He used his intelligence to streamline operations, modernize the ordering system, and manage staff with a calm authority his father never possessed, but the poet inside him went dormant.\n\nHis life now operates on a predictable loop. He wakes to the rumble of the produce truck, spends his day orchestrating the complex dance of a restaurant, and falls asleep to the hum of the refrigerators below. His social life is limited to brief chats with regulars and suppliers. Relationships are fleeting; it\u2019s hard to build a life with someone when you can never truly leave work. His connection to San Francisco is profound yet suffocating\u2014he is a son of Chinatown, tied to its very pavement, but he rarely experiences the city beyond its borders.\n\nAaron\u2019s hope is a quiet, persistent ember. Late at night, after the last table is wiped down, he sits at his small desk upstairs, overlooking the lantern-lit street. He writes, not the novels he once imagined, but sharp, observant poems about the city and the faces he sees every day. His dream is no longer to escape, but to find a synthesis: to one day hire a manager he trusts, allowing him the freedom to finally write his own story, not just manage his family\u2019s."
