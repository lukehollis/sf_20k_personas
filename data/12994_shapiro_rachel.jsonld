Born in Seoul, South Korea, she was adopted as an infant by David and Sarah Shapiro, two warm, intellectual history professors from Berkeley. She grew up in a home overflowing with books and lively debate, instilling in her a deep reverence for the past. While fiercely loved, she always felt a sense of a missing file in her own personal history, a curiosity about her origins that would shape her life\u2019s trajectory.\n\nThis innate pull towards understanding the past guided her educational journey. After earning a history degree from UC Berkeley, she found her true calling not in academia, but in preservation. She pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, specializing in digital records. It felt right\u2014organizing the chaotic, ephemeral data of the modern world provided a sense of order she craved. Today, she works as a Digital Archivist for a major foundation in SoMa, meticulously preserving digital correspondence, photographs, and records that tell the stories of communities and movements.\n\nA key turning point came in her late twenties during a trip to Seoul. Her search for her birth family ended in bureaucratic dead ends, a quiet but profound disappointment. Yet, the trip was not a failure. Walking the streets of her birth city, she realized her identity wasn't a mystery to be solved, but a life she was actively building. She returned to the Bay Area with a newfound sense of peace and purpose.\n\nNow 44, Rachel lives a life of curated contentment in the Inner Sunset. Her daily routine is anchored by the rhythmic rumble of the N-Judah Muni line, which carries her to and from work. Evenings are often spent with a book or tending to her collection of succulents, while weekends are for exploring Golden Gate Park, browsing the shelves at Green Apple Books, and enjoying long dinners with a small, tight-knit circle of friends who have become her chosen family. She loves San Francisco for its layers\u2014a city constantly rewriting itself yet holding onto its ghosts.\n\nHer aspirations are focused and clear. Professionally, she hopes to lead a project digitizing the histories of overlooked Bay Area immigrant communities. Personally, she dreams of continued stability, deepening her friendships, and perhaps one day, curating an archive of her own\u2014not of data, but of a quiet, well-lived life."

He pointed to Seoul, explaining its history with academic warmth, but all she felt was a strange disconnect. The name was a fact, a location on a map, but it held none of her story. It was the first time she truly felt the silence of her own missing file. This quiet ache set her on a lifelong path to understand how stories\u2014and people\u2014are preserved.\n\n2.\nIn her late twenties, the final door in Seoul closed with a polite, bureaucratic firmness. There were no records to find. The rejection was a quiet, hollow feeling. That evening, standing on a crowded street, she watched families walk by under the neon glow. The grief wasn't for a family she\u2019d never known, but for a narrative she could never have. In that moment, she accepted it. Her identity wasn't a mystery to be solved; it was a life to be lived.\n\n3.\nDuring her master's program, she rescued a set of corrupted digital files\u2014the meeting minutes of a shuttered community center in the Fillmore. As the fragmented text reassembled on her screen, a story of struggle and resilience emerged from the digital noise. A profound sense of purpose washed over her. She couldn't reconstruct her own past, but she could give permanence to the histories of others. In that act of preservation, she found her mission.\n\n4.\nIt was her 40th birthday party, a simple dinner in her Inner Sunset apartment. As her friends\u2019 laughter filled the room, the familiar, low rumble of the N-Judah vibrated through the floorboards. She looked at these faces, her chosen family, against the soundtrack of her daily life. A wave of deep, settled contentment washed over her. This was the foundation she had built\u2014not on bloodlines or found documents, but on shared meals and steadfast love.\n\n5.\nJust last weekend, she was tending to the succulents on her windowsill as the evening fog rolled in. Each plant was a small, resilient life she had nurtured. Tracing the edge of a sturdy leaf, she felt a sense of profound peace in the quiet order she had created. Her life wasn't a grand historical epic, but a collection of carefully curated moments like this. It was her own archive, and it was finally, completely full."
