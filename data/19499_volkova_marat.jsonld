Born to a Buryat historian mother and a Russian physicist father, his upbringing was a blend of ancient folklore and empirical data. The name \u201cMarat\u201d was an intellectual choice by his parents; the surname \u201cVolkova\u201d was his mother\u2019s, a quiet matriarchal statement. In 1991, with the Soviet Union collapsing, his family emigrated, trading the vastness of Siberia for the dense, foggy avenues of San Francisco's Richmond District.\n\nHis initial years in America were a study in dissonance. He found solace not in sports but on the high school debate team, where he learned to structure arguments and wield facts like weapons. This led him to UC Berkeley\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism, where he initially pursued traditional investigative reporting. The key turning point came during a post-graduation internship in the early 2000s, where he watched the newspaper industry hemorrhage money and influence. He saw the future wasn\u2019t just in words, but in the patterns hiding within raw information. He spent his nights teaching himself to code, merging his journalistic ethics with the rigid logic of programming.\n\nNow 44, Marat is the lead data journalist for a prominent online news organization headquartered in SoMa. His daily 1.8-mile commute from his minimalist Hayes Valley apartment is a ritual of observation, absorbing the city's rhythm via the Muni Metro. He leads a team that builds visualizations and uncovers stories about housing disparities and climate change from vast, impersonal datasets.\n\nHis personal life is one of curated calm. A brief, intense marriage in his late twenties fizzled under the weight of his career focus, teaching him the value of balance. He is now in a stable, seven-year relationship with a landscape architect who appreciates his quiet intensity. Marat\u2019s greatest hope isn't a Pulitzer, but to author a definitive book\u2014one that translates the cold data of systemic inequality into a powerful human narrative his mother would have understood. He seeks not just to inform, but to reveal the elegant, often heartbreaking, truth hidden in the numbers."

His mother, pointing to the deep, crystalline fissures in the ice, doesn\u2019t speak of physics but of sleeping spirits. She tells him patterns are the earth\u2019s oldest language. He feels a profound sense of awe, not just for the folklore, but for the immense, visible data of the ice itself. This moment fused storytelling with observation, setting the foundation for his life\u2019s work of finding the narrative within the pattern. This was in 1988, three years before leaving home forever.\n\n2.\nHis first autumn in the Richmond District, age 12. The relentless fog felt like a physical weight, erasing the Siberian sky from his memory. He stood on a corner on Geary Boulevard, unable to understand the overlapping conversations, the hiss of a Muni bus, the smell of damp eucalyptus. The feeling was not sadness, but a clinical alienation. This profound sense of being outside the system forced him to become its keenest observer, learning to decode the city\u2019s rhythms and rules as a matter of survival, a skill he would later call journalism.\n\n3.\nIt\u2019s 2003, in a dying newsroom that smelled of stale coffee and defeat. He watches a veteran editor stare at a spreadsheet of plummeting circulation numbers with utter despair. But Marat sees something else: a story. In the stark, unforgiving columns of data, he saw a powerful, objective truth that no article could convey. The emotional impact was one of electrifying clarity. This moment pivoted his entire career, convincing him that the future wasn\u2019t just writing the story, but coding the machine that could find it.\n\n4.\nThe quiet in their Hayes Valley apartment after his wife left was the loudest thing he\u2019d ever heard. He was 29. She hadn\u2019t yelled, but had stated with devastating calm, \u201cI can\u2019t compete with a dataset, Marat.\u201d He remembers staring at his screen, lines of Python blurring. The emotional impact was a hollow scoop in his chest, a recognition of his own profound imbalance. That failure taught him that human connection couldn't be quantified or optimized, a hard-learned lesson that made his current, stable relationship possible.\n\n5.\nRiding the N-Judah underground last year, he was reviewing a map visualizing eviction data. Suddenly, the glowing red dots weren't abstract points; they were the faces of families, the fog of the Richmond, the feeling of displacement he himself knew. He felt a powerful, almost heartbreaking surge of empathy, a connection between his code and his own history. It was the moment his life\u2019s ambition crystallized: he wouldn\u2019t just show the data, he would write the book that made everyone else feel what he felt in that instant."
