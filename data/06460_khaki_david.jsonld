            "value": "David Khaki\u2019s life has been a quiet study in empathy, forged in the gap between parental expectation and personal calling. The only son of Filipino immigrants who settled in Daly City, David grew up under the weight of his parents\u2019 dreams. They envisioned a future for him in business or engineering\u2014a stable, respectable path far from the manual labor they had known. David was an observant, thoughtful child who absorbed the anxieties of his household, learning early to navigate the unspoken currents of familial duty.\n\nHe dutifully enrolled as an economics major at UC Davis, but his heart was never in it. The turning point came during his junior year when a close family member suffered a severe mental health crisis. David witnessed firsthand the struggle, compounded by a cultural stigma that treated therapy as a source of shame rather than support. He saw the desperate need for care that understood their background. This silent crisis became his calling. Against his parents\u2019 wishes, he switched his focus, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University.\n\nDavid\u2019s early career was spent in the trenches of community health, working in clinics in the Mission and Bayview-Hunters Point. He honed his skills, specializing in trauma and culturally competent care for immigrant communities. Now, at 53, he has found a sustainable rhythm. His 0.0-mile commute is to the second bedroom of his clean, minimalist apartment in the Inner Richmond, which he has converted into a home office for his private telehealth practice.\n\nHis days are structured and serene. A morning walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park clears his mind before he spends hours holding space for the trauma of others. In the evenings, he unwinds by listening to old jazz records and tending to his collection of meticulously cared-for ficus trees. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of a few colleagues and old friends who understand the emotional toll of his work. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is less about its vibrant nightlife and more about its quiet corners\u2014the park, the local bakeries, and the diverse clients he serves. His greatest aspiration is to mentor the next generation of BIPOC therapists, ensuring that the compassionate care he fought to provide becomes the standard, not the exception."
