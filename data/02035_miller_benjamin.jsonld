Adopted from an orphanage in Seoul at six months old, he was raised in Marin County by his loving, white adoptive parents, Mark and Susan Miller. They gave him a childhood of hiking trips on Mt. Tam and stable, suburban comfort, yet a quiet sense of dislocation always lingered beneath the surface. He was loved, but he was different, a fact underscored by his own reflection. This fostered a watchful, reserved personality and a deep appreciation for order and predictability.\n\nDrawn to understanding how systems and societies are built, he pursued a Bachelor's in History at San Francisco State University. While his peers chased tech startups or artistic dreams, Benjamin sought security. This led him not to academia, but to the steady, ordered world of civic service. He found a role as an Administrative Assistant for the San Francisco Public Works department, a job that suited his meticulous nature. Processing permits and managing schedules for city infrastructure projects provided a tangible sense of contributing to the city's foundation.\n\nHis life is a portrait of deliberate routine. Living in a tidy Hayes Valley studio, Benjamin\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a short walk past the opera house to his office near City Hall. Evenings are often spent with a history book, a small group of college friends for trivia night at a local bar, or exploring the city\u2019s culinary landscape one ramen shop at a time.\n\nAt 30, a turning point is quietly emerging. The stability he so carefully constructed now feels like a gilded cage. Last year, while helping his parents clean their attic, he found his original adoption portfolio, full of Korean script he couldn't read. This unlocked a profound yearning. His dream is no longer just to be secure, but to be whole. Benjamin is now saving diligently, not for a down payment, but for a trip to Seoul. He doesn\u2019t necessarily want to find his birth parents, but rather to walk the streets of his birth city, to connect with a part of his own history that has, until now, been a blank page."

When they got the print back, he saw it clearly for the first time: three smiling white faces and his own, distinctly Korean. It wasn\u2019t a sad feeling, but a separate one. It was the moment he realized he was both a beloved part of the picture and an observer standing just outside of it. This quiet awareness became his constant companion.\n\n2.\nHis 10th-grade history project was on the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. While others focused on its iconic beauty, Benjamin was lost in the blueprints. He spent hours tracing the engineering diagrams, mesmerized by the complex, ordered system that created something so permanent. He saw how history wasn't just stories, but a structured process of creation. It was a comfort, a predictable logic he could hold onto, and it charted the course for his future studies and career in building the city itself.\n\n3.\nWalking home one evening around age 26, he stopped at the corner of his block in Hayes Valley. The crosswalk paint was bright, the asphalt smooth and new. He remembered signing the permit for that specific resurfacing project three months prior. A quiet, profound satisfaction washed over him. It wasn't fame or fortune, but it was tangible. He had put a small, orderly piece of the city into place. In a life of uncertain origins, he found a unique sense of belonging by helping to build his home.\n\n4.\nIn his parents' dusty attic at 29, he found the manila folder. His mother handed it to him gently. Inside, the official documents were covered in dense, elegant Korean script he couldn't decipher. It was the first time his past felt like more than a story; it was an object he could hold. The abstract question of his identity suddenly had a weight and a texture. In that moment, the secure world he\u2019d built felt incomplete, and a new, deeper kind of stability\u2014wholeness\u2014became his goal.\n\n5.\nHe sat at his favorite ramen bar just last week, the steam warming his face. Before, it was just about the perfect broth. But now, he listens differently to the owner's chatter in Korean with the chefs. He studies the characters on the menu, feeling a strange pull towards something familiar yet unknown. It's no longer just a meal; it's an act of preparation. Each visit feels like a small bridge of steam and noodles connecting his life in San Francisco to the Seoul streets he saves to walk."
