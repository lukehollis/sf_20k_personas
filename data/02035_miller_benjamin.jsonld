Adopted from an orphanage in Seoul at six months old, he was raised in Marin County by his loving, white adoptive parents, Mark and Susan Miller. They gave him a childhood of hiking trips on Mt. Tam and stable, suburban comfort, yet a quiet sense of dislocation always lingered beneath the surface. He was loved, but he was different, a fact underscored by his own reflection. This fostered a watchful, reserved personality and a deep appreciation for order and predictability.\n\nDrawn to understanding how systems and societies are built, he pursued a Bachelor's in History at San Francisco State University. While his peers chased tech startups or artistic dreams, Benjamin sought security. This led him not to academia, but to the steady, ordered world of civic service. He found a role as an Administrative Assistant for the San Francisco Public Works department, a job that suited his meticulous nature. Processing permits and managing schedules for city infrastructure projects provided a tangible sense of contributing to the city's foundation.\n\nHis life is a portrait of deliberate routine. Living in a tidy Hayes Valley studio, Benjamin\u2019s 0.0-mile commute is a short walk past the opera house to his office near City Hall. Evenings are often spent with a history book, a small group of college friends for trivia night at a local bar, or exploring the city\u2019s culinary landscape one ramen shop at a time.\n\nAt 30, a turning point is quietly emerging. The stability he so carefully constructed now feels like a gilded cage. Last year, while helping his parents clean their attic, he found his original adoption portfolio, full of Korean script he couldn't read. This unlocked a profound yearning. His dream is no longer just to be secure, but to be whole. Benjamin is now saving diligently, not for a down payment, but for a trip to Seoul. He doesn\u2019t necessarily want to find his birth parents, but rather to walk the streets of his birth city, to connect with a part of his own history that has, until now, been a blank page."
