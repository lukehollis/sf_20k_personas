She grew up in the apartment above her parents' small, no-frills Cantonese restaurant, a place where food was about sustenance and survival, not art. Her parents, immigrants who worked tirelessly, saw cooking as a trade, not a passion. While they wanted her to help, they pushed her toward a more \"stable\" American future. To appease them, Mei Ling dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College, a practical credential she never felt connected to.\n\nThe turning point came at age 24, after the passing of her grandmother. Going through her grandmother's belongings, Mei Ling found handwritten recipe books filled not just with ingredients, but with stories, poems, and sketches linking dishes to seasons and emotions. It was a revelation. She realized the culinary heritage she\u2019d taken for granted was a profound art form. This quiet inheritance sparked a rebellion. She left the family business, a move that created a painful rift, and took a line cook job in a high-end restaurant in Hayes Valley to learn modern techniques.\n\nHer career was a slow, deliberate build. She started a pop-up series, \"Palette & Plate,\" hosting dinners in friends' art studios. Her concept was unique: each menu was designed as a response to a specific art piece, creating a multi-sensory experience. Word spread through the city\u2019s creative underground. Today, \"Palette & Plate\" is a sought-after catering company for gallery openings, museum fundraisers, and private events within the SF arts community.\n\nMei Ling lives and works out of a spacious Dogpatch loft, a converted warehouse where steel beams and exposed brick frame her state-of-the-art kitchen. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life and work are seamlessly integrated. Her days start with sourcing ingredients from the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and end with orchestrating what she calls \"edible installations.\" Her social circle is a tight-knit group of artists and designers, and her relationship with her parents has slowly mended as they\u2019ve witnessed her unorthodox success. Her dream is to one day collaborate with SFMOMA on a fully immersive exhibition, proving definitively that food is one of the highest forms of art."
