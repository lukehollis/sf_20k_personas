His parents, who ran a small grocery store, championed the conventional paths of medicine or engineering for their only son. Jaspreet, however, was captivated by stories. He quietly enrolled at San Francisco State University, choosing to study History, a decision that created a gentle, unspoken rift with his family's practical ambitions. He fell in love with the city\u2019s layered past, spending weekends tracing the ghosts of the Gold Rush through downtown alleys and the Beat poets through North Beach cafes.\n\nThe turning point came swiftly after graduation. His father suffered a major health crisis, and the family business faltered. Setting aside his dream of pursuing a master's degree, Jaspreet took the first stable job he could find: a trainee position at a large insurance firm. The irony was not lost on him. His passion was understanding the grand sweep of history, but his profession became quantifying individual, present-day disasters.\n\nNow, at 48, Jaspreet\u2019s life is a study in quiet containment. The 0.0-mile commute is to his desk in the spare bedroom of his Inner Richmond apartment, overlooking the fog-dampened street. His days are a procession of digital files and phone calls, assessing damage from fires, floods, and accidents across the city he once explored on foot. He knows San Francisco not through its landmarks, but through its calamities.\n\nHis personal life is similarly curated. He remains close to his widowed mother in Fremont, calling her every evening. His social circle consists of two old friends from college with whom he shares a monthly dinner. His daily routine is anchored by a late afternoon walk through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that clears his head of policy limits and liability clauses. He\u2019s a familiar face at a small tea shop on Clement Street, where he reads history books\u2014never novels.\n\nJaspreet\u2019s dream is a quiet one. He hopes to one day leave the world of insurance claims behind and use his savings to create historical walking tours of the city\u2019s lesser-known neighborhoods. He wants to share the stories of the people and places that don't make it into the guidebooks, reconnecting with the city he loves not as a collection of risks, but as a living, breathing narrative."
