The son of Gujarati immigrants, he grew up behind the counter of his parents\u2019 small grocery store in the Excelsior District. From a young age, his world was defined by the scent of cardamom and the rhythm of ringing up customers. He saw his parents\u2019 endless hard work, their sacrifices for a foothold in a new country, and the fragile nature of their dream. While his friends talked about college, Rohan watched a new supermarket chain slowly choke the life from his family\u2019s business.\n\nThat experience became his defining turning point. The stress lines on his father's face and the eventual \"For Lease\" sign on their door taught him a lesson no classroom could: stability was the ultimate prize. After graduating from Balboa High School, he bypassed the uncertainty of higher education and entry-level jobs. Instead, he worked various gigs to help his family before pursuing a career path he\u2019d observed daily from his bedroom window: the steady, unwavering presence of a Muni bus. Becoming a transit operator for SFMTA promised a union job, a pension, and a sense of permanence his parents never had.\n\nNow 35, Rohan\u2019s life follows the predictable, comforting timetable of his route. He lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset, a 5.5-mile commute he makes on a colleague\u2019s bus line or the N-Judah, the same train he sometimes operates. His connection to San Francisco is not one of trendy bars or tech startups, but of the early morning fog over Twin Peaks seen from his driver\u2019s seat. He knows the faces of his regulars\u2014the nurse ending her night shift, the student heading to SF State, the elderly woman going to Chinatown for groceries. His social life is built around Sunday dinners at his parents\u2019 home in Daly City and sharing a beer with fellow operators after a long shift.\n\nRohan\u2019s dreams are as grounded as he is. He\u2019s diligent with his savings, hoping to one day buy a small condo in his neighborhood. He doesn't aspire to change the world, but to be a reliable part of it. His ambition is quiet but profound: to build a life of security, to honor his parents' sacrifices by achieving the stability they always sought, and to continue navigating the city he intimately knows, one stop at a time."

It wasn\u2019t the quiet click of the lock that he remembers, but the way his father\u2019s broad shoulders slumped, defeated by the bright new supermarket down the block. The familiar store, once fragrant with cardamom and hope, suddenly smelled only of dust. That cold, helpless feeling forged in Rohan a quiet, desperate need for something unbreakable, something that could never have a \u201cFor Lease\u201d sign slapped on its door.\n\n2.\nA few months after the store closed, he sat in his bedroom window overlooking the Excelsior. Every 12 minutes, like a promise, the 29-Sunset bus would crest the hill. It never worried about new competition or rising rent. It just *was*. He watched it, a fixed point in the chaotic blur of his family's life. At 18, the sight didn\u2019t spark adventure, but a profound sense of calm. He decided then that he didn't want to build something fragile; he wanted to be a part of something that endured.\n\n3.\nHe was 23 when he brought home his first SFMTA paycheck. He didn't cash it. He drove to his parents' home in Daly City and placed the envelope in his mother\u2019s hands. She looked at the city seal, then at him, her eyes welling with a relief he hadn\u2019t seen in years. His father simply put a hand on his shoulder, a silent acknowledgment that their son had found the solid ground that had crumbled beneath them. That unspoken pride was the only validation he ever needed.\n\n4.\nHe remembers the first time Mrs. Li, an elderly regular on his N-Judah line, intentionally let a packed train go, making eye contact and giving a small nod as he pulled up. No words were exchanged as she boarded, but he understood. She trusted him for a smoother ride, for the familiar face. This was around age 28. It wasn't about being a hero; it was about being a known quantity, a reliable stitch in the fabric of her day. It made the anonymous route feel profoundly personal.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a rare foggy morning off, he stood across from a small condominium building on Irving Street. He ran the numbers in his head for the hundredth time, his savings account finally nearing the goal. He pictured himself with his own key, turning a lock in a door that was his. The feeling wasn't excitement, but a deep, quiet satisfaction. Owning that small piece of the Sunset would be the final, anchoring brick in the life of security he\u2019d promised himself he would build."
