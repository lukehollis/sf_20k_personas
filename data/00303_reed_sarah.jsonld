Raised in a small, practical town in the Oregon rain shadow, her upbringing was defined by modest expectations and a love for the tangible world. Her parents, a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, encouraged her curiosity, which led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Art History\u2014a choice of passion over pragmatism.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco in the late 90s, drawn by a post-college sense of adventure rather than the burgeoning tech gold rush. Her initial years were a struggle, spent working low-wage jobs at a small gallery and a bookstore. The turning point came unexpectedly when a friend got her a temporary administrative job at a dot-com startup. Sarah discovered a hidden talent for organization and communication, a knack for \"herding cats\" that was invaluable in the chaotic tech environment. She wasn't a coder, but she could translate between the engineers and the marketing team. Art History had taught her to analyze complex systems and communicate them clearly; it turned out to be the perfect, unconventional training for project management.\n\nSince then, her career has been a series of contracts. She\u2019s ridden the waves of tech booms and busts, surviving several layoffs that taught her fierce financial independence and a cautious approach to stability. Now, at 48, she works exclusively from her quiet two-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within these walls and the immediate neighborhood. Her days consist of a string of Zoom calls, Slack messages, and Gantt charts, managing teams scattered across the globe.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is one of a long-term observer. She loves the city for its proximity to the ocean and Golden Gate Park, where she takes long, meditative walks to decompress. Having weathered two decades here, she feels a disconnect from the city's frenetic energy, which she now witnesses mostly from her window. Her social life is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from former contracts. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, leaving her with a sense of quiet independence she both values and questions. Her dream isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder, but to find a project\u2014or a life\u2014that feels more permanent. She recently started a pottery class, a way to reconnect with the tangible, artistic world she left behind, hoping to mold a future with more stability and deeper roots."
