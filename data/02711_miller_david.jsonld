His 0.0-mile commute isn\u2019t a tech perk, but a necessity; he lives in a small, subsidized apartment on the same property as the skilled nursing facility where he works. His life is a closed loop of care, one he chose deliberately after years of drifting.\n\nRaised by a well-meaning but transient mother, David\u2019s childhood was a series of new towns and temporary homes. He was the constant, the responsible one, ensuring bills were acknowledged and his mother remembered to eat. Formal education was a luxury they couldn't afford; for David, high school graduation was the finish line, not a starting block. He spent his twenties and early thirties working a mosaic of low-wage jobs\u2014unloading trucks, stocking shelves, making coffee\u2014landing in San Francisco on a whim and staying for the fog-laced anonymity.\n\nThe turning point arrived in his late thirties when his mother\u2019s health finally failed. He became her full-time caregiver, a role he discovered he not only endured but excelled at. In her final months, he found a profound sense of purpose in providing comfort, managing her pain, and preserving her dignity. After she passed, the silence of his apartment felt like a void.\n\nAt 40, David enrolled in a Certified Nursing Assistant program at a local community college. It was the most definitive step he\u2019d ever taken. Now, at 50, his days are a steady rhythm of compassion and physical labor. He is the one who helps residents with their morning routines, who listens to stories of a San Francisco that no longer exists, and who holds a hand during a difficult night. His social circle is small, consisting of a few trusted coworkers with whom he shares a knowing weariness and a dark sense of humor.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to the city isn\u2019t through its vibrant nightlife or iconic landmarks, but through the quiet resilience of its aging population. His dream is not of wealth, but of simple stability\u2014to one day save enough to visit a national park, to see mountains that stand still. More than anything, he hopes to maintain his own health long enough to continue offering the steady, gentle care that gives his own life its unwavering meaning."
