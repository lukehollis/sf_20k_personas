Born in the South Bay to a white American father, a thoughtful linguistics professor at Stanford, and a Sikh mother who immigrated from Punjab, Anya grew up navigating the space between cultures. Weekends were a blend of trips to the Gurdwara in San Jose, scented with cardamom and ghee, and long hikes in the Santa Cruz Mountains discussing syntax with her dad. This constant code-switching between a vibrant, traditional Indian community and the intellectual quiet of her American home made her an astute observer and a natural bridge-builder.\n\nIn high school, she was the one everyone talked to\u2014the friend who could mediate conflicts between cliques and offer a calm ear to anxieties over grades and identity. Witnessing the silent struggles of newly arrived immigrant students, who reminded her of her own cousins, solidified her path. She pursued psychology as an undergraduate at UC Davis before earning a Master of Science in School Counseling. She didn't want to just understand the mind; she wanted to be a practical, supportive presence in the chaotic world of adolescence.\n\nNow 40, Anya is a counselor at a large public high school in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. Her life is woven into the neighborhood fabric, a deliberate choice after a brief, amicable marriage to a tech exec whose life revolved around SoMa startups. Her commute is a ten-minute walk, allowing her to be fully immersed in the community she serves. Her days are a whirlwind of mediating student conflicts, consulting with parents, and managing college applications. She is the anchor for hundreds of students trying to find their own way.\n\nHer evenings are her sanctuary. She returns to her cozy, rent-controlled apartment, often with groceries from the Clement Street Farmers Market. She finds peace in cooking, FaceTiming her aging parents, or reading with her cat, Rumi, curled on her lap. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow educators and artists. Anya\u2019s dream isn\u2019t grand; it's to develop a peer-to-peer mentorship program at her school, connecting older students with freshmen. For herself, she hopes to one day take a sabbatical and travel through Punjab with her mother, finally piecing together the part of her story she knows mostly through family lore."
