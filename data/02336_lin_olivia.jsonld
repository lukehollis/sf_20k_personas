Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, she is a native San Franciscan in a city that often feels alien to her. Her parents, immigrants from Taiwan, run a bustling bakery on Irving Street, their lives a testament to pragmatism and ceaseless work. They had hoped for a daughter who would pursue engineering or medicine, a stable path they had sacrificed everything for.\n\nOlivia, however, found her calling not in formulas but in form. She chose to study Art History at UC Santa Cruz, a quiet act of rebellion. She fell in love with the provocative works of the Bay Area Figurative Movement and dreamed of curating exhibits at SFMOMA. But she graduated in 2020, into a world where museums were shuttered and the arts felt like an impossible luxury. With student loans looming, practicality won. She took the first stable job she could find: an administrative assistant for a large, impersonal tech company based in SoMa.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute means her day is a digital blur of Slack notifications, calendar invites, and managing logistics for executives she\u2019s never met in person. The job pays the bills and allows her to live alone, a prized independence. Yet, she feels a disconnect, a ghost in her own life story.\n\nTo combat this, Olivia cultivates a life offline. Evenings are for pottery classes at a studio in the Mission, her hands covered in clay, creating something tangible. Weekends are for long walks through Golden Gate Park, visiting the de Young Museum not as a curator, but as a silent observer, refueling her spirit. She maintains a tight-knit circle of college friends, sharing dim sum in Clement Street restaurants that remind her of childhood.\n\nOlivia\u2019s dream hasn\u2019t died; it\u2019s just dormant. She saves diligently, hoping to one day afford a Master\u2019s degree in Museum Studies. Her administrative role, she tells herself, is just a chapter. It\u2019s the groundwork, the financial bedrock upon which she will, eventually, build a life that is not just stable, but beautiful."
