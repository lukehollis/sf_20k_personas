The daughter of a software engineer from Delhi and a textile artist from Kyoto, she grew up in Fremont, navigating a beautiful confluence of cultures. From her father, she inherited a love for vibrant stories and boisterous family gatherings; from her mother, a quiet appreciation for form, subtlety, and the Japanese concept of *wabi-sabi*\u2014finding beauty in imperfection. As a shy child, Kaiya often struggled to articulate her feelings, instead pouring them onto paper through intricate drawings and sketches. Art became her first and most honest language.\n\nThe true turning point came when her younger brother began struggling with severe anxiety in middle school. Witnessing his difficulty with traditional talk therapy, Kaiya started doing collaborative art projects with him. As they molded clay and mixed paints, his walls came down, and he began to express the fears he couldn't name. It was a profound realization for Kaiya: art wasn't just self-expression, it was a pathway to healing for others. This experience set her on a direct course to earning her Bachelor's in Expressive Arts Therapy.\n\nNow 25, Kaiya lives in a sun-drenched Inner Richmond apartment with two roommates. Her life is a deliberate construction of meaning and mindfulness. Her work at a Hayes Valley non-profit, where she provides art therapy to at-risk youth, is emotionally demanding but deeply fulfilling. Her $72,000 salary affords her a stable, if not extravagant, life in the city she loves.\n\nHer daily 2.5-mile bicycle commute through Golden Gate Park is a cherished ritual, a liminal space to process the day's emotions before arriving home. Evenings are for cooking simple, veggie-forward meals, sketching in her journal, or meeting friends for cheap, delicious dumplings on Clement Street. Her connection to San Francisco is rooted in its acceptance of diverse identities and its vibrant community support systems. Kaiya dreams of one day opening her own small, sliding-scale art therapy studio, a welcoming space where she can help others find their own language, just as she found hers."

Kaiya looked not at the ruined color but at his trembling hands, finally at work. In that moment, she realized art wasn\u2019t about creating beauty, but about making a space safe enough for the truth, however messy, to emerge. It was the moment she knew what her life's work would be.\n\n2.\nAt ten, she dropped a small ceramic bowl her mother had made. A hairline crack fractured its side, and Kaiya started to cry. Her mother simply picked it up, traced the new line with her finger, and whispered, \u201cNow it has a story.\u201d This was Kaiya\u2019s first lesson in *wabi-sabi*. She learned that flaws weren\u2019t failures but signs of a life lived. It became the core of her therapeutic philosophy: to help others see the beauty and strength in their own fractured stories.\n\n3.\nIt was her first year working at the nonprofit. A 14-year-old girl had filled pages with angry, black scribbles for weeks. Then one day, Kaiya noticed a tiny speck of color in the corner: a fragile, blue bird. \u201cI wish I could go somewhere else,\u201d the girl whispered. Kaiya\u2019s heart ached with a profound, quiet victory. It wasn't a cure, but it was hope, rendered in crayon. That memory fuels her through the most draining days, a reminder that progress is often small and slow.\n\n4.\nLast autumn, cycling home through Golden Gate Park, the evening fog rolled in, swallowing the tops of the cypress trees. Her legs burned from a hill, and the air was cold and damp. As she coasted, the city\u2019s hum softened to a gentle whisper. In that quiet, solitary moment, surrounded by the park\u2019s wild beauty, she felt a profound sense of peace and belonging. This wasn\u2019t the chaotic city of tourists, but *her* San Francisco\u2014a place that held her and let her breathe.\n\n5.\nShe remembers the scent of her childhood home in Fremont on a Sunday: her father\u2019s fragrant chicken curry simmering on the stove, its bold spices filling the air, while her mother quietly prepared green tea in the next room, its clean scent a calm counterpoint. The boisterous Hindi chatter of her relatives mixed with the soft clink of her mother's ceramics. It wasn't a clash of cultures, but a perfect, comforting fusion. That memory is her internal blueprint for harmony and acceptance."
