His younger sister, Clara, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age six, a moment that reset his family\u2019s world. Aiden, then just ten, became a studious observer of the healthcare labyrinth\u2014the sterile-smelling pamphlets, the hurried explanations from nurses, and his parents' constant anxiety. He saw firsthand how crucial, yet often lacking, clear and compassionate communication was. This early exposure to the human side of chronic illness planted the seed for his future.\n\nHe chose SF State for its well-regarded Public Health program, trading Sacramento\u2019s suburban sprawl for the city\u2019s dense, foggy energy. The move was a profound shift, immersing him in a culture of social consciousness that resonated with his values. He minored in Sociology, fascinated by how zip codes could predict health outcomes more than genetic codes. His turning point came during a college internship with a community clinic in the Mission, where he helped create bilingual materials on nutrition and preventative care. He wasn't just distributing facts; he was building bridges of understanding.\n\nNow at 24, Aiden works as a Health Educator, developing digital patient education materials for a major Bay Area hospital network. Since his role is fully remote, his commute is a zero-mile walk from his bed to his desk in his small Inner Sunset apartment. His life is structured around a quiet routine: a morning coffee from the cafe on Irving Street, hours spent designing accessible infographics and videos, and a midday run through Golden Gate Park to clear his head. He maintains a close-knit circle of friends from college, preferring game nights and brewery visits over the club scene.\n\nAiden loves the Inner Sunset's quiet, village-like atmosphere, a peaceful anchor in the bustling city. His ambition isn't for wealth, but for impact. He dreams of pursuing a Master's in Public Health and eventually designing community health programs from the ground up, ensuring no family feels as lost as his once did. For Aiden, his work isn't just a job; it's a way to rewrite the story for others."
