            "value": "Mei Garcia-Levine is a product of intersecting worlds. Born in San Jose to a Chinese immigrant mother who worked as a home healthcare aide and a second-generation Mexican-American father who was a line cook, Mei\u2019s upbringing was a blend of Cantonese, Spanish, and English. She witnessed firsthand her parents\u2019 struggles navigating complex American healthcare and social service systems, often acting as their teenage translator and tech support. These early experiences, filled with poorly designed websites and confusing bureaucratic language, ignited a quiet but fierce passion to build technology that served people, rather than frustrated them.\n\nHer academic path was deliberate. After earning a psychology degree from UC Davis, she pursued a master\u2019s in Human-Computer Interaction at a Bay Area university, focusing her thesis on digital literacy in immigrant communities. This specialty made her a coveted candidate, and she landed a job at a health-tech startup. Now, as a Lead UX Researcher, she champions intuitive design for digital tools used in schools and clinics, ensuring that a student seeking mental health support or a parent applying for aid has a clear and compassionate digital experience.\n\nA key turning point was meeting her husband, David Levine, a public school teacher, at a community meeting about gentrification in the Mission District. They bonded over a shared commitment to social equity and soon married. Mei, fiercely proud of her heritage, hyphenated her name to honor both her family and her new partnership.\n\nTheir life is deeply woven into San Francisco's fabric. They share a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission, just a 3.5-mile Muni ride from Mei's downtown office. Her days start with the hum of the J Church streetcar and a podcast on design ethics. Evenings are for cooking with David, salsa classes, or volunteering at a local food bank. Mei\u2019s dream is to eventually launch her own consultancy, focusing exclusively on helping non-profits and public agencies build humane and accessible technology. For her, success isn't just a high income; it\u2019s about architecting a more equitable digital world, one user-friendly interface at a time."

The county benefits website was a maze of jargon and broken links. As her mother\u2019s hopeful expression tightened into anxious frustration, Mei felt a hot rush of anger. It wasn\u2019t just bad design; it was a wall built to keep people like her parents out. In that moment of helplessness, her life's mission quietly clicked into place: she would be the one to tear those walls down.\n\n2.  During her master's program, she was observing digital literacy classes at a community center. An elderly Cantonese man, a retired tailor, was trying to video call his daughter. He kept hitting the wrong icon, his shoulders slumping with each failure. Mei knelt down and, in his dialect, gently guided his finger to the right spot. When his daughter's face appeared, his weary eyes filled with tears. This raw, emotional connection, almost lost to a confusing interface, cemented her professional focus on humane technology.\n\n3.  The community meeting about gentrification was tense, full of shouting. Then David stood up. He didn't yell; he spoke with the steady, clear conviction of a teacher, detailing how housing instability was impacting his students' ability to learn. His empathy was a beacon in the angry room. Their eyes met briefly as he sat down, and Mei felt a profound sense of recognition. This was an ally. This was the start of a partnership built on a shared fight for their community.\n\n4.  Early in her role as a UX researcher, she watched a live user test of a school mental health portal she\u2019d helped redesign. A high school student, using the Spanish-language version, navigated the resource finder and scheduled a confidential appointment in under three minutes. Before the redesign, the task had taken users an average of fifteen minutes and often ended in abandonment. Seeing that teenager find help so easily was more rewarding than any promotion. It was a promise kept to her younger self.\n\n5.  Just last month, David was grading papers at their small kitchen table while she was simmering a pot of her father\u2019s pozole. The rumble of the J Church streetcar vibrated through the floorboards\u2014a familiar city heartbeat. Looking at the life they had built in their rent-controlled apartment, a blend of cultures, commitments, and shared purpose, she felt a quiet, powerful sense of rightness. Her hyphenated name, Garcia-Levine, wasn't just a name; it was this feeling, this home, this fully integrated life."
