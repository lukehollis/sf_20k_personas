The only child of Hong Kong immigrants, she grew up amidst the fragrant bustle of her family\u2019s small grocery store in the Inner Richmond. Her parents, practical and hardworking, envisioned a stable future for her in medicine or law. Mei, however, spent her childhood sketching in notebooks, captivated by the city's vibrant murals and the elegant typography on old shop signs.\n\nTo appease her family, she pursued a Bachelor's in Art History at UC Davis, a compromise she felt was close enough to her passion. The real turning point came during the first dot-com boom of the late 90s. While her peers chased traditional careers, Mei taught herself Photoshop and HTML, translating her artistic eye to the nascent digital world. She landed an entry-level job at a small web design agency, where her talent for creating clean, intuitive visuals shone. For over two decades, she has ridden the waves of the tech industry, evolving from a web designer into a respected Senior Graphic Designer, specializing in user interface and experience for a major tech firm.\n\nA long-term partnership that defined her thirties and early forties ended amicably five years ago, a transition that solidified her independence and deepened her self-reliance. Now, at 50, her life is a study in quiet intention. Her commute is a zero-mile walk from her bedroom to her home office in her Outer Richmond condo, a sanctuary filled with art books and ceramic pots. Her days are structured: a foggy morning walk along Ocean Beach, deep-focus work sessions, and evenings spent at a local pottery studio, reconnecting with the tactile world her digital career eschews. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of friends she\u2019s known since college.\n\nMei\u2019s ambition is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder. She dreams of scaling back her tech work to mentor young, underrepresented designers and perhaps open a small community gallery and print shop. San Francisco is not just her residence; it is her muse, her history, and the canvas on which she hopes to paint her final, most meaningful act."
