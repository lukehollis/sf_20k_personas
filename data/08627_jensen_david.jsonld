Raised in the dusty heat of the Central Valley, his childhood was scored by the clang of his father\u2019s tools in the family\u2019s auto shop. He learned early that the world ran on well-oiled machines and sturdy infrastructure, not abstract ideas. While his peers dreamed of escaping to coastal cities, David was content learning how things worked, valuing the solid satisfaction of a successfully repaired engine over classroom theory.\n\nForegoing a four-year university, he earned an Associate's degree in Building Management from a community college, a practical choice for a practical man. He began his career in the East Bay, managing maintenance for sprawling, low-rise corporate parks. But as the dot-com boom echoed across the bay, a new kind of opportunity arose. Tech startups, flush with cash but clueless about physical space, needed someone to manage their chaotic, fast-growing offices. In the late 90s, David took a job in San Francisco, a move that proved to be a pivotal turning point. The city\u2019s frantic energy and the tech world's ephemeral nature were a culture shock, a strain that contributed to the eventual, amicable end of his marriage.\n\nNow, at 54, David is the Facilities Manager for a mid-sized tech company in SoMa. His 0.0-mile commute is a perk of the job; he lives in a modern apartment a few floors above the office. His life is a neatly contained ecosystem. He is the quiet anchor in a sea of youthful ambition, the one they call when the high-tech espresso machine sputters or a circuit breaker blows during a product launch. He\u2019s a respected, paternal figure, but an outsider, observing the lexicon of \"synergy\" and \"disruption\" with a detached amusement.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is with its bones\u2014the steel girders, the plumbing, the electrical grids\u2014not its ever-changing social scene. His dream isn't a promotion, but a quiet escape. He spends his evenings browsing listings for small plots of land in Sonoma County, envisioning a workshop where he can restore old motorcycles, his hands covered in grease. David Jensen manages the space where the future is built, all while quietly planning his own return to a world he can touch."
