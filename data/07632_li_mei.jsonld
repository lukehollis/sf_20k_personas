            "value": "Mei Li was born and raised in the fog-drenched avenues of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District, the only child of pragmatic Cantonese immigrants. Her father, a cook, and her mother, a seamstress, instilled in her a profound respect for skill and a steady hand. While they dreamed of her securing a stable office job, Mei was fascinated by how things worked, spending her childhood disassembling old radios and building intricate models. This created a quiet, lifelong tension between their definition of security and her passion for creation.\n\nAs a compromise, she bypassed a four-year university and earned an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology from City College. This practical education landed her a reliable job repairing audio equipment, but the work felt sterile. The turning point came after her father\u2019s death a decade ago. Staring at his worn-out cooking knives, she realized that his craft had been his art. It gave her the courage to leave her stable job and seek work that married her technical skills with her creative soul.\n\nShe found her niche as a freelance Assembly Technician for the Bay Area art community. Now, from her small, rent-controlled live/work studio in the Dogpatch, Mei is the invisible force behind large-scale installations. Her commute is a few steps from her bed to her workbench, a space filled with schematics, soldering irons, and the scent of ozone. Artists bring her their ambitious, often impossible, concepts, and she translates them into physical reality\u2014wiring kinetic sculptures, fabricating neon signs, and engineering interactive displays.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a few other fabricators and the occasional artist who treats her as a collaborator rather than just a hired hand. She is a quiet observer at gallery openings, finding a private satisfaction in seeing her meticulous work functioning perfectly under the bright lights, her contribution known only to a few. Mei\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to become the artist, but to achieve mastery in her craft. She hopes to one day see a small plaque that reads, \u201cFabrication by Mei Li,\u201d and, more pressingly, to secure enough long-term contracts to ensure she can remain in the city that is, and has always been, her home."
