The daughter of Korean immigrants who ran a small dry-cleaning business in Daly City, Grace grew up translating not just words, but entire cultural worlds for her parents. She witnessed firsthand the community's silent struggles with stress, poverty, and acculturation, which planted the seed for her future career. While her parents hoped she would pursue a more lucrative path like medicine or law, Grace felt a pull toward service, a calling that felt more authentic than any six-figure salary.\n\nHer decision to enroll in the Master of Social Work program at UC Berkeley was a turning point, creating a temporary rift with her family that healed over time as they saw her passion. Now, as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Grace is embedded in the city\u2019s public school system, a crucial support for students navigating everything from family trauma to the immense pressure of adolescence in a competitive city. Her office is a safe harbor, her presence a steadying force.\n\nGrace\u2019s daily routine is grounded in her Inner Richmond neighborhood. She begins her day with a walk to a local bakery for coffee before catching the 38-Geary bus for her 2.8-mile commute. The ride is her moment of transition, a time to mentally prepare for the emotional weight of her job. Her personal life is a curated circle of close friends, mostly educators and healthcare workers, who understand the unique demands of their professions. They are her chosen family, gathering for potlucks and hikes in the Marin Headlands.\n\nA key life event wasn't a single dramatic moment, but the cumulative impact of seeing her students succeed against the odds. The first time a student she had guided through homelessness was accepted into college, Grace felt a profound sense of purpose that solidified her life\u2019s path. Her aspiration isn\u2019t to climb a career ladder, but to deepen her impact. She dreams of one day founding a small mentorship non-profit connecting first-generation students with professionals. For Grace, success isn\u2019t measured by her income, but by the resilience she helps foster in the next generation of San Franciscans."

As she stumbled over the bureaucratic jargon, she saw a flicker of helplessness in his eyes\u2014a look she\u2019d never seen before. In that moment, she understood her role wasn't just to speak English, but to be a bridge over a chasm of fear and uncertainty. It planted a seed of purpose: to make the world less intimidating for people trying their best.\n\n2.\nThe quiet at the dinner table after she announced her plan to apply for her Master of Social Work was deafening. Her mother\u2019s hope for a daughter in medicine had been a silent, constant pressure. \"We wanted more for you,\" her father finally said, his voice heavy with disappointment, not anger. Grace felt a pang of guilt, but also a surge of quiet determination. That painful silence was the price of her own calling, a defining choice to pursue a wealth of purpose over one of dollars.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't a grand ceremony, but a simple text message on a rainy Tuesday that she will never forget. \"Ms. Kim, I got into Sac State. I start in the fall.\" It was from a student she had spent two years helping navigate homelessness and family court. Grace had to close her office door, where she cried silently with profound relief and joy. All the bureaucratic frustrations and emotional exhaustion of her job melted away, solidifying into a singular, unshakeable truth: this was exactly where she was meant to be.\n\n4.\nOn a windswept hill in the Marin Headlands, Grace looked at her friends\u2014a teacher, a public defender, and an ER nurse\u2014as they shared a thermos of tea. They were talking about their week, the impossible cases and small victories, and no one had to over-explain the emotional toll. A profound sense of belonging washed over her. These people, her chosen family, were her anchor. This shared understanding, more than anything, was what refueled her for another week of holding space for her students\u2019 struggles.\n\n5.\nRiding the 38-Geary home one evening, she watched a teenager hunched over a scholarship application, her face a mixture of fierce ambition and deep anxiety. Grace saw a reflection of so many of her students, brilliant and striving but without a map. The idea for her non-profit crystallized in that moment, shifting from a vague dream to a concrete plan. It wouldn't just be about support, but connection\u2014building the network of mentors she and so many others never had. The commute became a call to action."
