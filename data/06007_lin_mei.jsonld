Born and raised in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District, she is the only child of immigrants from Guangdong, China, who poured their life savings and relentless labor into \"Lin's Market,\" a corner store that became a neighborhood fixture. Mei was their American dream manifest: bright, diligent, and the first in their family to attend college.\n\nShe was two years into a graphic design program at San Francisco State University, her world expanding with new ideas and friends, when life pivoted abruptly. Her father suffered a severe stroke, leaving him unable to manage the store's demanding physical labor. Without discussion, it was understood Mei would step in. She took a semester off, which quietly bled into a permanent departure from her studies. The vibrant potential of a design career was packed away along with her textbooks.\n\nNow, at thirty, Mei is the unofficial, and indispensable, assistant manager. Her daily routine is a familiar rhythm: unlocking the doors at dawn, arranging produce, managing inventory, and sharing knowing smiles with the regulars who have watched her grow up. Her commute is zero miles, a fact that feels both convenient and confining. Her social life consists of brief chats over the counter and occasional boba with a childhood friend. The life she once imagined\u2014filled with art galleries and creative deadlines\u2014feels like a story about someone else.\n\nYet, dreams don't simply vanish. During quiet moments in the back office, Mei sketches new logo ideas for the market on receipt paper. She imagines launching a delivery service, modernizing the website, and stocking products from local Asian-American artisans. Her connection to San Francisco isn't found in its iconic landmarks but in the specific gray fog that consumes Clement Street and the diverse faces of her customers. Her deepest aspiration is no longer to escape her inherited life, but to reshape it\u2014to blend her dormant artistic passion with her filial duty, proving that a dream deferred can still find a way to bloom, even in the familiar aisles of a neighborhood grocery store."
