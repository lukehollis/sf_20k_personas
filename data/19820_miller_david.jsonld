The son of a Sacramento-based accountant and a high school history teacher, he was raised on a steady diet of fiscal prudence and stories of economic cycles. A sharp, analytical mind led him to a degree in Economics from UC Davis, where he was more interested in market dynamics than campus parties. He graduated in the mid-90s and immediately moved to San Francisco, landing a grueling but formative job as an investment banking analyst.\n\nHe survived the dot-com bust, learning a crucial lesson about the difference between hype and value. The true turning point, however, was the 2008 financial crisis. Watching the old guard of finance crumble solidified his belief that technology was the only viable path forward. He saw an opportunity not just for profit, but for reinvention. Leveraging his decade of traditional finance experience, he pivoted, joining a small venture capital firm focused on a nascent field: FinTech. His grounded, old-school financial acumen was the perfect counterbalance to the wild optimism of young founders. This insight propelled him to his current role as Managing Partner.\n\nHis professional success, however, exacted a personal toll. The 80-hour workweeks of his youth contributed to an amicable divorce a decade ago. Now, his primary personal connection is his daughter, a sophomore at UCLA, with whom he has a warm, if long-distance, relationship. His social life consists of a tight circle of industry peers and a few old friends, typically meeting for dinner at tasteful restaurants in Hayes Valley or North Beach.\n\nDavid lives in a sleek Rincon Hill high-rise, his 3.5-mile commute to the Financial District a quiet, reflective Uber ride spent reading market reports on his phone. He both loves and laments the city; he remembers a grittier, more accessible San Francisco but his career is inextricably linked to the boom that transformed it. At 50, his aspirations have shifted from pure wealth accumulation to legacy. He dreams of backing a company that truly democratizes finance for the average person, a final, meaningful entry on a long and successful ledger."

His boss, a man who\u2019d boasted of a paper fortune a month prior, stared blankly at a terminal. It wasn\u2019t fear David felt, but a cold, clarifying calm. Hype evaporated; only the unforgiving math of a balance sheet remained. That silence taught him a lesson he\u2019d carry for the rest of his career: value is quiet, and bubbles always, always burst.\n\n2.\nThe news ticker on the silent office television screamed LEHMAN BROTHERS FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY. It was September 2008, well past midnight. He watched the titans of his industry, men he\u2019d once revered, become historical footnotes in real-time. It felt like watching Rome fall. In that moment of profound institutional failure, he saw it: the future wasn\u2019t in propping up the old world, but in building a new, digital one from its wreckage. It was the true start of his career.\n\n3.\nThe last box from their Pacific Heights home. Tucked inside a book was a faded crayon drawing his daughter, then eight, had made of their family holding hands. His ex-wife had smiled, a sad, knowing look. There was no shouting, just a quiet acknowledgment of the thousands of hours he\u2019d given to the office instead of them. The price of his success, he realized, wasn't just monetary. He closed the box, a hollow ache of regret settling in his chest.\n\n4.\nHe sat across from his daughter at a bustling caf\u00e9 near UCLA last spring. She was passionately explaining a political theory, her arguments sharp and insightful. He saw his analytical mind but also his wife\u2019s warmth in her. For a moment, he wasn\u2019t a VC, just a father filled with a quiet, overwhelming pride. The four-hundred-mile distance between them felt vast, but the connection was undeniable. This, he thought, was the one investment that had yielded immeasurable, uncomplicated returns.\n\n5.\nDuring an Uber ride home a few months ago, traffic stalled in the Mission. He remembered the neighborhood\u2019s gritty vibrancy from his early days. Now, he saw a young couple staring anxiously at a payday loan storefront wedged between a kombucha bar and a new condo building. The juxtaposition struck him like a physical blow. He had profited from this new San Francisco, yet here was the problem, raw and unsolved. In that moment, his ambition crystallized: to build something that would put that loan shop out of business forever."
