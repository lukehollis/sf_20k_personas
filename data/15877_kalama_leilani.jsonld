Raised in a close-knit family, she was taught the importance of `kuleana`\u2014a deep sense of responsibility to her community and the `\u02bb\u0101ina` (land). Her parents, a fisherman and a schoolteacher, instilled in her a quiet strength and an awareness of the social and economic currents that could disrupt a community\u2019s balance. This awareness propelled her to the mainland for college, a difficult but determined choice, where she enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Urban Studies program, trading the green cliffs of home for the concrete canyons of the Bay Area.\n\nHer education was a revelation. Leilani saw the patterns of displacement and inequality she\u2019d witnessed on a smaller scale in Hawai\u02bbi magnified in the complex urban fabric of the Bay Area. A pivotal internship with a housing rights organization in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District solidified her career path. She wasn\u2019t just studying the city; she was learning how to advocate for its most vulnerable residents. After graduating, she committed herself to the non-profit sector, rising steadily through the ranks. Now, as a Senior Program Manager, she develops and oversees initiatives that provide legal aid and support services for tenants facing eviction, a cause that feels deeply personal.\n\nAt 47, Leilani\u2019s life is woven into the city\u2019s texture. Her 2.6-mile commute on the J-Church Muni line from her rent-controlled apartment near Dolores Park is a daily ritual of observation. Her days are a demanding mix of grant writing, strategic meetings, and mentoring younger staff. Though a significant relationship ended five years ago, she has built a chosen `ohana` in San Francisco\u2014a diverse group of friends, activists, and colleagues who gather for potlucks in her small apartment or for walks through the Presidio.\n\nWhile she is proud of the life and career she has built, a part of her heart remains tethered to Hawai\u02bbi. She Skypes with her aging parents weekly and dreams of one day using her expertise to address housing issues back home. For now, however, her `kuleana` is here. Leilani\u2019s aspiration is to see the organization she serves become a permanent, unshakable pillar of support in a city that is constantly, and often ruthlessly, reinventing itself."

The elderly woman, her hands trembling, showed Leilani a photo of her late husband in front of their building. In that moment, Leilani saw that a home wasn't just shelter; it was a vessel for a person\u2019s entire life. This quiet realization solidified her `kuleana`, not to the `\u02bb\u0101ina` of Hawai\u02bbi, but to the people of this new land.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe silence in her apartment after Mark left was the loudest sound she\u2019d ever heard. It was five years ago. She was 42, staring at the empty space on the bookshelf, feeling utterly adrift. Then, a knock. Her colleague, Asha, stood there holding a container of homemade dal. No questions asked, just a shared meal on the floor. That simple act of care was a revelation, the moment she understood that `ohana` was a structure you could build yourself, beam by beam, wherever you were planted.\n\n***\n\n3.\nOn a cold, gray morning on the J-Church about three years ago, she watched a young man in an expensive jacket stare at his phone, a few feet from an elderly Chinese woman struggling with three bags of groceries. No one offered a seat. The silent, invisible wall between them felt vast and insurmountable. It wasn't anger she felt, but a profound, motivating sorrow. The moment crystallized her mission: her work wasn\u2019t just about fighting evictions, but about mending the city\u2019s fractured empathy, one case at a time.\n\n***\n\n4.\nShe was 28, overworked and questioning everything, when she stumbled into the Conservatory of Flowers on a rare warm day. The sudden, humid scent of orchids and ginger hit her like a physical blow, instantly transporting her to her grandmother\u2019s garden in Hilo. Leaning against the glass, she wept quietly\u2014not from sadness, but from a piercing, beautiful homesickness. It taught her that she could carry Hawai\u02bbi within her, and that finding these small, sacred pockets of home was essential for her survival in the city.\n\n***\n\n5.\nTen years ago, she had to tell the residents of a SOMA apartment block that they\u2019d lost their final appeal. The memory of a little girl pressing a crayon drawing of her family into Leilani\u2019s hand still stings. That night, she didn\u2019t feel like an advocate; she felt like an agent of grief. The raw helplessness she experienced became a crucible, burning away any remaining naivete. It forged a tougher, more strategic resolve, cementing her commitment to building an organization so strong it could prevent that kind of heartbreak from ever happening on her watch again."
