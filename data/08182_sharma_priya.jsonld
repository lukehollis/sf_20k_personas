Born in Marin County to white, spiritual-seeker parents in the late 1970s, she was named Priya by a mother deep in Eastern philosophy and given the surname Sharma by a father who felt it had a better \"vibrational energy\" than Smith. Her upbringing was a whirlwind of ashrams, communal living, and conversations about chakras, leaving Priya craving structure and predictability.\n\nShe fled to San Francisco for college, enrolling at SF State with an undeclared major, determined to build a conventional life. However, during her sophomore year, her parents\u2019 transient lifestyle finally caught up with them in the form of a financial crisis, forcing Priya to drop out and find full-time work. She landed a job at a small, independent home goods store in Hayes Valley, initially seeing it as a temporary measure. To her surprise, she thrived. The tangible world of inventory, merchandising, and balancing the books provided the order she had always lacked. She had a knack for it, and her quiet competence saw her promoted from clerk to assistant manager, and finally, to store manager a decade ago.\n\nNow 45, Priya\u2019s life is a testament to the stability she built for herself. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment directly above the shop, making her commute a simple walk down a flight of stairs. Her daily routine is her sanctuary: opening the store, arranging new displays, chatting with the neighborhood regulars who have become her de facto family. Her social life is small but solid, consisting of wine nights with other local business owners and quiet evenings reading novels. Having spent her youth searching for a place to belong, she has become a fixture of her corner of the city. Her greatest aspiration is to one day buy the store from its retiring owner, transforming her life\u2019s work into a legacy of her own making\u2014a final, grounding anchor in the city that allowed her to define herself."
