The daughter of an American GI who fell in love in Hong Kong and a determined immigrant mother, she grew up in a small apartment directly above her parents' restaurant, \"The Lucky Crane,\" in San Francisco's Richmond District. Her childhood was a blend of American cartoons and Cantonese nursery rhymes, of learning to fold wontons with her mother and doing homework at a corner table while her father charmed the regulars.\n\nShe tried to forge a different path. After graduating from Washington High, Mei-Ling enrolled at San Francisco State, vaguely pursuing a business degree. It was a bid for a life outside the restaurant's demanding embrace. However, midway through her sophomore year, her father suffered a major stroke. With her mother overwhelmed, Mei-Ling\u2019s choice was clear. She left college, telling herself it was temporary, and stepped fully into managing The Lucky Crane. \"Temporary\" soon became permanent.\n\nThe restaurant became her world. After her father passed and her mother retired, Mei-Ling took ownership, subtly updating the menu but preserving the beloved classics that were her family\u2019s legacy. She never married; a serious relationship in her thirties ended when her partner couldn't accept being second to the restaurant's relentless demands. Her staff became her family, and the generations of customers she served became her community.\n\nNow at 52, her commute remains zero miles. Her day begins with the rumble of the delivery truck and ends long after the last table is cleared. She knows the names of her regulars, their kids' college majors, and their favorite dishes. She is the living memory of this corner of the city, a bridge between the old San Francisco and the new. Her dream isn't to escape but to ensure The Lucky Crane survives another tech boom and celebrates its 60th anniversary. Perhaps then, she might finally take a real two-week vacation, somewhere she can\u2019t smell the ginger."
