Born and raised in Daly City, she is the only child of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, successful laundromat. Her childhood was steeped in the ethos of practicality and security; her parents\u2019 dream was for her to secure a stable job with a pension. She was a dutiful daughter, witnessing their long hours and appreciating the sacrifices made for her future.\n\nFor college, Sarah stayed local, attending San Francisco State. While her parents hoped for a business degree, she secretly enrolled in classes that fascinated her, eventually earning a bachelor's in English Literature. It was a degree chosen for love, not for its job prospects. The reality of post-graduate life and student loans quickly set in, and honoring her parents\u2019 wishes, she took the civil service exam. She landed a position as an Administrative Assistant in the City Planning Department, a role she has held for eight years.\n\nThe true turning point in her life came four years ago when she won the housing lottery for a below-market-rate studio apartment in a new development bordering Civic Center and Hayes Valley. This move transformed her world. Her 0.0-mile commute is a daily reminder of the life she deliberately built, trading a long BART ride for a short walk across the plaza.\n\nSarah\u2019s life is a study in contrasts. By day, she is the meticulous organizer, managing schedules and documents for the very people reshaping the city\u2019s skyline. After 5 PM, her true passion unfolds. She is a gifted amateur photographer, her literary eye finding narratives in the city's hidden corners\u2014the fog clinging to Buena Vista Park, the weathered face of a Mission District mural, the stark geometry of the federal buildings outside her window.\n\nHer social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few friends from college and a trusted work colleague. Weekends often involve visiting her now-retired parents for dim sum in the Sunset or losing herself for hours on a photo walk. Sarah\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a promotion; it\u2019s to one day have a small gallery show, to have her vision of San Francisco\u2014the quiet, overlooked, and intimate city she loves\u2014seen and felt by others. Her stable job is the anchor, but photography is the current that guides her."
