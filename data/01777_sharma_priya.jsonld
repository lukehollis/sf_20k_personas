Born in Davis, California, to Indian immigrant parents who were both academics at the university, Priya grew up in a household that revered books and disciplined study. While her parents hoped she would pursue medicine or engineering, Priya was drawn to the evocative power of images. She spent her youth hiding art history books within her chemistry textbooks, a quiet rebellion that defined her path.\n\nShe pursued her passion at UC Berkeley, earning a BA in Art History, followed by a Master of Library and Information Science from San Jose State. It was a practical compromise, a way to build a stable career around her love for the arts. After a few years in university archives, she found her true calling at the San Francisco Public Library. She thrived in the democratic space of the public library, a place where knowledge was freely accessible to all. Over three decades, she worked her way up to become the Senior Reference Librarian for the Arts collection at a major branch.\n\nA key turning point in her life came in her late thirties after the amicable end of a decade-long partnership with a musician. The breakup, while painful, solidified a deep sense of self-reliance. It was then she moved into a small, rent-controlled apartment on a floor above a bookstore adjacent to her library branch in the Richmond District, making her commute nonexistent. Her life became seamlessly integrated with her neighborhood.\n\nHer days are a comforting ritual: a morning walk in Golden Gate Park with her reusable tea thermos, a stroll down Clement Street for groceries, and her work helping patrons uncover the histories of forgotten Bay Area artists. Her social life is a small, warm circle of fellow librarians, bookstore owners, and a few elderly artists she has befriended through her research.\n\nAt 54, Priya\u2019s dreams are not of travel or wealth, but of legacy. She aspires to secure a grant to digitize a fragile collection of ephemera from the city\u2019s 1960s psychedelic art scene and hopes to mentor a new generation of librarians to be passionate curators of community memory. She is a quiet anchor in a city of frantic reinvention, a guardian of the stories that give San Francisco its soul."
