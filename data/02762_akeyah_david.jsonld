The only child of Nigerian immigrants who settled in Oakland in the 1970s, David was raised on the principles of hard work and stability. His parents, a nurse and a postal worker, saw education as the unwavering path to a secure American life.\n\nDavid, however, was drawn to the abstract. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, defying gentle parental pressure to study engineering, and instead lost himself in the hushed halls of Art History. He fell in love with the bold lines of the German Expressionists and the chaotic energy of the Futurists. But upon graduating in the late 90s, he faced a harsh reality: a passion for art history didn't pay Bay Area rent. This was his first major turning point\u2014the moment he made a quiet pact with practicality.\n\nHe began taking temp jobs, his sharp organizational skills making him a reliable administrative hire. One of those temp gigs was at a burgeoning dot-com, and he never left the industry. For two decades, David has been the stable, unseen force keeping chaotic tech departments running. Now, at 46, he\u2019s an administrative assistant for a large software company, a role he performs with meticulous efficiency from his Lower Haight apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute defines his days. Life unfolds within the walls of his rent-controlled one-bedroom, a space filled with art books he rarely opens and the persistent, low hum of his work laptop. He is well-liked by colleagues he has never met in person. His social life is a small, curated circle of old university friends, anchored by a fiercely competitive weekly trivia night at a neighborhood dive bar.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is bittersweet. He lives blocks away from the museums and galleries that once fueled his soul, yet he rarely visits. He works for the industry that transformed his adopted city into an unaffordable playground, a fact that isn't lost on him. His dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s a quiet hope to reclaim a piece of his past self. He\u2019s started saving for a trip to Berlin to see the art he only ever studied in books, aspiring to find a version of himself that exists beyond meeting invites and expense reports."
