The son of a union electrician and a school secretary, Aidan was raised on the values of hard work, humility, and getting a practical education. He attended UMass Amherst, earning a marketing degree not out of passion, but because it promised a clear path to a stable career.\n\nHe spent his early twenties working for a traditional retail chain in Boston, feeling the ceiling of the old-guard corporate world approaching. The turning point came in 2011. A friend\u2019s excited descriptions of the Bay Area\u2019s burgeoning tech scene planted a seed. Seeking more dynamism, Aidan took a leap, accepting a junior e-commerce role at a San Francisco-based apparel company.\n\nHe arrived with two suitcases and a healthy dose of imposter syndrome. He navigated the city's frantic energy, learning to love the fog and the steep hills. His career flourished as he proved adept at understanding online consumer behavior. He worked his way up from coordinator to manager, and finally to his current role as Director of Digital Merchandising, where he now leads a team responsible for the entire online shopping experience.\n\nHis personal life has been a series of chapters. A serious four-year relationship ended two years ago, a casualty of differing life goals\u2014she wanted to move to the suburbs and start a family, while Aidan wasn't ready to leave the city. Now, his social life is a mix of a tight-knit group of friends from his early SF days and industry acquaintances.\n\nAidan\u2019s daily routine is quintessentially San Franciscan. His 3.1-mile bike ride from his meticulously kept apartment in NOPA to his SoMa office is a non-negotiable ritual. He\u2019s a regular at his local coffee shop, knows the Golden Gate Park running trails by heart, and spends weekends hiking in Marin or exploring new restaurants.\n\nThough financially successful, the dream of homeownership in the city he loves feels perpetually just out of reach. His deepest aspiration is to find a sense of permanence\u2014a lasting partnership and perhaps a small condo in a neighborhood he can call his own for good. He is a man who has built a life he\u2019s proud of, but is still searching for the final pieces to make it feel whole."
