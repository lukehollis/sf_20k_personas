The son of a pragmatic second-generation Chinese-American engineer and an idealistic Irish-American social worker, Caleb\u2019s identity was forged in a home that valued both methodical systems and community compassion. Growing up, he watched the city transform, seeing neighborhoods shift and skylines rise. This constant, visible evolution sparked his fascination with the urban landscape, leading him to pursue an Urban Studies degree at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis key turning point came during a college internship with a housing advocacy group in the Mission District. For the first time, he saw the human cost of planning decisions\u2014the displacement of families, the erosion of culture, and the grassroots fights for neighborhood preservation. This experience cemented his desire to shape cities for the better, but the realities of student debt led him down a more conventional path. He accepted a position as an urban planner at a large private development firm in SoMa, a role that pays well but creates a persistent internal conflict.\n\nNow 31, Caleb lives in a cherished rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a quiet counterpoint to his bustling workday. His 1.5-mile commute on the 38 Geary Muni bus is a daily immersion in the city\u2019s diverse tapestry. At work, he designs large-scale, mixed-use projects, poring over blueprints that promise efficiency and profit. Yet, he is haunted by the faces from his internship, constantly grappling with the gap between his firm\u2019s objectives and the community's needs.\n\nHis social life is a small, tight-knit circle, centered around his long-term partner, a public-school teacher who grounds him in the city's on-the-ground struggles. Caleb\u2019s dream is to eventually leave the corporate world and start a small, influential consulting firm focused on creating equitable and sustainable community developments. He yearns to build bridges, not just buildings, ensuring the San Francisco he helps create is a city that has a place for everyone, including himself."

His father pointed west, explaining the methodical grid of the Sunset behind them, a system designed for order. But his mother hugged him, whispering that the fog was where the city kept its secrets and dreams. He felt caught between the logical lines in the sand his dad drew and the mysterious, compassionate haze his mom described. It was the first time he understood his heart lived in two different worlds.\n\n2.\nDuring his college internship, he helped a family pack the last of their things from a Mission apartment they'd lived in for 25 years. He was tasked with taking down a child\u2019s drawing of their building, held to the wall by yellowed tape. As his fingers carefully peeled it free, leaving a faint rectangle on the painted wall, the abstract concept of \"displacement\" became a physical ache in his chest. That empty space on the wall became the ghost he's been chasing ever since.\n\n3.\nOn the 38 Geary bus a few years ago, he was reviewing blueprints for a sleek new SoMa high-rise on his tablet. He glanced up and saw the reflection of an elderly Cantonese woman, her face etched with worry, superimposed over the glossy architectural rendering on his screen. The jarring image\u2014her lived reality layered over his profitable design\u2014felt like a judgment. It became his daily measure of the gap between the city he was building and the city he was losing.\n\n4.\nLast year, he came home late, drained from a fight over profit margins. His partner was at their small kitchen table, patiently marking up student essays, a red pen in her hand. She looked up and smiled, telling him about a student\u2019s small breakthrough. The quiet integrity of her work, focused on one child\u2019s potential, felt more monumental than any skyscraper he could design. In that moment, his dream of starting his own firm felt less like a fantasy and more like a necessity.\n\n5.\nIn a presentation six months ago, he heard himself use the phrase \"demographic revitalization\" to describe a new project. The sterile words hung in the air, and he suddenly saw the face of the father from his internship, his eyes full of a quiet, tired dignity. A wave of shame washed over him. He realized the polished language of his profession was a tool for erasure, for turning homes into units and people into data points. It solidified his resolve to one day speak a different language."
