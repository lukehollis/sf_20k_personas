The only child of first-generation Chinese immigrants who ran a small laundromat, David grew up straddling two worlds. At home, he was the dutiful son, translating bills and navigating American bureaucracy for his parents. At school, he was a quiet, observant kid who excelled in understanding people. His parents hoped he would pursue a lucrative career, so his Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications from SF State seemed like a practical step toward a stable corporate job.\n\nThe turning point came not in a boardroom, but in a hospital waiting room. During his senior year, his grandmother's health declined rapidly. David became her primary advocate, a frustrating odyssey of navigating Medicare, finding bilingual social workers, and fighting for culturally competent care. He saw firsthand how easily the vulnerable could fall through the cracks. The experience ignited a quiet fury and a profound sense of purpose. The corporate path now felt hollow.\n\nAfter graduating, he took an entry-level position at a non-profit in the Tenderloin. Now, at 32, David is a seasoned Case Manager for a supportive housing program. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to his immersion; he lives in a modest apartment in the same building where he works, offering a constant, steadying presence for residents battling addiction, mental health issues, and homelessness.\n\nHis daily routine is a mix of crisis management, mountains of paperwork, and small, vital victories\u2014securing a client\u2019s disability benefits, celebrating a year of sobriety, or simply sharing a cup of coffee. His social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow non-profit workers who understand the burnout and the deep rewards. He dreams not of wealth, but of leverage: of one day moving into policy to fix the systemic flaws he battles daily. David Lee is the city\u2019s quiet conscience, a native son who chose to serve its heart rather than chase its gold."
