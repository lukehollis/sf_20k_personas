The only daughter of Indian immigrants, she was raised in a home where stability was prized above all else. Her parents, a pharmacist and an engineer, envisioned a similar, secure path for her. However, Aaliyah was captivated by the way light and shadow could tell a story, a passion that led her to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography from UC Santa Cruz, a choice her parents viewed with loving concern.\n\nAfter graduating, she faced the artist\u2019s classic dilemma. The freelance photography gigs were sporadic, barely covering the cost of her equipment, let alone rent. The pressure to find stability mounted. Her key turning point came after a year of struggling, when she accepted an Administrative Assistant position at a burgeoning San Francisco startup. It was meant to be a six-month solution, a way to build savings before relaunching her creative career. That was four years ago.\n\nNow 29, Aaliyah\u2019s world is often confined to the four walls of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute offers convenience but blurs the line between work and life. Her days are a cycle of scheduling meetings, managing calendars, and responding to Slack messages for a team she\u2019s only met in person twice. Her BFA degree is a footnote she omits from her corporate resume.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is forged not in the office, but in her neighborhood. On weekends, she escapes the digital world, her old Canon camera a familiar weight in her hands. Golden Gate Park is her true studio, where she captures candid moments: the way sun filters through the cypress trees or the vibrant chaos of a drum circle. Her small circle of friends, a mix from college and a local pottery class, provides a vital link to her creative self.\n\nAaliyah\u2019s hope is to bridge the two halves of her life. She diligently saves a portion of her salary, dreaming of one day launching a creative agency or becoming a project manager for an arts-focused tech company. She fears the comfort of her current role, worried her pragmatic compromise is slowly becoming her permanent reality. For now, she finds solace in the quiet click of her camera's shutter, a reminder of the artist who still lives within the efficient administrative assistant."
