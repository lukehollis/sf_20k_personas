They instilled in her a formidable work ethic and a desire for stability, envisioning a future for their daughter in medicine or engineering. Lena dutifully enrolled in pre-med at UC Davis, but a volunteer stint at a Sacramento free clinic became her defining turning point. She was less drawn to diagnosing individual ailments and more fascinated by the systemic barriers\u2014poverty, language, lack of access\u2014that prevented entire communities from being healthy.\n\nThis newfound passion led her to pivot, much to her parents\u2019 initial confusion. She pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, finding her calling in the world of grant writing, program design, and data-driven outreach. After graduating, she moved to San Francisco, drawn to its vibrant non-profit scene and mosaic of diverse communities. She started as a coordinator at a large healthcare non-profit, methodically working her way up over fifteen years. The intense burnout of the pandemic, where she managed remote testing and vaccine equity programs, solidified her value and ironically gave her the life she now cherishes: fully remote.\n\nToday, Lena lives in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her kitchen to a sunlit corner desk overlooking 9th Avenue. Her days are a structured rhythm of Zoom calls with community partners, analyzing health outcome data, and writing the meticulous grant proposals that keep her programs afloat.\n\nShe has cultivated a life of intentional calm. Mornings often start with a jog through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, and evenings are for her small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a teacher, a nurse, and a graphic designer\u2014sharing dinner at a neighborhood spot or a bottle of wine at home. Lena\u2019s ambition isn't for a C-suite title; it's to see the senior food security program she designed become a permanent, city-funded institution. She found her purpose not in a doctor\u2019s coat, but in ensuring the health of the city she now calls her own, one program at a time."
