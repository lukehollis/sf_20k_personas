Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants who ran a small, fragrant grocery store, her childhood was a blend of fragrant spice aisles and the quiet ambition of Silicon Valley suburbs. Her parents, practical and hardworking, dreamed of her becoming a doctor or an engineer. But Deepa was captivated by stories, not schematics. She saw the subtle struggles of her elders, particularly her grandmother, who navigated the American healthcare system with a mix of fear and confusion, her limited English a constant barrier. This planted a seed of purpose in Deepa.\n\nForsaking the paths her parents envisioned, she pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley. It was here she found her calling: not in treating individual ailments, but in dismantling the systemic barriers that prevented entire communities from receiving care. Her early career was spent in the trenches of San Francisco\u2019s non-profits, doing outreach and education in Chinatown and the Mission District. She saw firsthand how language, culture, and poverty could be more detrimental to health than any virus.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when a program she was managing, providing prenatal resources to monolingual Spanish-speakers, secured major city funding. The success elevated her from frontline work to a leadership position. Now, as a Program Manager, she works from her light-filled apartment in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is deeply woven into the neighborhood. Her days are a rhythm of Zoom calls designing health equity initiatives, broken up by walks to a local coffee shop and lunch in Patricia\u2019s Green.\n\nAt 41, Deepa is single and deeply fulfilled by a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow public health advocates and artists from her neighborhood. Her life is her work, but she dreams of finding a better balance. Her aspiration is to launch a new, city-wide program focused on geriatric care for non-English speaking seniors, a tribute to the grandmother who unknowingly set her life\u2019s course. She hopes to one day take a sabbatical to travel through India, not as a tourist, but to connect with the roots of the culture she so passionately advocates for in her chosen city."
