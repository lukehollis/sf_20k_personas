Raised in Daly City, the only son of Filipino immigrants, his childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s grease-stained mechanic overalls and his mother\u2019s crisp nurse\u2019s aide uniform. They instilled in him a profound sense of duty and the pragmatic value of a job well done. Their dream for him was a clean-handed career, something proven by a college degree.\n\nBrandon enrolled at City College of San Francisco with a vague notion of studying business, but his path veered sharply. In his second semester, his father suffered a debilitating back injury, forcing him out of work. Without hesitation, Brandon dropped out to help support his family, taking a job as a maintenance technician for a large property management company. It was meant to be temporary, but he discovered a deep, quiet satisfaction in solving tangible problems\u2014tracing a leak, rewiring a faulty panel, restoring order.\n\nHe never went back to school. Instead, his work became his education. His natural aptitude and unwavering reliability saw him climb the ladder from tech to lead, and eventually to his current role as Facilities and Maintenance Supervisor for a gleaming SOMA high-rise.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute means his life is intrinsically tied to the building he manages. He lives in a small but comfortable apartment on a lower floor, a perk that doubles as a golden handcuff. His daily routine is the building's own rhythm: morning system checks, managing his crew's assignments, and fielding calls from residents. He knows the building\u2019s secrets\u2014the ghost in the HVAC system on the 22nd floor, the exact pressure needed for the lobby\u2019s fountain.\n\nSocially, Brandon is friendly but reserved, maintaining a professional distance from the tech entrepreneurs and finance professionals whose luxury he maintains. His connections are with his crew, sharing beers after a tough shift. His core aspiration is simple and concrete: save enough for a down payment on a small house in the East Bay, a place where he isn't on call 24/7. He doesn't want to build an empire; he just wants a home where he can finally put his own tools away."
