Born in Fremont to parents who emigrated from Lucknow, India, he was raised in a home filled with the aroma of cardamom and the pressure to succeed. His father, a software engineer, and mother, a pharmacist, envisioned a prestigious medical career for their only son. For a time, Alex tried to want it, too, excelling in his science classes.\n\nThe turning point came at seventeen when his older cousin, deeply depressed, attempted suicide. Alex witnessed the family\u2019s struggle, a mixture of shame and confusion, and saw firsthand how a culturally-competent social worker helped them navigate the crisis. The experience was a revelation; he realized he didn't want to heal bodies, but minds and family systems. Announcing his decision to pursue social work was met with quiet, prolonged disappointment from his parents, a rift that has only recently begun to heal.\n\nHe earned his Master of Social Work from SF State, drawn to the city's complex tapestry of immense wealth and acute vulnerability. Now an LCSW for a major healthcare provider, his \"commute\" is a ten-second walk from his bed to his desk. His small apartment in the Inner Richmond, just blocks from Golden Gate Park, has become both his office and his sanctuary.\n\nHis days are a series of telehealth sessions, a digital confessional for young adults grappling with anxiety, tech burnout, and the crushing weight of modern life. Between calls, he decompresses by walking through the park's foggy eucalyptus groves or grabbing a burrito on Clement Street. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014a chef, a teacher, a graphic designer\u2014who ground him. Dating is sporadic; he finds it difficult to switch off his therapist brain and be truly vulnerable himself.\n\nAlex\u2019s dream is to eventually open a private practice focused on serving the South Asian community, helping to destigmatize mental healthcare for the generation caught between cultural tradition and American life. He feels a profound connection to San Francisco\u2014a city that, like his patients, is beautiful, innovative, and deeply wounded. He hopes, one day, to feel he is truly helping it heal."
