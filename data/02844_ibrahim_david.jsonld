Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he was the only child of a Coptic Egyptian history professor and a second-generation American Jewish librarian. His childhood home was a vibrant intellectual space, filled with the aroma of ful medames and matzo ball soup, where lively debates over history and philosophy were the norm. This upbringing endowed him with a unique ability to hold competing ideas in his mind and find the connections between them, a skill that would later define his career.\n\nHe attended the University of Michigan, initially aimless until he discovered the nascent field of Information Science. The dot-com boom was on the horizon, and David was fascinated not by the code itself, but by how technology was reorganizing human systems. After earning his Master\u2019s, he was recruited by a major consulting firm in Chicago. His turning point came during the 2008 financial crisis; watching lumbering corporate giants falter, he realized the future was in nimble, tech-driven innovation. He packed his bags for San Francisco in 2010.\n\nNow 44, David is a highly sought-after management consultant, a \"systems whisperer\" for tech companies navigating complex growth. The 0.0-mile commute on his profile is literal; he works from a minimalist live-work loft in Dogpatch, surrounded by exposed brick and a view of the Bay. His days are structured with disciplined precision: a pre-dawn run along the waterfront, deep work sessions solving intractable corporate puzzles, and evenings spent either with a tight-knit circle of friends or decompressing at a local wine bar. He knows the neighborhood baristas by name, a small but important anchor in a transient city.\n\nHaving achieved financial security, David feels a growing pull toward purpose over profit. The intellectual curiosity inherited from his parents is urging him toward a new problem: ethical technology. His quiet aspiration is to pivot from optimizing corporate efficiency to building his own advisory firm, helping startups integrate social responsibility into their DNA from day one. He hopes to synthesize his professional expertise with his ingrained sense of history and humanity, finally building something that reflects the complex, principled world he was raised in."
