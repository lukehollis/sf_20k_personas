Born and raised in the vibrant, cacophonous Mission District, he was the quiet son of hardworking Oaxacan immigrants. His father, a mechanic with grease-stained hands, saw the world in terms of function and repair, while his mother cleaned the homes of the wealthy in Pacific Heights. For David, escape and wonder were found not in engines, but in the Mission\u2019s defiant murals and the hushed, gilded halls of the de Young Museum, a world away on the other side of the park.\n\nA perceptive high school art teacher recognized his sharp eye and deeper hunger for context, pushing him to apply to SF State. There, he traded the familiarity of 24th Street for the intellectual rigor of art history, eventually earning a Master's degree from UCLA. While offers from larger institutions beckoned, David felt an inexorable pull back to the city that shaped him. He started as a part-time docent at the Cypress Gallery, a respected but intimate museum of Californian art nestled on the edge of Golden Gate Park.\n\nHis career grew organically within those walls. David\u2019s gift wasn't just knowing art, but translating it. He could connect a Plein Air landscape to the tang of sea salt in the air outside or explain an abstract sculpture in a way that resonated with a skeptical tech worker. The key turning point in his life was twofold: his promotion to Head of Education and the loss of his wife, Sarah, a cellist, to cancer a few years later. The museum, once his profession, became his sanctuary. As a long-serving, essential staff member, he was offered the small, rent-controlled apartment on the museum grounds\u2014a relic of a bygone era, making his commute a simple walk across a courtyard.\n\nNow, at 54, David\u2019s days are a quiet ritual. He wakes to the muffled sounds of the park, often walking through the silent galleries with his morning coffee, communing with the art before the doors open to the public. His social life is a small, tight circle of old friends and museum colleagues. David finds his deepest connection in a visitor's moment of discovery\u2014the spark of understanding in a child\u2019s eyes. His dream is no longer about personal ambition, but legacy: to build a robust outreach program that brings kids from the Mission to the museum, giving them the same glimpse into another world that once saved him. He is a steward of history, a quiet anchor of old San Francisco in a city obsessed with the new."
