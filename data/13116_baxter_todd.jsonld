            "value": "Born and raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, Todd Baxter is a product of old San Francisco. His father was a union plumber and his mother a secretary, and their household ran on pragmatism and a steady work ethic. School was never Todd\u2019s strong suit; he was a restless, hands-on learner who preferred tinkering with the family\u2019s old Ford Falcon to sitting in a classroom. Forgoing college, he took a maintenance job at a downtown office building right after high school, quickly earning a reputation for being the guy who could fix anything.\n\nHis career was built not on degrees, but on a quiet architecture of competence. He moved from general maintenance to specializing in HVAC systems, then was hired by a burgeoning law firm during the first dot-com boom. As the firm grew, so did his responsibilities. He learned budgets, vendor management, and security protocols on the job, eventually being promoted to Facilities Manager. Now, at a sleek biotech firm in Mission Bay, he oversees the complex systems that are the building's lifeblood\u2014a role he takes immense pride in, feeling he manages the city's mechanical heartbeat.\n\nTodd\u2019s key turning point was a quiet one: his divorce a decade ago. He and his high school sweetheart had simply grown into different people. The split left him with their rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond and a profound sense of solitude. He filled the void with his work and simple routines.\n\nHis days are structured. An early N-Judah ride, coffee from the same cart, a day of solving problems, and the ride home. Evenings are for a home-cooked meal and old movies. His social life consists of a weekly beer with a couple of old friends and nodding acquaintances with his neighbors. He has seen his city transform, often feeling like a relic from a bygone era, but he holds no bitterness. His connection to San Francisco is etched into his memory of foggy baseball games at Candlestick and the unchanging taste of sourdough.\n\nAt 50, Todd\u2019s aspirations are modest. He dreams of a comfortable retirement, maybe buying a small cabin near the Russian River. More than anything, he hopes for a quiet companionship\u2014someone to share the simple routines that have come to define his well-managed life."

His dad didn\u2019t offer advice, just watched. When the engine finally sputtered to life, a quiet nod was his only praise. In that moment, Todd understood he wasn't meant for books. He was meant to fix things. It was the first time he truly felt competent in his own skin, setting the course for his entire life at sixteen.\n\n2.\nThe dot-com boom was a blur of frantic energy. One night, the law firm's servers went down. A panicked partner found him in the HVAC room. Surrounded by suits on cell phones, Todd methodically traced a tripped breaker in a forgotten closet. The hum of the servers returning was his victory. He wasn\u2019t just a maintenance man anymore; he was the bedrock they relied on. That night in his late twenties taught him that his brand of quiet competence was more valuable than any fancy degree.\n\n3.\nIt wasn't the arguments he remembered most about the divorce, but the silence a day after she left. At forty, he came home to their Inner Richmond apartment and instinctively went to make two cups of coffee. He stopped, holding one empty mug, staring at the space where her coat used to hang. The quiet wasn't peaceful; it was a vacuum. That evening, he learned the shape of loneliness. It was the moment his life bifurcated, forcing him to build a new scaffolding of routine to hold himself up.\n\n4.\nHe was on the N-Judah in his late forties, rattling toward downtown. A group of kids, maybe 25, were loudly discussing stock options. He remembered the same train car filled with plumbers and Muni drivers, their faces tired but familiar. Todd just looked out the window as the train emerged into the Mission Bay sun. He felt like a ghost on his own commute. It wasn\u2019t anger, just a profound sense of time passing, anchoring him even more firmly in the San Francisco he held inside.\n\n5.\nHe remembers the biting wind at Candlestick Park more than any specific play. A night game as a boy, probably against the Dodgers. He was small, bundled in a jacket, sharing a hot dog with his father. They were surrounded by thousands of people, all shivering under the swirling fog, united in their misery and hope. It wasn't about the baseball; it was about being part of something collective and real. That cold, foggy communion is the San Francisco he still carries with him\u2014a feeling of shared, simple belonging."
