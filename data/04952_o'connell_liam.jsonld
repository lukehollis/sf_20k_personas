Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving Irish-American couple, Liam was raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District. His father, a high school history teacher, and his mother, a union nurse, filled their home with books, lively debate, and a deep-seated belief in civic duty. Dinner conversations were less about schoolyard gossip and more about city propositions and social justice, planting the seeds of public service in him from a young age.\n\nThis upbringing naturally led him to major in Political Science at San Francisco State University. While many of his peers were drawn to the lucrative world of tech, Liam felt a pull toward the city\u2019s complex, often frustrating, political heart. A pivotal junior year internship with a City Supervisor sealed his fate. He spent a summer fielding calls from residents, drafting policy memos on housing, and witnessing firsthand how local government decisions rippled through every neighborhood. He was hooked, not by the power, but by the potential for tangible impact.\n\nNow 27, Liam lives a life wholly enmeshed in San Francisco\u2019s civic machinery. As a legislative aide, his days are a whirlwind of meetings, research, and constituent services. He resides in a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that allows him a zero-mile commute to his office at City Hall. His daily routine involves a short walk past the Opera House, grabbing a coffee from a local cafe, and diving into the controlled chaos of his work. His social life often blurs with his professional one, consisting of happy hours with fellow politicos and weekend canvassing for causes he believes in.\n\nBeneath his professional demeanor lies a fierce optimism. Liam sees San Francisco not just as a city of problems, but as a project worth fighting for. He dreams of one day running for the Board of Supervisors himself, aiming to build more equitable housing and advocate for the working-class values his parents instilled in him. He is a product of San Francisco\u2019s unique cultural fusion, driven by a desire to serve the city that gave him everything."

He found his dad in the study, who, instead of offering platitudes, pulled out a map of San Francisco. \"Family isn't just blood, Liam,\" he said, his finger tracing the foggy avenues of the Sunset. \"It's the people who show up and the community you build.\" In that moment, Liam understood his roots were planted right here, in the city that chose him and the parents who loved him.\n\n2.\nHe was thirteen, and his mother, still in her nurse\u2019s scrubs, was passionately debating a transit proposition with his dad over dinner. Liam, feeling bold, interjected that his friends\u2019 parents needed a later bus to get home from their restaurant jobs. His father stopped, looked at him, and said, \"That's a constituent's argument. A good one.\" It wasn't praise for being smart; it was validation. He felt, for the first time, like a participant in the city's conversation, not just a bystander in his own home.\n\n3.\nDuring his City Hall internship at twenty, he spent a full week on the phone with a Mrs. Diaz, an elderly tenant facing an illegal rent increase. The bureaucracy was maddening. But Liam, fueled by cheap coffee and his mother\u2019s union-bred stubbornness, finally found the right person at the Rent Board. Hearing the profound relief in Mrs. Diaz\u2019s voice when the issue was resolved was electric. The abstract idea of \"public service\" suddenly had a name and a sound\u2014it was a person\u2019s home saved.\n\n4.\nLast spring, after months of petitions and tedious meetings, he stood at the corner of Octavia and Linden. He watched a father easily push a stroller across the new, high-visibility crosswalk he had championed for a neighborhood group. It was a tiny piece of city infrastructure, a footnote in the budget. But to him, it was concrete proof that the grinding work\u2014the emails, the follow-ups\u2014could create something real and good. That quiet victory has refueled him on his most cynical days.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his morning walk past the Opera House, the golden dome of City Hall was lit perfectly by the sun. He paused, the smell of coffee from his usual cafe in the air. For a fleeting moment, it wasn\u2019t just his office. It was a promise. He thought of his parents, of Mrs. Diaz, of the crosswalk. He felt the weight and the hope of it all, a quiet vow to himself that one day, he\u2019d walk through those doors not just as an aide, but as someone elected to serve."
