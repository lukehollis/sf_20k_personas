Born in Daly City to second-generation Japanese-American parents, her upbringing was steeped in the scent of soil and the pragmatism of running a small family nursery. A creative and introspective child, Naomi was the first in her family to attend a four-year university, enrolling at SF State with plans to major in graphic design. The vibrant city, just over the hill, felt like a world of possibility.\n\nHer college journey was cut short after three semesters. Her father suffered a debilitating stroke, and Naomi, as the only child, left school to help her mother run the nursery. The dream of art was packed away with her textbooks. For nearly a decade, her days were a cycle of planting, customer service, and balancing ledgers. After her father passed and her mother decided to sell the business, Naomi, then in her early 30s, found herself needing a new path.\n\nLeveraging her organizational skills, she found a foothold as an administrative assistant in the burgeoning tech sector of the late 90s. It wasn\u2019t her passion, but it was stable. She was efficient, reliable, and invisible enough to survive waves of layoffs and industry shifts over the next two decades. She eventually saved enough to move into a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy tranquility suited her disposition.\n\nThe pandemic-induced shift to remote work was the most significant change in her adult life. Her 0.0-mile commute condensed her world into her 600-square-foot apartment. The faces of the young executives she supported became pixelated squares on a screen. Her daily routine is now one of quiet discipline: green tea at dawn, logging into a flurry of emails and calendars, a solitary lunch, and logging off precisely at five. Her main social connection is a weekly phone call with her aging mother in Sacramento and polite nods to neighbors.\n\nNow 54, Naomi feels a gentle stirring of her dormant aspirations. She isn't bitter about her choices; she understands the sacrifices she made. Her hope is not to change careers, but to reclaim a piece of herself. Last month, she enrolled in a weekend pottery class at a community studio. Her dream is a simple one: to fill her quiet apartment not with store-bought decor, but with the beautifully imperfect shapes she coaxes from clay with her own hands, finally creating art for an audience of one."
