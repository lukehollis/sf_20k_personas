Her life began as an unanswered question; she was a foundling, left on the steps of a sprawling Victorian communal house in the Haight-Ashbury in the early 1970s. Raised by a patchwork family of artists, activists, and aging idealists, she was taught that identity was a fluid creation, not a pre-assigned box. Her family tree had branches of every color, but no single root.\n\nFormal schooling never stuck. Instead, Mei Lin\u2019s university became the San Francisco Public Library system. While other kids were in class, she was devouring texts on civil engineering, urban sociology, and systems theory. She saw the city not as a place, but as a living organism, its arteries clogged and inefficient. This self-driven education led to her unique profession: Transportation Planner in None. She holds no municipal post or corporate title. Instead, she is a highly sought-after futurist and independent consultant, hired by think tanks and tech visionaries to design theoretical transit systems for cities of the future.\n\nA key turning point came in her late twenties when she won a prestigious international design competition for a zero-emission, fully autonomous urban network. The win gave her the credibility she lacked on paper and launched her unconventional career. She works from her quiet Inner Sunset apartment, her commute a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to a desk covered in blueprints and data models. Her days are a mix of deep focus and long, analytical walks through Golden Gate Park or along the N Judah line, observing the messy, beautiful flow of people.\n\nSocially, Mei Lin is a solitary creature who values deep connection over broad networks. Her chosen family remains a small circle of friends from different walks of life. Her dream is not for personal wealth, but to see one of her elegant, human-centric systems implemented, creating a city where movement is as unconscious and effortless as breathing. She remains a quintessential San Franciscan: a brilliant anomaly, shaped by the city\u2019s eccentricities, forever reimagining its future."
