            "value": "Dmitri Miller is a man built from quiet competence and the scent of solder. Raised in Portland, Oregon, he was the son of a meticulous car mechanic and a stoic bookkeeper. From a young age, Dmitri preferred the logic of circuits to the chaos of team sports, spending hours in the family garage disassembling and reassembling old radios. He bypassed the traditional four-year university path, finding it impractical, and instead earned an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology from a local community college.\n\nHe arrived in San Francisco in 1999, drawn by the magnetic pull of the first dot-com boom. While others chased stock options, Dmitri found his niche in the labs, the places where theoretical designs met physical reality. He was an engineering technician, the hands-on expert who built the prototypes, ran the stress tests, and diagnosed the failures. He survived the bust by being indispensable and stubbornly practical, moving from one tech giant to the next, always valued for his skill, not his hype.\n\nA key turning point was an amicable divorce over a decade ago. The separation, born from divergent paths rather than anger, left him with a profound sense of self-reliance and a quiet, ordered life. His true transformation, however, came with the pandemic in 2020. When his company\u2019s hardware lab shut down, they couldn\u2019t afford to halt prototype testing. Trusting Dmitri implicitly, they funded the conversion of his Outer Sunset garage into a secure, state-of-the-art micro-lab.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is now a short walk across his foggy backyard. His days are a ritual of strong coffee, focused work on proprietary circuit boards, and detailed reports. He has a few close friends\u2014a fellow motorcycle enthusiast and a neighbor he shares weekly beers with\u2014but he is most at home in his self-contained world. His connection to San Francisco is not in its vibrant nightlife but in the cool, salty air of Ocean Beach, where he walks most evenings. Dmitri doesn't dream of founding a startup; he dreams of mastering his craft and, one day, retiring to work on his own projects, perhaps restoring vintage audio equipment, content in the small, perfect world he built with his own two hands."
