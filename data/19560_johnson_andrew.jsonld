As the only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who ran a bustling Daly City market, the expectation was a stable, lucrative career in medicine or engineering. Andrew, however, was always more interested in the stories of the customers than in the numbers in the ledger. He saw the quiet struggles of families in his community, the stress weighing on the shoulders of kids his own age, and felt a pull he couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nHis turning point came during his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley. While dutifully slogging through pre-med requirements, he started volunteering at a youth center in West Oakland. There, he mentored a teenager navigating a turbulent home life and academic pressure. For the first time, Andrew felt a profound sense of purpose. He saw how targeted support and genuine empathy could change a young person\u2019s trajectory. Against his parents\u2019 wishes, he switched his major to social welfare, a decision that caused a rift in his family for years.\n\nHe earned his Master of Social Work from San Francisco State University and became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Now 34, Andrew works at a large public high school in the city, a role where he feels most effective. His days are a tapestry of teenage anxieties, from identity crises and family conflicts to the overwhelming pressure of living in the Bay Area.\n\nAndrew lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. His 2.1-mile commute is a short Muni ride, a daily ritual of observing the city\u2019s diverse pulse before diving into the intense emotional landscape of his work. He\u2019s been with his partner, Clara, a public-school teacher, for six years. They share a commitment to public service and decompress by exploring Golden Gate Park or trying new taco trucks.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is rooted not in its tech glamour but in its resilient, often-overlooked communities. Andrew\u2019s dream is to one day open a small, community-funded mental health clinic for underserved youth in the city. He wants to build something lasting, a safe harbor for kids like the one who first set him on this path."

As she paid, Andrew saw his own mother discreetly add a heavy bag of rice to her groceries, murmuring about an ordering mistake. The woman\u2019s eyes welled with a silent, profound gratitude. In that quiet exchange, Andrew understood that the deepest form of care was often unspoken, a lesson that would define his entire career.\n\n2.\nThe moment crystallized under the fluorescent lights of the West Oakland youth center. He was 19, a pre-med student. The teenager he was mentoring, who hadn\u2019t said more than three words at a time for weeks, finally looked up from his math homework and described the crushing silence in his house after his parents fought. In that instant, Andrew felt the sterile certainty of medicine fall away, replaced by the messy, vital, and purposeful work of holding another person\u2019s story. It was the only future that mattered.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the heavy silence at the dinner table when he was 20. His father, his hands calloused from work, simply stared at his plate after Andrew announced he was switching to social welfare. The words \u201cI\u2019m disappointed\u201d were never said, but they filled the room, thick and suffocating. The pain of that rift was immense, but it forged in him a stubborn resolve. It was his first real lesson in the personal cost of conviction, and it gave him an unflinching empathy for every student caught between two worlds.\n\n4.\nA few years ago, after a brutal week at work, he and Clara sat on a bench by Spreckels Lake. They didn't speak, just shared carnitas from a paper-wrapped parcel as the fog rolled in over Golden Gate Park. The city felt distant. In the comfortable silence, watching Clara\u2019s tired but peaceful profile, he felt a profound sense of being home. He realized his anchor wasn't a place, but this quiet partnership\u2014a shared harbor from the relentless demands of their work.\n\n5.\nLast year, a student who had been selectively mute in his office for months finally spoke. Her voice was a bare whisper as she described her fear of not being \u201cFilipino enough\u201d for her family nor \u201cAmerican enough\u201d for her peers. The breakthrough was not a dramatic flood of tears, but a fragile, honest whisper. For Andrew, it was a powerful affirmation. This was the work: creating a space safe enough for a single, terrifyingly vulnerable word to be said aloud. It was everything."
