His parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist from Chandigarh, India, settled in Fremont in the late 1970s. They instilled in David a dual mandate: achieve financial security and make them proud. For years, he followed the path perfectly. He was a dutiful son and a brilliant student, driven by a quiet but intense desire to understand and improve the systems that govern human lives.\n\nThis desire led him not to an MBA, but to a Master's in Public Policy from UC Berkeley. He dreamed of reshaping urban landscapes, of creating more equitable and efficient cities. However, the slow grind of bureaucracy and the reality of his student loans quickly soured this idealism. A recruitment event introduced him to the fast-paced, lucrative world of management consulting\u2014a field that promised complex problem-solving and immediate, tangible rewards. He told himself it would be for five years, just long enough to get established. Fifteen years later, he is a senior partner.\n\nDavid\u2019s key turning point wasn't a single event, but a slow erosion. His long-term relationship ended a year ago, a casualty of his punishing work schedule and emotional unavailability. Suddenly alone in his pristine SoMa condo, the life he\u2019d built felt hollow. His 0.0-mile commute meant his world had shrunk to his ergonomic chair, a wall of monitors, and the floor-to-ceiling window showcasing a city he served clients in but no longer truly inhabited.\n\nHis days are a structured sequence of Zoom calls with global teams, data analysis, and crafting impeccable PowerPoint decks. Evenings are often spent at his building's gym or on a solitary walk along the Embarcadero, the Bay Bridge a glittering, indifferent companion. His social life consists of infrequent, expensive dinners with colleagues where conversations orbit around market trends and exit strategies.\n\nNow, at 43, David\u2019s old aspirations are resurfacing. He finds himself idly browsing job boards for urban planning non-profits and sketching transit solutions on a notepad. His dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder, but about finding a way off it. He hopes to one day use his skills and capital to invest in a social enterprise, to finally reconnect with the idealistic young man who once believed he could fix the city, one system at a time."
