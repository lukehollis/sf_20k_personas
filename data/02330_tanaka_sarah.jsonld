Raised in San Jose by a Japanese-American father who ran a small auto repair shop and a Filipina mother who worked as a nurse, Sarah grew up surrounded by the tangible. While her friends dreamed of college dorms, she found solace in the logic of her father\u2019s garage, where a problem had a physical cause and a definitive solution.\n\nSchool felt abstract and unfulfilling, so after high school, she enrolled in City College of San Francisco\u2019s Electronics Technology program. The two-year associate\u2019s degree was a revelation. Soldering circuit boards and diagnosing system failures provided the same satisfaction as fixing an engine, but with a delicate, modern focus. This practical education became her entry into the city\u2019s booming tech industry, not through a keyboard, but through a microscope and a soldering iron.\n\nFor the last six years, Sarah has been an assembly line technician at a boutique hardware startup. Her commute is a 90-second walk from her small, rent-controlled apartment to the sleek, glass-fronted lab across the street. Her days are a quiet hum of machinery and intense focus, assembling and testing the complex guts of devices destined for global markets. She is the hidden, essential hand in an industry that lionizes coders and CEOs.\n\nHer life is routine but not unhappy. Evenings are for herself: meticulously restoring vintage synthesizers she finds online, a hobby that connects her skills with a love for music. Her social circle is small, limited to a few coworkers she shares lunch with and the barista at her corner coffee shop. She is an observer of the city more than a participant, watching the fog roll in over the shipyards from her window.\n\nSarah doesn\u2019t dream of climbing the corporate ladder. Her aspiration is quieter, more personal. She\u2019s saving diligently, hoping one day to open her own small, specialized electronics repair shop\u2014a modern version of her father\u2019s garage. It\u2019s a dream of independence and mastery, of building a life on her own terms, one perfectly repaired connection at a time."
