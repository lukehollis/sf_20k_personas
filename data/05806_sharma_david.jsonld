Born into an Indo-Fijian family, his heritage was a complex tapestry of South Asian roots woven into a Pacific Islander upbringing. When David was eight, seeking political stability and greater opportunity, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in the diverse, working-class landscape of Daly City. He watched his parents work multiple service jobs, their lives a testament to quiet resilience. This instilled in him a profound awareness of the struggles faced by immigrant communities navigating unfamiliar systems.\n\nThis formative experience guided him to San Francisco State University, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. He was less interested in corporate ladders and more in the architecture of society itself\u2014what held communities together and what left people behind. After graduating, a brief, soul-crushing stint in corporate HR solidified his calling. The turning point came when he helped an elderly Filipino neighbor, who spoke limited English, successfully dispute a medical bill after a hospital stay. The relief on her face was more rewarding than any commission he had ever earned.\n\nNow, at 33, David lives and works as a Community Health Worker in San Francisco's Tenderloin district. His 0.0-mile commute is a core part of his identity; his clients are his neighbors. His small, functional apartment is his sanctuary amidst the city's chaotic heart. His days are a blur of motion: connecting unhoused individuals with clinic services, translating medical jargon for recent immigrants, and running wellness workshops at the local community center.\n\nHis social life is deeply intertwined with his work, consisting of a close-knit circle of fellow non-profit workers, local artists, and the owner of the corner market where he buys his groceries. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but impact. He hopes to one day secure funding to launch a mobile health unit, bringing preventative care directly to the most isolated members of his community. He sees San Francisco not as a hub of tech and glamor, but as a city of villages, each with its own needs, and he has dedicated his life to tending to his own."
