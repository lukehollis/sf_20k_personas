Her mother, a first-generation immigrant from Taiwan, ran a small seamstress business, and her father, a second-generation Chinese-American, was an accountant. Growing up, Mei was instilled with a strong work ethic and a practical approach to life. The hum of fabric and the meticulous calculations of ledgers formed the backdrop of her childhood.\n\nAcademically driven, Mei excelled in mathematics and science. She attended UC Berkeley, earning a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, followed by a Master's in Industrial Engineering. Her career began on the production floor, gaining invaluable hands-on experience before moving into management. She rose steadily through the ranks of various manufacturing companies, eventually becoming a Senior Operations Manager, a role demanding precision, problem-solving, and the ability to navigate complex global supply chains.\n\nKey turning points included implementing significant efficiency improvements that saved a previous company millions and navigating the challenges of offshoring during a difficult economic period. These experiences solidified her reputation as a capable and resilient leader.\n\nMei is married to David Miller, a software engineer she met in an evening MBA class. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and shared ambition. They have one adult daughter, currently pursuing her own career in New York. Mei maintains close ties with her family, particularly her aging mother, and is actively involved in a local women's professional network.\n\nDespite the demanding nature of her work and the 15.5-mile commute that takes her south of the city, Mei finds solace in her routines. Her mornings begin early, often with a cup of tea overlooking the cityscape from her Outer Sunset home. Evenings are spent either with David, catching up on their days, or engaging in her hobbies, which include intricate knitting and tending to her small but thriving urban garden.\n\nMei's connection to San Francisco runs deep. It is the city where she was born, educated, and built her career. She appreciates its vibrant energy and diverse communities, though she sometimes laments the changing landscape and the increasing cost of living.\n\nLooking towards the future, Mei hopes to mentor younger women entering engineering and operations roles. She also envisions dedicating more time to travel with David and perhaps pursuing a smaller, more sustainable manufacturing venture in the future, leveraging her extensive experience for social good. For now, she finds satisfaction in the challenges of her current position and the stability her career provides for her family and future aspirations."

The focus in her mother's eyes, the painstaking care in each stitch\u2014it instilled in Mei a deep respect for precision and craft, a foundational piece of her later engineering mind. It was a quiet lesson in making something beautiful and functional from raw materials.\n\n2.  Standing on Sproul Plaza after graduation, the Berkeley Campanile a proud landmark against the blue sky, a wave of relief and accomplishment washed over her. The long hours, the challenging coursework, the juggling of family responsibilities \u2013 it had all culminated in this moment. It solidified her belief that dedication and hard work could open unimaginable doors, a truth she carried into her career.\n\n3.  The email landed in her inbox confirming her first management promotion. A knot of anxiety and excitement tightened in her stomach as she reread the title: Operations Manager. It felt like a significant leap, a recognition of her years on the production floor and a chance to apply her analytical skills on a larger scale. It was a turning point, shifting her perspective from individual contribution to leading and influencing others.\n\n4.  Holding her newborn daughter in her arms in her Richmond District home, the enormity of responsibility and love overwhelmed her. The world suddenly felt different, sharper, more precious. The drive to provide, to build stability, intensified tenfold, fueling her ambitions and choices in her demanding career. This tiny life became a new, powerful engine for her dedication.\n\n5.  Watching her mother, frail but with a twinkle in her eye, recount stories of their family's journey while sitting on a worn armchair in her childhood home, a profound wave of gratitude and belonging settled over Mei. The continuity of generations, the unspoken sacrifices, the bedrock of family \u2013 it grounded her, reminding her of where she came from and the enduring strength found in connection."
