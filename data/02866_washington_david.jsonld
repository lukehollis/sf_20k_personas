Raised by a librarian mother and a civil engineer father, his childhood home was a quiet, orderly place built on the foundations of public service and systematic thinking. This upbringing instilled in him a belief that complex problems could be solved with enough data and well-structured logic. He pursued this belief through a state university education and then a Master\u2019s in Public Policy from a prestigious East Coast university, envisioning a career shaping a more equitable society from within the halls of government.\n\nHis first decade was spent in the bureaucratic labyrinth of Washington, D.C. While intellectually stimulating, the work felt increasingly abstract, disconnected from the lives it was meant to improve. The turning point came at age 30. Burned out and disillusioned by federal gridlock, he accepted a Senior Policy Analyst position with the City of San Francisco, drawn by the promise of tackling tangible, immediate urban challenges like housing and transit.\n\nNow 40, David lives and works in a meticulously organized one-bedroom apartment in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a post-pandemic work culture he\u2019s fully embraced. His days are a disciplined ritual: a morning espresso from a local caf\u00e9, hours spent deep in data sets and policy drafts, and a late-afternoon walk through his neighborhood to deconstruct the very urban fabric he analyzes professionally. He is single, having found long-term relationships difficult to balance with his consuming work, but maintains a small, loyal circle of friends\u2014fellow policy wonks and urbanists\u2014for dinners and intellectual debate.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intensely professional yet deeply personal. He sees the city as a living document he is helping to edit. His youthful dream of changing the world has matured into a more focused aspiration: to be a key author of one significant, successful municipal project. He hopes to one day walk past a thriving supportive housing complex or ride a new, efficient light rail line and know, with quiet satisfaction, that his analysis helped lay its foundation."
