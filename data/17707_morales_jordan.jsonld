Born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, the hum of industry is in his blood. His father, a union man at a Ford assembly plant for thirty-five years, taught him the value of tangible work, while his mother, a high school administrator, instilled in him the belief that a degree was the key to being the one designing the line, not just working on it. This duality pushed Jordan toward a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Purdue, a practical choice for a practical mind.\n\nHe spent his first decade post-grad working in Midwest automotive and appliance manufacturing, mastering the logistics of production flow. The turning point came twelve years ago, when a Bay Area medical device company, struggling to scale its manufacturing, recruited him. The move to San Francisco was a culture shock and a significant professional gamble. It paid off handsomely in his career, positioning him as an expert in optimizing high-value, small-batch production. The demanding new role, however, contributed to the amicable end of his marriage.\n\nNow, Jordan\u2019s life is a study in structured routine. He lives in a modest single-family home in the Bayview, a neighborhood whose industrial roots feel familiar. His 6.8-mile commute to the manufacturing facility near Potrero Hill is his time to decompress with podcasts about process management. On the floor, he is the indispensable link between idealistic designers and the realities of production, respected by his teams for his calm demeanor and clear direction.\n\nHis personal life is centered on his 15-year-old daughter, who lives with her mother in Oakland. He cherishes their weekends together, exploring Golden Gate Park or catching a Giants game. His dream isn't flashy; it\u2019s about stability. He wants to see his daughter through college debt-free and eventually start his own consulting firm, helping smaller Bay Area makers streamline their operations. For Jordan, success isn't about disruption, but about building something that lasts."

He was nine. \u201cEverything has a place, Jordy,\u201d his dad had said, tracing the teeth of the gear. \u201cYou just have to find it.\u201d It wasn't just about the part; it was a lesson in order and purpose. That quiet moment in their Chicago garage planted the seed of his entire career, teaching him to see the elegant system hidden within every complex machine.\n \n2.\nHis first week in San Francisco, twelve years ago, he stood on Potrero Hill and watched the fog swallow the skyline. The familiar industrial landscape was gone, replaced by an unsettling, silent grayness. He felt a profound sense of isolation, a fear that he\u2019d traded the tangible Midwest for something beautiful but unknowable. The weight of his professional gamble and his fracturing marriage felt immense. It was a memory of doubt that hardened his resolve to succeed here on his own terms.\n\n3.\nThe sound was a crisp, perfect *click*. About ten years ago, a critical component for a new pacemaker had been failing assembly tests for weeks. Jordan had spent a weekend redesigning the workflow and a small jig. On Monday, he watched the technician use it. The component slid in and seated perfectly. The relief on the young tech\u2019s face, and the quiet satisfaction in his own chest, was better than any bonus. It was the moment he knew the move had been right.\n\n4.\nEight years ago, standing on the Oakland ferry dock after handing his seven-year-old daughter, Maya, back to her mother. The August wind was sharp. As the ferry pulled away, he saw her small form waving until she was just a speck. The wide, gray water between them felt like a physical representation of the divorce. That recurring ache on the ride back to San Francisco solidified his mission: to make every moment they did have together intentional, stable, and full of warmth.\n\n5.\nFive years ago, he plunged a shovel into the packed earth of his Bayview backyard for the first time. The house was his, a quiet anchor after years of flux. He wasn't a gardener, but the simple, physical act of breaking ground to plant tomatoes felt significant. It wasn't about optimizing a process or meeting a deadline. It was about putting down his own roots, creating something small and lasting in a city that finally, after all this time, was starting to feel like home."
