Raised in the quiet, predictable landscape of the Central Valley, she grew up in a household where practicality was prized above all else. Her father fixed tractors, and her mother managed the books for a local farm. Life was stable but felt small. At twenty, craving a life less planned, Susan packed a single suitcase and followed a friend to San Francisco, drawn by hazy promises of freedom and a world beyond dusty orchards.\n\nHer first decade in the city was a blur of survival jobs: waitressing in North Beach, stocking shelves in the Haight, and bartending in the Outer Sunset. She absorbed the city through osmosis, learning its rhythms, its moods, and its people. The work was transient, but the experience was formative. In her early thirties, tired of financial instability, she saw a hiring notice for SFMTA. A union job with benefits and a pension felt like winning the lottery. It promised the kind of security her parents had, but on her own terms, in the city she had adopted.\n\nThe transition from cocktail shakers to the wheel of a 40-foot bus was the defining turning point of her life. For two decades, she has operated the 38-Geary line, a cross-section of the city itself. Her bus is a rolling microcosm of San Francisco\u2014from the foggy avenues of the Richmond, through the bustle of Japantown, to the gritty realities of the Tenderloin. Susan has been a de facto therapist, a first responder, and an impromptu tour guide. She knows her regulars by name and can spot trouble a block away.\n\nNow at 50, her life has a steady, if demanding, cadence. A short-lived marriage in her late twenties left her with a fierce independence and a grown son who now lives in Portland. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of other drivers who understand the unique pressures of the job. She lives in a simple one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond, a quiet refuge from the day\u2019s cacophony. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; it\u2019s a peaceful retirement, perhaps on the Oregon coast. But she knows she would miss the pulse of the city, a rhythm she doesn\u2019t just observe but helps create, one stop at a time."
