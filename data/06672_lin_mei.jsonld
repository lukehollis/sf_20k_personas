The daughter of pragmatic Hong Kong immigrants who settled in the fog-drenched Sunset District, she was raised on a steady diet of expectation. Her parents, who ran a small grocery store, envisioned a secure future for her as a lawyer or accountant. Mei honored their wishes initially, enrolling in Economics at UC Berkeley, but a single elective in modern art history derailed their plans and ignited hers. The course was a revelation, connecting her to a world of expression and social commentary that felt more real than any supply-and-demand curve.\n\nThis pivot became the defining moment of her life. After graduating, she defied her parents' gentle disappointment by pursuing a Master's degree in Arts Administration from San Francisco State University. Her career began in the trenches of the city's non-profit arts scene: writing grants in cramped offices, hanging exhibits for demanding artists, and learning the delicate dance of fundraising. She discovered a hidden talent not for creating art, but for creating the *space* for art to happen.\n\nNow, at 49, Mei is the Program Manager for a thriving community arts center, conveniently located in the same converted warehouse building as her loft apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs, where her day is a whirlwind of managing budgets, mentoring emerging artists, and planning public workshops. Her social life is deeply interwoven with her work; her closest friends are the muralists, sculptors, and poets she champions. She has been single for several years, contentedly married to her mission of keeping art accessible in a city increasingly defined by wealth.\n\nMei has watched San Francisco transform, seeing artist enclaves pushed out by tech booms. Her driving ambition is not personal wealth, but securing a permanent endowment for her center, ensuring it remains a sanctuary for creativity long after she\u2019s gone. Her life is a testament to her belief that a city\u2019s soul is not found in its high-rises, but in the studios and galleries where its stories are told."
