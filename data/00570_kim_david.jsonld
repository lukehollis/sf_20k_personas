            "value": "David Rodriguez Kim is a product of two distinct, vibrant cultures that merged in the sun-drenched landscape of 1970s Los Angeles. His mother, Min-jun Kim, was a determined Korean immigrant who ran a small dry-cleaning business with an iron will. His father, Hector Rodriguez, a second-generation Mexican-American carpenter, was a gentle man who carried a silent, unnamed melancholy. David grew up in a home filled with the scent of kimchi jjigae and simmering carnitas, navigating the expectations of two families and often feeling like a cultural ambassador. He witnessed his father wrestle with depression, a struggle that was never diagnosed or treated, planting the seed for David\u2019s future path.\n\nHe fled the sprawl of L.A. for the Bay Area, earning his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and finding his calling. The turning point came during a volunteer shift at a free clinic, where he saw the profound relief on a man\u2019s face after simply being heard. It solidified his decision to pursue a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State. His career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) became his way of giving others the language and support his father never had. He specialized in mental health within large healthcare systems, drawn to the challenge of providing care within a complex, often impersonal bureaucracy.\n\nNow 49, David\u2019s life is centered in his quiet Inner Richmond apartment, which doubles as his office. The 0.0-mile commute is a post-pandemic shift he embraced, allowing him to reclaim his time. His days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions, where he guides patients through anxiety, trauma, and loss. Between appointments, he recharges with long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park, the fog a comforting blanket. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014his chosen family\u2014who gather for dinners that reflect his own blended heritage.\n\nDavid\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep and neighborhood-specific. He loves the Inner Richmond's unpretentious vibe, the mix of Russian bakeries and Chinese grocery stores. His dream is no longer about career advancement but about impact and peace. He hopes to one day transition to a small private practice, mentoring younger therapists, especially those from mixed-heritage backgrounds. He yearns to help others navigate the complex intersections of identity, finding wholeness in the city that allowed him to find his own."
