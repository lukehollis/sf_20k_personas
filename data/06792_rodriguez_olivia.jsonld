The daughter of Filipino immigrants who settled in Daly City, she was raised on the twin pillars of relentless work ethic and the promise of education. Her parents, a nurse and a postal worker, saw a future for their daughter beyond their own toil, and Olivia absorbed that ambition completely. She was the family\u2019s academic star, channeling her focus into earning a full scholarship to UC Berkeley for Economics.\n\nHer early career was a calculated climb. After Berkeley, she pursued an MBA at Stanford, where she was recruited by a top-tier global consulting firm. It was there she met Javier Rodriguez, a charismatic strategist from Colombia. They married young and became a quintessential power couple, their lives a whirlwind of international flights, high-stakes presentations, and lavish corporate dinners. For fifteen years, Olivia\u2019s home was a suitcase. She thrived on the pressure, skillfully diagnosing corporate rot and prescribing billion-dollar solutions. The marriage, however, buckled under the strain of two separate, demanding trajectories. Their divorce was amicable but felt inevitable, leaving Olivia with a new sense of independence and her married name.\n\nThe pandemic was an unexpected turning point. Grounded indefinitely, Olivia discovered a life outside the airport lounge. She traded her anonymous high-rise condo for a meticulously designed space in Hayes Valley, relishing the 0.0-mile commute. Her days are now a blend of intense focus and quiet neighborhood rhythms. Mornings are for Zoom calls with C-suite executives, her mind as sharp as ever, followed by an afternoon walk to a local cafe or a yoga class to decompress.\n\nAt 52, Olivia feels a shift in her aspirations. The thrill of corporate restructuring is waning, replaced by a desire for legacy. She\u2019s started mentoring young women in her field and is exploring a transition to consulting for non-profits. She dreams of using her sharp, analytical mind not just for profit, but for purpose. Her Hayes Valley home is her sanctuary, a base from which she plots a future that is less about climbing and more about building something that lasts."
