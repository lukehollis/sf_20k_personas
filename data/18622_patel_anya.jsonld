Adopted as an infant by a first-generation Indian-American couple, she grew up a white girl with the last name Patel in the vibrant, suburban warmth of Fremont. Her parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist, instilled in her a deep respect for education and a profound sense of compassion. Her childhood was a happy fusion of cultures\u2014celebrating Diwali with just as much enthusiasm as Christmas\u2014which gave her a unique, early understanding that family is defined by love, not by blood or appearance. This upbringing ignited a deep empathy for those navigating complex family dynamics and identity issues.\n\nThis personal history naturally guided her toward a career in social work. After earning her B.A. from UC Berkeley, she pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, focusing on child and family services. Now a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Anya works for a city-contracted agency, providing counseling and support to high school students in the public school system. She finds immense purpose in helping teenagers navigate anxiety, family conflict, and the pressures of adolescence, often drawing on her own journey of self-discovery.\n\nAnya lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her daily routine begins with a foggy walk to a local coffee shop before catching the 38 Geary MUNI bus for her 2.8-mile commute. Evenings are for unwinding\u2014either with a run through Golden Gate Park, trying a new dim sum spot on Clement Street with a close-knit group of friends from grad school, or simply curling up with a book. A recent breakup has left her feeling reflective, channeling more of her energy into her work and friendships.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is profound; she loves the city's mosaic of cultures, its progressive politics, and its proximity to the raw nature of the coast. Looking forward, Anya dreams of establishing a small private practice dedicated to supporting transracial adoptees and their families. For her, it\u2019s not about wealth, but about creating a space of belonging\u2014a full-circle tribute to the family that gave her a name and a future."

You\u2019re not Indian.\u201d Anya froze, the tiny flame flickering. Her father knelt beside her, his hand warm on her shoulder. \u201cThis is our family\u2019s festival,\u201d he said gently, \u201cand you are our family.\u201d In that moment, the confusion melted into a fierce, solid love. It wasn\u2019t a defense, but a statement of fact. It became the bedrock of her understanding that family was a fortress built of love, not of matching faces.\n\n2.\nDuring her sophomore year at UC Berkeley, sitting in a stuffy lecture hall for a sociology elective, a guest speaker\u2014a social worker specializing in transracial adoption\u2014took the stage. As the woman spoke about identity formation and the feeling of being a \u201cbridge between worlds,\u201d Anya felt a jolt of recognition so profound it was almost audible. The abstract feelings of her entire life were being given a name, a framework, and a purpose. She changed her major the next day, her path suddenly illuminated and clear.\n\n3.\nOne foggy morning during her first year of grad school, Anya was packed into the 38 Geary MUNI. Leaning against the window, she listened to the symphony of the city: Cantonese chatter behind her, a student\u2019s headphones leaking hip-hop, the automated stop announcement. Looking at the diverse sea of faces, all moving together through the gray morning, she was overwhelmed by a sense of profound belonging. She wasn't an anomaly here; she was just one more unique story in a city built of them. She was home.\n\n4.\nJust last year, a quiet, withdrawn sophomore she was counseling finally opened up. \u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d the student whispered, looking at his hands, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t really fit in with my step-dad\u2019s family, but I don\u2019t totally fit with my mom\u2019s anymore, either.\u201d The words landed in Anya\u2019s chest with the weight of her own history. She met his gaze and simply said, \u201cI understand that feeling.\u201d The flicker of relief in his eyes\u2014of being truly seen\u2014was the most powerful professional validation she had ever received.\n\n5.\nA few weeks after the breakup, she was on an evening run in Golden Gate Park. The air was cold and damp, smelling of eucalyptus. As she neared the ocean, the familiar ache of loneliness was sharp in her chest. But then, there was also the steady rhythm of her own feet on the path, her lungs burning with effort. She stopped, breathing hard in the fading light, and felt a quiet shift. The sadness was real, but so was her own strength. The city, her work, her friendships\u2014that was her foundation."
