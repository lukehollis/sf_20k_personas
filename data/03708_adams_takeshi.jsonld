Born in Oakland to a Japanese immigrant mother, a meticulous nurse, and a second-generation American architect father, Takeshi\u2019s childhood was spent navigating the hyphen in \"Japanese-American.\" He learned empathy from his mother\u2019s bedside stories and a love for elegant structure from his father\u2019s blueprints, two traits that would later define his professional life.\n\nInitially, Takeshi didn't feel a calling. He drifted through his undergraduate years at SF State, feeling like a ghost in the machine of the burgeoning dot-com boom. The turning point was not a single event but a slow erosion of spirit, watching friends chase IPOs while he felt an unnamable void. It was volunteering at a hospice during the height of the AIDS crisis in the 90s that finally gave him a direction. Witnessing the profound work of social workers\u2014providing dignity and advocacy amidst immense suffering\u2014ignited a purpose within him. He enrolled at UC Berkeley, earning a Master of Social Work.\n\nFor two decades, Takeshi worked within the bustling, often chaotic, halls of a major San Francisco hospital. He specialized in palliative care, counseling families and patients facing terminal illness. He met his late husband, a chef named Leo, during this time; their 15-year partnership was a bedrock of shared joy and quiet domesticity, ending too soon from a sudden illness five years ago.\n\nThe pandemic shifted his practice to telehealth, and Takeshi discovered he was more effective without the institutional noise. His 0.0-mile commute is now a short walk from his kitchen to a spare bedroom converted into a calm, book-lined office. His days are structured by virtual patient appointments, punctuated by walks through Golden Gate Park to clear his head.\n\nAt 53, Takeshi\u2019s ambitions are no longer about career-climbing but about legacy and peace. He hopes to establish a mentorship program for new LCSWs, helping them build resilience against the burnout he knows so well. He also dreams of taking a sabbatical to finally visit his mother's small coastal hometown in Japan, closing a circle that began before he was born. His connection to San Francisco is one of deep, layered history\u2014a city that has both wounded and healed him, and where he now offers that same healing, one session at a time."

He asked Takeshi not for water, but to describe the Golden Gate Bridge as if he\u2019d never seen it. As Takeshi spoke of the impossible color and the fog, he felt a profound shift. It wasn't about saving a life, but honoring one. In that moment, the nameless void inside him was filled with purpose, a quiet but absolute sense of direction.\n\n2.\nHe first saw Leo on a rare night off, across a loud Mission District restaurant. Takeshi was exhausted from a brutal week at the hospital, but Leo, the chef, was pure energy, laughing as he delivered a plate. Later, Leo sent over a perfect, architecturally sound yuzu a\u00efoli alongside grilled asparagus. \u201cYour father\u2019s blueprints, your mother\u2019s soul food,\u201d Leo said, having overheard him on the phone. It was the first time someone had seen both halves of him at once. That night, the weight of his work felt lighter.\n\n3.\nA week after Leo died, Takeshi tried to make rice. He reached for the donabe, the earthenware pot they\u2019d bought together in Japantown, and it slipped. The crash was muted, the thick clay breaking into three clean pieces on the kitchen floor. He didn\u2019t weep. He simply knelt and stared at the fracture. His carefully structured life, our life, he thought, broken. It was a tangible shard of grief, a quiet, absolute devastation that taught him more about loss than two decades of professional practice ever could.\n\n4.\nHe must have been seven or eight. His father had blueprints for a new building spread across the dining room table, a world of elegant, precise lines. That night, his mother sat on his bed and, instead of a fairytale, told him a story of the ocean near her childhood home in Japan\u2014its sounds, its smells, its moods. He fell asleep feeling securely held between two things: the solid logic of a structure and the boundless depth of a story. It was the first time he understood he could live in both.\n\n5.\nDuring the first quiet months of the pandemic, after a draining telehealth session, he walked into Golden Gate Park. The fog was heavy, muffling the city into a gentle hum. Standing in the AIDS Memorial Grove, he touched the cool, damp bark of a tree and felt the decades of institutional stress finally dissolve from his shoulders. The hospital walls were gone. It was just him, the quiet air, and the work. This, he realized with startling clarity, was the way forward. A path of his own making."
