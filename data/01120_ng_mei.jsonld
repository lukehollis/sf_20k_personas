Born and raised in the Richmond District, her childhood was a symphony of rattling Muni buses and the aromatic steam from her parents' small dim sum shop on Clement Street. As the eldest daughter of hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, her future was assumed: take over the family business. For years, she dutifully followed this path, her hands learning the delicate folds of a *har gow* while her mind wandered beyond the storefront window.\n\nThe turning point came not as a rebellion, but as a crisis. When her father suffered a major stroke at 55, Mei Lin, then 28, became his primary caregiver. She spent months navigating a bewildering healthcare system, fighting for resources, and providing emotional support for which she felt utterly unprepared. It was in the sterile quiet of hospital waiting rooms and the frustrating bureaucracy of social services that she discovered her true calling. Witnessing the profound impact of a single compassionate social worker on her family\u2019s ordeal ignited a new purpose within her.\n\nAt thirty, she defied all expectation, selling her share of the business to her younger brother and enrolling in community college. Her journey was slow but determined, leading to a bachelor's at SF State and finally a Master of Social Work. Today, at 54, Mei Lin is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) specializing in geriatric care and caregiver burnout.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the life she built. She runs her private practice via telehealth from a converted office in her Inner Sunset home, a cozy flat she bought after her divorce a decade ago. Her days are structured by client sessions, notes, and long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. Divorced and with her son now a software engineer in Austin, her connections are a small, tight circle of friends and the deep bonds she forms with the families she helps.\n\nMei Lin\u2019s dream is no longer about escape, but about deepening her roots. She hopes to create a pro-bono support group for new caregivers, offering the guidance she once desperately needed. She is a quiet fixture in her city\u2014a woman who found her purpose not by leaving her world behind, but by learning how to heal it from within."
