            "value": "Benjamin Cohen was a product of Southern California sunshine and suburban stability. Raised in La Mesa, a quiet suburb of San Diego, by a high school history teacher father and a dental hygienist mother, his childhood was defined by scraped knees, little league, and the steady, comforting rhythm of middle-class life. He was always more adept with words than with code, which led him to UC Santa Barbara, where he pursued a degree in Communications, believing his path lay in public relations or journalism.\n\nThe turning point came during a post-graduation internship. Tasked with managing social media for a small e-commerce brand, Ben discovered a fascination with analytics and digital strategy. He saw how marketing was shifting from creative slogans to data-driven campaigns. The traditional paths felt antiquated; the future, and the jobs, were in tech. He retooled his resume, taught himself the basics of SEO and content marketing, and after dozens of applications, landed a Marketing Coordinator position at a mid-size SaaS company based in San Francisco.\n\nHe moved into a sleek but small apartment in Hayes Valley in early 2020, dreaming of post-work drinks in SoMa and weekend trips to Marin. Weeks later, the world shut down. His commute became a 0.0-mile walk from his bed to his desk, his office a corner of his living room overlooking a bustling street he could only observe. His connection to San Francisco became hyper-local: he knows the baristas at Ritual Coffee by name, has a favorite bench in Patricia's Green, and spends evenings at the bouldering gym in the Mission to combat the isolation of remote work.\n\nNow 25, Ben is successful on paper but quietly adrift. His social life revolves around a small group of fellow UCSB alumni and the fleeting connections made on dating apps. He feels more like a resident of his laptop than of the vibrant, complicated city outside his window. His dream is to eventually leverage his marketing skills for a nonprofit or an arts organization\u2014something that contributes to the city's culture rather than just its stock value. For now, he finds meaning in small routines, aspiring to one day afford an apartment where his bedroom and his office aren't the same room."
