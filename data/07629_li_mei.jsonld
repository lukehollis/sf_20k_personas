The only child of hardworking immigrants from Guangdong, her upbringing was a constant hum of expectation. Her parents, who ran a small laundromat, poured their life savings and hopes into her, envisioning a future in business or tech\u2014a world away from their own strenuous labor. For a time, Mei followed this path, enrolling in a business program at San Francisco State University, her future seemingly mapped out.\n\nThe map was irrevocably redrawn during her sophomore year when her mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. Mei dropped out of college, telling her parents it was temporary, but knowing deep down it was a permanent shift. The theoretical world of business contracts faded, replaced by the practical, demanding reality of caregiving. She learned about medication schedules, patient mobility, and the quiet art of providing comfort through confusion. This duty, born of love and necessity, unexpectedly bloomed into a calling. After her mother passed away, the laundromat was sold, and Mei, now in her mid-twenties, found she had a skill set and a profound empathy for the elderly.\n\nNow, at 32, Mei is a live-in caregiver for an 88-year-old woman named Eleanor in a stately Pacific Heights home. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life lived within the confines of her work. Her days are a quiet rhythm of preparing meals, administering medication, reading aloud, and providing steady companionship. Her connection to the city is now seen through Eleanor\u2019s bay windows or during brief, solitary walks through Lafayette Park. Social connections are sparse\u2014a weekly video call with her best friend from high school and bi-weekly visits to her aging father in the Sunset.\n\nThough her life is contained, her dreams are not. Mei aspires to return to school, not for business, but to earn a nursing degree. She saves what she can, picturing a small apartment of her own, a space where she isn't just Mei the caregiver, but simply Mei. She dreams of a future where her compassion is her profession, but her life is entirely her own, a quiet testament to the resilience forged in the heart of San Francisco."
