The only child of Punjabi immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a high school math teacher mother\u2014Sarah\u2019s upbringing was a blend of traditional values and Silicon Valley ambition. Dinner table conversations revolved around calculus and the virtues of a stable career path. She absorbed their ethos of hard work, excelling in school and aiming for a future that was both lucrative and secure.\n\nShe pursued an economics degree at UC Berkeley, but it was during a summer internship that she found her calling. Surrounded by the frenetic energy of a startup seeking Series A funding, she became fascinated not by the products, but by the numbers that told their story. This led her to a Master of Science in Financial Analysis at the University of San Francisco, a deliberate choice to immerse herself in the city\u2019s economic heart. Upon graduating, she landed a demanding role as a financial and investment analyst for a major tech corporation, dissecting the viability of potential acquisitions from her home office.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute defines her current life. Sarah lives in a sleek, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, where her living room doubles as her workspace. Her days are structured and intense: a 6 a.m. run through the quiet streets, followed by ten hours of spreadsheets, market research, and video calls. The pandemic normalized this isolation, but Sarah now actively works to counter it. She\u2019s a regular at a local pottery studio, finding a tangible sense of creation that her digital work lacks. Her social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends from her graduate program, with whom she explores the city's culinary scene on weekends.\n\nThough successful, Sarah yearns for more impact. Analyzing billion-dollar deals feels impersonal. Her dream is to pivot to venture capital, specifically to a fund that invests in female and minority-led startups. She wants to be the one on the other side of the table, using her expertise to champion the underdogs and build something new, connecting her parents' immigrant drive with her own vision for a more equitable future in tech."
