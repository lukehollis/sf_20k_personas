Raised in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District, he is the only son of first-generation Korean immigrants who poured their life savings into \"Seoul House,\" a small, beloved neighborhood restaurant. His childhood was a blur of homework at a corner table and learning the difference between perfectly fermented kimchi and a batch that was just slightly off. His parents envisioned a different future for him\u2014a corner office, not a kitchen corner\u2014and pushed him toward a business degree.\n\nHe obediently enrolled at San Francisco State University, but the lectures on market capitalization felt hollow compared to the tangible satisfaction of a busy dinner service. The turning point came during his sophomore year when his father suffered a heart attack. David dropped his classes to run Seoul House, intending it to be temporary. Instead, he found his calling. He discovered a natural talent for managing staff, soothing demanding customers, and streamlining inventory. He never returned to college; the restaurant became his classroom and his career.\n\nNow at 30, David\u2019s world is the single city block his restaurant occupies. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a flight of stairs from the apartment above the restaurant where he grew up. His day starts with early morning trips to the wholesale markets and ends late after he\u2019s shared a quiet beer with his head chef. He\u2019s the anchor of his small community, knowing his regulars by name and their children by their ever-changing favorite dishes.\n\nWhile he has honored his parents' recipes, he has subtly made the restaurant his own, introducing craft beer pairings and a modern, minimalist d\u00e9cor. His deepest aspiration isn't to become a celebrity chef, but to earn a Michelin Bib Gourmand\u2014not for himself, but as a definitive tribute to his parents' sacrifice. David dreams of creating a legacy that lasts, a place that feels like home for generations of San Franciscans, and perhaps, one day, finding a partner who understands that his life's greatest love affair will always be with the warm, bustling dining room downstairs."
