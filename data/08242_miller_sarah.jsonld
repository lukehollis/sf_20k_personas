The only child of Korean immigrants, she was raised in a home where diligence and education were paramount. Her father, an engineer, and her mother, a pharmacy technician, instilled in her a quiet determination. Sarah\u2019s childhood was a predictable rhythm of school, piano lessons, and helping at her mother\u2019s pharmacy, where she first witnessed the complex intersection of health, access, and community.\n\nInitially on a pre-med track at UC Davis, her trajectory shifted during her junior year. Her father\u2019s sudden type 2 diabetes diagnosis was a jarring turning point. It wasn't just the medical reality that struck her, but the systemic factors\u2014cultural diet, stress, lack of preventative education\u2014that contributed to it. She realized she was more interested in preventing the illness on a macro level than treating it on a micro one. This epiphany led her to pursue a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, focusing on epidemiology.\n\nUpon graduating, Sarah accepted a Research Associate position with a UCSF-affiliated healthcare consortium. She settled into a small but bright one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset, a neighborhood she chose for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its quiet, residential feel.\n\nNow 35, Sarah\u2019s life is defined by a focused routine. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins with coffee from a local cafe before settling in at her standing desk, surrounded by monitors displaying population health data. She analyzes trends in chronic illness across San Francisco's diverse communities, her work fueled by the memory of her father. Midday, she breaks for a long run through the park, a ritual that clears her mind and grounds her in the city's natural beauty.\n\nSocially, her circle is a tight-knit group of fellow researchers and grad school friends. Recently navigating single life after a long-term relationship ended, she finds solace in their weekend hikes in the Marin Headlands and dinners in the Mission. Her dream is to eventually become a lead investigator, publishing her own research that directly influences municipal health policy. For Sarah, San Francisco is both her home and her most complex data set, a city whose health she is dedicating her life to understanding, one spreadsheet at a time."
