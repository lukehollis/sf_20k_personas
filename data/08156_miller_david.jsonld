The only child of a high school history teacher and a dental hygienist, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and saturated with the expectation of a practical career. His choice to major in Philosophy at UC Davis was a small, intellectual rebellion\u2014a search for underlying systems and meaning that his parents found baffling but benign.\n\nUpon graduating, David moved to San Francisco, drawn by a romantic ideal of the city he\u2019d gleaned from books and weekend visits. The reality was a series of unfulfilling temp jobs and a tiny room in a shared apartment. The turning point came when a temp agency placed him as an administrative assistant in the San Francisco Planning Department. Surrounded by blueprints, zoning regulations, and environmental impact reports, David discovered an unexpected affinity for the work. The abstract systems he studied in college were made tangible here, shaping the physical world. He methodically worked his way up to City Planning Assistant, finding a comfortable niche where his attention to detail was a virtue.\n\nNow 42, David\u2019s life is defined by his Inner Richmond apartment, which is also his office. The 0.0-mile commute has made him a permanent fixture in his neighborhood, a man whose world is a ten-block radius on most days. His routine is disciplined: coffee from a local cafe, followed by hours spent analyzing land-use proposals and digitizing archived maps. His connection to San Francisco is both profound and detached; he understands the city\u2019s structural DNA better than most, yet rarely experiences its frenetic energy firsthand.\n\nA long-term relationship ended five years ago, a quiet dissolution that deepened his solitude. His social life consists of a weekly trivia night with a few friends and solitary walks through Golden Gate Park, where he observes the interplay of planned landscapes and human activity. David dreams of one day managing a small, tangible project\u2014a new parklet or a protected bike lane\u2014to see his meticulous work manifest in a way that directly improves a corner of the city he so carefully studies from his desk. He hopes to one day find a partner who appreciates the city not for its noise, but for its intricate, beautiful design."
