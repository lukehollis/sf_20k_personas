Born in Portland, Oregon, to a Korean immigrant mother who ran a small dry-cleaning shop and a quiet, Caucasian-American librarian father, David grew up navigating the space between two cultures. He was the family\u2019s natural mediator, translating not just language but cultural nuance. The defining moment of his youth came when his father fell seriously ill. David, then a teenager, witnessed his mother\u2019s frustration and fear as she struggled to understand doctors and navigate a labyrinthine healthcare system. It was then he knew he wanted to be an advocate for people lost in the cracks.\n\nThis conviction led him to pursue a Master of Social Work. After graduating, he was drawn to San Francisco's vibrant diversity and progressive ideals, a stark contrast to his homogenous hometown. He settled in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy serenity and access to Golden Gate Park suited his disposition. For two decades, David has worked as a Licensed Social Worker within a major SF hospital system, specializing in discharge planning and patient advocacy. The work is emotionally taxing, a daily confrontation with trauma, grief, and systemic inequality.\n\nSince the pandemic, David\u2019s role has shifted to be entirely remote, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to a small office nook overlooking a neighbor\u2019s carefully tended garden. His days are a marathon of video calls, connecting vulnerable patients with housing, mental health services, and follow-up care. Now 47 and single after a long-term relationship ended a few years prior, his social life is small but meaningful. He treasures his weekly hikes in the Marin Headlands and the quiet companionship of the vinyl records that fill his evenings. He dreams not of wealth, but of peace\u2014both for his clients and for himself. Someday, he hopes to transition to a less crisis-driven role, perhaps even open a small bookstore. For now, he finds purpose in the city's contradictions, offering a steady, calming presence to those navigating their most difficult moments."
