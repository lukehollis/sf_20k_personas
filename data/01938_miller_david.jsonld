Born in Portland, Oregon, to a Korean immigrant mother who ran a small dry-cleaning shop and a quiet, Caucasian-American librarian father, David grew up navigating the space between two cultures. He was the family\u2019s natural mediator, translating not just language but cultural nuance. The defining moment of his youth came when his father fell seriously ill. David, then a teenager, witnessed his mother\u2019s frustration and fear as she struggled to understand doctors and navigate a labyrinthine healthcare system. It was then he knew he wanted to be an advocate for people lost in the cracks.\n\nThis conviction led him to pursue a Master of Social Work. After graduating, he was drawn to San Francisco's vibrant diversity and progressive ideals, a stark contrast to his homogenous hometown. He settled in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy serenity and access to Golden Gate Park suited his disposition. For two decades, David has worked as a Licensed Social Worker within a major SF hospital system, specializing in discharge planning and patient advocacy. The work is emotionally taxing, a daily confrontation with trauma, grief, and systemic inequality.\n\nSince the pandemic, David\u2019s role has shifted to be entirely remote, his commute a 0.0-mile walk from his bedroom to a small office nook overlooking a neighbor\u2019s carefully tended garden. His days are a marathon of video calls, connecting vulnerable patients with housing, mental health services, and follow-up care. Now 47 and single after a long-term relationship ended a few years prior, his social life is small but meaningful. He treasures his weekly hikes in the Marin Headlands and the quiet companionship of the vinyl records that fill his evenings. He dreams not of wealth, but of peace\u2014both for his clients and for himself. Someday, he hopes to transition to a less crisis-driven role, perhaps even open a small bookstore. For now, he finds purpose in the city's contradictions, offering a steady, calming presence to those navigating their most difficult moments."

David saw his mother\u2019s cheeks flush, her English faltering under pressure. He stepped forward and, in a voice that surprised even him, calmly explained the chemical risks of a second treatment. The woman, taken aback, finally nodded. He felt a heavy, premature sense of responsibility settle in his chest, the quiet weight of being a bridge between his mother\u2019s world and this one.\n\n2.\nHis first month in San Francisco, still a graduate student, he felt utterly adrift. One Sunday, he walked into Golden Gate Park as a thick, disorienting fog rolled in. The sound of the city vanished, leaving only the drip of moisture from eucalyptus trees and the mournful bellow of a distant foghorn. Instead of feeling lost, he felt held. Anonymous and serene, he finally understood he was home. This quiet, ghostly beauty was the part of San Francisco that would belong to him, a peace he would chase for decades.\n\n3.\nIt was a decade ago, before the pandemic. He sat for hours by the bedside of an elderly Cantonese man, terrified and alone after a stroke. The hospital\u2019s translator phone was clumsy, so David just sat, nodding and occasionally patting the man\u2019s hand. After a week of frantic calls, he finally secured a spot in a nursing home with Cantonese-speaking staff. The relief on the man\u2019s face was a silent, profound thank you\u2014a small, singular victory against a broken system that both fueled and exhausted him for the drive home.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, on the first Saturday after Michael left, David drove to the Marin Headlands. It had been their spot. He hiked the familiar trail alone, the wind whipping tears from his eyes before they could fall. From the ridge, the Golden Gate Bridge looked like a fragile, beautiful toy. The immense scale of the ocean and the city didn\u2019t make him feel small, but simply solitary. It was a clean, sharp pain, the first day of learning to find peace in his own quiet company again.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a wrenching video call trying to arrange shelter for a family being evicted, he clicked \"End Meeting.\" The exhausted, pixelated faces vanished. He felt hollowed out. He looked from his screen to the window, where his neighbor was tending to her rain-soaked camellias, a small, determined act of care. He walked to his turntable and put on a Bill Evans record. The quiet, contemplative notes filled the room, a gentle antidote to the digital despair, a reminder of the real, tangible world just outside his walls."
