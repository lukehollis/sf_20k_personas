The only child of an Irish-American longshoreman and a talented seamstress from Guangzhou, she grew up in a home filled with the scent of salty air from the docks and the quiet hum of her mother\u2019s sewing machine in their Outer Richmond flat. Her bicultural upbringing gave her a unique lens: she understood both the city's working-class grit and the subtle artistry of a perfectly cut cheongsam.\n\nThis dual perspective shaped her education at San Francisco State University, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Art History. While her peers were focused on Renaissance paintings, Mei-Ling was fascinated by the history of textiles and fashion as a form of cultural expression. She began her career on the sales floor of a Union Square luxury department store, where her innate understanding of fabric, fit, and style quickly set her apart. She was promoted to assistant buyer, then buyer, relentlessly climbing the corporate ladder.\n\nA key turning point came in her early thirties. A quiet divorce from a man who never quite understood her ambition coincided with her mother\u2019s passing. Inheriting a trunk of her mother\u2019s exquisite handmade garments, Mei-Ling felt a renewed sense of purpose. This wasn't just a career; it was a legacy. She poured her energy into her work, becoming a sought-after senior buyer known for her impeccable taste and trend-forecasting abilities.\n\nToday, at 46, Mei-Ling lives and works from a chic, minimalist loft in Hayes Valley, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to the life she has meticulously designed. Her days are a blur of virtual meetings with Parisian ateliers and meticulous data analysis. Her social life is curated, consisting of a tight-knit circle of gallery owners and chefs. While content, she dreams of leaving the corporate world to launch her own label\u2014a brand that honors her mother\u2019s craftsmanship by blending traditional Chinese silk embroidery with modern, sustainable design. For Mei-Ling, San Francisco is not just a home; it is the loom on which her past, present, and future are intertwined."
