The son of a literature professor and a dedicated homemaker, Rahman was raised on stories and poetry. He was a contemplative child who preferred the library to the football pitch, eventually earning a Bachelor's degree in English Literature, dreaming of a life spent among books.\n\nHowever, the magnetic pull of opportunity in America, sponsored by an older cousin in the Bay Area, rerouted his destiny. Arriving in his mid-twenties, Rahman quickly realized that a literature degree from a foreign university was not a practical key to a stable life. This was his first major turning point: the pivot from passion to pragmatism. He saw the burgeoning healthcare industry as a bastion of stability. Adaptable and meticulous by nature, he enrolled in a specialized certificate program and retrained as a scientific laboratory technician.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Rahman has worked in a clinical lab within a large hospital complex. He lives in a small, tidy apartment on the same medical campus, explaining his 0.0-mile commute. His life is a testament to routine. He wakes before the sun, walks to the lab, and spends his day in the ordered world of centrifuges and microscopes, finding a certain peace in the concrete, verifiable results of his work.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is personal and subdued. He avoids the city's boisterous energy, preferring the foggy tranquility of the Inner Sunset or long, solitary walks through Golden Gate Park. His social circle is small; a few colleagues with whom he shares lunch, and his family in Malaysia, with whom he speaks every Sunday via video call. Evenings are for reading history\u2014not literature\u2014and cooking the fragrant dishes of his youth.\n\nRahman\u2019s dream is not grand. He hopes to save enough to one day buy a small condo with a view of the ocean fog. While he is content with the life he has built, a small part of him, the young literature student, occasionally resurfaces. He secretly aspires to write a collection of short stories about the quiet, unseen lives of immigrants like himself, finally bridging the world he chose with the one he left behind."
