Raised in a household that prized academic achievement and surface-level harmony, David became a keen observer of the unspoken tensions that simmered beneath his family\u2019s polite exterior. He excelled in school but felt like an anthropologist in his own home, cataloging the emotional disconnects he couldn't yet name.\n\nHe pursued an English degree at Purdue, losing himself in literature's exploration of the human condition. It was a safe way to study emotion from a distance. The real turning point came at 25 when, feeling adrift, he visited a friend in San Francisco. The city\u2019s vibrant culture of self-expression and acceptance was a revelation. He felt an immediate, profound sense of belonging and made the life-altering decision to move, enrolling in San Francisco State University\u2019s Counseling Psychology graduate program.\n\nHis training was both academic and deeply personal. A tumultuous breakup during his internship forced him into therapy himself, where he had to dismantle the very emotional defenses his upbringing had built. This crucible of self-discovery forged him into a more empathetic and effective clinician. Now 40, David runs a private practice from a dedicated office in his Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking down the hall with a fresh cup of coffee. His days are a cadence of telehealth sessions, helping couples navigate the same murky waters he once learned to chart.\n\nHis life is one of intentional balance. He lives with his partner of eight years, Alex, a graphic designer whose creative energy complements David\u2019s introspective nature. Evenings are for cooking together, walks in Golden Gate Park, or quiet nights with a small circle of trusted friends. San Francisco is no longer just a city to him; it\u2019s the landscape of his own becoming. His future aspirations aren't grand; he dreams of leading communication workshops for new parents and one day buying a small home in the Sunset with Alex, with just enough room for a garden."
