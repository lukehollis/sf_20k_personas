Raised in a working-class family in Michigan, where his father assembled car parts, David understood supply chains before he knew the term. College was never a serious conversation; after high school, he took a job at a massive warehouse, learning the intricate dance of pallet jacks, inventory software, and shipping schedules from the ground up. He was sharp, organized, and reliable, slowly climbing from a floor worker to a shift supervisor over a decade.\n\nThe turning point came when a Bay Area tech hardware company, frustrated with traditional logistics hires, recruited him for his real-world expertise. The move to San Francisco with his then-wife was a culture shock. David traded snowy winters for foggy summers and factory floors for open-plan offices. While he excelled at untangling complex shipping networks, the city\u2019s pace and the pressures of his demanding job strained his marriage, which eventually ended amicably.\n\nNow 42, David lives a contained and orderly life in the Inner Sunset. The pandemic solidified his role as a fully remote Logistics Manager, shrinking his commute to the ten steps from his bedroom to his home office. His days are a blur of video calls, digital manifests, and coordinating shipments across continents. He is respected for his ability to solve problems others don't even see, a calm voice in the chaos of global trade.\n\nTo counteract the screen time, David has a rigid routine. Every evening at 6 p.m., he closes his laptop and heads out for a long run through Golden Gate Park, the methodical rhythm of his feet on the pavement a necessary release. His social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a weekly dinner with two friends and occasional visits to a quiet pub on Irving Street. He feels more like an observer of San Francisco than a participant, appreciating its beauty from a respectful distance. His dream isn't a promotion but a return to the tangible: he fantasizes about opening a small, meticulously organized bike shop, a place where he can apply his logic to something with gears and spokes that serves his own community."
