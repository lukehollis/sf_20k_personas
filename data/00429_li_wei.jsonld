Born in San Francisco to parents who emigrated from Guangzhou in the late 1960s, Wei grew up amidst the scent of medicinal herbs and the clatter of mahjong tiles in the Richmond District. His parents ran a small laundromat, instilling in him a quiet sense of duty and the weight of their aspirations for a more prosperous American life for their son.\n\nFollowing their wishes, Wei attended San Francisco State University, earning a practical but uninspiring Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. He spent nearly a decade in a downtown corporate finance office, a ghost in a grey suit, his days a blur of spreadsheets that felt disconnected from the vibrant community that raised him.\n\nThe turning point came when his father suffered a major stroke. Wei became his primary advocate, navigating a labyrinth of paperwork, indifferent specialists, and cultural misunderstandings within the healthcare system. He translated complex medical terms into Cantonese, fought with insurance companies, and saw firsthand how many other elderly immigrants in his community were lost and unsupported. The experience ignited a purpose that his corporate job never could.\n\nAt 35, Wei quit his job. He took certification courses and accepted a position as a Community Health Worker at a new non-profit clinic built into an affordable housing complex\u2014the very one he soon moved into. His business degree wasn't wasted; he used it to streamline patient scheduling and manage outreach programs.\n\nToday, at 47, Wei is a fixture in his community. His commute is zero miles, but his impact is immeasurable. He is the trusted face who explains medication dosages, the patient voice on the phone with a pharmacy, the organizer of the weekly Tai Chi class in the courtyard. He remains single, his energy poured into the well-being of the residents who view him as a surrogate son. His dream isn't of wealth or a house in the suburbs, but of securing a grant for a dedicated mental health counselor for the clinic. Wei Li found his life\u2019s work not by climbing a corporate ladder, but by coming home and walking downstairs."
