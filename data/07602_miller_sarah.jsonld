Raised in the quiet suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, by a pragmatic engineer father and a methodical librarian mother, Sarah\u2019s passion for the abstract was a quiet rebellion. While her parents saw the world in grids and Dewey Decimal points, Sarah found solace in the chaotic beauty of a Jackson Pollock drip or the stark emotion of a Rothko color field. This divergence fueled her escape to the East Coast, where she earned a Master of Arts in Curatorial Studies from New York University.\n\nHer early career in the cutthroat Chelsea gallery scene was formative but ultimately stifling. She felt the soul of art was being suffocated by its price tag. In 1998, seeking a more authentic community, she moved to San Francisco. It was a gamble. With a modest inheritance and a significant loan, she took over a raw, industrial-era warehouse in Hayes Valley, long before it became the chic neighborhood it is today. She lived in the dusty loft upstairs while personally transforming the ground floor into Axis Gallery.\n\nThis 0.0-mile commute defines her existence. Her days begin with the smell of fresh coffee mingling with the faint, lingering scent of oil paint from a new consignment. Mornings are for managing the business; afternoons are for collectors and nurturing her stable of emerging and mid-career artists. Her most significant romantic relationship, a decade-long partnership with a sculptor, ended amicably years ago; they both concluded they were more in love with their work than each other. Today, her artists are her family\u2014she is their champion, critic, and fiercest advocate.\n\nNow 52, Sarah is a fixture in the San Francisco arts scene. She\u2019s seen the city boom, bust, and boom again, fiercely protecting her gallery\u2019s role as a cultural anchor. Her aspirations are no longer about personal success but legacy. She dreams of discovering a Bay Area artist who will achieve international acclaim, cementing the gallery\u2019s\u2014and the city's\u2014importance. Her ultimate goal is to establish a foundation, ensuring Axis Gallery continues to support challenging, vital art long after she\u2019s gone, preserving the small corner of San Francisco she so carefully built."
