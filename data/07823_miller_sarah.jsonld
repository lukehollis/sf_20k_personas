The daughter of an accountant and a high school history teacher, her upbringing was stable, structured, and instilled with a Midwestern belief in hard work and clear paths. This foundation propelled her East for college and eventually to a Master\u2019s in Public Policy, driven by a youthful idealism to effect tangible, systemic change.\n\nHer early career in the non-profit sector in Washington D.C., however, proved to be a slow-burn disillusionment. The pace of change was glacial, the bureaucracy stifling. A turning point came during a coffee with a former classmate who had entered the world of consulting. She described a world of clear metrics, tangible project goals, and significant impact\u2014albeit on corporate balance sheets. Feeling burnt out, Sarah made a pragmatic pivot. She leveraged her analytical skills and policy background, landing a role in a financial consulting firm that valued her unique perspective.\n\nHer firm transferred her to San Francisco over a decade ago, where she quickly rose to Senior Project Manager. She traded Beltway bureaucracy for the frenetic energy of the financial and tech sectors. Today, she lives alone in a meticulously organized Russian Hill apartment with a view of Alcatraz. Her 0.0-mile commute means her day begins not with traffic, but with a brisk walk to a small caf\u00e9 on Polk Street, followed by a day of back-to-back Zoom calls, managing timelines and expectations for clients in New York and London.\n\nHer social life is curated and intentional\u2014a tight-knit circle of friends, a monthly book club, and bi-weekly dinners with a former colleague. While professionally successful, a part of her still wrestles with the idealistic young woman who wanted to change the world. Sarah dreams of transitioning her skills to impact investing or advising a major philanthropic foundation. She aspires to a future where her projects aren't just about maximizing profit, but about quantifiable good, finally bridging the gap between her pragmatic career and her enduring ideals."
