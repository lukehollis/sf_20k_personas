Raised in Oakland\u2019s Fruitvale district, he was the steady hand in a boisterous, close-knit family. His mother, a formidable church secretary, instilled in him a deep well of patience, while his father, a long-haul truck driver, was a loving but often distant presence. Early on, Darius dreamed of stability, of building something tangible. He enrolled at Laney College, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration with the goal of one day managing a small, local enterprise.\n\nThe trajectory of his life shifted abruptly when his mother suffered a debilitating stroke. Darius, then in his late twenties, became her primary caregiver. The logistics of managing medications, appointments, and physical assistance consumed him, but in the process, he discovered an unexpected aptitude for care. The patience his mother had taught him was now his greatest asset. After she passed, the path to business felt hollow. Instead, he pursued a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification, channeling his newfound purpose into a career.\n\nFor the past five years, Darius has been the live-in caregiver for Eleanor Vance, a sharp-witted but physically frail 89-year-old widow in a stately Pacific Heights home. This explains his zero-mile commute; his life is contained within the elegant, silent walls of the three-story Edwardian. His days are a structured routine of medications, meal preparation, assisting Eleanor with her correspondence, and reading aloud from historical biographies. He is more than an employee; he is her confidant, her memory-keeper, and her only consistent companion.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate yet isolating. He knows the precise angle of the morning fog over the Presidio from Eleanor\u2019s window but rarely socializes. His old friends are in Oakland, and his demanding schedule leaves little room for a personal life. In his quiet moments, Darius dreams not of wealth, but of autonomy. He yearns for a small, sunny apartment of his own in the Richmond or Sunset district, the freedom to go for a run without a pager in his pocket, and perhaps, the space to finally start a relationship. His greatest hope is to one day save enough to open his own small-scale, ethical home care agency, one that values the dignity of both the client and the caregiver."
