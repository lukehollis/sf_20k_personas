The only child of a second-generation Chinese-American engineer and a Caucasian mother from a family of Sacramento artists, he grew up in the meticulously planned suburbs of the East Bay. His father preached the gospel of stability and diligent work, while his mother filled their home with books on history and philosophy. Alex absorbed both, resulting in a personality that was both pragmatic and deeply thoughtful.\n\nHe surprised his father by choosing to major in History at UC Davis, where he became fascinated by the systems and stories that shape societies. Upon graduating, however, he found himself adrift, his passion ill-suited for the career paths his peers were taking. This became his first major turning point. Facing mounting pressure, Alex made a pragmatic pivot, enrolling in an intensive financial modeling certificate program. He discovered an unexpected aptitude for finding the narrative within the numbers, a skill that landed him an entry-level job at a San Francisco FinTech firm.\n\nNow 30, Alex is a Senior Financial Analyst at a PropTech company, a career that perfectly merges San Francisco\u2019s twin pillars of real estate and technology. His 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in the corner of his Hayes Valley apartment. His days are a disciplined routine: an early morning espresso from a local cafe, hours of deep focus analyzing market data, and a midday run to clear his head. He\u2019s finally achieved the financial stability his father championed.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is rooted in his neighborhood. After work, he sheds the analyst persona, exploring new restaurants with his girlfriend, Maya, a teacher who grounds him, or meeting friends for trivia. While he\u2019s successful, the historian in him remains. Alex\u2019s dream isn\u2019t a C-suite title, but to one day leverage his capital and expertise to launch a fund that invests in preserving and retrofitting historical buildings\u2014a way to finally fuse his love for tangible history with his mastery of future-facing finance, truly making his mark on the city he calls home."
