He was raised in Oakland, a world away from the Hayes Valley restaurant he now lives above. His culinary education began not in a formal school, but in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, a Louisiana transplant whose gumbo was legendary in their neighborhood. While she stirred roux, she told him stories of the South, planting a seed of culinary heritage that would define his future.\n\nHis parents, however, pushed for practicality. Fearing the instability of a creative life, they encouraged a business path. Omar dutifully enrolled at Laney College, earning an Associate's in Business Administration. To pay for school, he took a job as a dishwasher in a bustling San Francisco restaurant. It was there, amidst the clatter of pans and the intense pressure of the service line, that he found his true calling. He absorbed everything, working his way from the dish pit to prep cook, his natural talent outshining his formal education.\n\nA key turning point came when a respected but notoriously tough chef took Omar under his wing, mentoring him for five grueling years. He learned discipline, technique, and the brutal economics of the industry. Armed with this knowledge and his grandmother\u2019s recipes, Omar pooled his life\u2019s savings and took a massive risk, opening \"The Parish,\" a modern Creole restaurant.\n\nLiving above the restaurant means his life is a cycle of inventory, prep, service, and cleanup. The 0.0-mile commute is both a blessing and a curse; it has cost him relationships, most notably with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, who couldn't compete with the demands of his dream. His staff is his de facto family, and his social life consists of sharing a shift drink with his sous-chef after a long night.\n\nNow 36, Omar dreams beyond the day-to-day grind. He aspires to earn a Bib Gourmand recognition, a mark of quality he feels would validate his sacrifices. His ultimate goal, however, is to open a smaller, more casual spot back in Oakland, bringing his success full circle. Omar\u2019s San Francisco is not one of scenic vistas or tourist traps; it is a city experienced through early morning farmers' market runs and the diverse palates of the customers who fill his dining room each night."
