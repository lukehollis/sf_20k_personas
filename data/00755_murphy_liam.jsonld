Adopted as an infant by a warm, boisterous Irish-American couple, Liam grew up with a name that never quite matched the face in the mirror. His childhood was a loving fusion of cultures: evenings spent listening to The Chieftains while his mother, a nurse, prepared pot roast, and Sundays attending St. Anne\u2019s, all while navigating the quiet curiosity his Korean features drew from strangers. He felt more Murphy than anything else, yet a piece of his identity remained an unanswered question.\n\nAcademically adrift after high school, Liam enrolled at City College of San Francisco with no clear direction. It was a part-time job washing dishes in a bustling North Beach restaurant that ignited his passion. The kitchen\u2019s chaotic ballet, the alchemy of simple ingredients, and the visceral satisfaction of feeding people gave him a purpose he\u2019d been missing. He immediately switched his focus, earning an Associate's degree in Culinary Arts. His twenties were a blur of long hours, low pay, and invaluable experience, working his way up from line cook in fine dining establishments to sous chef at a trendy Mission bistro.\n\nThe true turning point came at 28. Using a small inheritance from his grandmother, Liam took a six-week pilgrimage to South Korea. There, surrounded by the flavors of his heritage, a new vision formed. He wanted to create food that explored identity\u2014his own, specifically.\n\nToday, at 33, Liam is the Head Chef and owner of \"Palette,\" a small, experimental dining space in a converted SoMa warehouse. His official title is self-coined: \"Head Chef in Arts,\" reflecting his philosophy of food as an artistic medium. His commute is zero miles; he lives in the loft above the restaurant. His days start before dawn at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and end late, after he has personally described the final course\u2014a deconstructed Irish stew with gochujang-braised lamb, for example\u2014to his handful of nightly guests.\n\nHis dream is not a Michelin star, but recognition for creating a new culinary dialogue. He hopes to expand Palette into a collaborative that hosts other artists, creating multi-sensory experiences. Liam remains deeply connected to his adoptive parents, who are his biggest fans, even if they find his food more beautiful than comforting. He is a man who found his identity not by choosing one culture over the other, but by learning to plate them together."
