Born and raised in Daly City to a stoic, working-class family\u2014a bus driver father and a grocery store clerk mother\u2014college was a concept discussed for other people's children. For Susan, the goal was simple: get a job, be self-sufficient. At nineteen, she fled the fog-drenched suburbs for the vibrant chaos of San Francisco, landing a hostessing gig at a cozy Italian restaurant in the Inner Richmond called \"Il Posto.\"\n\nShe never left. Susan possessed an innate talent for hospitality, an ability to remember not just a regular\u2019s name, but their favorite table and the story about their daughter\u2019s recital. The original owner, an old-world gentleman named Mr. Rossi, saw her potential. He mentored her, teaching her inventory, scheduling, and the delicate art of managing truculent chefs and homesick servers. Her education wasn\u2019t in a classroom; it was forged during hectic Saturday night services and quiet Tuesday morning ordering calls. By her late twenties, she was the manager.\n\nA key turning point came a decade ago when a long-term relationship with a musician unraveled, the breakup leaving her with the second-floor apartment above the restaurant and a profound sense of solitude. Instead of crumbling, Susan doubled down on her work, transforming Il Posto into her life's anchor. The staff became her family, the regulars her community. She is the calm center of the storm, the one who soothes an irate customer, covers a server's shift for a family emergency, and knows precisely when the kitchen is about to run out of Chianti.\n\nHer daily routine is woven into the fabric of the neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is a single flight of stairs. Now 49, Susan dreams not of escape, but of permanence. Her greatest hope is to one day have the capital to buy Il Posto from Mr. Rossi\u2019s children, ensuring its legacy. Her deepest fear is that they will sell to developers, erasing the world she has so carefully built. To her, San Francisco isn't the Golden Gate Bridge or a cable car; it\u2019s the sound of the delivery truck on Clement Street and the warm glow of her restaurant on a foggy evening."
