Born to a perpetually searching couple with a jumble of European and East Asian ancestries, Mei never identified with a single ethnicity, feeling more like a native of California's transient, eclectic culture. Lacking formal structure, her upbringing instead gave her a profound, if challenging, education in navigating unpredictable human behavior.\n\nShe moved to San Francisco at 19, drawn by its promise of acceptance for those who don\u2019t fit neatly into boxes. She drifted through service jobs until a turning point at 24: her roommate suffered a severe mental health crisis. While others backed away, Mei found a quiet purpose in the chaos, helping her friend navigate the bewildering system of care. The experience ignited a calling.\n\nForgoing a traditional university degree, she pursued a direct, practical path, earning a certification to become a Behavioral Health Technician. Her 0.0-mile commute is no tech-industry luxury; Mei lives on-site at the supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin where she works. Her life and work are deeply intertwined. Her days are a structured rhythm of medication oversight, de-escalating crises, and leading group sessions focused on coping skills. She is a pillar of stability for residents for whom stability is a foreign concept.\n\nHer social life is small and intense, consisting mostly of a few colleagues who understand the burnout and emotional weight of their shared profession. Romantic relationships have been fleeting, often unable to withstand the demands of her all-encompassing job.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is not with its gleaming towers but with its gritty, compassionate heart. She witnesses the city's deepest struggles and its moments of profound resilience every day. Her dream isn\u2019t wealth or status, but a quiet, simple future: to one day afford her own small apartment in the Outer Richmond, a personal sanctuary where she can finally separate her work from her life, and fall asleep to the distant sound of the ocean foghorns."
