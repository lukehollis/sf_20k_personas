Adopted from South Korea as an infant by a loving, white couple from Marin County, his upbringing was one of comfortable privilege and heartfelt support. Yet, a quiet sense of dislocation followed him. While his parents gave him everything, he was acutely aware of the invisible barriers and unspoken questions that came with being a Korean kid with the surname Thompson in a predominantly white community.\n\nThis feeling of being an outsider looking in fueled a deep empathy that defined his educational path. He initially enrolled in a business program at UC Berkeley, trying to follow a practical path, but felt a profound lack of purpose. A volunteer position at a community health clinic in Oakland during his junior year was the turning point. Witnessing the immense need and the systemic obstacles faced by vulnerable populations, he immediately switched his focus, eventually earning a Master of Social Work from the same institution.\n\nDaniel\u2019s career became his calling. He deliberately chose the most challenging assignments, drawn to the epicenters of crisis where he felt he could make the most impact. This led him to his current role in San Francisco, which explains his 0.0-mile commute. Daniel is a residential social worker at a supportive housing facility in the Tenderloin, living in the same building as the formerly homeless clients he serves, many of whom struggle with chronic illness and addiction.\n\nHis daily routine is an immersive blend of personal and professional life. Mornings begin before sunrise with a run along the Embarcadero, a brief escape to clear his head before plunging into a day of case management, crisis de-escalation, and navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of city services for his clients. He maintains a small, tight-knit circle of friends\u2014mostly other social workers and nurses who understand the emotional toll of the work.\n\nDaniel's connection to San Francisco is intensely localized to the few blocks he calls home and work. He sees both the city\u2019s profound compassion and its glaring failures every day. His dream is not of wealth or recognition, but the quiet satisfaction of seeing a long-term client achieve a year of stability. And deep down, he harbors a personal aspiration: to one day take a trip to Seoul, not to find his birth family, but simply to stand in the city of his origin and feel, for the first time, like he fully belongs."
