            "value": "Mei Miller is a product of San Francisco\u2019s cultural confluence, born to a free-spirited, bookstore-owning father from Berkeley and a pragmatic immigrant mother from Hong Kong. Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, her childhood was a quiet negotiation between two worlds: her father\u2019s shelves of beat poetry and her mother\u2019s meticulous bookkeeping. This duality shaped her, instilling a deep appreciation for art alongside an unshakeable need for order.\n\nShe pursued an Art History degree at SF State, captivated by theory but realizing she lacked the temperament of a solitary artist or academic. A post-graduation volunteer gig at a small, scrappy theater in the Mission District became her turning point. Surrounded by the beautiful chaos of stage production\u2014erratic directors, last-minute set changes, and tight budgets\u2014Mei discovered her true calling. She didn't create the art; she built the vessel that allowed it to sail. Her talent for organization, calm problem-solving, and managing creative personalities saw her rise quickly from intern to Production Manager.\n\nNow 42, Mei\u2019s life is woven into the very fabric of that same theater, now a respected Mission institution. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a small apartment directly above the stage. Her days are a rhythm of budget meetings, scheduling rehearsals, and sourcing props from neighborhood shops. Evenings are spent with the rumble of dialogue and music vibrating through her floorboards. Her social circle is a revolving cast of actors, designers, and playwrights\u2014intense, transient friendships that bloom and fade with each production.\n\nThough fulfilled by her work, Mei dreams of securing a legacy endowment for the theater, ensuring its survival beyond the constant grant-writing hustle. This, she hopes, would finally afford her the space to breathe\u2014to perhaps travel without checking emails, mentor a successor, and disentangle her identity from her job title. From her fire escape, watching the vibrant life of the Mission pulse below, Mei feels an immense sense of belonging. She is not just a resident of San Francisco; she is one of the countless, tireless custodians of its creative soul."
