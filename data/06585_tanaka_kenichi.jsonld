The son of a stoic auto mechanic and a meticulous homemaker from Daly City, Kenichi was raised on the gospel of steady hands and a reliable paycheck. He watched his father\u2019s pride in fixing what was broken and internalized the value of tangible, necessary work. While his high school friends dreamed of IPOs and startup glory, Kenichi was drawn to the practical, choosing a path that felt solid beneath his feet.\n\nHe enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Building Engineering Technology. It was a logical, not a passionate, choice. The turning point came during his apprenticeship when he saw the financial precarity of his own family contrasted against the city\u2019s booming wealth. He vowed to build a life of unshakable stability. The opportunity for a live-in Facilities Technician position at a new luxury apartment tower felt like the ultimate security: a home and a job in one neat package. His 0.0-mile commute was a deliberate life design.\n\nNow, at 35, Kenichi\u2019s days are a structured rhythm of responding to work orders, maintaining HVAC systems, and ensuring the building\u2019s complex infrastructure runs flawlessly. He is a familiar, friendly face to the tech executives and venture capitalists who live there, yet he remains professionally distant, an observer of a world he services but does not inhabit. His social life is small and intentional, centered around a weekly Go club in Japantown where he can lose himself in ancient strategy, far from the demands of modern luxury.\n\nKenichi\u2019s true connection to San Francisco unfolds on his days off. With a vintage film camera in hand, he walks for miles, from the gritty alleys of the Tenderloin to the foggy avenues of the Outer Richmond. He captures the city\u2019s unpolished soul\u2014the weathered faces, cracking facades, and fleeting moments of authenticity that stand in stark contrast to the sterile perfection of his workplace. His quiet dream is not to climb a corporate ladder, but to one day display his photographs, to show people the San Francisco that exists beyond the penthouse windows. He maintains the city of glass and steel, but he lives for the city of grit and heart."
