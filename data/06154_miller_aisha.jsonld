Raised in a bustling New Orleans household filled with the sounds of jazz and the aroma of her father\u2019s gumbo, her upbringing was rich in culture but grounded in practicality. Her father, a high school history teacher, and her mother, a city clerk, instilled in her a deep appreciation for stories and systems, never suspecting it would lead her to the art world.\n\nShe left the humidity of Louisiana for the cool fog of the Bay Area, enrolling at San Francisco State University. Eschewing the more direct path of Art History, Aisha pursued a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Anthropology. She was fascinated not just by objects, but by the human rituals, beliefs, and social structures that gave them meaning. This unique perspective became her superpower. During a pivotal internship at a small, community-focused gallery in the Mission, while her peers analyzed color theory, Aisha wrote a compelling proposal framing the exhibit\u2019s folk art as artifacts of modern urban ritual. The director was stunned, and the experience cemented her career path.\n\nNow 28, Aisha is a Curatorial Assistant at a respected contemporary art gallery. Her zero-mile commute is a function of her life\u2019s design: she lives in a small, rent-controlled studio apartment just a block from the gallery\u2019s polished concrete floors. Her days are a meticulous-yet-passionate routine of research, cataloging artist submissions, and handling delicate correspondence. Her social life is woven into her work; evenings are often spent at gallery openings, artist talks, or in deep conversation with her small circle of fellow creatives at a nearby wine bar.\n\nSan Francisco, for Aisha, is not a city of tech bros and startups, but a dense ecosystem of creators and thinkers. She feels its pulse in the murals of Clarion Alley and the experimental installations she helps bring to life. Her ultimate dream is to graduate from assistant to full curator, mounting an exhibition that blends her anthropological training with her passion for contemporary Black artists, exploring themes of diaspora and identity. For now, she finds fulfillment in the quiet, essential work of helping other people\u2019s stories be seen and understood."
