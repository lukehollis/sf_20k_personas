Raised by immigrant parents who ran a small, beloved neighborhood bakery, she learned the city not through maps, but through the cadence of daily life: the early morning rush for fresh pineapple buns, the gossip shared over countertops, and the constant struggle to keep a small business afloat amidst changing regulations and rising costs. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue a stable, lucrative career, Mei was more fascinated by the invisible forces that shaped their community\u2014zoning laws, transit lines, and public spaces.\n\nThis fascination led her to pursue a Master's degree in Urban Planning, a path that felt like both a rebellion and a tribute to her roots. She wanted to understand the system that had so often frustrated her parents and work from within to make it more humane. After graduating, she joined the San Francisco Planning Department, quickly proving her value with a keen eye for detail and a deep, empathetic understanding of neighborhood dynamics.\n\nNow 36, Mei is a Senior Urban Planner, a role she embodies completely. A key turning point was her decision five years ago to move into a compact apartment in the Mission District, intentionally creating a life with a zero-mile commute. Her workspace is her apartment, her research lab is the street below, and her commute is a walk to a local cafe for coffee before heading out for a site visit. Her days are a blend of virtual meetings, poring over blueprints, and walking the blocks of a new project, observing how people interact with the urban environment.\n\nSocially, Mei is deeply embedded in her community. Her friends are a mix of fellow city employees, artists she\u2019s met at gallery openings in the Mission, and the owner of the corner bookstore. She isn't actively dating, finding fulfillment in her rich professional and platonic relationships. Her dream is to lead a landmark project that creates truly equitable public space\u2014a park or plaza that serves multigenerational families and reflects the soul of its neighborhood. For Mei Lin Wu, San Francisco is not just a home; it is her life's work, a complex, frustrating, and beautiful puzzle she is dedicated to solving, one block at a time."
