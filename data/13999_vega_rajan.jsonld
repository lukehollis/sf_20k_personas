The son of a Filipino-American auto mechanic from Daly City and an Indian-American administrative assistant who settled in the Sunset District, Rajan\u2019s upbringing was a blend of cultures, pragmatism, and a deep appreciation for the city's working-class backbone. From his father, he learned the logic of systems and how things fit together; from his mother, he inherited a meticulous nature and a belief in civic duty.\n\nHis path was irrevocably shaped by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. As a student at UC Berkeley studying Public Policy, witnessing the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct and the city\u2019s paralysis ignited in him a quiet determination to dedicate his life to the infrastructure that holds society together. He turned down more lucrative private-sector offers upon graduation and took an entry-level position at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). He has been there ever since, slowly working his way up through dedication and an unparalleled understanding of the city's transit veins.\n\nNow a Senior Policy Analyst, Rajan\u2019s life is one of quiet routine and purpose. He lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in Cole Valley, a home he\u2019s kept since his amicable divorce over a decade ago. His most important relationship is with his daughter, Sofia, who is now studying urban planning on the East Coast\u2014a choice he quietly treasures.\n\nHis day begins before dawn with a strong coffee and a detailed read of transportation journals. His 5.5-mile commute on the N Judah light rail isn\u2019t a chore but a daily field study. He observes passenger flow, dwell times, and the subtle shifts in the city\u2019s rhythm. At his office at 1 South Van Ness, he analyzes data and drafts policy recommendations that aim to make the system more equitable and efficient.\n\nRajan\u2019s hope is not for wealth or recognition, but for legacy. He dreams of seeing the Central Subway extension fully integrated and thriving before he retires. He aspires to leave behind a transportation system that is slightly fairer and more reliable than the one he found, a fitting tribute to the city that raised him."

It wasn\u2019t just concrete and rebar; it was a lifeline, severed. The abstract theories from his public policy textbooks suddenly collapsed into a single, terrifying truth: civilization is fragile, held together by systems. In that moment of shared, city-wide shock, his vague desire to serve the public good sharpened into a quiet, unshakable mission. He would work on the things that hold. This occurred in October 1989.\n\n2.\nThe smell of engine grease and the patient click of his father's socket wrench are imprinted in his soul. Rajan, maybe ten years old, sat on a stool in the Daly City garage, watching his father map out a transmission problem. \u201cEverything has a place, a reason,\u201d his father said, wiping his hands on a rag. \u201cYou just have to be patient enough to see the whole system.\u201d It was the first time Rajan understood that mastery wasn't about genius, but about dedicated, methodical observation. This memory from his childhood grounds his entire approach to policy.\n\n3.\nHe can still feel his daughter Sofia\u2019s small hand squeezing his as the N Judah plunged into the Sunset Tunnel for the first time. Her gasp of delight as they burst back into the light at Duboce Park echoed his own quiet joy. In her five-year-old excitement, the light rail wasn't just a mode of transport; it was a magical journey. This moment transformed his work from a series of data points and reports into a tangible service for families, a way to connect his own daughter to the city he loved. This happened nearly twenty years ago.\n\n4.\nThe divorce wasn\u2019t a storm, but a quiet tide going out. He remembers sitting with his wife in the living room of their Cole Valley apartment, the afternoon light fading. There were no raised voices, only the shared, sad acknowledgment that they had become architects of different lives. The apartment, once their shared dream, became his sanctuary in the aftermath. That quiet ending cemented his preference for a life of purpose and routine over passionate unpredictability. This amicable split happened over a decade ago.\n\n5.\nYears ago, long after his policy recommendation for adjusted dwell times was implemented, he stood on the outbound platform at Civic Center station one rainy evening. He watched the train arrive, the doors open, and passengers embark and disembark with an unhurried, efficient flow. No one noticed the extra seven seconds. But he did. It was a moment of profound, anonymous satisfaction\u2014the feeling of having mended a tiny tear in the city's fabric. This quiet success, which occurred late in his mid-career, is the feeling he still chases."
