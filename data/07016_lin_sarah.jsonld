The daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Richmond District, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty. Her life\u2019s trajectory was set at age fifteen when her grandmother suffered a debilitating stroke. Suddenly, Sarah was no longer just a teenager but the designated translator and navigator for her terrified parents, trying to make sense of a bewildering American healthcare system. She witnessed firsthand the fear and confusion that a medical crisis could inflict on a family unprepared for its complexities.\n\nThis formative trial steered her away from her parents\u2019 hopes of her becoming a doctor and toward a different calling. She earned her undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley and completed a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. Her career choice felt like a calling fulfilled: she would be the compassionate guide her family never had. Now, as a medical social worker, she is the calm, professional presence in the storm, helping families manage everything from insurance battles to end-of-life decisions.\n\nHer 0.0-mile commute is less a perk and more of a tether; she lives in a small, functional apartment in hospital-subsidized housing in the Inner Sunset. Her life is dictated by the hospital's rhythm. Mornings begin with a foggy walk to the cafeteria for coffee, followed by a day of relentless advocacy. A long-term relationship ended two years ago, a casualty of her demanding schedule and the emotional armor her job requires. Her social circle is tight-knit, comprised mostly of fellow healthcare workers who understand the pressure.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is twofold: the sprawling, familiar city of her youth, and the intense, contained world of the hospital campus. Her dream isn\u2019t of promotion, but of balance. She fantasizes about taking a pottery class in the Mission, learning to surf at Ocean Beach, or simply having a weekend where she isn\u2019t on call. She hopes to one day find a partner who sees the person behind the professional, but for now, she remains the steady anchor for others, finding her own peace in rare, quiet walks through Golden Gate Park."
