Adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish couple\u2014a public school teacher and a union carpenter\u2014he was raised in the foggy avenues of the Inner Richmond. His parents, an idealistic pair, instilled in him a profound sense of social justice and community responsibility. From them, he inherited the name Solomon and a deep-seated belief that one\u2019s purpose was to ease the burdens of others.\n\nInspired by his upbringing, David enrolled in the Social Work program at San Francisco State University. However, the theoretical nature of academia felt hollow compared to the pressing needs he witnessed volunteering at a youth center in the Tenderloin. He saw the system\u2019s cracks firsthand and felt an urgent pull to be on the ground, not in a lecture hall. After two years, he made the pivotal decision to leave college, trading his pursuit of a degree for the immediate, tangible impact of direct action.\n\nHis career became a patchwork of roles in the city's non-profit ecosystem. He worked in shelters, ran after-school programs, and advocated for unhoused residents, his lack of a diploma more than compensated for by his decades of street-level experience. A key turning point was the passing of his adoptive mother from cancer. Her unwavering compassion during her illness solidified David's commitment, transforming his job into a personal mission to honor her legacy.\n\nNow 54, David is a Community Outreach Coordinator, a role that perfectly synthesizes his life's work. He\u2019s the vital link between city services and residents who might otherwise fall through the cracks. His daily routine is grounded in his neighborhood. He takes the 38 Geary bus for his short commute, knows the names of the baristas at his local cafe, and spends his evenings attending community meetings or decompressing with long walks in Golden Gate Park. He lives alone in a rent-controlled apartment filled with books and local art, having had one long-term partnership that ended amicably years ago. His true family is the network of colleagues, neighbors, and clients he has built.\n\nDavid\u2019s dreams remain rooted in service. He hopes to secure funding to expand a mentorship program for at-risk youth and quietly nurtures a desire to one day visit Korea, not to search for his birth family, but to connect with a part of his identity on his own terms. For David, success isn\u2019t measured in wealth, but in the stability and support he helps foster in the city that raised him."

His father, the carpenter, pointed to the empty chair for Elijah. \u201cWe leave the door open for the stranger, David,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cBecause we were once strangers.\u201d It wasn't just a story; it felt like a blueprint. That night, the concept of social justice stopped being a lesson from his teacher mother and became a deeply personal inheritance. It was his family's sacred duty to always have a seat waiting for someone in need.\n\n2.\nHe was twenty, splitting his time between SF State and a Tenderloin youth center. One afternoon, a quiet teenager showed him the holes in his shoes, his feet soaked from the rain. David had just left a sociology lecture on systemic poverty, and the intellectual detachment felt like a betrayal. He spent his next paycheck on new boots for the boy. In that moment, he understood his path wasn't in a lecture hall. The real work was here, on the ground, keeping someone\u2019s feet dry.\n\n3.\nHis mother was frail in her final weeks, the cancer relentless. David sat by her bed, exhausted, expecting her to talk about her pain. Instead, she whispered, \u201cHow is that young woman, David? The one you helped find shelter?\u201d Her compassion, even then, was boundless and directed outward. It wasn't just grief he felt, but a profound sense of purpose. Her legacy wouldn't just be a memory; it would be his mission. He was carrying her light forward for everyone she could no longer reach.\n\n4.\nRiding the 38 Geary home about five years ago, he saw a woman he'd worked with tirelessly to get into family housing. She was laughing with her daughter, holding a grocery bag, looking not like a case file, but simply like a mom. Their eyes met, and she gave him a small, knowing nod. No words were needed. That simple, anonymous moment of peace\u2014of a life made stable\u2014was more affirming than any award or promotion. It was the entire reason he did the work.\n\n5.\nOn his 50th birthday, he sat alone in his apartment and took out the single photograph he had from Korea: a formal, black-and-white picture of him as an infant. For the first time, he didn\u2019t see a mystery to be solved or a family to be found. He saw the start of his own, singular story. He felt a quiet connection not to unknown people, but to a place. The desire to visit Korea solidified then, not as a search, but as a pilgrimage to a part of himself he finally felt ready to meet."
