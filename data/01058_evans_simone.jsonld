Raised in a small Oregon college town by a librarian mother and a literature professor father, her childhood was a quiet immersion in books and ordered information. Formal education was treated as just one option among many; Simone opted for experience. She bypassed college, finding her first job at 19 digitizing microfiche records for the local county archives. It was here she discovered her calling: bringing order to the digital chaos of the past.\n\nShe honed her skills through a series of freelance and contract jobs, teaching herself archival software, metadata standards, and digital preservation. Her career was a slow, steady build, based on meticulous work and quiet competence. At 28, she followed a partner to San Francisco, a move filled with the promise of a shared future. The relationship dissolved within a year, leaving Simone adrift. This became her defining turning point. Instead of retreating, she resolved to build a life on her own terms.\n\nHer breakthrough came when she landed a highly specific, word-of-mouth gig as the Digital Collections Manager for the private archive of a reclusive tech pioneer. Since the job is entirely remote, her commute is a zero-mile journey from her bed to her desk in her Inner Richmond apartment. Her days are structured and solitary, spent cataloging decades of emails, digital photos, and code fragments.\n\nNow 37, Simone\u2019s life is peaceful. Her social circle is small but meaningful: a weekly pottery class in the Mission, her regular table at a favorite Clement Street caf\u00e9, and two close friends from her early freelance days. She loves the Inner Richmond for its foggy mornings that wrap the neighborhood in a serene quiet, a stark contrast to the city\u2019s frantic energy. Her connection to San Francisco is not with its start-up hustle but with the moody beauty of Golden Gate Park and the specific rhythm of her chosen enclave. Her great hope is to one day move from curating other people\u2019s stories to creating her own\u2014perhaps a digital art project using orphaned data, a final act of giving a narrative to the forgotten."
