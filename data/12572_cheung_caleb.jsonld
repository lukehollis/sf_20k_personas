Raised in Daly City by his Caucasian father, a journeyman electrician, and his Chinese-American mother, a dental hygienist, Caleb grew up with grease-stained hands and a deep appreciation for things that were built to last. His surname came from his mother, but with his father\u2019s features and a temperament more suited to a workshop than a classroom, he always identified as white. While his mother hoped he\u2019d pursue a university degree, Caleb found his calling amidst the screech of saws and the bright flare of welding torches in his high school\u2019s underfunded shop class.\n\nHis teacher, seeing a rare, intuitive talent, pushed him toward a vocational program in metalworking. It was the turning point that defined his life. Instead of student loans and lecture halls, Caleb chose apprenticeships and the tangible satisfaction of shaping steel. After graduating, he landed a job at a custom fabrication shop in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood, a hub of modern industry tucked away from the tech campuses.\n\nNow 26, Caleb's life has a steady, rhythmic pulse. His day begins before sunrise in his small, rent-controlled apartment in the Mission District. The 3.5-mile MUNI ride to work is his time for loud music through headphones, mentally preparing for the physically demanding day ahead. At the shop, he is an artist of angles and alloys, fabricating everything from bespoke furniture for wealthy clients to intricate architectural elements for new buildings. His $72,000 income affords him a life of simple pleasures in an expensive city: mission burritos, beers with work friends at a local dive, and weekend motorcycle rides across the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nHis social circle is small but loyal, comprised mostly of fellow tradespeople who share his disdain for the city's tech-fueled ephemerality. They are the ones building the physical city while others build virtual worlds. Caleb\u2019s dream is not to get rich, but to master his craft. He meticulously saves a portion of every paycheck, his eyes set on a future where he can open his own small shop, perhaps called \u201cCheung & Co. Metalworks,\u201d a quiet nod to the heritage he carries in his name. He is a tangible part of San Francisco, his work literally holding the city together, one perfectly welded joint at a time."

When he lifted the mask, he saw not a clumsy seam, but a clean, strong bond joining two pieces of scrap steel forever. In that moment, the noise of the world fell away. It wasn't just metal; it was control, creation, and a purpose so solid and real he could hold it in his hand. It was the first thing that had ever truly made sense.\n\n2.\nAt 18, after turning down the university his mother wanted, his dad visited him at the vocational school. He wordlessly picked up Caleb\u2019s final project, a complex geometric cube. His father, a man of few compliments, ran a calloused thumb over a particularly difficult joint, his face unreadable. He just nodded slowly and said, \u201cGood work, son.\u201d That quiet, expert approval was more validating than any diploma. It cemented Caleb\u2019s belief that true value was found in skilled hands, not just in lecture halls.\n\n3.\nThe first time he saw his work installed in the city, he was 23. It was an intricate set of balcony railings on a new Potrero Hill condo. He stood across the street after his shift, anonymous in the crowd, just staring. Commuters rushed past, oblivious. But Caleb knew the precise angle of every cut, the feel of the steel under his grinders. He wasn\u2019t building code in a virtual world; his work was a permanent, physical part of the skyline. He felt a quiet, profound pride, like he finally had roots here.\n\n4.\nHe remembers a ride last year, after a brutal week wrestling a stubborn fabrication. Kicking his motorcycle to life, he sped toward the Golden Gate Bridge just as the fog began to break. The thrum of the engine vibrated through his bones, and the icy Pacific wind scoured the grit from his mind. Leaning into the curve with the iconic orange towers soaring above, he felt a pure, exhilarating freedom. This was his reward\u2014a moment of communion with the city\u2019s greatest piece of engineering, a feeling of absolute release.\n\n5.\nJust six months ago, his mother visited his apartment, her quiet disappointment about his career path still a tangible thing between them. He finally showed her his savings ledger, with \u201cCheung & Co. Metalworks\u201d written at the top. He watched her trace his surname with her finger, the name he\u2019d always felt disconnected from. A different kind of pride softened her face, one he\u2019d never seen before. For the first time, carrying her name didn\u2019t feel like an accident, but a destiny he was choosing to build himself."
