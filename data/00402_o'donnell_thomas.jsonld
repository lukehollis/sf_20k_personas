Adopted as an infant in the 1970s by Sean and Mary O\u2019Donnell, a loving Irish-American couple, he was raised under the fog-drenched skies of the Sunset District. Growing up, Thomas learned to navigate the space between his Korean face and his Irish name, a duality that made him a keen observer of people and the invisible lines that connect or divide them. He spent his youth exploring the city\u2019s grid on his bike, fascinated by how its arteries\u2014the streetcar lines, bus routes, and freeways\u2014functioned as the city\u2019s circulatory system.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley for an undergraduate degree in geography, followed by a Master's in Urban Planning. His early career was spent in the public sector, wrestling with the bureaucratic maze of city planning departments. While he believed in the mission, the slow pace of change frustrated him. The turning point came during the second tech boom when he saw private companies tackling urban problems with data-driven immediacy. He made the leap, trading his city hall badge for a role at a burgeoning mobility tech company.\n\nNow, at 50, Thomas is a senior transportation planner, working remotely from his minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute gives his days a quiet rhythm. He begins each morning with a walk to a local cafe, sketchbook in hand, not for art, but to map pedestrian flows and observe traffic patterns\u2014a habit he can\u2019t shake. Amicably divorced for five years, his social circle is small but deep, a mix of old friends from his Sunset days and colleagues who share his vision for a smarter city.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is that of a native son who has watched his hometown shapeshift under the pressures of technology\u2014a force he is now a part of. His aspiration is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder, but about leaving a legacy of efficiency and equity on the streets he grew up on. Lately, a deeper, more personal dream has taken root: to finally visit Seoul, to trace the first, unwritten lines of his own life\u2019s map and perhaps, for the first time, feel wholly connected to both sides of his identity."

A kid on a stoop, seeing an Asian face so far west of Clement Street, asked for his name. \"Thomas O'Donnell,\" he said. The other boy just blinked. In that silent, confused pause, Thomas felt the entire distance between his face and his name. It wasn't shame, but a quiet awareness of being a map with two starting points. The feeling fueled his rides, pushing him to chart every street that connected the city\u2019s disparate worlds.\n\n2.\nAt 28, fresh from his master\u2019s program, he presented a protected bike lane plan at a community meeting. For two hours, he watched his proposal, backed by months of data, get systematically dismantled over the potential loss of six parking spots. He saw not civic process, but a tangled knot of stubbornness. Driving home that night, the slow, grinding pace of bureaucracy felt like a physical weight. It was the first time he wondered if he was trying to fix the city from the wrong side of the desk.\n\n3.\nAt 35, he was crammed into a SoMa conference room for a tech demo. On screen, thousands of tiny dots\u2014buses, ride-shares, scooters\u2014moved across a map of San Francisco in real time. It was the city\u2019s circulatory system, alive and responsive. All his years wrestling with static plans and outdated surveys felt instantly archaic. In that flickering data-stream, he saw not just an app, but a new, faster language for understanding the city. He updated his resume that afternoon, ready to make the leap.\n\n4.\nThe day his marriage ended wasn't loud. It was the quiet Saturday he and Sarah, his ex-wife, divided their books. There was no fighting, just a soft negotiation of ownership\u2014his urban planning texts, her poetry collections. As he boxed up his half, he realized they were just plotting separate routes from a shared origin. The sadness was deep but clean, an amicable rezoning of their lives. It taught him that a well-planned departure could be its own form of kindness.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, sketching pedestrian flow at his usual Hayes Valley cafe, a young Korean couple sat nearby, speaking softly to their toddler. He understood none of the words but felt their gentle cadence in his bones. In that moment, the abstract idea of Seoul became a tangible, magnetic pull\u2014an unvisited neighborhood on his own life\u2019s map. He put down his pen, the traffic patterns suddenly seeming less important than the single, untraced line leading back to a city he\u2019d never known."
