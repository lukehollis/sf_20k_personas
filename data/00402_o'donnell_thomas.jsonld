Adopted as an infant in the 1970s by Sean and Mary O\u2019Donnell, a loving Irish-American couple, he was raised under the fog-drenched skies of the Sunset District. Growing up, Thomas learned to navigate the space between his Korean face and his Irish name, a duality that made him a keen observer of people and the invisible lines that connect or divide them. He spent his youth exploring the city\u2019s grid on his bike, fascinated by how its arteries\u2014the streetcar lines, bus routes, and freeways\u2014functioned as the city\u2019s circulatory system.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley for an undergraduate degree in geography, followed by a Master's in Urban Planning. His early career was spent in the public sector, wrestling with the bureaucratic maze of city planning departments. While he believed in the mission, the slow pace of change frustrated him. The turning point came during the second tech boom when he saw private companies tackling urban problems with data-driven immediacy. He made the leap, trading his city hall badge for a role at a burgeoning mobility tech company.\n\nNow, at 50, Thomas is a senior transportation planner, working remotely from his minimalist condo in Hayes Valley. His 0.0-mile commute gives his days a quiet rhythm. He begins each morning with a walk to a local cafe, sketchbook in hand, not for art, but to map pedestrian flows and observe traffic patterns\u2014a habit he can\u2019t shake. Amicably divorced for five years, his social circle is small but deep, a mix of old friends from his Sunset days and colleagues who share his vision for a smarter city.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is that of a native son who has watched his hometown shapeshift under the pressures of technology\u2014a force he is now a part of. His aspiration is no longer about climbing a corporate ladder, but about leaving a legacy of efficiency and equity on the streets he grew up on. Lately, a deeper, more personal dream has taken root: to finally visit Seoul, to trace the first, unwritten lines of his own life\u2019s map and perhaps, for the first time, feel wholly connected to both sides of his identity."
