She was born in a refugee camp in the Philippines, the daughter of Vietnamese \"boat people\" who eventually found sponsorship and settled in San Jose. Growing up, she absorbed their stories of loss and survival, which instilled in her a profound empathy and a sense of responsibility to build a stable life they never had.\n\nInitially, she pursued this stability through a practical business degree at UC Berkeley. It was there she met Dmitri Petrova, a brilliant, troubled Russian literature student. Theirs was a whirlwind romance, a fusion of cultures and intense passions. They married young, but Dmitri\u2019s undiagnosed bipolar disorder and struggles with addiction cast a dark shadow. His fatal overdose at 27 shattered Linh\u2019s world and became the defining turning point of her life.\n\nShattered, Linh abandoned her corporate path. The grief and helplessness she felt ignited a new purpose: to understand the darkness that had consumed her husband and to help others navigate their own. She returned to school, earning a Master of Social Work degree. For the past decade, she has worked as a clinical social worker, specializing in dual diagnosis patients within the healthcare system.\n\nNow 44, Linh lives a deliberately contained life in the Inner Sunset. Her 0.0-mile commute is to the spare room in her quiet apartment, which she has converted into a home office for her telehealth practice. Mornings begin with a meditative walk through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual that grounds her before she immerses herself in the trauma of others. Her days are filled with virtual sessions, holding space for the city's most vulnerable. Evenings are for herself: cooking simple Vietnamese meals, reading, and connecting with a small, fiercely loyal circle of friends who understand the emotional weight of her work. She carries Dmitri's name not as a constant reminder of grief, but as a commitment to the purpose she found in his loss. Her aspiration is not for greatness, but for peace\u2014both for her clients and, eventually, for herself."

It showed a gaunt woman on a crowded boat, a woman who was\u2014but wasn't\u2014her mother. Her mother saw her looking and simply said, \u201cWe survived.\u201d The weight of that quiet statement settled in her small chest, a silent promise to build a life worthy of their sacrifice. It was the first time she understood what stability truly meant, and why she had to achieve it.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, she sat across from Dmitri in a fluorescent-lit Berkeley cafe, long after the library had closed. He was quoting Dostoevsky, his eyes blazing with a troubled intensity that mirrored her own inherited seriousness. He saw past the business student to the girl who understood deep sorrow. In that moment, surrounded by the smell of burnt coffee and old books, she didn't feel responsible or practical. She just felt seen. It was the moment she chose passion over a plan.\n\n3.\nIn the suffocating quiet of their apartment after he was gone, she found his copy of *The Brothers Karamazov* on the floor. It was open to a page he\u2019d underlined, but the words were just a blur. The only thing she could feel was the cold air where his presence should have been. It wasn\u2019t grief yet, but a hollowed-out emptiness. This silence, she realized, was the opponent she would spend the rest of her life fighting\u2014for others, if not for herself.\n\n4.\nA year after Dmitri's death, she sat in a sterile admissions office for her Master of Social Work interview. The woman across the desk asked her \"Why?\" Linh didn't speak of grief, but of helplessness\u2014his, and then her own. As she explained her desire to understand the intersection of trauma and addiction, a profound calm settled over her. She realized she wasn't running from her past but walking directly into it, armed with a new purpose. It was the first time she felt anchored since he died.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, on her morning walk, the fog in Golden Gate Park was so thick she could barely see the trail ahead. She stopped, listening to the muffled drip of condensation from the cypress trees. This was her peace now. Not a soaring joy, but a quiet, grounded presence. She breathed in the damp, earthy air, feeling the weight of the coming day's sessions, but also feeling her own two feet on the ground. She wasn't free of Dmitri's ghost, but she had learned to walk with it."
