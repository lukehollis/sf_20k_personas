The daughter of a determined immigrant mother from Jalisco, Mexico, and a third-generation Californian father, Sarah grew up in Fresno navigating two cultures. She saw firsthand the silent struggles of her community, particularly her beloved uncle who battled severe depression, his pain compounded by language barriers and the cultural stigma surrounding mental health. This experience became the quiet, guiding force of her life.\n\nDriven by a need to be the resource her family never had, Sarah pursued her education with fierce intentionality. She attended UC Davis for her undergraduate studies before moving to the city for her Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. The transition was a culture shock, but she fell in love with the city's vibrant, chaotic energy and its embrace of diverse identities. Upon graduating and earning her licensure, she accepted a position as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with a major Bay Area healthcare provider.\n\nNow 27, Sarah lives and works in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute is a modern reality; her practice is conducted almost entirely through telehealth. Her days are a structured sequence of virtual sessions, holding space for patients grappling with anxiety, trauma, and loss. To counteract the emotional weight of her work and the isolation of her home office, she has a strict routine. Mornings begin with a run through the misty trails of Golden Gate Park, a ritual to clear her mind before diving into her clients' worlds. Evenings are for disconnection\u2014exploring the dim sum restaurants on Clement Street, FaceTiming her family, or meeting with her small, tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom she met in grad school.\n\nWhile she feels fulfilled, Sarah dreams of more direct impact. Her ultimate goal is to open a small, bilingual private practice in the Mission District, providing culturally competent and accessible therapy to the Latino community. She wants to build a space of healing and understanding, a true sanctuary in the city that has become her own. For Sarah, San Francisco is not just a place to live; it's the arena where she is determined to build the bridge she once so desperately needed to cross."
