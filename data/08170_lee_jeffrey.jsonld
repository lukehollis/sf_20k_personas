His 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a life inextricably woven into the fabric of his family\u2019s business.\n\nBorn in San Francisco to parents who had immigrated from Hong Kong in the late 1960s, Jeffrey\u2019s childhood was a symphony of clattering woks, the rhythmic chop of cleavers, and the murmur of Cantonese trading stories over dim sum. He grew up bussing tables and folding wontons, the restaurant an extension of his home. A sense of duty, mixed with a desire for a different life, led him to San Francisco State University to study business. However, the theoretical concepts felt pale compared to the tangible reality of managing inventory, staff, and the nightly dinner rush. After two years, when his father\u2019s health began to decline, Jeffrey left college without a degree and returned to the Jade Lantern, a decision he has never regretted.\n\nHe started at the bottom, earning the respect of the long-time staff before his parents officially handed him the keys two decades ago. The restaurant became his life\u2019s work and, in many ways, his entire social circle. A brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably, the long hours and unyielding demands of the business proving too much for his ex-wife. Now, his family consists of his aging parents, who live nearby, his loyal kitchen staff, and the generations of regular customers who still ask for \"Mr. Lee's son.\"\n\nJeffrey\u2019s dream is not one of expansion or wealth, but of preservation. He hopes to maintain the Jade Lantern as a quiet anchor in the turbulent sea of a changing San Francisco, a place where tradition is honored and quality is never compromised. His days are long, starting with market runs before sunrise and ending long after the last table is cleared. As he locks the front door each night and walks the few steps upstairs, he feels the weight and pride of being a keeper of his family's legacy, a permanent resident in the heart of the neighborhood that raised him."
