Born and raised in the Excelsior District, her childhood was framed by the hum of her parents\u2019 laundromat and the quiet diligence required to make ends meet. They were working-class people who valued stability over ambition, a lesson Mei absorbed deeply. While her high school classmates dreamed of college campuses, Mei\u2019s reality was more immediate. She took on part-time jobs, and after graduation, entered the workforce full-time to help support her aging parents, shelving any thoughts of higher education.\n\nHer career began not with a plan, but with an opportunity: a temporary clerk position in City Hall. In the maze of municipal government, Mei\u2019s meticulous nature and quiet competence shone. She didn't have a degree, but she had an unparalleled ability to understand and navigate complex systems. Over two decades, she climbed the ladder through sheer grit and institutional knowledge, moving from clerk to administrative aide, and finally to her current role as a Program Coordinator for the City Planning Department. She is the unseen force behind neighborhood outreach notices, permit applications, and zoning variance meetings\u2014the human cog that makes the immense machine of the city turn.\n\nA key turning point was the lengthy, contentious approval process for a new community health clinic in the Outer Mission. While planners and politicians debated, Mei coordinated the public commentary, ensuring every voice, however frustrated, was logged and heard. Seeing the clinic finally open, she realized her work, while unglamorous, had a tangible impact. It cemented her identity as a public servant.\n\nNow 49 and single, Mei lives a life of quiet routine in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute means her workday begins the moment she logs into her city-issued laptop. Her world is her immediate neighborhood: the bakery where she gets her morning coffee, the produce market on Clement Street, and the pathways of Golden Gate Park where she walks every evening. Her social life consists of a few close friends from her youth and colleagues who appreciate her dry humor.\n\nMei\u2019s dreams aren\u2019t grand. She hopes to see the city she grew up in retain some of its soul amidst staggering change. Her secret aspiration is to one day use her savings to help fund a small public art installation in a forgotten neighborhood alleyway\u2014a permanent, beautiful mark on the city that has been her entire world."
