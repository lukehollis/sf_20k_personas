Born in Fresno to a Mexican-American mother and a father of Midwestern farming stock, she grew up understanding the value of pragmatism. Her childhood was filled with the scent of her mother\u2019s cooking and the sound of her father\u2019s practical advice on saving money. This bicultural upbringing instilled in her a deep sense of family loyalty and an unshakeable work ethic.\n\nHer educational path was practical. Forgoing a four-year university, Sarah earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college, eager to start earning and build her independence. In her late twenties, a promising relationship drew her north to San Francisco, a city that felt like another world compared to the Central Valley. While the romance eventually faded, her love for the city did not. She was captivated by the fog rolling over the hills and the feeling of being in a place where any identity was possible.\n\nSarah found a foothold as a bank teller, and with meticulous effort, she worked her way up through the ranks over two decades, eventually becoming a trusted loan officer. The pandemic was a pivotal turning point, shifting her job permanently remote. This gave her the ultimate freedom: living in the city she adored without the downtown commute.\n\nNow, at 47, Sarah\u2019s life is anchored in her cozy Inner Richmond condo. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days begin not with traffic, but with a walk with her rescue terrier, Buster, in Golden Gate Park. Her work is a steady rhythm of calls and calculations, helping others achieve the dream of homeownership she worked so hard for herself. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014her chosen family\u2014with whom she shares weekly dinners and book club meetings. Her aspirations are as pragmatic as she is: to pay off her mortgage early and to help her younger cousins with their college tuition. Sarah Miller\u2019s story is a testament to a life carefully curated, proving that fulfillment can be found in the steadfast, quiet joy of a home truly earned."
