Born in Fremont to Indian immigrant parents who hoped she\u2019d pursue medicine, Olivia was always drawn more to people and aesthetics than to science. She was the one who planned family trips with detailed itineraries and remembered everyone's favorite snack.\n\nHer attempt at a traditional path led her to a community college near San Diego, studying general education with a vague notion of transferring. That plan was cut short when her father suffered a major health crisis, requiring her to return to the Bay Area to help support her family. At 21, with her own ambitions on hold, she took a job at a hotel front desk. It was meant to be temporary, but she discovered a natural talent for the controlled chaos of hospitality.\n\nHer grace under pressure and sharp organizational skills saw her rise quickly. Five years ago, she accepted her current role as Operations Coordinator, a demanding position that came with a rare perk: a small studio apartment on a staff-only floor. This 0.0-mile commute became the defining feature of her life. It\u2019s a golden cage; she is always on-call, her personal space an extension of her workplace. Her days are a blur of coordinating housekeeping, managing event logistics, and soothing frayed nerves\u2014both staff and clientele. Her social life consists of after-work drinks with colleagues, their conversations inevitably circling back to occupancy rates.\n\nNow 30, Olivia feels a quiet restlessness. She loves the city she sees from her office window\u2014the fog rolling over the bay, the distant clang of a cable car\u2014but she experiences it as a backdrop to her job, not a place she truly lives. Her dream is no longer about a specific career but about autonomy. She fantasizes about finishing her degree, maybe online, and renting her own apartment in a neighborhood like the Inner Richmond, where she could have a favorite bakery and a leaky faucet that is her own problem to solve. Her greatest aspiration is to one day clock out and truly go home."
