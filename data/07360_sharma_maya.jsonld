The daughter of Indian immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a data analyst mother\u2014her childhood was a study in high expectations. Success was a defined path paved with STEM degrees and lucrative tech careers. Maya, however, was always more interested in the \u2018why\u2019 behind people's actions than the \u2018how\u2019 of a circuit board. This innate empathy felt like a deviation from the family blueprint, a quiet, internal rebellion brewing throughout her adolescence.\n\nHer true turning point came during her undergraduate studies at UC Santa Cruz, where a sociology class ignited a passion she couldn't ignore. Defying her parents\u2019 gentle-but-firm hopes for a more \u201cstable\u201d career, she enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. Her clinical internship at a major city hospital was the crucible that forged her career. Witnessing families navigate the emotional wreckage of sudden illness and chronic disease, she found her calling not in abstract theory but in concrete, compassionate action.\n\nNow 28, Maya is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, providing telehealth counseling to patients and their families from a dedicated corner of her Inner Richmond apartment. Her 0.0-mile commute offers convenience but blurs the line between work and sanctuary. Days are spent in intense sessions of emotional triage, helping others manage grief, fear, and life-altering diagnoses. To decompress, she relies on a strict routine: long, misty runs through Golden Gate Park, exploring the dumpling shops on Clement Street, and bi-weekly trivia nights with a tight-knit circle of friends, most of whom also work in caring professions.\n\nHer relationship with her parents remains loving but tinged with a mutual, gentle misunderstanding. They\u2019re proud of her independence but still wish she had an easier, more profitable job. Maya harbors a dream of one day opening a small, specialized private practice focused on medical trauma and grief counseling. For now, she finds fulfillment in the life she has carefully built\u2014one measured not by stock options, but by the quiet, profound impact she has on people during their most vulnerable moments, all from her small apartment in the city that finally feels like hers."
