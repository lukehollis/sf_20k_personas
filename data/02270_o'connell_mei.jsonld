Born in the Outer Richmond to a Dublin-born longshoreman and a first-generation Cantonese-American seamstress, her childhood was a fusion of two worlds. She learned the cadence of Irish folktales from her father and the intricate language of silk and thread from her mother. Growing up feeling like a cultural artifact herself, forever translating one side of her family to the other, she developed a deep fascination with how objects tell stories.\n\nThis fascination guided her academic path, leading her from a bachelor's in Cultural Anthropology at UC Berkeley to a Master's in Museum Studies from San Francisco State University. Her thesis focused on the preservation and interpretation of immigrant textile arts. After a brief, unfulfilling stint at a large, impersonal institution, Mei found her calling as a Museum Educator at the small, specialized Pacific Textile Museum, nestled on the edge of Japantown.\n\nA key turning point was the loss of her father ten years ago. Sifting through his few possessions\u2014a worn wool sweater, a shipping ledger, a faded photo\u2014she felt the urgent need to preserve not just objects, but the narratives they hold. This solidified her mission to make museum collections accessible and emotionally resonant for everyone. While she is single, Mei cultivates a rich social life, a close-knit circle of fellow curators, local artists, and the elderly owner of the ramen shop below her apartment.\n\nMei\u2019s life is a study in deliberate simplicity. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her rent-controlled apartment, a cozy space filled with books and fabric swatches, down to the museum. Her days are spent developing educational programs for school groups, leading tours that connect Tang dynasty embroidery to modern fashion, and meticulously cataloging new acquisitions. Her dream is to launch a permanent oral history project at the museum, recording the stories of the artisans and families behind the collection's pieces. Mei found her identity not by choosing between her Irish or Chinese roots, but by weaving them together, creating a life as rich and textured as the tapestries she so lovingly protects."
