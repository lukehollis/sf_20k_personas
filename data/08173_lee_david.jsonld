Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, his childhood world was the cluttered aisles of his parents' small grocery store on Clement Street. They were first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong who preached two gospels: hard work and stability. David absorbed the first but, for a time, rebelled against the second. He attended San Francisco State University, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies, dreaming of redesigning MUNI routes and shaping a more equitable city.\n\nThe reality of post-graduate life, coupled with his parents' declining health, steered him down a different path. An entry-level administrative job at a downtown financial firm, taken out of necessity, revealed an unexpected talent. David had a gift for seeing systems, for creating order out of operational chaos. He quietly climbed the ladder not with charisma, but with sheer competence. For over two decades, he has been a Logistics Manager, ensuring the complex machinery behind the firm\u2019s transactions runs flawlessly. He doesn't trade stocks; he makes sure the traders can.\n\nNow 51, David's life is a study in controlled routine. The pandemic shifted his work entirely remote, shrinking his world to the confines of his meticulously tidy one-bedroom apartment, still in the Inner Richmond, just blocks from where he grew up. He is a lifelong bachelor, his life dedicated to his career and, until they passed, his parents. His social circle is small but enduring\u2014a couple of old friends with whom he has dim sum every other Sunday.\n\nHis days begin with a brisk walk through Golden Gate Park before he settles into his home office, the city he once dreamed of shaping now just a backdrop outside his window. As a native, he feels a deep, almost mournful connection to San Francisco, remembering businesses and buildings that exist only in his memory. His aspirations are modest now. He dreams of retiring in a decade, perhaps finally using his savings to travel through southern China, tracing the footsteps of the parents he knew only in their American context. He hopes for a future as quiet and reliable as the systems he has spent his life managing."
