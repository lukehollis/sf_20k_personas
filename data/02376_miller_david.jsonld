Born in the Mission District to a Mexican-American mother, Elena, and a white father, a carpenter named Robert Miller, David grew up straddling two cultures. His childhood was a vibrant mix of his mother's Spanish, the smell of carnitas from the corner taqueria, and his father\u2019s dusty workshop. He was a quiet, observant kid who preferred mapping out complex historical events over playing stickball, a trait that would define his future career.\n\nHe stayed local for college, attending San Francisco State University. Shunning the more \"practical\" degrees, he earned a Bachelor's in History, fascinated by how systems and societies evolved. He graduated in the early 90s, just as the first dot-com wave began to swell. Needing a job, he took a position in Quality Assurance at a fledgling software startup, not for the tech, but because he was good at identifying patterns and breakdowns in a process\u2014a skill honed by studying historical campaigns.\n\nThis was his turning point. David discovered a natural talent for translating the chaotic ambitions of engineers into structured, achievable plans. He moved from QA to project coordination and, through the boom and subsequent bust of the late 90s, steadily climbed the ranks. He survived layoffs that shuttered his first two companies, learning resilience and adaptability.\n\nNow a Senior Project Manager, David works from his quiet Cole Valley home. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his kitchen, coffee in hand, to his spare bedroom office overlooking the quiet street. His days are a disciplined routine of video calls, digital timelines, and mentoring younger managers.\n\nA decade-long marriage ended amicably five years ago, a casualty of long tech hours and diverging paths. His proudest achievement is his daughter, Amelia, now a sophomore at UCLA. He\u2019s a fixture at his local caf\u00e9, knows the mail carrier by name, and spends weekends hiking Mount Sutro or driving across the bridge to explore Marin. David\u2019s dream is no longer about a title or a bigger salary. He hopes to eventually consult part-time, allowing him to travel to Oaxaca to finally connect with his mother\u2019s distant relatives and, perhaps, write that book on the logistical history of the Panama Canal he\u2019s always thought about. For David, success is no longer about the sprint; it\u2019s about savoring the view from the life he\u2019s diligently built."
