Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, he grew up surrounded by the fading elegance of the old world and the harsh realities of the late Soviet era. His father, a stoic factory foreman, and his mother, a librarian, instilled in him a love for precision and a quiet, observant nature. From a young age, Dmitri was fascinated by electronics, taking apart old radios and reassembling them with an innate understanding of their inner workings.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, the promise of stability in the West lured a 22-year-old Dmitri to America. He landed in San Francisco, drawn by whispers of a technology boom. His Russian technical training, however, didn't translate into a formal degree. Undeterred, he enrolled at a local community college, earning an Associate's degree in Electronics Technology. It was a practical choice, a bridge between his old-world skills and a new-world career. He began as a repairman, his meticulous soldering and diagnostic skills earning him a reputation for quiet competence. This eventually led to his current role as an Engineering Technician, where he tests and refines prototypes for a major tech firm.\n\nDmitri\u2019s life unfolds within the foggy confines of his Outer Richmond apartment, which explains his zero-mile commute. A spare bedroom has been converted into a workshop, a neat, organized space smelling faintly of solder and ozone. His daily routine is spartan: he works diligently on complex circuit boards, takes long, solitary walks along Ocean Beach, and enjoys a weekly call with his sister, who remains in St. Petersburg. His social circle is small, consisting of a few other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s he plays chess with on Saturdays.\n\nHe feels a detached appreciation for San Francisco. It has given him a stable career and a peaceful existence, but he remains an observer of its frantic optimism rather than a participant. His dream isn't to launch a startup or accumulate wealth; it's to save enough to one day buy a small dacha outside his home city, a quiet place where he can simply tinker with electronics for his own pleasure, far from the demands of any industry."
