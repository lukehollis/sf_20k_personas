Born in the Sunset District to a Japanese American father, a quiet landscape gardener, and a vibrant Mexican American mother, a line cook from the Mission, Kenji\u2019s childhood was a mix of serene garden discipline and the boisterous energy of a bustling kitchen. He was a curious kid, more interested in the guts of a broken VCR or the mechanics of his Schwinn bicycle than in schoolwork. He had a natural talent for seeing how things fit together, a skill he inherited from both his parents\u2019 meticulous professions.\n\nAfter high school, Kenji enrolled at the City College of San Francisco, vaguely pursuing a degree in computer science. It felt like the expected path, but the theoretical code on the screen never satisfied him the way the tangible click of a well-seated component did. When his father\u2019s health declined, Kenji left his studies without a second thought to take on full-time work, finding his calling not in software but in hardware. He bounced between jobs, learning to repair everything from commercial kitchen appliances to complex medical imaging equipment, his \"some college\" background overshadowed by a formidable real-world expertise.\n\nHis life\u2019s turning point came when he landed his current role, which explains his zero-mile commute. Kenji is the lead Field Service Technician for a large, high-tech residential building in Mission Bay. He lives on-site in a small company apartment, making his \"field\" the fifteen floors of smart homes, the automated package lockers, the temperamental gym equipment, and the rooftop solar array. He is the building\u2019s ghost in the machine, the person residents call when their networked blinds won't open or the shared co-working space\u2019s 3D printer jams.\n\nKenji\u2019s life is his work. His social circle consists of the building\u2019s residents: the tech founders he helps with their home automation, the elderly woman whose smart TV he patiently resets weekly, and the barista in the ground-floor cafe whose espresso machine he keeps perfectly calibrated. He dreams of one day opening his own small shop in the Outer Richmond, a place for repairing high-end, esoteric electronics\u2014a haven for things people believe are beyond fixing. For now, he finds deep satisfaction in being the indispensable man, the quiet center of a complex urban ecosystem, ensuring his corner of San Francisco runs smoothly."
