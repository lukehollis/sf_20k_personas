He arrived in California\u2019s Central Valley at 14, trading dusty fields for the irrigated farmlands around Yuba City. His family, part of a growing Sikh community, instilled in him a profound sense of structure and duty. While his father and uncles found their footing in agriculture and trucking, Harpreet was drawn to the intricate systems of the cities they supplied, particularly the beautiful, chaotic puzzle of San Francisco, which he visited on a high school trip.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree and then to UCLA for a Master of Urban and Regional Planning. He saw city planning not as an abstract exercise, but as a moral imperative\u2014a way to create equitable, functional spaces for everyone. He joined San Francisco\u2019s Planning Department in his late twenties, eschewing more lucrative private sector offers for the belief that he could effect more meaningful, lasting change from within the government.\n\nNow 54, Harpreet is a veteran of city hall. His career has been a slow, steady climb, marked by the unglamorous work of zoning reviews, environmental impact reports, and endless community meetings. A key turning point was the contentious development of a mixed-use project in the Mission in the early 2000s, where he learned the delicate, often thankless art of balancing community needs with political pressures.\n\nHe lives in a tidy condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he has watched transform firsthand. The 0.0-mile commute is a blessing; he works primarily from home, his desk overlooking the very streets he helps shape. His mornings start with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, where he observes the city waking up\u2014the traffic patterns, the flow of pedestrians, the new graffiti. He is amicably divorced, and his greatest pride is his daughter, Kiran, now a landscape architecture student at Cal Poly. Their video calls are often filled with lively debates about public space and sustainable design.\n\nHarpreet\u2019s aspirations are no longer for personal advancement. His dream is to see one last major project through to completion: a comprehensive plan to revitalize a neglected waterfront corridor. He wants to leave a tangible legacy of thoughtful, human-centric design on the city that became his home, a final, indelible mark from the boy who once only dreamed of such complex, vibrant places."

Below, San Francisco wasn\u2019t just a city; it was a living circuit board, a grid of logic and light. He saw the flow of traffic like blood in its veins. In that moment, the boy who knew only flat farmland felt a profound sense of recognition. This beautiful, complex system was the puzzle he was meant to spend his life solving.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the oppressive humidity of a Mission church basement in his early thirties, facing a hostile crowd. An elderly woman, her hands gnarled with arthritis, didn't shout. She quietly asked if the shadow from his proposed building would kill the single rose bush in her yard. All the technical arguments about floor-area-ratios vanished. His job wasn't about blueprints; it was about the sunlight on a single flower. That night taught him a deep, weary humility that has guided every decision since.\n\n3.\nKiran was ten, walking with him through the then-new Hayes Valley streetscape parks\u2014a project he\u2019d bled for. She ran her hand along the edge of a corten steel planter he\u2019d debated over for months. \"You made people a place to sit, Daddy,\" she said, so simply. He watched a couple share a coffee where parked cars once sat, and felt a surge of quiet, fierce pride. The endless meetings and paperwork had solidified into this simple, tangible joy for his daughter. That became his metric for success.\n\n4.\nOn a video call last year, Kiran pulled up a satellite view of his waterfront revitalization area. \"It needs more soft edges, Dad,\" she\u2019d said, already a peer. She started sketching, her landscape architect\u2019s mind seeing things his planner\u2019s eye had missed\u2014tidal pools, native grasses, places for life to thrive on the margins. He felt not the pride of a father, but the respect of a colleague. The debate was lively, brilliant, and the most hopeful he'd felt about his work in years.\n\n5.\nJust last week, working from his desk, he watched a delivery truck driver get stuck trying to navigate a newly narrowed street he\u2019d designed. For a moment, he felt a planner's panic. Then, he watched the caf\u00e9 owner come out, guide the driver, and share a laugh with him. Others on the sidewalk paused to help. The system he designed wasn\u2019t perfect, but it forced a moment of human interaction; it made neighbors out of strangers. He smiled. The city was working as intended."
