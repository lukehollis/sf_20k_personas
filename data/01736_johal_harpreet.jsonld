He arrived in California\u2019s Central Valley at 14, trading dusty fields for the irrigated farmlands around Yuba City. His family, part of a growing Sikh community, instilled in him a profound sense of structure and duty. While his father and uncles found their footing in agriculture and trucking, Harpreet was drawn to the intricate systems of the cities they supplied, particularly the beautiful, chaotic puzzle of San Francisco, which he visited on a high school trip.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree and then to UCLA for a Master of Urban and Regional Planning. He saw city planning not as an abstract exercise, but as a moral imperative\u2014a way to create equitable, functional spaces for everyone. He joined San Francisco\u2019s Planning Department in his late twenties, eschewing more lucrative private sector offers for the belief that he could effect more meaningful, lasting change from within the government.\n\nNow 54, Harpreet is a veteran of city hall. His career has been a slow, steady climb, marked by the unglamorous work of zoning reviews, environmental impact reports, and endless community meetings. A key turning point was the contentious development of a mixed-use project in the Mission in the early 2000s, where he learned the delicate, often thankless art of balancing community needs with political pressures.\n\nHe lives in a tidy condo in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood he has watched transform firsthand. The 0.0-mile commute is a blessing; he works primarily from home, his desk overlooking the very streets he helps shape. His mornings start with a walk to a local caf\u00e9, where he observes the city waking up\u2014the traffic patterns, the flow of pedestrians, the new graffiti. He is amicably divorced, and his greatest pride is his daughter, Kiran, now a landscape architecture student at Cal Poly. Their video calls are often filled with lively debates about public space and sustainable design.\n\nHarpreet\u2019s aspirations are no longer for personal advancement. His dream is to see one last major project through to completion: a comprehensive plan to revitalize a neglected waterfront corridor. He wants to leave a tangible legacy of thoughtful, human-centric design on the city that became his home, a final, indelible mark from the boy who once only dreamed of such complex, vibrant places."
