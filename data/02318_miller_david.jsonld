His commute is a ten-step walk from his kitchen to a small, sound-proofed home office, a deliberate choice born from years spent in the city's chaotic healthcare system.\n\nRaised in a stoic, blue-collar Ohio family, David\u2019s upbringing was defined by unspoken rules and emotional restraint. Feelings were inconvenient, a private burden to be managed alone. The turning point came when his aunt suffered a severe depressive episode, a crisis the family met with confused silence and quiet shame. Watching her struggle without the vocabulary or support to heal ignited a quiet rebellion in teenage David. He became fascinated by the invisible architecture of the human mind and the power of being heard.\n\nHe pursued a degree in sociology at a state university before moving west for his Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University. The city was a revelation\u2014a place where vulnerability could be a strength. He cut his teeth as an LCSW at a major downtown hospital, working in the emotional triage of the emergency department. For over a decade, he witnessed the rawest forms of human suffering, learning to offer calm in the face of crisis. But the relentless exposure led to burnout, a hollowing out that threatened the very empathy his job required.\n\nFive years ago, David made a change. He left the hospital and established a private telehealth practice from his apartment. Now, his days are structured and calm. He starts with a run in Golden Gate Park, grabs coffee from the same local cafe, and then begins his video sessions with clients. He helps them navigate anxiety, grief, and trauma, his approach grounded in the real-world experience the hospital gave him.\n\nHis life is interwoven with his partner of twelve years, a landscape architect named Leo, and a small circle of close friends. Evenings are for cooking, reading, and walks to Ocean Beach to watch the surf. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is profound; he has treated its people at their most broken and now helps them heal, one session at a time. His dream is no longer to save the world, but to maintain his own balance, perhaps one day writing a book about the quiet courage he witnesses daily from his chair."
