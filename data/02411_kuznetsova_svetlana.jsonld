Raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother, her world was one of books and the briny air of the port city. She began a degree in history, fascinated by the tales of tsars and revolutions. However, when her grandmother\u2019s health severely declined, her mother made the difficult decision to immigrate to San Francisco, following an aunt who promised access to better medical care in the city\u2019s large Russian-speaking community.\n\nAt 21, Svetlana arrived in the fog-shrouded Sunset District. Her history degree was abandoned as she and her mother navigated a new language and the overwhelming task of caring for a loved one. It was in the hushed rooms of their small apartment, helping her grandmother with daily tasks, that Svetlana discovered an unexpected calling. She possessed a deep well of patience and a quiet, steadying presence. After her grandmother passed away, the path forward felt clear. She enrolled in a short, intensive program and became a Certified Nursing Assistant.\n\nNow 34, Svetlana\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of the \u201cRichmond Gardens,\u201d a small, private assisted living facility in the Outer Richmond where she not only works but also resides in a modest staff studio. Her 0.0-mile commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs. Her days are a cycle of soft-soled shoes on clean floors, assisting elderly residents with meals, medication, and companionship. She is a familiar comfort, known for her calm demeanor and her willingness to listen to stories of a San Francisco she never knew.\n\nHer social life is quiet. She maintains a close bond with her mother, who still lives in the Sunset, and shares Sunday tea with a few other Russian caregivers. The dream of completing her history degree has faded, replaced by a more immediate aspiration: to one day have her own small apartment, a space separate from her work. She longs for a window overlooking the ocean, where she can read Chekhov in peace, a quiet life earned through a decade of caring for others."
