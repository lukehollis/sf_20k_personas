            "value": "David Wong is a product of San Francisco in its purest form. Born to a working-class Irish-American father from the Sunset and a third-generation Chinese-American mother from Chinatown, his identity was never boxed into a single category. He was raised simply \u201ca San Franciscan,\u201d a label he carries with quiet pride and which he offers when asked about his background. This upbringing in a home filled with diverse traditions, foods, and perspectives shaped his adaptable, non-judgmental worldview.\n\nForegoing a traditional four-year university, David found his education in the city itself. After high school, he drifted through service jobs until landing a position at a small print shop in SoMa. There, in the controlled chaos of ink, paper, and deadlines, he discovered a natural talent for untangling complex workflows and managing client expectations. This hands-on experience became the bedrock of his career. He parlayed his skills into a coordinator role at a small design agency, absorbing everything about project pipelines and creative collaboration. Today, he\u2019s a sought-after Project Manager for a creative agency, earning certifications online to formalize the skills he honed in the trenches.\n\nA key turning point was the end of a long-term relationship in his early thirties, which prompted him to move from a shared apartment in the Mission to a solo one-bedroom in the Inner Richmond. The change forced a new level of self-reliance and deepened his connection to his immediate surroundings. His 0.0-mile commute means his life is hyperlocal. His days start with a walk through the fog in Golden Gate Park and coffee from a favorite spot on Clement Street. He works from a desk tucked into a bay window overlooking the neighborhood, his focus only broken by the rumble of the 38 Geary bus.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of friends from various stages of his life, often meeting for dim sum or drinks at a familiar neighborhood bar. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to scale a corporate ladder but to apply his project management skills to something tangible for the city\u2014perhaps restoring a local parklet or managing the launch of a new community arts initiative. He sees himself as a quiet caretaker, someone who brings order to chaos, both in his work and in his unwavering, lifelong love for the complex, ever-changing city that raised him."
