The daughter of Chinese immigrants who ran a small grocery store in the Sunset District, she grew up surrounded by the quiet hum of hard work and the expectation that she would become a doctor. For years, she followed that path, excelling in science at Lowell High School and starting as a pre-med student at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year when her grandfather, a man who spoke little English, battled a prolonged illness. Mei witnessed firsthand his confusion and frustration navigating a fragmented healthcare system. It wasn't a single doctor who failed him, but the system itself. This ignited a different passion in her: to fix the system from the inside. She pivoted from pre-med to public health, earning both her undergraduate degree and MPH from Berkeley.\n\nNow 37, Mei is a Clinical Informatics Specialist at a major San Francisco medical center. She is the crucial bridge between clinicians and technology, designing and refining electronic health record systems. Her work is her passion; she finds deep satisfaction in projects that use data to identify and reduce health disparities across the city's diverse populations. Her daily routine begins with a brisk walk in Golden Gate Park before catching the 38 Geary Muni bus for her 3.8-mile commute.\n\nMei lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, just a few miles from her childhood home. She maintains close ties with her parents, joining them for weekly dim sum. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends, a mix from college and work, with whom she explores the city's food scene and escapes for hiking trips in Marin. While content with her independence and career, a quiet hope lingers for a partnership with someone who shares her values of community and service. Her long-term dream is to lead a city-wide initiative using health tech to improve language access for non-English speaking patients\u2014a direct tribute to the grandfather who unknowingly set her on her true path."

She saw not just confusion in his eyes, but a deep, quiet shame at his inability to understand. In that sterile room, Mei\u2019s ambition shifted from fixing a body to fixing the broken system that isolated him. The feeling of helpless anger that day became the fuel for her entire career, a promise she made to him without words.\n\n2.\nAt age eight, she\u2019d perch on a stool behind the counter of her parents\u2019 Sunset grocery, watching her mother use patient gestures and a kind smile to help an elderly Russian customer find the right kind of tea. There was no shared language, only a shared humanity. That simple, daily act of bridging a gap, of ensuring someone felt seen and understood, planted a seed in Mei. It taught her that community care wasn\u2019t a grand gesture, but a million small, empathetic moments.\n\n3.\nThe click of the mouse felt impossibly loud in the silence of the Berkeley library computer lab. It was 2 a.m. her sophomore year, and she had just officially changed her major from Molecular Biology to Public Health. A wave of both terror and profound relief washed over her. It was the first time she had actively defied her parents' dream for her, choosing a path forged from her own conviction. That click was the sound of her taking ownership of her life.\n\n4.\nHer first major project victory wasn't a promotion, but a graph. On screen, the data visualization she designed starkly illustrated that Cantonese-speaking patients missed follow-up appointments at three times the rate of English speakers. It was proof, undeniable and clear. A wave of fierce satisfaction hit her\u2014she had turned her family\u2019s painful experience into a tool for change. In that moment, her grandfather\u2019s frustration was no longer just a memory; it was a mandate.\n\n5.\nLast fall, standing with her friends at the top of Mount Tam, the wind whipped her hair as they looked down at San Francisco blanketed in fog, the tip of the Sutro Tower peeking through. In the easy, comfortable silence between them, she felt a profound sense of peace. This was the life she had built: meaningful work, deep friendships, and an enduring love for the city that held all her history. It was a feeling of being wholly, contentedly herself."
