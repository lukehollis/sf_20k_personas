Adopted from an orphanage in Busan, South Korea, he was raised by Sean and Moira O\u2019Connell, a firefighter and a public school teacher, in a foggy corner of San Francisco\u2019s Sunset District. He grew up surrounded by love, Irish blessings, and steaming bowls of his mother's beef stew, yet always felt the quiet dissonance of the face in the mirror. His childhood was a happy paradox, a Korean kid with a slight Irish brogue learned from his grandparents, navigating the unique cultural tapestry of his family and city.\n\nHe enrolled at San Francisco State University, vaguely pursuing a business degree to satisfy his practical-minded parents. But the sense of being untethered, of following a script not written for him, became overwhelming. After two years of lackluster grades and mounting existential dread, Liam dropped out. The decision was a turning point, creating a rift of loving disappointment with his parents and leaving him adrift. Needing steady income, he took a job as a loan processor assistant, a position he found through a temp agency.\n\nNow, at 25, Liam\u2019s world is largely confined to the four walls of his small Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are a quiet hum of digital paperwork, processing files for people buying homes he could never afford. His routine is monastic: wake up, log in, eat at his desk, log off. Socially, he keeps a small circle of high school friends, meeting for pho or beers at a familiar neighborhood dive bar.\n\nLiam\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep but complicated. He is a native who feels increasingly like a stranger in a city reshaped by wealth. He cherishes the familiar comfort of his neighborhood\u2014the smell of saltwater on the fog, the bakeries on Clement Street, the quiet presence of his parents still in his childhood home. His hope, simmering beneath the surface of his monotonous job, is to save enough money to travel to South Korea. It isn't about finding his birth parents, but about finding a piece of himself he feels is missing. His dream is to one day reconcile his two worlds\u2014the Irish son of San Francisco and the man from Busan\u2014and finally feel whole."

He belonged there, wrapped in his father's arms, but his eyes and hair told a different story. It wasn\u2019t sadness, but a profound, quiet confusion. A puzzle piece that fit perfectly yet was cut from a different picture. This was the first time he truly understood he was a paradox, a loving contradiction, a question he would spend his life trying to answer.\n\n2.\nTelling them was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done. He was twenty, sitting at the familiar kitchen table in the Sunset, the air thick with the scent of brewing tea. His dad, Sean, just stared at his calloused hands. His mom, Moira, her eyes welling, whispered, \u201cBut Liam, darling, your future.\u201d It wasn\u2019t anger that broke him, but the crushing weight of their loving disappointment. That day, he chose an unknown path over a comfortable lie, trading their approval for a chance to find himself, even if it meant getting lost first.\n\n3.\nHe was 23, scrolling aimlessly through a streaming service, when he landed on a travel show. A chef was walking through a bustling fish market in Busan. The chaotic energy, the faces, the rapid-fire language\u2014it was utterly foreign, yet it struck a resonant chord deep within him. It wasn't about searching for strangers. It was about standing in a place where he wasn't the outlier. The vague feeling of otherness sharpened into a clear, singular goal: he had to go to Busan.\n\n4.\nLast winter, during a week of overwhelming deadlines, he opened his apartment window late at night. The city was silent except for the low, mournful call of the Golden Gate Bridge fog horn. The sound vibrated through the damp Inner Richmond air, the same sound he\u2019d heard his entire life. It was the city\u2019s constant heartbeat beneath the frantic change. In that moment, he didn\u2019t feel like a stranger priced out of his home. He felt like a native son, anchored by a sound that had no price tag.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, at their usual dive bar, his high school friend Mark announced he\u2019d just closed on a small condo in the Mission. The pride and congratulations were real, but a cold dread settled in Liam\u2019s stomach. Mark wasn\u2019t a tech millionaire; he was just\u2026 moving forward. Liam went home to his quiet apartment, the loan applications he'd processed that day mocking him from his laptop screen. He was building other people\u2019s lives in his city while his own felt stuck on a loading screen."
