Growing up in San Jose, the only child of a third-generation Japanese American family, he was surrounded by the quiet hum of Silicon Valley\u2019s burgeoning order. His father, a hardware engineer, taught him the logic of circuits and processors, while his mother, a community librarian, showed him the intricate, often messy, systems of human connection. This duality defined him.\n\nHe pursued a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, resisting the more lucrative path of pure computer science. David was fascinated by how people moved through cities, seeing them as elegant, complex organisms. His early career at the SFMTA was a lesson in bureaucratic patience, mapping out bike lanes and bus routes with meticulous care. He loved the work but felt constrained by its pace.\n\nThe turning point came a decade ago. A major tech company, building its own sprawling campus, lured him away with a massive salary and the promise of creating a \"city of the future\" from scratch. He became a Transportation Planning Manager, trading public service for private innovation. He now designs autonomous shuttle routes and optimizes traffic flow with algorithms, all from the quiet of his Inner Sunset apartment.\n\nHis 0.0-mile commute is a quiet irony he often considers. At 45, his days are a cycle of video calls with teams across the globe, the city he shapes a digital abstraction on his multiple monitors. Divorced for three years, his personal life has become similarly contained and orderly. He finds solace in the meticulous art of bonsai, tending to his miniature maples on a balcony overlooking the fog-draped park. His social life consists of a tight-knit group of friends from his old MUNI days and the occasional friendly nod to neighbors at the local bakery.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is both profound and detached. He walks through Golden Gate Park daily, appreciating its planned wilderness, a system designed for escape. David\u2019s aspiration is no longer a bigger title. He dreams of using his corporate expertise to help smaller, underserved communities design smarter, more equitable transit systems\u2014a way to finally merge his father's logic with his mother's sense of community. He just hasn't figured out the route yet."
