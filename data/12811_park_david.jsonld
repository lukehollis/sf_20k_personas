Born in the Outer Sunset to a Korean immigrant father who ran a small corner grocery and a second-generation Irish-American mother who worked as a waitress, David grew up navigating the space between two distinct cultures. He was neither fully one nor the other, a feeling that defined his youth. Restless and academically adrift, he saw high school not as a launchpad but as a finish line. He graduated with a general studies diploma, eager to trade textbooks for the tangible pulse of the city.\n\nFor years, David drifted. He was a bike messenger weaving through FiDi traffic, a bartender in the Mission slinging drinks, and a stockroom worker in a Union Square department store. Each job paid the bills but left him feeling unmoored. The turning point came in his late twenties when his father suffered a serious health crisis. David spent weeks in and out of SF General Hospital, observing the efficient, compassionate work of the patient care technicians. He was struck by their ability to offer dignity and comfort amid chaos. It was a purpose he could understand\u2014direct, human, and essential. He enrolled in a certification program and found his calling not in a grand ambition, but in the quiet act of service.\n\nNow 47, David's life has a steady rhythm. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its proximity to Golden Gate Park and its unpretentious vibe. His daily routine is anchored by the 1.8-mile MUNI ride down Geary to the UCSF Parnassus campus, where he works as a PCT. His day is a blur of taking vitals, assisting patients with basic needs, and offering a calm presence. The work is physically and emotionally demanding, but he finds deep satisfaction in the small, meaningful connections he makes.\n\nDavid is amicably divorced and maintains a small circle of close friends, meeting for pho on Clement Street or catching a Giants game. He isn't chasing wealth or status; his dreams are more grounded. He hopes to save enough to one day buy a small condo, perhaps even outside the city, though the thought of leaving the familiar fog-laced streets fills him with ambivalence. For now, he finds contentment in his routine, his role, and the quiet knowledge that he is a steady, caring hand in the city that shaped him."

His father, smelling of cardboard and garlic, worked beside him in silence. It wasn't an awkward silence, but a shared rhythm of work. In that quiet fog-laced store, stocking shelves next to his dad, David felt a rare, uncomplicated sense of belonging. It taught him that connection didn't always need words; sometimes, it was just the dignity of a shared task.\n\n2.\nAt twenty-three, he was a bike messenger. He vividly recalls a near-miss on Montgomery Street, a taxi door swinging open without warning. The screech of his tires, the jolt in his chest, the driver's unheard apology\u2014it was the peak of the adrenaline rush he chased daily. For a fleeting moment, he felt intensely alive, a feeling he mistook for purpose. That memory became a benchmark for recklessness, a reminder of a time when moving fast through the city felt more important than having a place to go.\n\n3.\nThe most pivotal moment of his life was in a sterile, beige room at SF General. His father, looking small in the hospital bed, struggled to drink from a cup. A patient care technician, a man with tired eyes and gentle hands, came in, adjusted his father\u2019s pillows, and held the straw to his lips with practiced ease. David watched, frozen by his own helplessness. In that simple act of compassionate service, he saw a purpose so clear and tangible it cut through years of aimlessness. He knew, right then, what he had to do.\n\n4.\nOn his first solo shift as a PCT at UCSF, an elderly woman, delirious and frightened, gripped his arm with surprising strength. Instead of panicking, he remembered the technician who helped his father. He spoke to her softly, not about procedures, but about the view of the Sutro Tower from her window. Her grip slowly loosened. The fear in her eyes softened to confusion, then exhaustion. The immense relief he felt wasn't a thrill but a deep, quiet satisfaction. It was the first time his presence alone had been a form of care.\n\n5.\nJust last year, after a grueling double shift, he stood alone in Golden Gate Park as dusk settled. The scent of eucalyptus and damp earth filled the air. He listened to the distant hum of a N-Judah train and watched the fog roll in over Strawberry Hill, obscuring the city he both loved and felt trapped by. There was no grand epiphany, just a profound sense of peace. This was his life: demanding, imperfect, and anchored in this specific place. In that quiet moment, contentment felt like enough."
