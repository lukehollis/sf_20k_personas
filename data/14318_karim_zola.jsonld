Raised in Oakland by her Pakistani immigrant father, a history professor with a love for Sufi poetry, and her multiracial (Black and white) American mother, a dedicated public school teacher, Zola\u2019s childhood was a rich tapestry of storytelling, activism, and soulful cooking. This foundation instilled in her a deep-seated belief in the power of narrative and community support.\n\nDrawn to helping others, Zola moved across the bay to attend San Francisco State University, enrolling in the social work program. She was passionate but grew disillusioned with the field\u2019s rigid bureaucracy, feeling it often pathologized the very people it aimed to serve. Her turning point came during a volunteer placement at a youth center in the Bayview. There, she saw a withdrawn teenager, who had resisted all attempts at talk therapy, come alive while painting a mural, his story pouring out in vibrant spray paint. Zola realized art was a more direct, empowering language for healing. She left college, channeling all her energy into community arts.\n\nNow 33, Zola is the Community Arts Program Coordinator for a non-profit serving at-risk youth. Her days are a whirlwind of grant writing, managing art supplies, and mentoring young artists. Her 3.8-mile commute on the MUNI from her small, rent-stabilized apartment in the Mission District is a time for reflection, watching the city and its people flash by her window. Zola\u2019s social life is intertwined with her work; her friends are fellow artists, activists, and educators who gather for potlucks in Precita Park or to support local gallery openings.\n\nWhile she\u2019s content, Zola dreams of securing a larger, permanent home for her program\u2014a true sanctuary where creativity is the primary form of care. Her personal aspiration is to finish a series of portraits celebrating the unsung community elders of her neighborhood. For Zola, San Francisco is not a city of tech booms and tourist traps, but a complex, breathing organism. She finds her purpose in its gritty, resilient heart, working every day to ensure its most vulnerable voices have a canvas to be seen and heard."

The air was thick with the scent of her mother\u2019s daal and the sound of her father\u2019s voice, reading Rumi aloud in a low, rhythmic Urdu. She didn\u2019t understand all the words, but she understood the feeling\u2014a profound sense of peace where art and nourishment were one. It was the first time she recognized that care could be a form of poetry, a lesson that became the bedrock of her life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nShe was 21, disillusioned in a Bayview youth center, watching a boy named Marcus. He hadn\u2019t spoken a word to her in weeks. Then he picked up a can of spray paint. A phoenix in brilliant orange and gold erupted on the wall, fierce and beautiful. In the hiss of the can, she heard his voice louder than any therapy session. It was a lightning strike of understanding; her path wasn't in an office filing paperwork, but right here, handing him another can of paint.\n\n3.\nAt 25, after begging a Mission cafe owner for wall space, she hosted her first youth art show. She\u2019d paid for the cheap frames herself. She watched one of her quietest students, a 15-year-old girl, stare at her own framed photograph, a small, proud smile breaking across her face. Zola felt a wave of relief so powerful it almost buckled her knees. It wasn\u2019t a grant or a formal recognition, but it was everything. It was proof that her gamble on art was paying off.\n\n4.\nShe remembers a potluck in Precita Park two summers ago. The fog was just starting to roll over the hills, but the air was warm. Someone was playing a guitar, and her friends\u2014artists, activists, teachers\u2014were laughing, sharing food from mismatched Tupperware. Looking at their faces, bathed in the golden hour light, Zola felt a profound sense of rightness. This circle, this park, this shared meal\u2014this was her San Francisco. It wasn't about money or status; it was about showing up for each other.\n\n5.\nJust last year, she sat in the cramped, sunlit kitchen of Ms. Elena, a 78-year-old matriarch who\u2019d lived on her block for five decades. While Zola sketched the lines on her face for her portrait series, Elena shared a story about organizing rent strikes in the 80s. Zola felt less like an artist and more like a scribe, a humble vessel for a history that maps couldn't show. That quiet afternoon sharpened her purpose: to ensure these faces, and their stories, would not be erased."
