Raised by a civil engineer father who taught her the logic of systems and a biology teacher mother who instilled a reverence for the natural world, Sarah\u2019s childhood was a blend of hiking trips and lessons on watershed management. This practical, earthy upbringing shaped her path. She pursued an Environmental Science degree at the University of Oregon before earning a Master of Science in Environmental Management from UC Santa Barbara, focusing on corporate sustainability.\n\nHer early career was spent in the bureaucratic molasses of a large environmental firm, assessing contaminated industrial sites. It was frustratingly slow work. The turning point came during a project in the mid-2000s, where she saw firsthand the tech boom\u2019s invisible footprint: massive energy consumption for data centers and a burgeoning e-waste crisis. She realized her skills could have a greater impact not by cleaning up the old world\u2019s messes, but by preventing the new one from making them. She pivoted, joining a niche consultancy that advised tech giants on reducing their environmental impact.\n\nNow a senior consultant working from her elegant Cole Valley flat, Sarah\u2019s life is both deeply connected to and removed from her work. Her 0.0-mile commute means her days start not in traffic, but with a foggy morning run through Golden Gate Park. Her work is a series of video calls and data analyses, helping corporations in far-off Silicon Valley and Asia tweak supply chains and calculate carbon offsets.\n\nHer personal life is curated and quiet. A decade-old, amicable divorce from a startup founder left her with a strong sense of independence and a close-knit circle of friends. Her social life revolves around her yoga studio, a bi-monthly book club, and the Saturday morning farmers' market. She loves San Francisco for its proximity to wildness\u2014the Headlands, Mount Tam, the rugged coast\u2014which serve as an antidote to her digitally sterile profession.\n\nSarah\u2019s dream is to close the loop on her own life. She hopes to one day trade her spreadsheets for soil, using her savings to buy a small plot of land in Sonoma County to start a native plant nursery and practice regenerative agriculture. It\u2019s a quiet aspiration to escape the abstract world of corporate consulting and once again get her hands dirty in the earth she\u2019s spent her life trying to protect."
