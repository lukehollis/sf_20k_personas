Raised in San Jose, she was the daughter of a pragmatic software engineer father from Delhi and a free-spirited graphic designer mother from Marin County. Her childhood was a blend of weekend coding bootcamps and afternoons spent smearing paint on canvases in the garage. This duality defined her, leaving her feeling equally at home navigating lines of code as she was discussing color theory.\n\nWhile she initially pursued a computer science degree at UC Santa Cruz to please her father, she found the work sterile. A pivotal elective in human-computer interaction changed everything. Here, she discovered a field that lived in the space between her parents' two worlds: a discipline that used technology not as an end, but as a tool to create intuitive, beautiful human experiences. This revelation led her to San Francisco to pursue a Master's in Interaction Design at California College of the Arts.\n\nNow 30, Kaia is the Lead Experience Designer for a company that creates immersive digital platforms for boutique restaurants and live events. She thrives in the collaborative chaos, leading a team to design systems that feel less like software and more like a natural extension of a night out. Her 2.8-mile bike commute from her apartment in the Mission District to her SoMa office is a daily ritual. The ride, with its vibrant murals and bustling streets, is a source of constant inspiration.\n\nHer life in the Mission reflects her upbringing: she loves the neighborhood's energetic, artistic pulse and its world-class food scene. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of designers, chefs, and climbers she met at Mission Cliffs. While successful, Kaia dreams of starting her own design studio focused on public art and interactive museum installations\u2014projects that fully break the digital out of the screen and into the physical world. For her, San Francisco isn't just a place to work; it's the canvas on which she hopes to design a more connected and joyful future."

It was just code and mechanics, but it felt alive, artistic. Kaia felt a profound click, a sudden coherence between her father\u2019s logic and her mother\u2019s art. The sterility of computer science dissolved, replaced by a thrilling sense of possibility. In that moment, she didn\u2019t just find a new major; she found the language her own soul had been trying to speak.\n\n2.\nShe was 23, nervously showing her father her grad school portfolio. He didn\u2019t get the color theory, but when she showed him the user flow diagrams, his eyes lit up. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, tracing a path with his finger, \u201cI see the system. It\u2019s elegant.\u201d In his simple, pragmatic approval, years of feeling torn between her parents\u2019 worlds dissolved. She wasn\u2019t abandoning his world for her mother\u2019s; she was building a bridge between them. That moment gave her the unconflicted confidence to move forward.\n\n3.\nShe was 26, her hands chalky and trembling halfway up a route at Mission Cliffs. Below, a new friend she\u2019d met just an hour before held her rope, shouting encouragement. Letting go at the top, trusting a near-stranger to catch her, was terrifying and then, completely liberating. That sharp intake of breath, followed by the smooth descent, wasn't just about climbing. It was the moment she realized her San Francisco community would be built on shared trust and guts, not just shared aesthetics or career paths.\n\n4.\nAt 27, Kaia sat anonymously at a Hayes Valley restaurant on the launch night of her team's first big project. She watched a couple across the room use the interactive menu she\u2019d designed. They weren\u2019t fumbling or frustrated; they were laughing, pointing at animations, their interaction with the tech fluidly part of their date. It was the proudest moment of her career. She hadn't just built an interface; she had successfully designed a small piece of someone else's joy, proving technology could be a quiet partner to human connection.\n\n5.\nOne foggy morning at 28, cycling through Clarion Alley, the wet pavement intensified the murals\u2019 colors, making them pulse against the grey gloom. The anonymous, defiant art felt more immediate and human than any screen she\u2019d ever designed. It was a jolt of pure inspiration that crystallized her ambition: she didn\u2019t just want to design *for* screens. She wanted to create experiences like this\u2014bold, physical, and woven into the very fabric of the city. Her daily commute became her daily mission."
