Her family fled the civil war when she was a young child, arriving in the Mission District with little more than the clothes on their backs and a community of fellow refugees to welcome them. This early life, colored by her parents\u2019 trauma and the constant struggle to navigate a new country\u2019s systems, instilled in her a profound sense of justice and a desire to help others navigate the very mazes that once confounded her family.\n\nThis calling led her to San Francisco State for her undergraduate degree and then to UC Berkeley for her Master of Social Work. She deliberately chose a career path that would place her at the intersection of vulnerability and bureaucracy. For over two decades, Marisol has been a Licensed Clinical Social Worker within the San Francisco Unified School District, acting as a vital bridge for immigrant and low-income families. She is the steady voice in a chaotic Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting, the one who secures healthcare access for an uninsured child, and the compassionate ear for students struggling with trauma she understands on a cellular level.\n\nA quiet divorce in her late thirties was a pivotal turning point, forcing her to rely on her own resilience and deepening her empathy for the single mothers she often serves. Her greatest pride is her daughter, Sofia, now a student at UCLA, whose passion for public policy was sparked by watching her mother fight tirelessly for others.\n\nMarisol\u2019s daily routine is grounded in the city. Her 3.8-mile commute is a ritual, spent on the 14 Mission bus, reading case files or simply watching the city wake up. She lives in the same rent-controlled apartment she\u2019s had for fifteen years, a sanctuary filled with books and photos of Sofia. The Mission is more than her neighborhood; it\u2019s her anchor, from the murals on Balmy Alley to the familiar comfort of La Torta Gorda.\n\nNow at 49, Marisol dreams not of retirement, but of evolution. Her ultimate goal is to open a small, bilingual private practice in the Mission, offering culturally competent therapy to address the intergenerational trauma she knows so well. She wants to create a space for healing, built by and for the community that first saved her."

The teacher, Mrs. Davis, knelt beside her desk and placed a worn copy of *The Little House* in her hands, its pages filled with pictures that needed no translation. In that moment, Marisol felt seen not as a refugee, but as a child. It was a simple act of kindness that planted a seed: a school could be a sanctuary. This belief became the bedrock of her entire career, driving her to make schools a safe harbor for every child.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIn her late twenties, Marisol sat in her first truly hostile IEP meeting. A single mother, who spoke only Spanish, was shrinking under the barrage of acronyms. Marisol saw her own mother\u2019s frightened face in the woman\u2019s eyes. A fierce, protective clarity washed over her. She interrupted the proceedings, her voice calm but unbreakable, and began translating not just the words, but the intent. This was the moment her job became a calling, solidifying her role as a fierce, unwavering advocate who would stand in the gap for others.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe memory she holds dearest is of Sofia, then sixteen, bursting through the door after volunteering at a legal aid clinic, her face flushed with righteous anger over an immigration case. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Mom!\u201d Sofia had declared, pacing the small living room. In her daughter\u2019s fire, Marisol saw her own life\u2019s work reflected back, not as a burden, but as a torch being passed. That evening, a profound sense of pride and relief settled in her heart; the fight would continue through her daughter.\n\n***\n\n4.\nOn the first night alone in her apartment after her divorce, the silence was deafening. She was 38. For a moment, she felt adrift. Instead of weeping, she walked to a dusty box and began unpacking her old social work textbooks from Berkeley. Tracing the spines of titles on trauma and family systems felt like finding her own backbone again. It was a quiet, solitary act of reclamation. That night forged a new, deeper empathy for the single mothers she served, an understanding now rooted in her own hard-won resilience.\n\n***\n\n5.\nJust last year, sitting on the 14 Mission bus on her way home, she watched the vibrant life of her neighborhood unfold. She saw the murals of Balmy Alley, smelled the roasting corn from a street cart, and heard the blend of Spanish and English around her. A sudden, overwhelming wave of peace washed over her. This community hadn't just been a landing place; it was the soil she had grown in. The feeling cemented her dream: to open her practice here, to give back to the very streets that saved her."
