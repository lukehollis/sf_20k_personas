Adopted as an infant by a loving, white academic couple in Marin County, the Quons, the name is his only tangible link to the birth parents he never knew. This early sense of being a misplaced entry in a catalog fostered a lifelong fascination with systems, identity, and the need for order.\n\nThis innate drive led him to UC Berkeley for his Master's in Library and Information Science. He was idealistic, envisioning a future surrounded by the comforting scent of old paper in a university library. However, he graduated at the dawn of the web 2.0 era. He quickly realized the world\u2019s most chaotic library was the internet itself, and the principles of cataloging and retrieval were desperately needed there. He pivoted, taking a job as a taxonomist for an early-stage startup.\n\nHis career blossomed. David\u2019s rare ability to translate the abstract principles of library science into logical, user-friendly digital structures made him invaluable. He rose through the ranks, his title evolving from UX Researcher to Information Architect, and finally, to Director at a major SoMa tech firm. The success, however, exacted a personal toll; a decade-long marriage dissolved under the pressure of long hours and a focus that had become more digital than domestic.\n\nNow 50, David\u2019s life is a study in well-ordered solitude. He lives in a meticulously kept apartment in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood he loves for its fog-muted quiet and proximity to Golden Gate Park. His daily routine is sacred: the N-Judah train ride downtown with a physical book, a day spent wrestling with complex data structures, and the commute home. Evenings are for cooking simple, precise meals and listening to jazz records.\n\nWhile he\u2019s proud of his professional success, David feels a pull back to his original calling. The high salary provides comfort, but not the soul-deep satisfaction he once sought. He dreams of using his skills for something smaller, more permanent\u2014perhaps building a free digital archive for a local historical society or volunteering at a struggling branch library. He's an architect of vast digital worlds, now quietly wondering how to draft the schematics for his own second act."

He watched his teacher\u2019s gaze shift from his own face to his mother\u2019s kind, blonde one, then down to the file on her desk. \u201cQuon,\u201d the teacher had murmured, a small wrinkle of confusion between her brows. In that moment, David understood his name wasn\u2019t just a sound, but a piece of data that didn't compute. It wasn\u2019t sad, exactly, but it was the first time he felt like a loose page from another book, neatly tucked into the wrong binding.\n\n2.\nIn the hushed, soaring stacks of Berkeley\u2019s Doe Library, he ran a hand along a row of bound periodicals. He was 24. The air smelled of old paper, binding glue, and decades of quiet thought. He pulled a volume and saw the crisp, typewritten card still in its sleeve\u2014a perfect, logical breadcrumb leading to this exact spot. It was a sublime peace, the feeling that all human knowledge could be ordered and preserved. This was the sanctuary he believed he would spend his life maintaining. It was his truest calling.\n\n3.\nThe fight with his wife, Lena, wasn't loud. He was on his laptop at the kitchen table, mapping a navigation system for a new app. She stood by the counter, holding two mugs of tea he hadn\u2019t noticed. \"You spend all your energy making things clear for millions of strangers,\" she said, her voice terribly quiet, \"but I feel completely lost with you.\" The words landed with the devastating precision of a line of code. He had architected a perfect digital world while the schematics for his own life lay in ruins.\n\n4.\nThe day he left his first startup for the major tech firm, he walked past the SFMOMA. He was 38. He remembered the founder promising they would \"change the world\" on beanbag chairs, and for a while, it felt true. But now, signing the offer letter with its staggering salary and Director title felt different. It wasn't the thrill of building something new, but the cold, clean logic of a successful transaction. He had traded the chaotic energy of creation for the gilded cage of management, and he felt the first real chill of compromise.\n\n5.\nJust last month, riding the N-Judah home through the fog, he looked up from his novel. The train surfaced near Cole Valley, and he saw a man carefully tending the miniature garden in his front window box. The act was so small, so physical and permanent against the fleeting digital structures he managed all day. A profound loneliness washed over him. He\u2019d spent his life architecting clouds, ephemeral and vast, and realized with a quiet ache that what he wanted now was to cultivate a single, perfect window box."
