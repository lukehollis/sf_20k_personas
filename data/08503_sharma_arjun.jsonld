Born and raised in Ludhiana, an industrial hub in Punjab, India, his upbringing was pragmatic. His family valued tangible skills over abstract degrees, and from a young age, Arjun was more comfortable with tools than textbooks. He finished his secondary schooling with decent marks but no clear path forward until his uncle, who owned a small machine shop in San Francisco, offered him a way out and a place to stay.\n\nArriving at 19, Arjun was thrown into the deep end. He didn't speak much English, and the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood felt like another planet compared to the bustling streets of Ludhiana. His education began not in a classroom, but on the shop floor. His uncle taught him the trade from the ground up: sweeping metal shavings, operating manual lathes, and eventually, the complex language of computer numerical control (CNC) machines. This became his calling; he found a deep satisfaction in translating digital code into tangible reality, shaping a raw block of aluminum into a perfect, custom part. When his uncle retired five years ago, Arjun stayed on, his skills making him indispensable to the new owners.\n\nArjun\u2019s life is defined by his 0.0-mile commute. He lives in a small, starkly functional apartment directly above the workshop. His day begins and ends with the hum of machinery filtering through the floorboards\u2014a sound he finds more comforting than disruptive. His connection to San Francisco isn't through its iconic landmarks, but through its industrial underbelly. His social circle is small, revolving around work colleagues and the owner of the corner store where he buys his groceries.\n\nThough his life is routine, Arjun harbors a quiet ambition. He saves methodically, dreaming of one day buying his own, more advanced CNC machine. After hours, he sometimes uses scrap metal to create intricate geometric sculptures, a private artistic outlet that blends his skill with a creativity few people see. He hopes to eventually launch a small business creating bespoke metalwork and custom parts, transforming his craft into a legacy\u2014a small, solid piece of San Francisco that he can truly call his own."
