Raised in a modest, middle-class family\u2014her father a carpenter, her mother a librarian\u2014Sarah was instilled with a quiet work ethic and a love for stories. This led her to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature from the University of Oregon, a choice she made for passion rather than a career path.\n\nAfter graduating, she fell into the restaurant industry, first as a server and then a bartender, discovering an unexpected talent for orchestrating the nightly chaos of a busy service. She moved to San Francisco in the late 1990s, drawn by the city\u2019s vibrant energy before the first dot-com boom fully reshaped it. For a decade, she managed a beloved, bustling Italian restaurant in North Beach, a role she cherished. Her life took a sharp turn during the 2008 recession when the restaurant closed, and her marriage of twelve years ended amicably. At 35, she was suddenly untethered.\n\nThe pivotal moment came from a friend who worked at a burgeoning tech company. \"They treat food like a core product,\" he\u2019d told her. \"They need someone who actually knows how to run a restaurant, not just a cafeteria.\" Intrigued, Sarah applied and was hired to manage the company's multi-million-dollar food service program. It was a culture shock, trading romantic North Beach nights for data-driven lunch rushes and kombucha on tap, but she thrived. She brought classic hospitality principles to a world obsessed with optimization, earning respect for her efficiency and human touch.\n\nNow, at 49, Sarah lives a comfortable, independent life in a modern condo in Hayes Valley, a short walk from the corporate campus she oversees. Her days are a blur of logistics, budgets, and managing a large team, ensuring thousands of employees are fed creatively and well. Her friends are a mix of old restaurant lifers and new tech colleagues. Having achieved a level of financial security she never imagined, Sarah dreams not of climbing the corporate ladder, but of stepping off it. Her long-term goal is to use her savings to open a small, intimate wine bar in her neighborhood\u2014a place with a story, where the focus is on connection, not scale. It would be a return to her roots, but this time, entirely on her own terms."
