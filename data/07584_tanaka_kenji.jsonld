            "value": "Kenji Tanaka is as much a part of the school\u2019s architecture as the worn brick and foggy windows. As a fourth-generation San Franciscan, his roots in the Richmond District run deeper than the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. His family once owned a small, beloved grocery store on Clement Street, a place that smelled of soy sauce, fresh produce, and his mother\u2019s homemade manju. Young Kenji, a quiet boy with a talent for drawing, dreamed of being an architect, sketching futuristic buildings in the margins of his school notebooks.\n\nHis path diverged sharply in his senior year of high school. Kenji\u2019s father suffered a debilitating stroke, and the responsibility for the family and the store fell squarely on his shoulders. College applications were set aside, and his dreams were packed away with them. For two decades, he dutifully ran the store, his world shrinking to the few blocks around his home. He knew every customer by name but sacrificed his own youth, watching friends leave for university and careers while he restocked shelves.\n\nThe grocery store couldn't survive the crush of chain supermarkets, and it finally closed when Kenji was in his late thirties. Adrift and with a limited resume, he took the only job that offered stability and a home: a live-in custodian position at the local elementary school he himself had once attended.\n\nNow, Kenji\u2019s life is governed by the school bell. He lives in a small apartment tucked behind the gymnasium. His commute is a short walk across the basketball court. He is a silent, dependable presence, the man who fixes what is broken and erases the day\u2019s chaos, leaving clean slates for the children each morning. While respected by the staff, his connections are polite and professional. His real solace comes in the quiet hours after the children have gone home, when he walks the empty halls or sits on a bench in the schoolyard, sketching the patterns of the fog-draped city in a small, worn notebook\u2014the last remnant of the architect he once hoped to be. His dream is no longer of grand buildings, but of simple dignity and the quiet satisfaction of being the unseen guardian of a community\u2019s future."
