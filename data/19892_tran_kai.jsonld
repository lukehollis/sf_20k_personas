Born in Honolulu, he is the son of a Vietnamese refugee who found sanctuary in Hawai\u02bbi and a Native Hawaiian woman whose lineage is deeply rooted in the islands. Kai\u2019s upbringing was a blend of his father\u2019s quiet resilience and his mother\u2019s embracing spirit of *aloha* and *ohana* (family). He spent his youth between the bustling energy of Honolulu and the serene shores of the North Shore, learning to navigate the complex social currents affecting his community.\n\nWitnessing the struggles of marginalized families firsthand inspired him to pursue a Bachelor's in Social Work from the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa. His goal was to become a bridge for those lost in systemic cracks. A key turning point came in his late twenties when he followed a partner to San Francisco. While the relationship eventually ended, Kai found the city\u2019s vibrant diversity and progressive spirit compelling. He decided to stay, planting new roots 2,400 miles from home.\n\nNow 41, Kai is a dedicated Clinical Case Manager, advocating for at-risk students within the city's public school system. His work is challenging but deeply fulfilling, a direct application of the values instilled in him as a child. His $89,000 salary requires careful budgeting in the expensive city, but allows for a stable life in his small Inner Richmond apartment.\n\nHis daily routine is quintessentially San Franciscan: a brisk walk to the bus stop, a 2.8-mile ride on the 38-Geary, and a day spent navigating bureaucracy for his students. To decompress, he finds solace not in bars, but in the green expanse of Golden Gate Park or by challenging the cold Northern California waves at Ocean Beach\u2014a poignant echo of his Hawaiian youth. While currently single, he maintains a close-knit circle of friends. His dream isn't of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014both for himself in a high-burnout field and for the families he serves. He hopes to one day visit Vietnam with his aging father and to spend more time back home, ensuring the threads of his heritage remain strong."

His father, usually so quiet, was telling a story\u2014not of escaping Vietnam, but of a neighbor sharing their meager rice ration. In that moment, watching his father\u2019s face soften, Kai understood that survival wasn\u2019t just about endurance, but about the quiet threads of community. It planted the seed of wanting to be one of those threads for others.\n\n2.\nHe was fifteen, paddling frantically at Sunset Beach, heart hammering against his ribs. The wave looked like a liquid mountain. For a terrifying second, as the board caught, he was sure it would crush him; then, he was flying. The world\u2019s roar subsided into a perfect, silent glide. It was more than a thrill; it was a lesson in how to find balance amid chaos and respect a power greater than himself\u2014a feeling he now chases in the cold waters of Ocean Beach.\n\n3.\nSix months after the breakup that brought him to San Francisco, he sat alone on the grass in Dolores Park. He felt hollowed out, unmoored from everything he knew. But as he watched the vibrant mix of people around him\u2014a microcosm of the world laughing under the same sun\u2014he didn\u2019t feel lonely. He felt a quiet click of belonging, a sense that *ohana* could be found and built, even thousands of miles from the Pacific he called home. He decided to stay that day.\n\n4.\nIn his mid-thirties, he was working with a transfer student who hadn't spoken in class for months. Kai felt like he was failing. One afternoon, after weeks of just sitting with him in silence, the boy slid a piece of paper across the table. It was a crayon drawing of his family, with a tiny figure labeled \u201cMr. T\u201d standing beside them, smiling. The quiet gratitude in that drawing refueled Kai for years, a powerful shield against the burnout that haunted his field.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a Sunday call, his father\u2019s voice was thin but clear. \u201cThe river in Tr\u00e0 Vinh,\u201d he\u2019d said, unprompted. \u201cI remember the fishing boats at dawn.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a sad memory, but a simple, wanting one. For Kai, hearing that specific detail transformed a vague dream into an urgent promise. That trip was no longer just about visiting a place; it was about bringing his father\u2019s memory home, and in doing so, finally understanding the first chapter of his own story."
