Born in Hayward to a Punjabi immigrant father, an engineer who arrived in the 70s, and a second-generation Chinese-American mother from Oakland, Arjun\u2019s childhood was a blend of langar at the gurdwara and dim sum with his maternal grandparents. This dual heritage taught him early on how to navigate different worlds, a skill that would define his professional life.\n\nA sharp but unmotivated student in his youth, Arjun\u2019s purpose crystallized while watching his grandmother, Po Po, struggle with diabetes. He saw firsthand how language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, and a complex healthcare system created insurmountable obstacles for her. This experience was his turning point, igniting a passion to fix the systemic flaws he witnessed. He pursued a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley, determined to work on solutions that could impact entire communities.\n\nInitially working for a county health department, Arjun grew frustrated with the slow pace of change. He realized technology could scale solutions far more effectively than policy alone. This insight led him to the private sector, where he pivoted to become a Clinical Product Manager. Now, he designs and manages digital health tools for underserved populations, blending his clinical knowledge with tech innovation.\n\nArjun\u2019s life in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Sunset is a measured balance. His 5.5-mile MUNI commute on the N-Judah is a cherished liminal space, perfect for reading public health journals or listening to podcasts. He shares his rent-controlled apartment with his partner, Chloe, a landscape architect whose work with physical space complements his work in the digital realm. Weekends are for hiking Mount Sutro, exploring farmers' markets, and attempting to perfect his family's recipes.\n\nAt 38, Arjun feels a sense of grounded purpose. His core aspiration isn\u2019t a corner office but a proof of concept: to launch a platform that demonstrably improves health outcomes for non-English speaking seniors. He hopes to build a future, perhaps with a family of his own, that is as richly layered and compassionate as his own heritage."

She stared at a new bottle of medication, her brow furrowed in confusion at the English label. Arjun tried to translate the doctor's complex instructions, but his words felt clumsy and inadequate. He saw fear in her eyes, and a hot, helpless anger bloomed in his chest. It wasn't just about language; it was about a system that made his grandmother feel small. That moment planted the seed of his life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nOne foggy afternoon at age nine, his world felt perfectly whole. In the morning, he sat cross-legged on the floor of the gurdwara, his father\u2019s hand guiding his as they served lentils. By afternoon, he was at a loud dim sum parlor, his Po Po expertly plucking a steaming har gow from a cart just for him. He felt no dissonance, only the warm, expansive feeling of belonging to both worlds completely. It taught him that a person could hold multiple truths at once.\n\n3.\nThe epiphany struck him on the N-Judah, rattling through the tunnel toward the Inner Sunset. He was 31, bogged down by a county health report, the ink-and-paper bureaucracy feeling impossibly slow. He looked up, and every single person was absorbed in their phone. The solution wasn\u2019t in his report; it was on those screens. The scale, the access, the intimacy\u2014it was all there. In that moment, the frustration of his government job dissolved into the focused energy that led him to tech.\n\n4.\nOn a weekend hike up Mount Sutro, Arjun complained to Chloe about a clunky user interface he was designing. He felt stuck. She stopped him on the trail and pointed to a faint \"desire path\" worn into the dirt, a shortcut created by hikers ignoring the main trail. \"Build it like that,\" she said. \"The way people actually want to go.\" In her simple observation about physical space, she unlocked his entire digital problem. He felt a profound sense of partnership, of two minds seeing one solution.\n\n5.\nJust last month, in his own kitchen, the scent of sizzling scallions and sesame oil filled the apartment. After years of trying, he\u2019d finally nailed his mother\u2019s pancake recipe\u2014the crispy edges, the chewy layers. It was more than just food. It was a tangible connection to his heritage, a piece of his childhood recreated in the life he was building with Chloe. For a moment, he felt completely grounded, a link in a chain stretching both backward and forward in time."
