Raised in a placid, orderly suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, her path was forged by the unspoken anxieties that permeated her family home. Her father\u2019s stoicism and her mother\u2019s nervous energy created an environment where difficult emotions were ignored, not processed. This silent turmoil fueled her fascination with the human mind, leading her to pursue a Master of Social Work from the University of Michigan.\n\nShe arrived in San Francisco in her late twenties, drawn by the city\u2019s reputation for progressive thought and professional opportunity. Her first decade was a trial by fire at a major downtown hospital, working with acute crises, trauma, and the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations. The work was visceral and rewarding, but the constant exposure to suffering led to profound burnout. The turning point came during the pandemic. As the world shifted to telehealth, Sarah saw a path to a more sustainable practice. She resigned from the hospital, became fully licensed for private practice, and established a telehealth-only service from home.\n\nNow, at 40, her life is contained within a few square miles. Her commute is the ten steps from her kitchen to her small home office. Mornings begin with a run through Golden Gate Park, the fog a familiar, comforting blanket. Her days are a series of virtual sessions, holding space for others\u2019 pain. In the evenings, she consciously disconnects, meeting a close-knit circle of friends\u2014a teacher, a chef, a software engineer\u2014for dinner in Cole Valley or walking to the local cinema.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-based, defined by the produce at the local farmers' market and the familiar faces at her favorite coffee shop. While professionally fulfilled, Sarah quietly yearns for a deeper personal partnership, one built on the emotional honesty she lacked in childhood. Her dream is no longer about changing the world, but about cultivating her own small corner of it, finding a balance where she can heal others without losing herself."
