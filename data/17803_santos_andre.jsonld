A first-generation Filipino-American, his story is deeply woven into the Bay Area's fabric. Raised in Daly City by a nurse mother and a line cook father, Andre grew up amidst the aromas of adobo and the quiet hum of immigrant ambition. While his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a more \u201cstable\u201d career, he was drawn to the kinetic energy of his father\u2019s world\u2014the clatter of pans, the camaraderie of the kitchen staff, the satisfaction of a perfectly executed service.\n\nChoosing Hospitality Management at San Francisco State University was his first major act of independence. He worked his way up the industry ladder with grit and grace: busser, server, sommelier-in-training, and eventually, a management role. The pandemic was his trial by fire. As a newly minted assistant manager, he navigated the brutal pivots to takeout, heartbreaking layoffs, and the slow, arduous process of rebuilding his team and their morale. The experience solidified his leadership and deepened his commitment to creating a sustainable, supportive work environment. It was during this period of uncertainty that he was promoted to General Manager, a testament to his resilience.\n\nToday, Andre\u2019s life is a rhythm of long hours and cherished routines. He lives in the Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose low-key vibe and authentic eateries offer a welcome contrast to his trendy workplace. His 3.5-mile commute on the Muni 5-R is his time to decompress, listening to podcasts about food systems or simply watching the city wake up. His evenings are anchored by his partner, Chloe, a graphic designer he met at a gallery opening. They share a small apartment, a love for walks in Golden Gate Park, and a mutual respect for each other\u2019s creative passions.\n\nAndre\u2019s dream is no longer just to manage, but to own. He envisions a small, intimate restaurant of his own one day\u2014a place that honors his Filipino roots with a modern, Californian sensibility. For now, he finds fulfillment in mentoring his staff and perfecting the nightly performance at Mesa, a proud San Franciscan shaping the city's vibrant culinary scene, one service at a time."

While his mother saw chaos and long hours, Andre saw a dance. His father, usually quiet at home, moved with sharp, focused grace. In that clatter and heat, Andre felt a profound sense of belonging. It wasn\u2019t a backup plan; it was his future calling him, a secret shared between him and the fire, solidifying his path.\n\n2.\nApril 2020. The restaurant was a ghost. As the new assistant manager, he sat across from Maria, a server with two kids, his voice hollow as he explained the furlough. Her quiet tears felt like a personal failure. The weight of that conversation was immense, more real than any profit-and-loss statement. It was the moment he stopped being just a manager and became a steward of his team\u2019s welfare. He vowed then to rebuild something better, something that would never forget the human cost of a crisis.\n\n3.\nIt was late 2021, after a grueling Saturday service\u2014their first at near-full capacity since the closures. Andre was exhausted, wiping down the bar long after the staff left. The owner found him there, simply sliding a new set of keys across the counter. \"It's yours to run now, Andre.\" No grand speech, just quiet trust. The exhaustion was washed away by a wave of profound validation. All the sleepless nights and impossible pivots had been seen. It wasn\u2019t a promotion; it was his arrival.\n\n4.\nThree years ago, dragged to a SoMa gallery opening, he felt entirely out of his element. Then he saw her. Chloe, a graphic designer, wasn't pontificating about art; she was laughing, genuinely amused by a peculiar sculpture. They talked, not about service or covers, but about color and line. For the first time in years, he felt seen for who he was, not what he did. That night reminded him that life existed beyond the restaurant doors, offering a balance and a partner he desperately needed.\n\n5.\nLast fall, on his morning 5-R commute, he watched a woman expertly eat fresh lumpia from a small paper bag, the scent momentarily filling the bus. It was a simple, beautiful act that cut through the noise of his podcast. In that moment, his abstract dream of a restaurant sharpened into a crystalline vision: a place that felt like this. A place that captured the soul of his Filipino heritage not as a fine-dining trend, but as a living, breathing part of the city\u2019s daily fabric."
