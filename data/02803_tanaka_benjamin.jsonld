As a third-generation (Sansei) Japanese-American, his upbringing was a blend of Californian ease and a deep-seated respect for civic duty, inherited from parents who valued stability and community\u2014an engineer father and a librarian mother. Growing up, Ben wasn't fascinated by startups, but by systems: the intricate dance of the VTA light rail, the logic of freeway interchanges, and the social fabric of San Jose's Japantown.\n\nHis path was steady and focused. An undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from UC Davis led to a pivotal study-abroad year in Tokyo. There, witnessing the sublime efficiency of their public transit system, his purpose crystallized. He returned to the Bay Area to earn his Master of Urban Planning from UC Berkeley, determined to untangle the knotted transportation grids of American cities.\n\nThe turning point was landing a job as a Transportation Planner for the City of San Francisco. It was both a career goal and a personal declaration of independence from the South Bay. He deliberately chose a small, modern apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood where the city's pulse is undeniable. His 0.0-mile commute is a core principle; he lives his work, walking to his office near City Hall on in-person days and enjoying a hyper-local existence when working remotely.\n\nBen\u2019s daily routine is ordered. Mornings start with a pour-over coffee from a local cafe, followed by hours immersed in GIS data, traffic flow models, and community feedback reports. He\u2019s the mind behind a new protected bike lane or a rerouted Muni line\u2014small, incremental changes he believes are the bedrock of a more equitable city. His social life, once centered around a long-term relationship that ended last year, is now quieter. He prefers brewery trivia nights with a few close colleagues to loud clubs, or long weekend runs through the Presidio.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is that of a dedicated steward. He feels the city\u2019s frustrations\u2014the stalled streetcars, the budget fights\u2014as personal challenges. Ben\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to one day see a truly seamless, world-class public transit network in the city he now calls home. He hopes to build a life here, one of quiet impact, meaningful connection, and the simple satisfaction of a city that works for everyone."
