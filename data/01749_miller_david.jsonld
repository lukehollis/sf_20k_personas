Raised in a quiet Chicago suburb, he was the son of a pragmatic engineer father and a mother who filled their home with art books and classical music. This blend of structure and aesthetics became his calling. He fled the Midwest for the East Coast, earning a Master of Architecture from a university renowned for its artistic, almost sculptural, approach to design.\n\nHis early career in a prestigious New York firm was formative but creatively stifling. He felt like a cog in a machine building glass boxes. It was the siren song of the late-90s dot-com boom that drew him to San Francisco. He wasn\u2019t after stock options, but the chance to design for a new kind of client\u2014one who valued disruption, creativity, and unconventional living. This move was his defining turning point.\n\nIn San Francisco, David carved out a niche as the go-to architect for galleries, theaters, and private homes for art collectors. He became a Principal at his own boutique firm, known for spaces that didn\u2019t just house art but conversed with it. His success, however, came at a personal cost. A decade-long marriage, strained by his intense focus on his work, ended amicably, leaving him with a cherished but long-distance relationship with his now college-aged daughter.\n\nToday, David lives and works in a sprawling Dogpatch live-work loft, the ultimate expression of his ethos. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom past blueprints and scale models to his studio, where light floods in from massive industrial windows overlooking the bay. His days are a disciplined routine of strong coffee from a local roaster, deep work, and evening walks along the waterfront. Though he values his solitude, he maintains a close circle of friends\u2014artists, gallery owners, and chefs.\n\nAt 51, his ambition has shifted from personal success to legacy. David dreams of designing a landmark public arts center for a San Francisco neighborhood, a permanent gift to the city that allowed him to build his world. He aspires not just to shape the city's skyline, but to create a lasting space for the community and art that define it."

A tourist took a photo of it, but David felt nothing. In that moment, the rigid grid of Manhattan felt like a professional and spiritual cage. The stories his mother told him of rebellious, visionary artists flooded his mind. He realized he didn't just want to leave New York; he needed to escape it. San Francisco wasn't a choice; it was an antidote. This was in 1998.\n\n2.\nIt was for a small gallery in Hayes Valley, nearly 2 AM. He was wrestling with a troublesome interior wall on the scale model. On a whim, he shifted it, and the moonlight from his studio window sliced through the model\u2019s opening, hitting the far wall not as an accident, but as a deliberate brushstroke. A euphoric jolt went through him. He wasn\u2019t just building rooms; he was sculpting with light and void. That night in 2003, he knew he had finally found his architectural voice.\n\n3.\nHis daughter, then seven, sat on the floor of his first SF studio, her own \u201cblueprints\u201d rendered in purple crayon. \"Look, Daddy, a house for my dolls,\" she\u2019d said, holding it up. He remembers nodding, distracted by a looming deadline, the scent of adhesive on his hands. The memory isn\u2019t of her drawing, but of the missed opportunity\u2014the tiny, perfect world she offered him while he was consumed with building his own. It was the first, sharp echo of the personal cost of his ambition.\n\n4.\nIt was the first morning he woke up in his finished Dogpatch loft, a few years after his divorce. He rose not to an alarm, but to the gentle clanging from the shipyard and the cool, patterned light filtering through the massive industrial windows. Walking from his bed, past his drafting table, to the espresso machine was a profound act. This wasn't just a home or a studio; it was the ultimate design project\u2014a life built precisely to his own specifications. A feeling of deep, solitary contentment washed over him.\n\n5.\nHe was on an evening walk through a recently revitalized Mission Bay park about three years ago. He watched a crowd of strangers gather around a public light installation, their faces bathed in its shifting colors. They weren't collectors or critics; just people finding a moment of communal wonder. Designing a perfect home for a client was fulfilling, but creating a permanent space for *that* feeling\u2014for everyone\u2014felt like a legacy. The vague ambition for a public arts center sharpened into a clear, necessary calling."
