Raised in a quiet Chicago suburb, he was the son of a pragmatic engineer father and a mother who filled their home with art books and classical music. This blend of structure and aesthetics became his calling. He fled the Midwest for the East Coast, earning a Master of Architecture from a university renowned for its artistic, almost sculptural, approach to design.\n\nHis early career in a prestigious New York firm was formative but creatively stifling. He felt like a cog in a machine building glass boxes. It was the siren song of the late-90s dot-com boom that drew him to San Francisco. He wasn\u2019t after stock options, but the chance to design for a new kind of client\u2014one who valued disruption, creativity, and unconventional living. This move was his defining turning point.\n\nIn San Francisco, David carved out a niche as the go-to architect for galleries, theaters, and private homes for art collectors. He became a Principal at his own boutique firm, known for spaces that didn\u2019t just house art but conversed with it. His success, however, came at a personal cost. A decade-long marriage, strained by his intense focus on his work, ended amicably, leaving him with a cherished but long-distance relationship with his now college-aged daughter.\n\nToday, David lives and works in a sprawling Dogpatch live-work loft, the ultimate expression of his ethos. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom past blueprints and scale models to his studio, where light floods in from massive industrial windows overlooking the bay. His days are a disciplined routine of strong coffee from a local roaster, deep work, and evening walks along the waterfront. Though he values his solitude, he maintains a close circle of friends\u2014artists, gallery owners, and chefs.\n\nAt 51, his ambition has shifted from personal success to legacy. David dreams of designing a landmark public arts center for a San Francisco neighborhood, a permanent gift to the city that allowed him to build his world. He aspires not just to shape the city's skyline, but to create a lasting space for the community and art that define it."
