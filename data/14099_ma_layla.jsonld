The daughter of a pragmatic Turkish engineer and a meticulous Filipina nurse who met in Los Angeles, Layla grew up in a household where logic and compassion were equally valued. From a young age, she was fascinated not by toys, but by how they were assembled, taking things apart just to understand their systems. This innate curiosity led her to pursue a B.S. and then a Master\u2019s degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering from Cal Poly, where she excelled at optimizing complex processes.\n\nHer career began in the aerospace industry, a predictable and structured world. However, a major turning point came during a company-wide restructuring. While her job was safe, she witnessed the cold, impersonal side of corporate efficiency. Disillusioned, she sought a role where her skills could foster innovation rather than just cut costs. This search led her to San Francisco and its burgeoning high-tech manufacturing sector.\n\nNow 38, Layla is the Operations Director for a company in the Dogpatch that produces custom robotics. She commands her $210,000 salary by orchestrating a symphony of supply chains, automated assembly lines, and human talent. Her 3.5-mile MUNI ride is a cherished ritual\u2014a quiet space to listen to podcasts on sustainable manufacturing before the day\u2019s controlled chaos begins.\n\nLayla lives in a minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, a neighborhood whose blend of grit and artistry appeals to her. Her social life is small but deep, centered around a bi-weekly dinner club with other professional women and a weekend ceramics class\u2014a tactile, imperfect escape from her precise workday. While professionally fulfilled, she dreams of launching her own consultancy focused on helping startups build ethical and sustainable manufacturing practices from the ground up. Personally, she hopes to find a partnership that values quiet evenings and shared ambitions over the city\u2019s frantic social scene, a system built for two that runs on connection, not just efficiency."

He didn't scold her for breaking the toy; instead, he handed her a small, black case of precision screwdrivers. The weight felt serious, a tool, not a toy. In his knowing smile, she felt not just permission, but an anointing. It was the moment she realized her obsession with how things worked wasn't strange\u2014it was a blueprint, a legacy she was meant to follow.\n\n2.\nThe memory of her aerospace mentor, David, still stings. He was a brilliant engineer who was laid off via an impersonal email after 30 years. She recalls watching him pack his schematics and a single sad plant into a cardboard box, his shoulders slumped in defeat. That cold, calculated act of \u201cefficiency\u201d felt like a betrayal of human ingenuity. It was then, at 29, that she vowed her own expertise in systems would be used to build things up, not to tear people down.\n\n3.\nThe first time one of their custom robotics arms powered on was a symphony she conducted. From her place on the Dogpatch factory floor, she watched the complex system she\u2019d designed\u2014from supply chain to final assembly\u2014whir to life. The arm moved through its programmed sequence flawlessly. The team\u2019s collective exhale followed by a spontaneous cheer was more gratifying than any promotion. It was visceral proof, at 35, that she had made the right choice to leave the sterile corporate world for this creative, controlled chaos.\n\n4.\nIn her weekend ceramics class, she once pulled a newly fired bowl from the kiln. It was beautifully imperfect\u2014slightly lopsided, with a single thumbprint permanently baked into the glaze. After a week of managing perfectly calibrated robotic systems, the flaw felt profoundly human. She ran her thumb over the print and felt a wave of relief. This tactile act, which happened just last year, taught her to find joy not just in flawless execution but in the beautiful, tangible evidence of the human hand at work.\n\n5.\nOne rainy Tuesday night, after her dinner club friends had left, she stood by her apartment window, looking down at the slick Hayes Street pavement. The apartment was silent, minimalist, and perfectly ordered\u2014a system she had built for one. But in that quiet, she didn\u2019t feel lonely; she felt a distinct awareness of an empty space. A space for shared silence, for another mind to puzzle things out with. It was then, at 37, that her desire for a partner crystallized\u2014not as a need, but as the next logical, beautiful component to add."
