            "value": "Kaimana Miller\u2019s name tells the story of his two worlds. Born in Hilo to a Native Hawaiian mother who taught traditional dance and a white geologist father from the mainland, his upbringing was a gentle tug-of-war between spirit and science. He spent his childhood learning the names of winds and rains from his mother\u2019s `ohana` (family) while his father taught him about volcanic rock formations. This duality defined him: the power of the ocean in \"Kaimana,\" grounded by the commonness of \"Miller.\"\n\nWhen the family relocated to Oregon for his father\u2019s career, a teenage Kaimana felt adrift. Pressured to follow a practical path, he enrolled in a business program at a community college but found no meaning in it. The concrete maze of marketing principles and accounting felt sterile compared to the vibrant stories of his homeland. After three semesters, feeling lost and disconnected, he dropped out. It wasn't a failure, but a course correction. He spent a year working odd jobs, saving money for a place that felt like a bridge between his two halves. He chose San Francisco.\n\nHe found his calling by accident. Needing work, he answered a \"Help Wanted\" sign at a small, play-based preschool in the Inner Sunset. He discovered an immediate, intuitive connection with the children. Their unvarnished emotions and boundless curiosity resonated with the Hawaiian values of presence and `aloha` (love, compassion) his mother had instilled in him. He was a natural.\n\nNow, at 24, Kaimana\u2019s life is one of intentional simplicity. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small in-law unit behind the preschool, a benefit of the low-paying job. His days are a whirlwind of finger-paints, story time, and mediating toddler disputes. His connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal: the preschool, the dim sum places on Irving Street, and early morning walks to Ocean Beach, where the Pacific\u2019s roar reminds him of home. His social circle is small but deep, consisting mainly of the school\u2019s head teacher and a few other young transplants.\n\nKaimana\u2019s dream is to return to school, this time for a degree in Early Childhood Education. He envisions one day opening his own preschool, one that integrates themes of `m\u0101lama \u02bb\u0101ina`\u2014caring for the land\u2014and brings a piece of Hawaiian soul to the children of this city by the bay."
