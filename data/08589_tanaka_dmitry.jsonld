            "value": "Dmitry Tanaka\u2019s name has always been a conversation starter. Adopted at birth by Kenji and Emiko Tanaka, a second-generation Japanese-American couple in Alameda, Dmitry\u2019s physical appearance\u2014fair skin, light brown hair\u2014reflects his white biological parentage. This juxtaposition of name and appearance became the cornerstone of his identity, fostering a deep-seated empathy for those navigating complex personal narratives. Growing up in a loving home filled with Japanese traditions and American sensibilities taught him early on that family was built on love, not genetics.\n\nThis personal history naturally guided him toward a career in social work. After earning a psychology degree from UC Davis, he enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. The subsequent years were a grueling but formative grind of accumulating the thousands of supervised clinical hours required for licensure. He worked in underfunded community mental health clinics, dealing with cases of profound trauma and systemic failure. A turning point came during the pandemic; seeing the critical need for accessible mental healthcare, he embraced telehealth and saw a path to create a more controlled, sustainable practice for himself and his clients.\n\nNow, as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Dmitry\u2019s commute is zero miles. He lives and works from his cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His days are structured: a morning run through Golden Gate Park, followed by back-to-back telehealth sessions with clients from across California. He purposefully chose the Inner Richmond for its quiet, residential feel and proximity to nature, which provides a necessary buffer from the emotional intensity of his work. He finds solace in the neighborhood\u2019s blend of cultures, which feels like an external reflection of his own internal world.\n\nHe maintains a close relationship with his parents and a tight-knit circle of friends from grad school. While focused on his career, Dmitry dreams of eventually opening a small group practice specializing in therapy for adoptees and transcultural families. He aspires not just to be a therapist, but to build a community resource that honors the complex, beautiful ways families are formed, ensuring others feel as seen and understood as he finally does."
