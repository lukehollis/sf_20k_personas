Born in Cupertino to Taiwanese immigrants, her father was a hardware engineer who rode the first wave of Silicon Valley\u2019s boom, while her mother ran a bustling boba tea shop. Mei-Ling grew up surrounded by the hum of ambition, expected to excel. Resisting the engineering path laid out for her, she moved to San Francisco in the 90s and pursued a Bachelor's in Communications at SF State, drawn to the city's artistic energy over the South Bay\u2019s suburban sprawl.\n\nHer early career was a mosaic of roles at various startups during the dot-com bubble\u2014marketing, office management, whatever was needed. The 2001 crash was her defining turning point. Laid off and disillusioned, she took a junior project coordinator role at a struggling software company. There, she discovered her true talent: translating the chaotic brilliance of engineers into actionable plans. She wasn't a coder, but she spoke their language and could organize their process. It was during this rebuilding period that she met her husband, David Miller, a thoughtful architect who appreciated her pragmatism.\n\nNow 49, Mei-Ling is a senior production manager for a major tech firm, her commute a 0.0-mile walk from her bedroom to her home office in the Inner Richmond. Her days are a disciplined cycle of global video calls, meticulous timeline management, and focused work, punctuated by long, fog-chilled walks through Golden Gate Park to clear her head. Her connection to San Francisco is intimate; she knows the best dim sum spots on Clement Street and cherishes the quiet, residential feel of her neighborhood.\n\nWhile successful, Mei-Ling feels the familiar tech burnout. Her aspirations no longer involve climbing the corporate ladder. She dreams of a second act\u2014perhaps consulting for non-profits or mentoring young women entering the tech industry. She yearns to apply her skills to something with more lasting, tangible impact than the next software release, hoping to produce a more meaningful final chapter for herself."
