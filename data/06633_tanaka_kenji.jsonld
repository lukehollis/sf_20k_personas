A third-generation Japanese-American, he grew up in Daly City, hearing his grandparents' quiet stories of resilience and his engineer father\u2019s lectures on structural integrity. While his father hoped he'd follow him into construction, Kenji was always drawn to the wilder landscapes\u2014the fog-drenched coastline and the towering redwoods of Muir Woods. This pull toward the natural world led him to UC Santa Cruz for his undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies.\n\nHe found his true calling during graduate school at UC Berkeley, where he earned a Master's in Environmental Science & Management. He learned that protecting the environment wasn't just about activism; it was a complex dance of policy, science, and economics. His career began in the field, wearing steel-toed boots to test soil samples at contaminated industrial sites. Now, as a Senior Environmental Consultant, he spends his days translating complex scientific data into actionable strategies for corporations and municipalities, ensuring they comply with environmental regulations.\n\nA key turning point was an early project managing the cleanup of a polluted site in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. Witnessing the direct impact of environmental neglect on a community\u2019s health cemented his professional purpose. He wasn't just analyzing data; he was advocating for healthier communities.\n\nKenji lives in a quiet, book-filled apartment in the Inner Sunset with his partner, Leo, a graphic designer. Since the pandemic shifted his work fully remote, his 0.0-mile commute has deepened his connection to his neighborhood. His days start not with a drive, but with a walk to a local cafe for beans, followed by a jog through the verdant pathways of Golden Gate Park. His home office overlooks a small, meticulously-kept garden of native plants. Evenings are for cooking with Leo, tending to his bonsai trees, and connecting with a small circle of friends, most of whom share his love for hiking and good food.\n\nHis aspiration is to one day lead a major regional restoration project, perhaps reviving the wetlands in the South Bay. For Kenji, San Francisco isn't just a city of innovation and culture; it\u2019s a delicate, interconnected ecosystem he has dedicated his life to understanding and protecting, one policy and one project at a time."
