The daughter of a pragmatic Caucasian carpenter and a vibrant Native Hawaiian/Filipino artist, her world was a fusion of precise angles and expressive forms. While her father taught her to respect the grain of wood in their garage workshop, her mother filled their home with textiles and stories of the islands. This blend of practicality and artistry became the core of her identity.\n\nShe pursued Industrial Design at the California College of the Arts, initially focused on sleek, digital product rendering. A key turning point came during a summer internship at a small design firm. Tasked with creating CAD models, Kailani found herself drawn to the workshop downstairs, fascinated by the hum of 3D printers and the precision of laser cutters. She began staying late, helping the fabrication team bring designs to life. Her manager, noticing her innate talent for turning digital concepts into physical objects, mentored her, shifting her career focus from pure design to the hands-on craft of making.\n\nNow 28, Kailani is a Fabrication Specialist at an innovative manufacturing studio in the Dogpatch. Her daily 4.5-mile MUNI commute from her Inner Richmond apartment is a cherished ritual. It\u2019s her time to sketch in her notebook, listen to design podcasts, and observe the city\u2019s diverse architecture. Her $82,000 salary affords her a comfortable, if not extravagant, life, sharing a classic flat with a close friend. Her social circle is tight-knit, a mix of fellow creatives and friends from her rock-climbing gym.\n\nKailani loves her San Francisco life\u2014the proximity to both urban innovation and the wildness of the coast. She feels a deep connection to the city's legacy of craft and counter-culture. Her dream is to eventually open her own small studio, designing and building sustainable, custom furniture that honors both her father\u2019s woodworking skills and her mother\u2019s artistic heritage. For Kailani, the ultimate goal isn't just to design a beautiful object, but to build a beautiful life, piece by piece."

Her father handed her a small, three-legged stool he\u2019d built, placing a piece of sandpaper in her palm. \"With the grain, Kailani,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. As she followed the wood's natural lines, feeling the surface turn from rough to satin, she felt a profound sense of partnership with the material. It wasn\u2019t just about making an object; it was about honoring its life. That quiet lesson in respect became the foundation of her craft.\n\n2.\nAt thirteen, she sat on the floor, watching her mother weave a lauhala mat, her hands moving with a fluid, ancestral rhythm. Her mother told a story about the Naupaka flower, a blossom torn in half by legend. Kailani saw how the story lived in the pattern, a tangible piece of Hawaii in their East Bay home. It was the first time she understood that an object could hold a narrative, that function could be a vessel for spirit. It planted the seed of imbuing her own work with meaning.\n\n3.\nIt was 2 AM during her internship, the studio silent except for the whir of the laser cutter she was fine-tuning. Frustrated by a flawed CAD model, she\u2019d gone into the workshop and decided to remake the prototype herself. When her manager found her at dawn, holding a perfectly assembled object, he didn't scold her. He smiled. \"You're a builder, Reed.\" That single moment of recognition gave her permission to leave the screen behind and embrace the hands-on work that made her feel whole.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, after a grueling week, she went climbing at Mickey's Beach. Perched on the rock face, with salty wind whipping her hair, she looked across the water at the distant silhouette of the Sutro Tower. She felt the raw power of the coast under her fingertips and the hum of the city across the bay. In that instant, suspended between nature and innovation, she knew this was her home. The city\u2019s duality mirrored her own, and for the first time, she felt truly settled.\n\n5.\nLast spring, rattling along on the T Third line through Dogpatch, she wasn\u2019t listening to her podcast. She was staring at the skeletal remains of an old industrial pier against the sleek new condos. A vision struck her with the force of a jolt: a bench made of reclaimed, weathered wood like her father would use, but with joints of impossibly precise, 3D-printed bronze that mimicked her mother's textile patterns. The commute sketch became the blueprint for her dream, a tangible fusion of her entire identity."
