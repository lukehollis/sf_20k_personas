The son of a meticulous German-American engineer father and a compassionate Filipina nurse mother, he was raised in Berkeley in a home where scientific rigor coexisted with deep empathy. This duality defined his path. He devoured biology texts, fascinated by the intricate machinery of life, a passion that led him to a B.S. at UC Berkeley and ultimately a PhD in Molecular Biology from Stanford.\n\nHis early career was spent in the sterile glow of a biotech lab in South San Francisco, a true believer in the power of pure research. For over a decade, he was a \"man at the bench,\" contributing to foundational research on CRISPR technology. The turning point arrived in his late thirties. During a major project, Rohan realized his true talent wasn't in executing experiments, but in architecting their purpose\u2014connecting the microscopic science to the macroscopic need. He saw the strategy, the market, the human impact.\n\nPivoting from research to strategy felt like a betrayal of his younger self, but it was the right move. He rose quickly, his unique blend of scientific depth and business acumen making him invaluable. Now, as a Senior Director of Life Sciences Strategy, he shapes the future of a major firm from his Mission Bay office.\n\nRohan\u2019s life is anchored in the Duboce Triangle flat he shares with his husband, David, a landscape architect. Their meticulously restored Victorian is their sanctuary. His mornings begin with a run with their terrier, Mendel, in Duboce Park, followed by a crowded N-Judah ride to work, a routine he prefers over the isolation of a car. Evenings are for quiet dinners, industry podcasts, or planning their next hiking trip in Marin.\n\nAt 49, Rohan hopes to leverage his influence to steer his company towards developing more equitable and accessible therapies, a quiet tribute to his mother's nursing ethos. He dreams of an earlier retirement, perhaps mentoring underrepresented students in STEM, ensuring the next generation has a chance to build on the foundations he helped lay."

His father leaned over his shoulder, correcting the scale of the mitochondria with a drafting pencil, explaining its precise function as the cell\u2019s powerhouse. Then his mother placed a hand on his other shoulder, her touch warm. \u201cAnd think, *anak*,\u201d she\u2019d said softly, \u201cof all the people this tiny thing keeps alive.\u201d That moment was the first synthesis of his two worlds: the beautiful machine, and the person it was made for.\n\n2.\nIt was 2 AM in the sterile chill of the South San Francisco lab. Rohan stared at a successful gene-editing result on his monitor, but felt nothing. The victory felt small, abstract. Suddenly, instead of seeing the data, he saw a path\u2014a branching, complex strategy from this single result to a viable therapy, to a patient, to a family. The clarity was terrifying. He understood then that his true talent wasn't in creating the data, but in charting its journey into the world. It was the beginning of his great pivot.\n\n3.\nHis first day as a strategist, he put on a tailored suit that felt like a costume. The wool chafed where a lab coat used to hang comfortably. Walking into the gleaming Mission Bay office, he felt a profound sense of loss, a fraud who had abandoned the noble purity of the bench for spreadsheets and market shares. That deep unease forged his resolve: he would have to prove, mostly to himself, that he could do more for science in the boardroom than he ever could have at the bench.\n\n4.\nHe and David had spent a full Saturday carefully stripping paint from the original Victorian crown molding in their living room. Covered in dust, exhausted, they finally stepped back as the late afternoon sun streamed through the bay window, illuminating the intricate, newly-revealed details. Looking at David\u2019s tired, happy face, Rohan felt a peace that work could never provide. This\u2014building a small, beautiful world together, detail by painstaking detail\u2014was the ultimate, successful experiment. It was the foundation for everything else.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on his morning run in Duboce Park, Mendel chasing a leaf, Rohan paused. An N-Judah train, crowded with morning commuters, rumbled past towards the downtown skyline where his office stood. He saw the faces inside\u2014nurses, teachers, tech workers\u2014and felt a sudden, fierce connection. His work wasn't for a dataset or a quarterly report, but for them. It was a quiet click of purpose, a promise to his mother\u2019s memory, to use his position to serve the people on that train."
