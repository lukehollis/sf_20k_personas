The only child of Cantonese immigrants who ran a small grocery store, she grew up surrounded by the unspoken pressures of filial piety and the American dream. Her parents envisioned a prestigious, stable future for her\u2014a doctor or an engineer\u2014a tangible return on their sacrifice. But Mei was a quiet observer, more attuned to the hushed struggles of her community, particularly the silent melancholy that settled over her own uncle after he lost his job, an ailment dismissed by the family as simple weakness.\n\nThis experience became her compass. Defying her parents' wishes, she enrolled in the Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University. The decision caused a painful rift, particularly with her father, who saw her choice as a rejection of their values. The path to becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) was long and demanding, filled with challenging rotations in city hospitals, but it solidified her purpose. She was giving voice to the suffering her family had refused to name.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a crucible. As a hospital social worker, Mei guided terrified families through loss and uncertainty, her calm presence a lifeline in the chaos. The crisis normalized telehealth, which led to her current role. Now, she works from her tidy Mission Bay condo, her commute a ten-step walk from her kitchen to her home office. Her patients, many of them elderly or medically fragile, appear as faces in a digital window, yet she fosters a connection just as profound.\n\nHer days are structured by these virtual sessions. In between, she walks her rescue shiba inu, Mochi, along the waterfront, a starkly modern landscape compared to her childhood streets. The relationship with her parents has slowly mended, their pride finally outweighing their initial disappointment. At 40, she is single after a long-term relationship ended years ago, finding fulfillment in a tight-knit circle of friends and her quietly revolutionary work. Her dream is to one day open a small private practice dedicated to serving the AAPI community, creating a space where cultural understanding is the foundation of healing. For Mei, this isn't just a career; it's a way of healing her city, one conversation at a time."
