Born and raised in the foggy expanse of the Sunset District, he was the quiet, dutiful son of Hong Kong immigrants. His parents, who ran a bustling dim sum restaurant, pinned their hopes on him, envisioning a future in tech or finance\u2014a life far removed from the grueling hours of the service industry.\n\nHe followed the prescribed path, enrolling in a business program at San Francisco State University. However, the theory felt hollow, and Ethan found himself more engaged by the city's pulse than his textbooks. The turning point came during his sophomore year when his father\u2019s health declined, placing immense financial strain on the family. Dropping out wasn\u2019t a dramatic decision, but a quiet necessity. He took the first full-time job he could find: a night auditor at a boutique hotel near Union Square.\n\nTo his surprise, Ethan thrived. The chaotic symphony of late check-ins, misplaced luggage, and eccentric guests was a puzzle he was naturally gifted at solving. His calm demeanor and sharp efficiency earned him a promotion to Front Desk Supervisor within two years. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development; to save aggressively and gain a sliver of independence, he moved into a small, subsidized staff room in the hotel.\n\nHis life exists in a strange, liminal space. He wakes up already at work, his social circle consisting mainly of colleagues he shares late-night meals with. He feels a disconnect from the city he grew up in; the Sunset feels a world away from his contained, downtown existence.\n\nEthan\u2019s primary dream is simple: to save enough for a deposit on his own apartment, perhaps in Hayes Valley or the Mission, and to finally feel like a true resident of his city again. Beyond that, he wrestles with whether hospitality is a long-term career or a temporary harbor. He hopes to one day show his parents that success can be measured not by a degree, but by the stability and quiet competence he has built for himself, one seamless guest check-in at a time."
