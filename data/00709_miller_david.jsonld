The son of a stoic engineer and a socially-focused mother, his childhood home was a place of material comfort but emotional scarcity. The real turning point came in his late teens when his younger sister developed a severe anxiety disorder. Watching his parents react with a mixture of confusion and dismissal, David felt a profound sense of helplessness that ignited a lifelong mission: he would learn the language of the human mind that his family could not speak.\n\nHe pursued psychology at a state university before making the deliberate move to the West Coast for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area\u2019s culture of open dialogue and emotional intelligence was a balm to his soul. After graduating, David began his career at a large Kaiser Permanente facility, navigating the demanding, high-caseload world of hospital social work. While rewarding, the bureaucratic grind wore on him. The pandemic-driven shift to telehealth was an unexpected revelation, offering a path to a more controlled and personalized practice.\n\nToday, David runs his own private practice entirely from his cozy apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen to a small, sound-proofed home office. His days are structured by back-to-back telehealth sessions, where he provides a calm, anchoring presence for clients grappling with everything from tech burnout to chronic illness. To decompress from the \"secondary trauma\" of his work, he runs. Long, meditative jogs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park are his non-negotiable form of therapy.\n\nHis life is anchored by his partner, Maya, a UX designer, and a small circle of close friends from his grad school cohort. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused; he loves the quiet streets, the local grocers, and the easy access to the ocean. His dream is not of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014to one day open a small group practice with a colleague, specializing in grief and loss, creating a space of healing that feels less clinical and more human."

His mother dismissed it as \u201cdrama\u201d while his father stayed silent behind a newspaper. Kneeling on the cold linoleum, David felt an invisible wall between his family and her palpable terror. He was powerless. In that suffocating silence, a vow formed: he would learn the language for this pain, a vocabulary of care that his own house lacked. This moment wasn\u2019t a choice; it was a directive.\n\n2.\nDuring a family systems seminar at Berkeley, a classmate shared a story of her parents\u2019 divorce with a vulnerability David had never witnessed. The room didn\u2019t recoil; it listened. The professor validated the raw emotion with academic grace. David felt a profound, physical sense of relief, as if a tightly coiled spring inside him had finally been released. He wasn't just in the right city; he was among his people, finally learning to speak his native tongue.\n\n3.\nHe remembers the harsh fluorescent lights of the Kaiser hallway. He\u2019d just delivered difficult news to a family, following protocol perfectly, but the son\u2019s hollowed-out expression haunted him. Later, sitting in his car, he realized he was just another cog in an overwhelmed system, his empathy a resource being depleted. It wasn't burnout; it was a slow erasure of self. That day, the abstract idea of a private practice became a concrete plan for survival.\n\n4.\nHis first few months of telehealth were heavy with inherited trauma. One afternoon, he ran into Golden Gate Park, straight into a wall of fog. The damp quiet absorbed the city's noise, leaving only his footfalls and ragged breath. He wasn't running from anything, but *through* it, metabolizing a client's story of loss. When he emerged from the eucalyptus grove, the weight on his chest had lifted with the mist. That run cemented the park as his sanctuary.\n\n5.\nHe closed his laptop after a session on grief and walked into the living room. His partner, Maya, was sketching at the table. She looked up, and without him saying a word, she simply asked, \"Tough one?\" He nodded. She reached out and squeezed his hand, a small, solid anchor in the quiet of their apartment. That simple, shared moment of attunement was everything. It was the calm he offered his clients and the peace he had finally built for himself."
