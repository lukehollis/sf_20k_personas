The son of a stoic engineer and a socially-focused mother, his childhood home was a place of material comfort but emotional scarcity. The real turning point came in his late teens when his younger sister developed a severe anxiety disorder. Watching his parents react with a mixture of confusion and dismissal, David felt a profound sense of helplessness that ignited a lifelong mission: he would learn the language of the human mind that his family could not speak.\n\nHe pursued psychology at a state university before making the deliberate move to the West Coast for his Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area\u2019s culture of open dialogue and emotional intelligence was a balm to his soul. After graduating, David began his career at a large Kaiser Permanente facility, navigating the demanding, high-caseload world of hospital social work. While rewarding, the bureaucratic grind wore on him. The pandemic-driven shift to telehealth was an unexpected revelation, offering a path to a more controlled and personalized practice.\n\nToday, David runs his own private practice entirely from his cozy apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his kitchen to a small, sound-proofed home office. His days are structured by back-to-back telehealth sessions, where he provides a calm, anchoring presence for clients grappling with everything from tech burnout to chronic illness. To decompress from the \"secondary trauma\" of his work, he runs. Long, meditative jogs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park are his non-negotiable form of therapy.\n\nHis life is anchored by his partner, Maya, a UX designer, and a small circle of close friends from his grad school cohort. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and neighborhood-focused; he loves the quiet streets, the local grocers, and the easy access to the ocean. His dream is not of wealth, but of sustainability\u2014to one day open a small group practice with a colleague, specializing in grief and loss, creating a space of healing that feels less clinical and more human."
