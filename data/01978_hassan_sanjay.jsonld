The son of Pakistani immigrants who arrived from Karachi in the early 1970s, he was raised on his father\u2019s engineering pragmatism and his mother\u2019s deep commitment to community service through their local mosque. Dutifully, Sanjay pursued a computer science degree at UC Berkeley and rode the wave of the first dot-com boom. For a few years, he coded in sterile Silicon Valley offices, earning a salary that felt both immense and meaningless.\n\nThe crash of 2001 was his liberation. Disenchanted with the hollow pursuit of stock options, he felt a deeper calling, one amplified by the suspicion and fear cast upon his community post-9/11. He saw a need for bridges, not firewalls. This revelation led him to enroll at San Francisco State University, where he earned a Master of Public Administration. He traded a six-figure salary for an entry-level caseworker position at a refugee resettlement agency, a decision his parents met with loving confusion.\n\nOver two decades, Sanjay poured his life into his work, rising to become the Program Director for a non-profit that helps newcomers navigate the bewildering landscape of the Bay Area. His key turning point wasn't a promotion, but meeting his partner, David, a landscape architect, at a community garden volunteer day. Their quiet, stable partnership is the bedrock of his life.\n\nNow, at 50, Sanjay\u2019s world is contained within his Inner Richmond neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the home office in his classic Edwardian flat. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, grant proposals, and virtual check-ins with families from Afghanistan to Ukraine. He breaks for walks along Clement Street, grabbing pho or dim sum, and ends most days with a stroll through Golden Gate Park with David. He loves the city's chaotic diversity but is pained by its stark inequities. His dream is to secure funding for a permanent, comprehensive welcome center for all immigrants arriving in San Francisco, a true sanctuary. He hopes to one day leave a legacy not of code, but of compassionate community building."

The stock ticker on a news channel scrolled by, a stream of red arrows. Instead of despair, he felt an unexpected lightness, a deep, cleansing breath after holding it for years. The code on his screen looked like a foreign language he no longer wanted to speak. It wasn't an ending; it was the unlocking of a door he didn't know was there.\n\n2.\nA few months after the towers fell, he sat in his parents\u2019 Fremont living room, listening to his father on the phone. He heard the careful, measured tone his dad used, the patient way he assured a relative they were safe. Sanjay saw the quiet weight settle on his father's shoulders, the burden of representing an entire faith to wary neighbors. In that moment, the abstract idea of \"community\" became a fierce, protective instinct. He knew then he had to build bridges for a living, not firewalls.\n\n3.\nIt was a foggy Saturday at the Fort Mason community garden. He was hopelessly wrestling with a stubborn patch of weeds when a kind voice explained the root system. He looked up at David, hands caked in rich soil, a smudge of dirt on his cheek. The conversation flowed so easily, from native plants to the perfect burrito. Walking home, Sanjay realized it was the first time in months he hadn't thought about a grant proposal. He felt a quiet, grounding calm, like a seed finally taking root in good soil.\n\n4.\nHe\u2019ll never forget handing the keys to a small apartment in the Mission to the Alami family from Herat, around 2015. The father\u2019s eyes welled as he clutched them, the first keys to their own home in America. The youngest daughter, barely six, shyly gave him a crayon drawing of a smiling sun over the Golden Gate Bridge. That flimsy piece of paper felt heavier and more valuable than any stock certificate he\u2019d ever owned. It was the moment he knew his parents\u2019 loving confusion about his career had been worth it.\n\n5.\nLast spring, walking with David near Spreckels Lake, he saw a family huddled over a phone map, their conversation a mix of Ukrainian and gestures. They looked overwhelmed but determined. He felt a familiar pang\u2014pride in their courage and anger at the city's fragmented welcome. He stopped, squeezed David\u2019s hand, and said aloud for the first time, \"I'm going to build that welcome center. A real sanctuary.\" It was no longer a vague hope, but a declaration, as solid as the cypress trees around them."
