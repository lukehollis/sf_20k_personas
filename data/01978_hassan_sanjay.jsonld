The son of Pakistani immigrants who arrived from Karachi in the early 1970s, he was raised on his father\u2019s engineering pragmatism and his mother\u2019s deep commitment to community service through their local mosque. Dutifully, Sanjay pursued a computer science degree at UC Berkeley and rode the wave of the first dot-com boom. For a few years, he coded in sterile Silicon Valley offices, earning a salary that felt both immense and meaningless.\n\nThe crash of 2001 was his liberation. Disenchanted with the hollow pursuit of stock options, he felt a deeper calling, one amplified by the suspicion and fear cast upon his community post-9/11. He saw a need for bridges, not firewalls. This revelation led him to enroll at San Francisco State University, where he earned a Master of Public Administration. He traded a six-figure salary for an entry-level caseworker position at a refugee resettlement agency, a decision his parents met with loving confusion.\n\nOver two decades, Sanjay poured his life into his work, rising to become the Program Director for a non-profit that helps newcomers navigate the bewildering landscape of the Bay Area. His key turning point wasn't a promotion, but meeting his partner, David, a landscape architect, at a community garden volunteer day. Their quiet, stable partnership is the bedrock of his life.\n\nNow, at 50, Sanjay\u2019s world is contained within his Inner Richmond neighborhood. His 0.0-mile commute is a walk from his bedroom to the home office in his classic Edwardian flat. His days are a marathon of Zoom calls, grant proposals, and virtual check-ins with families from Afghanistan to Ukraine. He breaks for walks along Clement Street, grabbing pho or dim sum, and ends most days with a stroll through Golden Gate Park with David. He loves the city's chaotic diversity but is pained by its stark inequities. His dream is to secure funding for a permanent, comprehensive welcome center for all immigrants arriving in San Francisco, a true sanctuary. He hopes to one day leave a legacy not of code, but of compassionate community building."
