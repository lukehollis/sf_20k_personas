Born in San Jose to an Indian engineer father and a white, second-generation Russian-American mother, Natasha\u2019s childhood was a blend of pragmatic ambition and soulful melancholy. The family\u2019s central, unspoken axis was her younger brother\u2019s chronic juvenile arthritis. Watching her parents navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system, fighting for care and dignity, planted the seed for her future.\n\nShe pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Davis before earning her Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. Her early career was a baptism by fire in the chaotic environment of UCSF Medical Center, where she worked with patients and families grappling with sudden, life-altering diagnoses. The work was grueling and emotionally taxing, and for years, she felt on the verge of burnout.\n\nThe shift to mandatory telehealth during the pandemic was an unexpected turning point. The frantic pace of hospital corridors was replaced by focused, one-on-one virtual sessions. She found she could connect more deeply with her clients without the institutional clangor, offering a calmer, more stable presence. After the crisis waned, she made a pivotal decision: she resigned from the hospital and accepted a fully remote position with a large healthcare provider, officially making her commute zero miles.\n\nToday, Natasha\u2019s life has a quiet rhythm. Her mornings begin with a walk through the fog in Golden Gate Park, listening to a podcast before returning to her apartment. Her workday is a series of faces on a screen\u2014people from across the Bay Area whom she guides through illness, grief, and fear from her sunlit home office. She is a familiar face at the local bakery on Irving Street and knows the names of the staff at her branch library. Having divorced in her late thirties, she has cultivated a rich life centered on a few close friendships and her own well-being. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; it is one of sustainability. She hopes to eventually open a small private practice, specializing in supporting the very caregivers she saw her parents become, bringing her life\u2019s story full circle."
