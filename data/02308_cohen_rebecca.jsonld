Her fondest childhood memories weren't of career fairs, but of the aromatic steam in her grandmother\u2019s kitchen, where brisket and kugel were expressions of love. Heeding her parents' advice, she moved west to attend UC Berkeley, earning a practical Bachelor's degree in Communications that funneled her directly into San Francisco's booming tech marketing scene.\n\nFor over a decade, Rebecca excelled, climbing the corporate ladder and living a life that looked perfect on paper. But by her mid-thirties, a quiet dissatisfaction had simmered to a boil. The turning point was a difficult divorce, an event that stripped away her carefully constructed identity and forced a confrontation with her own unhappiness. In the solitary quiet of her apartment, she returned to her grandmother\u2019s recipes, finding solace and control in the methodical process of cooking.\n\nThis rediscovery sparked a quiet rebellion. At 38, Rebecca cashed out her tech stocks, enrolled in night classes at a local culinary institute, and took a humbling job as a line cook. She spent five years honing her craft, saving fiercely, and drafting a business plan that married her old marketing acumen with her new passion.\n\nToday, at 46, Rebecca is the owner and head chef of \"Rose & Rye,\" a small, celebrated eatery in Hayes Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from her cozy one-bedroom apartment to the kitchen\u2019s welcoming cacophony. Her menu is a modern love letter to her Ashkenazi roots, infused with California seasonality. Her days are a blur of pre-dawn market runs, staff management, and the fiery dance of dinner service. Her social life is woven into the fabric of her restaurant; regulars have become friends, and her staff is a second family. San Francisco isn't just her home; it\u2019s the city that provided the ingredients for her second act. Her dream isn't expansion, but perfection\u2014to create a space so warm and nourishing that it feels like coming home, not just for her customers, but for herself."
