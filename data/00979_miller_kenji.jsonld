The son of a Japanese immigrant mother and a second-generation Irish-American father, he grew up in a quiet, homogenous Ohio suburb where his name and features were a constant source of curiosity. He spent his youth feeling like a cultural translator in his own home, navigating the stoic deference of his mother and the boisterous affection of his father\u2019s family. This constant code-switching left him feeling slightly detached, an observer in his own life, which stoked in him a deep well of empathy for others who felt like outsiders.\n\nHis path wasn't linear. After high school, he drifted, working odd jobs and feeling aimless until a profound bout of anxiety in his early twenties led him to therapy. The experience was transformative; for the first time, someone helped him articulate the dissonance he\u2019d always felt. This was his turning point. He enrolled in a state college, then pursued a Master of Social Work at San Francisco State University, drawn by the city\u2019s promise of acceptance and diversity.\n\nNow 46, Kenji is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who runs a private practice from a converted office in his Hayes Valley apartment, making his commute a few simple steps. His days are structured and quiet, beginning with matcha tea and meditation before a schedule of telehealth appointments with clients grappling with anxiety, trauma, and identity issues. He specializes in helping young adults navigate complex family dynamics, a direct reflection of his own upbringing.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is profound. In the city\u2019s vibrant mosaic, he finally felt whole, not a collection of disparate parts. He loves the anonymity of walking through the bustling Mission and the calm of Golden Gate Park. His social life is small but deep, consisting of a few close friends, mostly fellow therapists, with whom he shares dinners and dissects the human condition. While professionally fulfilled, he nurses a quiet hope of finding a long-term partner. His ultimate dream is to establish a non-profit providing accessible mental health services to biracial and multicultural youth, creating the sanctuary for them that he had to build for himself."
