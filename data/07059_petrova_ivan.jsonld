Born in Vladivostok, Russia, to a Filipino family that had settled there two generations prior, Ivan grew up speaking Russian and celebrating a unique blend of Orthodox and Catholic traditions. His great-grandfather, a sailor from Cebu, had put down roots in the port city, creating a lineage that was neither fully Russian nor traditionally Filipino. Ivan took his mother\u2019s surname, Petrova, a fierce single parent who taught him resilience and the importance of honoring one's matriarchal line.\n\nTheir world was upended when they immigrated to the United States when Ivan was 15, settling near family in Daly City. The transition was jarring. In Russia, he was the Filipino boy; in America, with his Slavic first name, he was an enigma. He completed his high school equivalency while navigating a new language and culture, feeling perpetually on the outside. He found stability not in higher education, which felt like another mountain to climb, but in the quiet order of administrative work.\n\nA key turning point was his mother\u2019s passing five years ago. The loss anchored him in his solitude but also freed him to define his own identity. He moved from the suburbs into a small, rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. The neighborhood, with its Russian bakeries and Chinese grocery stores, felt like a microcosm of his own mixed heritage. His job as an office clerk is now fully remote, meaning his 0.0-mile commute confines him to the quiet world of his apartment.\n\nIvan\u2019s days follow a placid rhythm: coffee, logging into the corporate system, processing digital paperwork, and logging out. He is not lonely, but he is solitary. His social connections are few, maintained through carefully worded emails and occasional calls with a cousin. His primary connection to San Francisco is tactile and sensory\u2014the damp fog rolling down his street, the scent of eucalyptus during his long, contemplative walks through Golden Gate Park.\n\nNow 29, Ivan\u2019s ambitions are internal. He dreams of piecing together his fractured history. He\u2019s slowly teaching himself Tagalog through online apps and has started a savings account with a single goal: to one day take a trip that will trace his family\u2019s journey in reverse, from San Francisco back to Vladivostok, and finally, to the shores of Cebu."
