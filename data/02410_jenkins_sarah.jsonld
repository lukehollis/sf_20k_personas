Raised in suburban Ohio, she grew up in a household governed by a well-meaning but profound emotional austerity. Love was expressed through provision, not words, leaving Sarah with a deep curiosity about the unspoken currents that shape family dynamics. She pursued an undergraduate degree in psychology before making a deliberate break, moving to California for its sun-drenched promise of reinvention and a Master's degree in Counseling Psychology.\n\nHer early career was spent in a small practice near the Financial District, but the most significant turning point wasn\u2019t professional\u2014it was personal. At 38, her own twelve-year marriage ended. The experience was painful, but it became a crucible for her work. Instead of feeling like a failure, Sarah discovered a new depth of empathy. She understood the intricate grief of uncoupling and the quiet courage it takes to rebuild. This personal wound became her professional superpower, allowing her to connect with clients on a level of authentic, shared humanity.\n\nToday, at 48, Sarah\u2019s life is centered in her serene Noe Valley flat, where a converted guest room serves as her office. The pandemic prompted her to shift to a fully remote practice, and the 0.0-mile commute has been quietly revolutionary. Her days are structured by the digital chime of telehealth appointments, where she guides couples and individuals through their most vulnerable moments. She breaks up her schedule with rituals: a morning walk to a local bakery for coffee and a strict 6 p.m. shutdown, followed by a long walk through the neighborhood to decompress, admiring the familiar Victorian facades as the fog rolls in.\n\nDivorced for a decade, Sarah maintains a close circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow therapists and artists\u2014and dates casually, finding contentment in her own company. Her deepest aspiration is to distill her professional and personal experience into a book about navigating relationship shifts in mid-life. For Sarah, San Francisco is not just a home; it's the place that gave her the space to deconstruct her past and consciously design a life, and a practice, built on the foundations of empathy and self-awareness."
