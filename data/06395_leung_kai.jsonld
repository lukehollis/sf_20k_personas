Born and raised in the apartment above his family\u2019s small shop, the sounds of Clement Street are the soundtrack to his life. His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, poured their life savings into \"Leung\u2019s Sundries,\" a cluttered but beloved variety store that sold everything from kitchenware to stationery. Kai grew up bagging groceries and stocking shelves, a quiet observer of the neighborhood\u2019s ebb and flow.\n\nHis one act of rebellion was enrolling in a Graphic Design program at SF State. For two years, he felt the thrill of a separate identity, sketching logos in crowded cafes and dreaming of a life beyond the shop\u2019s awning. That dream was cut short when his father had a serious heart attack. Without discussion, Kai dropped out of college to run the store, assuring his parents it was temporary. It never was.\n\nAfter his parents retired to a quieter life in Daly City, Kai faced a turning point. He could either keep the dusty, dated shop as a shrine to his parents\u2019 hard work or make it his own. He chose the latter. Over a year, he painstakingly renovated the space, using his dormant design skills to transform it into \u201cThe Commonplace,\u201d a curated home goods and lifestyle boutique.\n\nNow 37, Kai\u2019s commute is a walk down a single flight of stairs. His days are a quiet ritual of brewing coffee, meticulously arranging Japanese ceramics and local artisan goods, and chatting with regulars. He is a fixture, known for his calm demeanor and impeccable taste. His social life is limited to weekly dim sum with a few high school friends and conversations across his counter. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his unwavering dedication to the business.\n\nKai harbors a quiet dream of traveling, of seeing the world his parents left behind, but on his own terms. He stares out his shop window, watching the fog roll in, and wonders if one day he\u2019ll be able to hire a manager and finally take a trip that lasts longer than a weekend. He is a man who chose duty over desire, and now works to find a measure of personal fulfillment within the life he inherited."
