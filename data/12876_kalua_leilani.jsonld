Raised in a working-class Pearl City neighborhood on O\u02bbahu, she watched her father, a union dockworker, and her mother, a hotel maid, pour their energy into providing for their family and neighbors. They instilled in her the belief that one\u2019s purpose was to lift up others.\n\nSeeking broader horizons, Leilani moved to the mainland for college, earning a bachelor\u2019s in Public Administration from the University of San Francisco. The initial culture shock was immense, trading the warm Pacific for the city\u2019s fog-laced hills. But in the vibrant, multicultural neighborhoods of SF, she found a different kind of *\u02bbohana*\u2014a chosen family united by shared struggles and aspirations.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of city-funded nonprofits. A key turning point was the first dot-com boom of the late 90s. As a program coordinator, she witnessed families she had helped stabilize get priced out of their homes in the Mission District, their community irrevocably altered. The experience hardened her resolve, transforming her job into a calling. She steadily climbed the ranks, her quiet competence and fierce advocacy earning her the position of Director of Community Programs at a prominent management consulting firm's social impact division.\n\nToday, Leilani lives in a rent-controlled apartment in Hayes Valley, a sanctuary filled with plants and photos of her family in Hawai\u02bbi. Her daily routine begins with a ride on the 21-Hayes Muni bus to her downtown office, where she oversees grants and partnerships that support housing security and youth development. Though single, she is never lonely; her life is rich with connections forged over decades. She is the beloved \"Auntie Lani\" to her junior colleagues and a fixture at neighborhood meetings.\n\nHer love for San Francisco is fierce and protective. She sees both its glittering potential and the inequities hiding in its shadows. Leilani\u2019s dream isn\u2019t of retirement on a distant beach, but of legacy. She aspires to mentor a new generation of diverse community leaders, ensuring that the fight for the city's soul\u2014a place of compassion and opportunity for all\u2014will continue long after she has passed the torch."

Standing atop Lone Mountain, she couldn\u2019t see the ocean, only a thick blanket of fog swallowing the city. It felt like a rejection. In that profound chill, a homesickness for O\u02bbahu\u2019s warmth washed over her. It was the moment she understood that to survive here, she\u2019d have to build her own warmth\u2014her own *\u02bbohana*\u2014from the community around her. This place would not give it freely.\n\n2.\nThe smell of cardboard and Do\u00f1a Vargas\u2019s tears is seared into her memory. It was 1998, and Leilani was helping the family pack their Mission flat after a no-fault eviction. Their son, a boy she\u2019d helped get into an after-school art program, quietly drew their building on a box flap. Watching their lives get boxed up, her quiet compassion hardened into a cold, sharp anger. It was no longer a job; it was a fight. *Kuleana* now meant holding the line.\n\n3.\nYears before she managed million-dollar grants, she spent a month petitioning Muni to add a stop near a Tenderloin youth center. The day it went into effect, she rode the bus route just to hear it. When the automated voice announced the new stop, her heart swelled. It was a small thing\u2014a few lines of code, a new sign\u2014but for the kids who no longer had to walk four extra blocks, it was safety. It was the first time San Francisco truly felt like *her* responsibility.\n\n4.\nA new intern, barely out of college and overwhelmed by the city\u2019s pace, once hesitated by her office door, close to tears. Leilani closed her laptop and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d Over an hour, she didn\u2019t give solutions; she just listened. As the young woman left, visibly lighter, Leilani felt a profound shift. She wasn\u2019t just a director; she was an Auntie. The torch wasn\u2019t something to be passed in the future\u2014she was already carrying it, offering its light.\n\n5.\nJust last week, riding the 21-Hayes home, she watched the city slide by. A gleaming new building reflected the Painted Ladies of Alamo Square, while a man pushed a shopping cart full of his life past an outdoor caf\u00e9. The sight didn't spark despair, but a familiar, weary resolve. This tension *was* her San Francisco. The place she was bound to. *Kuleana*, she thought, wasn\u2019t a task to be finished, but a current to swim in, every single day."
