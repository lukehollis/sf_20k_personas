Born Santiago Reyes to immigrant parents from Oaxaca, he was adopted as an infant by a warm, boisterous Irish-American couple in Sacramento. His upbringing was a loving blend of cultures: his adoptive father's union politics and boisterous family gatherings mixed with a deep, personal curiosity about the Mexican heritage he knew only through books and neighborhood taquerias. This duality fostered in him a unique perspective, a constant awareness of different, overlapping systems.\n\nHis path to technology was indirect. Fascinated by the logical grid of his suburban city, he first pursued civil engineering at UC Davis. However, he found the work too detached from human experience. A pivotal summer internship with Sacramento Regional Transit revealed his true passion: the complex, often inequitable ballet of urban movement. This led him to a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA, where he focused on the intersection of public transit and emerging technologies. He saw how data could either reinforce or dismantle systemic barriers.\n\nRecruited by a major tech firm, Sean moved to San Francisco eight years ago. His role as a Senior Transportation Planner involves analyzing vast datasets to optimize autonomous vehicle routes and on-demand transit services. The 0.0-mile commute from his Hayes Valley apartment is an irony he\u2019s keenly aware of; he spends his days digitally mapping a city he navigates physically with deliberate intention. His routine involves focused work sprints followed by long walks, observing traffic flows and pedestrian desire lines with a planner\u2019s critical eye.\n\nSocially, Sean maintains a tight-knit circle, including his long-term partner, a landscape architect named Marcus, and friends from both the tech world and his local neighborhood association. His connection to the city is profound; he sees it as a living organism he is both studying and serving. His ultimate dream is to lead a public-private partnership that develops a truly equitable, sustainable transportation system for the Bay Area, one that honors the needs of communities like the one his birth parents came from. He aspires to be more than an optimizer of algorithms; he wants to be a builder of connections."

His adoptive uncle, red-faced and joyful, slung an arm around him and boomed, \u201cSean O\u2019Malley, the best damn Irishman from Oaxaca we know!\u201d Laughter filled the Sacramento kitchen. It wasn\u2019t malicious, but in that moment, Sean felt the two halves of his story crystallize into a single, complex identity. It wasn\u2019t a conflict to be solved, but a truth to be lived. This quiet realization set him on a path to understand both worlds, not just one.\n\n***\n\n2.\nThe pivotal moment wasn\u2019t in a UC Davis lecture hall, but on Sacramento's Route 51 bus during his summer internship. He watched an elderly woman, her arms laden with groceries, miss her connecting bus by mere seconds. He saw the map in his head\u2014the efficient grid\u2014and then the reality: her forty-five-minute wait in the oppressive summer heat. A profound, angry empathy surged through him. It was then he knew he couldn\u2019t just design streets; he had to design systems that served the people who depended on them.\n\n***\n\n3.\nMonths after moving to San Francisco, he took a solo walk to the top of Corona Heights Park at dusk. As the sky bled from orange to indigo, he watched the city\u2019s circulatory system come alive below: the river of headlights on Market Street, the slow crawl of a MUNI bus, the scattered lights of homes. It wasn\u2019t just data on a screen anymore. It was a living, breathing, beautifully imperfect organism. He felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility, a solemn promise to tend to it carefully.\n\n***\n\n4.\nHe and Marcus were sitting on a bench in Patricia\u2019s Green, watching the Friday evening crowd. Marcus, a landscape architect, pointed out how a new bed of salvias subtly redirected foot traffic, creating a more peaceful corner. Sean saw it instantly: a physical manifestation of the digital desire lines he analyzed all day. In that shared observation, he felt seen. Their love wasn't just romantic; it was a shared lens for viewing and caring for the urban world they both inhabited and shaped.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast year, while walking through the Mission, he overheard two women chatting in Spanish about the two buses and 70 minutes it took to get to a caregiving job in the Richmond. The sound of their language, the echo of a life his birth parents might have known, collided with the sleek, autonomous shuttle simulations on his work laptop. A sharp pang of purpose hit him. His work wasn't about optimizing for the privileged, but about bridging the exact gap those women faced every single day."
