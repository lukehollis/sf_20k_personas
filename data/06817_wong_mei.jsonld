Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to her success; she lives and works in the same sleek tower, a world away from her childhood in the Richmond District.\n\nMei was raised amidst the fragrant chaos of her parents' small grocery store on Clement Street. The daughter of hardworking immigrants, she grew up watching them tally accounts on an abacus, their hands calloused from work. They hoped she would pursue a stable, practical career, which is why her choice to study Art History at UC Berkeley felt like a quiet rebellion. She craved beauty and narrative, not just balance sheets.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis was her great pivot. Working in a small art gallery, she saw how quickly passion projects crumbled. Seeking stability and control, she pivoted to the most tangible asset she knew: property. She earned her real estate license and entered the cutthroat world of commercial finance, a field dominated by men who saw her as an anomaly. But her Art History degree became her secret weapon. She didn't just sell square footage; she sold stories, connecting a building\u2019s architectural heritage to a client\u2019s brand identity. This unique perspective helped her close landmark deals, earning her a reputation for both shrewdness and sophistication.\n\nNow 50, Mei\u2019s life is a curated masterpiece of discipline. Her days begin before dawn with a workout in the building\u2019s gym overlooking the Bay Bridge, followed by a relentless schedule of calls and negotiations from her minimalist home office. Her personal life is sparse; a long-ago divorce taught her to compartmentalize, and her most enduring relationships are with a handful of powerful clients and mentors. She maintains a respectful, if distant, relationship with her retired parents, who are mystified by her success but proud nonetheless.\n\nHaving conquered the financial world, Mei\u2019s aspirations are shifting. She dreams of shaping the city's future, not just by brokering deals, but by creating a foundation that mentors young women, particularly from immigrant backgrounds, entering finance and development. Mei Lin Wong has sold pieces of San Francisco for decades; now, she wants to build a legacy within it."
