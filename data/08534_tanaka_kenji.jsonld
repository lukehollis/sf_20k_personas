Raised in San Jose, he was the only son of a pragmatic electrical engineer father and a mother who practiced the quiet, meditative art of ikebana. His childhood home was a place of contrasts: his father\u2019s world of rigid schematics and circuit boards versus his mother\u2019s world of organic asymmetry, space, and form. Kenji found himself drawn to the intersection of these two disciplines\u2014the point where structure gives way to feeling.\n\nHis educational journey mirrored this dual inheritance. After earning a Master of Architecture from UC Berkeley, where he honed his technical skills, he felt a creative void. This led him to pursue a second graduate degree, a Master of Fine Arts in Environmental Art, where he learned to design spaces that didn't just house art but conversed with it. After a soul-crushing stint at a corporate firm designing sterile glass towers, a key turning point came with his mother\u2019s passing. While sorting through her ikebana tools, he resolved to stop building containers and start creating experiences. He quit his job and founded his own boutique firm, focusing exclusively on projects within the arts.\n\nNow, Kenji lives and works in a converted SOMA warehouse, his 0.0-mile commute taking him from his minimalist living quarters to his sun-drenched studio downstairs. His days are disciplined: meditation at dawn, followed by hours of deep work manipulating light and material for his latest commission\u2014perhaps a new wing for a museum or a sculptor\u2019s live-work gallery. His social life is deeply intertwined with his profession; his closest friends are artists, curators, and chefs. He was briefly married in his thirties, but his devotion to establishing his practice proved all-consuming.\n\nDeeply connected to San Francisco\u2019s cultural fabric, Kenji sees the city not just as a home but as his canvas and collaborator. His current aspiration transcends individual buildings; he dreams of designing a public art park, a lasting legacy where nature, architecture, and community can converge in a seamless, contemplative dialogue\u2014the ultimate expression of his parents\u2019 united worlds."
