Born in Fremont to a first-generation Chinese father, a pragmatic software engineer, and a Caucasian-American mother, a poetic history professor, David grew up navigating two distinct worlds. His father pushed for stability and logic, while his mother championed the humanities and the importance of legacy. This duality shaped him, making him both meticulously organized and deeply introspective.\n\nInstead of the expected computer science degree, David pursued his mother\u2019s passion through a modern lens, earning a Bachelor's in Information Science. He dreamed of being an archivist for a museum or a university, preserving history. However, after a stark post-graduation stint at an underfunded historical society, he faced a turning point. The digital world offered the stability his father preached. He taught himself SQL and Oracle on nights and weekends, discovering that a database was simply a new kind of archive. He pivoted, landing a job as a Database Administrator, and found he was exceptionally good at creating order from digital chaos.\n\nNow 33, David lives a deliberately structured life in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are self-contained. He begins with pour-over coffee, listening to the foghorns, before logging in to manage massive corporate datasets. His work is precise, logical, and remote, a stark contrast to his analog passion: collecting and cataloging rare post-punk vinyl. His apartment, filled with meticulously organized records, is his personal archive.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal. He knows the best dim sum spots on Clement Street, frequents the small, independent bookstores, and takes long, meditative walks through Golden Gate Park. His social circle is small\u2014a few friends from his old archivist days and a weekly board game group. David\u2019s quiet dream is to eventually merge his worlds: to use his high-paying tech skills to build a sophisticated, open-source database for a non-profit, perhaps one dedicated to preserving independent music or local histories. He seeks to prove that a life built on logic can still serve a purpose rooted in passion."
