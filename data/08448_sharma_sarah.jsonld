Born in Fremont to Indian immigrant parents who prized engineering and medicine, Sarah was raised with the expectation that she would pursue a lucrative career. She was a dutiful daughter, and in her early twenties, moved across the bay to San Francisco to study business at SF State, feeling the immense pressure of her family\u2019s hopes.\n\nHer carefully planned path fractured during her sophomore year when her mother was diagnosed with a severe autoimmune disorder. Sarah left school and returned home to become a full-time caregiver. During those two grueling years, surrounded by medication schedules and doctor\u2019s appointments, she discovered a deep well of patience she never knew she possessed. She found she was skilled not at spreadsheets, but at soothing, at listening, and at creating small moments of joy amidst the struggle. This was the first major turning point; she realized the life her parents wanted for her was not the one she was built for.\n\nAfter her mother stabilized, Sarah returned to San Francisco, but not to college. Adrift, she took a job as an assistant at a small, play-based cooperative preschool in the Inner Richmond, initially just to pay the bills. There, she found her calling. The chaotic, vibrant world of three-year-olds was where her nurturing spirit thrived.\n\nNow 45, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply embedded in her neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is literal; she lives in a small, rent-stabilized apartment directly above the preschool. Her daily routine is a comforting rhythm of storytelling, mediating disputes over building blocks, and wiping away tears. Her social circle is her \"found family\": the head teacher who is her mentor, the parents she supports, and the local shopkeepers she knows by name. While she may not have a degree, her dream is to slowly complete her Child Development Associate (CDA) credential online. Sarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco isn't in its glittering landmarks or tech campuses, but in the few blocks she calls home\u2014a small, meaningful world she built for herself, one crayon drawing at a time."
