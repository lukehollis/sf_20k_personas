She was born in Flagstaff, Arizona, to a pragmatic Chinese-American ER nurse and a contemplative Din\u00e9 (Navajo) silversmith. Her childhood was a quiet synthesis of her parents\u2019 cultures: the sharp scent of medicinal herbs and the earthy aroma of turquoise dust, tales of the Monkey King interwoven with Din\u00e9 creation stories. This dual heritage often made her feel like an outsider, a feeling that solidified the \u201cOther\u201d she checked on official forms. She found solace not in creating art like her father, but in organizing it\u2014 meticulously arranging his tools and cataloging his finished pieces with a self-devised system.\n\nThis innate talent for creating order from creative chaos guided her academic path. After an undergraduate degree in Art History, she pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, specializing in digital archives. It was the perfect fusion of her passions: a way to preserve and contextualize the art she loved without the pressure of public performance. Upon graduating, she accepted a fully remote position as a Metadata Specialist for a major arts foundation, a role that brought her to San Francisco.\n\nNow 31, Chun-Li lives in a small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute means her days have a deliberate rhythm. Mornings begin with tea from a local shop on Clement Street, followed by hours of focused work, where she acts as a translator between art and algorithm, ensuring a digital brushstroke is as searchable as a sculptor\u2019s signature. A key turning point was the passing of her grandmother two years ago, which prompted her to digitize decades of family photos, a personal project that deepened her commitment to her professional work of digital preservation.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, centered on a pottery class in the Mission and a book club that meets in Golden Gate Park. She cherishes her quiet connection to the city, finding beauty in the fog rolling over Arguello Boulevard and the quiet symmetry of the Queen Wilhelmina Tulip Garden. Her dream is to one day lead the digital archival project for a major institution like SFMOMA, but more pressingly, she hopes to travel and see the physical artworks she has only ever known as data points on her screen."

Instead of shaping silver, she arranged his tools by function, then by size. She lined up chunks of turquoise, creating a silent, gradient story on the worn wood. It wasn't creation, but curation. This quiet act of bringing order to his art was the first time she felt truly centered, finding her own purpose between his world and her mother\u2019s. It was the birth of her love for systems.\n\n2.\nHer first month in San Francisco, around age 28, felt isolating. One evening, she watched the fog pour over Arguello Boulevard, turning streetlights into hazy stars. It wasn\u2019t a weather event; it was a quiet, moving presence. The city didn't feel loud or demanding, but contemplative, just like her. In that moment of atmospheric kinship, she realized she didn\u2019t have to perform to belong here. She could simply be, and the city would meet her where she was, in the quiet spaces.\n\n3.\nTwo years ago, hollowed by her grandmother's passing, she sat with the steady hum of a scanner. She found a faded photo: her grandmother, in her nurse\u2019s uniform, laughing beside Chun-Li\u2019s silversmith father. As she meticulously tagged the digital file\u2014`Akeyah, Chun-Mei`, `Din\u00e9`, `family`\u2014the sterile act felt sacred. Metadata became a form of remembrance, a way to keep not just an image, but a story, from fading. Her remote job transformed from a task into a personal, urgent calling.\n\n4.\nLast year, during her pottery class in the Mission, her first centered bowl collapsed. She tensed, but the woman next to her just smiled. \"The clay has its own ideas today,\" she said, scraping her own failed attempt into a lump. In her digital work, every detail had to be perfect. Here, amidst the spattered clay and shared imperfection, she felt a profound sense of relief. It was a community built not on pristine results, but on the simple act of trying together.\n\n5.\nJust last month, she was cataloging a contemporary sculpture that mimicked woven fabric. As she typed keywords\u2014`texture`, `materiality`, `trompe l'oeil`\u2014she realized she was translating the artist\u2019s physical intent into a language that would outlive the webpage it resided on. She was ensuring a feeling could be discovered by a computer. In that instant, the distance between the data point on her screen and the unseen artwork collapsed. Her quiet, remote work felt powerfully connected to the physical world she longed to see."
