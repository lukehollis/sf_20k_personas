            "value": "Chun-Li Akeyah\u2019s name is a story in itself, a reflection of a life lived between worlds. She was born in Flagstaff, Arizona, to a pragmatic Chinese-American ER nurse and a contemplative Din\u00e9 (Navajo) silversmith. Her childhood was a quiet synthesis of her parents\u2019 cultures: the sharp scent of medicinal herbs and the earthy aroma of turquoise dust, tales of the Monkey King interwoven with Din\u00e9 creation stories. This dual heritage often made her feel like an outsider, a feeling that solidified the \u201cOther\u201d she checked on official forms. She found solace not in creating art like her father, but in organizing it\u2014 meticulously arranging his tools and cataloging his finished pieces with a self-devised system.\n\nThis innate talent for creating order from creative chaos guided her academic path. After an undergraduate degree in Art History, she pursued a Master of Library and Information Science, specializing in digital archives. It was the perfect fusion of her passions: a way to preserve and contextualize the art she loved without the pressure of public performance. Upon graduating, she accepted a fully remote position as a Metadata Specialist for a major arts foundation, a role that brought her to San Francisco.\n\nNow 31, Chun-Li lives in a small, tidy apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute means her days have a deliberate rhythm. Mornings begin with tea from a local shop on Clement Street, followed by hours of focused work, where she acts as a translator between art and algorithm, ensuring a digital brushstroke is as searchable as a sculptor\u2019s signature. A key turning point was the passing of her grandmother two years ago, which prompted her to digitize decades of family photos, a personal project that deepened her commitment to her professional work of digital preservation.\n\nHer social life is small but meaningful, centered on a pottery class in the Mission and a book club that meets in Golden Gate Park. She cherishes her quiet connection to the city, finding beauty in the fog rolling over Arguello Boulevard and the quiet symmetry of the Queen Wilhelmina Tulip Garden. Her dream is to one day lead the digital archival project for a major institution like SFMOMA, but more pressingly, she hopes to travel and see the physical artworks she has only ever known as data points on her screen."
