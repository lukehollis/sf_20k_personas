The only son of Korean immigrants, his childhood was a landscape of meticulously folded shirts and the expectation that he would achieve a more prestigious, less strenuous life. A quiet, observant boy, he excelled in school, but instead of pursuing medicine or law as his parents hoped, he chose a path that confounded them: Philosophy at UC Berkeley.\n\nHis college years were a rebellion of the mind. He traded the certainty of his parents\u2019 world for the abstract ambiguity of Kant and Camus. Upon graduation, however, the impracticality of his degree became starkly real. Faced with mounting pressure, Daniel discovered an unexpected talent during a temp job: finding patterns in chaotic spreadsheets. He realized the logical frameworks he\u2019d studied in philosophy could be applied to data. Driven by a newfound purpose, he spent a year self-teaching Python and SQL, eventually landing an analyst role at a burgeoning tech startup.\n\nNow 29, Daniel lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is both digital and hyper-local. His day begins not with a train ride, but with a short walk to a local panaderia for coffee, his one non-negotiable ritual before logging on. He spends hours translating user behavior into clean data sets, a digital anthropologist observing from his standing desk.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of friends, mostly met through a shared love for rock climbing at Mission Cliffs. After work, he trades his screen for the vibrant murals of Clarion Alley or the grassy slopes of Dolores Park, finding solace in the city's analog pulse. Daniel\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate; he feels the city's heartbeat in his neighborhood, from the Sunday farmers' market to the late-night taco trucks.\n\nHis dream is to eventually bridge his two passions, using data analytics for social good\u2014perhaps working with a nonprofit to analyze patterns in housing insecurity or public transit. He wants to do more than just read the city\u2019s data; he wants to help write a better story for it."
