The youngest of four, she learned early how to listen amidst the noise, a skill sharpened by watching her older brother navigate a painful, often silent, battle with addiction. It was this experience that planted the seed for her career; she felt a powerful pull to understand the unseen wounds people carry.\n\nSeeking both distance and a different perspective, she left the East Coast for her graduate studies, earning a Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley. The move was a profound liberation. In California, she was no longer just \"the O'Connell's youngest,\" but a person of her own making. She threw herself into her work, taking a demanding position as a clinical social worker within a large San Francisco hospital system. For years, her life was a blur of patient crises, bureaucratic hurdles, and the quiet satisfaction of helping someone find their footing. A key turning point was the end of a long-term relationship in her early thirties, a heartbreak that, while devastating, forced her to build a new, stronger foundation of friendships and self-reliance entirely on her own terms.\n\nNow 40, Bridget\u2019s life is centered in her Inner Sunset apartment, a sanctuary of calming blues and overflowing bookshelves that doubles as her office. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development, a shift to telehealth that has given her more control over her draining work. Her days are a structured rhythm of intense virtual therapy sessions, punctuated by restorative runs through the fog-laced trails of Golden Gate Park, her sprawling backyard. She de-stresses with a small, fiercely loyal group of friends\u2014a mix of fellow therapists and artists\u2014over weekly dinners and long walks.\n\nHer connection to San Francisco is deep but quiet; she loves the city for its acceptance of idiosyncrasies and its proximity to nature's grandeur. Bridget\u2019s dream is to transition from the high-volume hospital setting to a small private practice, specializing in burnout among fellow healthcare professionals. She envisions a space where healers can themselves be healed, a culmination of a life spent listening in the quiet spaces."
