The only child of Bangladeshi immigrants, she grew up in a home filled with the scent of spices and the weight of high expectations. Her father, a civil engineer, encouraged her natural curiosity for how things worked, gifting her LEGO sets and old electronics to disassemble. While her parents hoped she\u2019d pursue medicine, Pria was more fascinated by the elegant mechanics of a bicycle derailleur than human anatomy.\n\nHer path led her to UC Berkeley, where she chose to major in Mechanical Engineering. It was there she found her true calling. A senior design project, creating a prototype for a low-cost, adaptive controller for gamers with motor disabilities, ignited a passion. It wasn\u2019t just about gears and circuits anymore; it was about how technology could interface seamlessly with human life. This project became the cornerstone of her portfolio, landing her a coveted role as a Product Development Engineer at a mid-sized SF tech company right after graduation.\n\nThe turning point in her professional life was an external one: the pandemic. Her company shifted to a fully remote model and never looked back, solidifying Pria\u2019s 0.0-mile commute. This freed her to choose her neighborhood based on lifestyle rather than proximity to an office. She settled in a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Sunset, drawn to the quiet streets and immediate access to Golden Gate Park.\n\nHer days now have a distinct rhythm. Mornings start with a run through the park, clearing her head before she dives into 3D modeling and coordinating with manufacturers from her standing desk. Work is a flurry of Slack messages and video calls, a digital world she consciously unplugs from at 6 p.m. To counteract the screen time, she\u2019s taken up pottery at a small local studio, finding immense satisfaction in shaping clay with her hands. Her social life is a tight-knit circle of college friends, often meeting for trivia nights at a pub on Irving Street or weekend hikes in Marin.\n\nPria feels a deep, quiet connection to San Francisco\u2019s blend of innovation and nature. While she\u2019s proud of the consumer electronics she helps create, her dream is to eventually lead a team developing assistive technology\u2014an ambition born from that pivotal college project. For now, she\u2019s content building her skills, cherishing her independence, and finding her own version of balance in a city that\u2019s always in motion."

Instead of studying for her biology final, she was meticulously reassembling her bicycle\u2019s derailleur. She watched the chain slip perfectly into place with a satisfying *click*. In that moment, the elegant, predictable logic of the machine was infinitely more beautiful than the messy complexities of human anatomy. It wasn\u2019t rebellion; it was a quiet, profound clarity. This was the language she understood, the world she wanted to build things for.\n\n***\n\n2.\nDuring her final semester at Berkeley, she watched a fellow student with cerebral palsy test her senior project. His fingers, usually strained, rested easily on the custom controller. He navigated a game menu, a small, triumphant smile spreading across his face. It wasn't about the grade or the mechanics anymore. It was the humbling, electric realization that her code and CAD models could dissolve a barrier and create a moment of effortless joy. That feeling became her professional compass, the true north she still follows.\n\n***\n\n3.\nHer first morning in the Inner Sunset apartment was transformative. She stood by the window with her coffee, watching the fog drift through the cypress trees in Golden Gate Park. There was no freeway drone, no pressure to commute. The only sound was the distant rumble of the N-Judah. This space, this quiet, this view\u2014it was the first major thing in her life she had chosen purely for herself, not for a career or for family. It was a profound feeling of quiet sovereignty.\n\n***\n\n4.\nIt took weeks, but one Tuesday night at the pottery studio, it happened. The stubborn lump of clay on the wheel, which had buckled and flopped under her hands so many times, finally centered. As it spun smoothly between her palms, the day's digital cacophony of Slack pings and video calls melted away. The simple, tactile feeling of creating a symmetrical form from mud was a grounding force, a necessary anchor in her screen-based world. It was a feeling of pure, analogue control.\n\n***\n\n5.\nOn a recent visit home, she showed her father a 3D-printed prototype of her company\u2019s latest speaker. He, a civil engineer who understood bridges of steel and concrete, turned the smooth, complex plastic housing over in his hands. He didn't mention medical school. Instead, he asked about the material tolerances and the draft angles for manufacturing. In his technical questions, she felt a new kind of acceptance\u2014a validation not of a daughter, but of a fellow engineer. The pride felt earned and solid."
