Raised in Modesto, the only child of a mechanic and a diner waitress, her upbringing was defined by pragmatism. College was a distant, abstract idea; the immediate need was a steady paycheck. After graduating from high school, she worked a series of retail and administrative jobs, her world feeling small and pre-determined.\n\nThe key turning point came at 22 when she followed a charismatic boyfriend to San Francisco, chasing a promise of excitement and a life less ordinary. The relationship dissolved within a year, but Sarah, having tasted the city\u2019s energy, refused to retreat. She was left with a tiny, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond and a fierce determination to make it on her own. Her early years were a difficult patchwork of temp assignments and survival jobs, teaching her a deep-seated self-reliance.\n\nHer career break, such as it was, came seven years ago when a temp-to-perm position converted into a full-time, remote role as a Data Entry Specialist for a massive tech company. This job became her anchor. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it was stable. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is largely confined to her one-bedroom apartment, where the clatter of her keyboard is the day\u2019s primary soundtrack. Her daily routine is monastic: log in at 8:59 AM, process endless spreadsheets, log out at 5:01 PM.\n\nSarah\u2019s San Francisco is not the one of cable cars and Michelin stars. It\u2019s the fog rolling down Arguello Boulevard, the quiet comfort of Green Apple Books, and the familiar nod from the cashier at her corner market. Her social life is small but meaningful, consisting of a couple of close friends from a previous job and her weekly video call with her mother. She feels like a ghost in the machine of the industry she serves, an invisible but necessary cog.\n\nHer dreams are modest and fiercely protected. She isn\u2019t aspiring to climb the corporate ladder, but to save enough to one day buy a small condo, perhaps somewhere quieter up the coast. She hopes to finally take a pottery class, to create something tangible with her hands after years of handling abstract data. Sarah Miller persists, a quiet testament to the resilience required to build a life in a city that so often celebrates only its loudest residents."
