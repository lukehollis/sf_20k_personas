Born and raised in the Mission District, David is the son of a Cantonese-speaking immigrant father who ran a small kitchen and a proud first-generation Mexican-American mother who worked as a home caregiver. His childhood was a vibrant fusion of cultures, languages, and cuisines\u2014a household where steamed fish was served alongside fresh tortillas, and conversations flowed between Spanish, Cantonese, and the English that bound them together.\n\nAs the first in his family to attend college, David felt the weight of expectation. He enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially unsure of his path. The turning point came during his junior year when his mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. David witnessed firsthand her struggle to navigate a healthcare system that was culturally and linguistically ill-equipped to support her. He translated complex medical jargon, fought for appointments, and grew frustrated by the disconnect between clinical advice and real-world applicability for someone like his mother. This experience ignited a fire within him. He found his purpose not in medicine itself, but in the space between the doctor\u2019s office and the community.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, he pursued a Master's in Public Health at UC Berkeley, focusing on community-based education. Now, at 46, David works as a Community Health Educator, with his Inner Sunset apartment serving as his office. His 0.0-mile commute allows him to dedicate his mornings to developing bilingual health materials and hosting virtual workshops on nutrition and preventative care. In the afternoons, he is out in the city\u2019s neighborhoods\u2014the Mission, the Excelsior, Bayview\u2014partnering with clinics and community centers, running support groups, and talking to people in the languages of their homes.\n\nDavid is deeply connected to San Francisco, seeing it not as a tech hub but as a mosaic of communities he is fiercely dedicated to serving. Though his work leaves little time for deep personal relationships, he finds connection in the familiar faces at the farmers' market and the families he empowers. His dream is to launch a mobile health unit, a \"clinic without walls,\" that brings culturally competent health education directly to the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents, ensuring no one else\u2019s mother has to face the system alone."
