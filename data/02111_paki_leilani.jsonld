Raised in a close-knit, multi-generational household of Filipino and Native Hawaiian heritage, her childhood was steeped in the values of *ohana* (family) and *kuleana* (responsibility). Her father was a hotel mechanic and her mother a school administrator, instilling in Leilani a potent combination of practical problem-solving and organizational grace. The move to the mainland for college was a profound shift, trading the scent of plumeria and salt for the crisp air of the Bay Area.\n\nShe earned a Bachelor's degree in Communications, initially envisioning a career in public relations. However, after a few unfulfilling years in corporate marketing, she landed an administrative role at a burgeoning tech startup during the first dot-com boom. There, amidst the beautiful chaos of engineering sprints and product launches, she discovered her true calling. She had a natural talent for translating the abstract goals of leadership into concrete, actionable tasks for developers. She found her calling not in writing code, but in orchestrating it. Through on-the-job training and sheer tenacity, she transitioned into project management, building a reputation as a calm, decisive leader.\n\nNow 46, Leilani lives a life of curated tranquility in Noe Valley. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the post-pandemic work-from-home culture she has fully embraced. Her days begin with a walk to a local cafe, where the baristas know her order, followed by a disciplined schedule of virtual meetings and project tracking from her light-filled home office. Her partner of twelve years, a landscape architect, provides a grounding counterbalance to the ephemeral world of software.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago when her father had a health scare, amplifying the geographic distance from her roots. While deeply connected to her \u201cchosen family\u201d of friends in San Francisco, she feels a growing pull towards her heritage. Her dream is no longer about climbing the corporate ladder, but about integration. She aspires to mentor young women of color entering the tech field and secretly nurses a long-term goal: to use her project management skills to help a non-profit dedicated to the preservation of Hawaiian language and cultural sites. For Leilani, San Francisco is her home, but Hawai\u02bbi will always be her foundation."
