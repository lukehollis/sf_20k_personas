Born and raised in the Mission District, he is a second-generation San Franciscan whose roots run as deep as the foundations of the two-story building his father bought in the 1970s. His childhood was a symphony of air wrenches and Spanish radio, spent watching his father, a self-taught mechanic from Jalisco, breathe life back into tired engines. The smell of gasoline and oil is the smell of home.\n\nWhile his father taught him the feel of a finely-tuned engine, David sought to master the science behind it. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology. He was the first in his family to get a college degree, a point of immense pride for his parents. The turning point came when his father passed away two decades ago, leaving David, then 32, the keys to \"Hayes Auto Repair\" and the weight of a legacy.\n\nDavid is a master of his craft, a diagnostician who can decipher an engine\u2019s troubles with a listen and a touch. His days are a disciplined routine: coffee at 6 a.m., open the shop by 7, and work steadily until dusk. He lives in the apartment above the shop, a practical arrangement that became solitary after his amicable divorce; his ex-wife never quite adapted to a life that revolved around engine overhauls. His greatest pride is his daughter, Sofia, now studying nursing at a state university, whose tuition bills are the reason he still works six days a week.\n\nAs the Mission has morphed around him, David has remained an anchor. He services the sedans of families he's known for decades alongside the Priuses of tech newcomers. He feels like a relic of an older San Francisco, a craftsman in a city obsessed with code. His dream isn\u2019t a splashy retirement, but a quiet one: to finally restore a '67 Ford Falcon sitting under a tarp in the back bay, a project just for himself, and drive it down Highway 1 with no destination in mind."

The oil pan bolt. 90-degree turn, *no m\u00e1s*.\" David\u2019s hands, clumsy and clean, tightened it until the wrench gave a satisfying click. It wasn't just a bolt; it was the first time his father trusted him with the final, crucial turn. In that click, he felt the weight and honor of his future settling into place.\n\n2.\nHe remembers standing in the garage, the plastic of his City College diploma feeling flimsy in his greasy hands. His father wiped his own hands on a rag and took the certificate, studying the official seal. He didn't smile, but gave a slow, deliberate nod. \"Good, David. *Es bueno saber la ciencia*.\" It was more than praise; it was an acknowledgment that David had added a new layer to the family foundation, mastering the books his father never had the chance to open.\n\n3.\nA week after the funeral, his mother pressed the shop keys into his palm. They were cold and sharp, so different from the calloused warmth of his father's hand. He walked into the silent garage, the familiar smell of oil now heavy with absence. For the first time, it didn't smell like home, but like a profound and solitary responsibility. At thirty-two, he wasn\u2019t just a mechanic anymore; he was the keeper of his father\u2019s entire world.\n\n4.\nHe was midway through a transmission flush when Sofia called, her voice buzzing through his phone\u2019s speaker. \"I passed my pharmacology final, Dad! I actually passed!\" David leaned against a tool chest, a grin spreading across his face, forgetting the grime on his hands. In that moment, the endless invoices, the aching back, the lonely apartment upstairs\u2014it all coalesced into a single, sharp feeling of purpose. This was why. Her future was the engine he was truly working on.\n\n5.\nHe must have been seventeen when he helped his father pull the dusty tarp off the Ford Falcon for the first time. \"One day,\" his dad had said, running a hand over the fender, \"we take this down the coast. No customers, no phones. Just the road.\" The car was never just a project; it was his father\u2019s someday. Now, restoring it feels less like a hobby and more like finishing a conversation, a final promise to drive toward that quiet horizon they dreamed of together."
