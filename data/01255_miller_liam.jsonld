Raised by itinerant software developers who treated borders as suggestions, Liam\u2019s upbringing was a global patchwork. His education wasn\u2019t from a single institution but was pieced together from online courses, local libraries in Berlin and Seoul, and a voracious, self-directed curiosity. There is no diploma on his wall because his learning never had a graduation date.\n\nHe landed in San Francisco at nineteen, drawn by a myth of digital frontiers and intellectual freedom. He initially tried the traditional route, but the structure of corporate life felt suffocating. The turning point came during a late-night coding session when he realized his true talent wasn't writing code, but finding the information that made the code relevant. He began taking on small, anonymous online gigs: verifying obscure facts for novelists, tracing the digital footprint of a market trend for a boutique investor, mapping subcultures for academics. He became a research analyst for \"None,\" an ever-shifting clientele who value discretion and results over a formal resume.\n\nLiam\u2019s day begins before sunrise, with strong black coffee and the quiet hum of his servers. His work is his commute. His connection to San Francisco is deeply hyperlocal; he knows the baristas at the Blue Danube by name and has a running dialogue with the owner of Green Apple Books about rare sci-fi first editions. His social life is sparse but meaningful, consisting mostly of a weekly bouldering session at Dogpatch Boulders with his one close friend, Maya, and the occasional shared silence on a bench overlooking Ocean Beach.\n\nHe doesn't dream of a high-rise office or stock options. Liam\u2019s aspiration is to remain untethered, to have the intellectual freedom to follow any thread of information to its source. His ultimate goal is to build a private, open-source intelligence tool\u2014a system that can see the patterns he sees. For Liam, San Francisco isn't a ladder to climb, but a complex, living dataset he is privileged to observe, analyze, and, in his own quiet way, call home."
