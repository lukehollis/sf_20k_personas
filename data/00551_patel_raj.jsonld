The only son of Gujarati immigrants who settled in Fremont in the 1980s, Raj grew up surrounded by the hum of burgeoning technology. His parents, a software engineer and a pharmacist, envisioned a similar STEM path for him. Raj, however, was more interested in the human systems that technology was beginning to disrupt. While his friends were coding, he was reading political theory and sociology.\n\nThis led him to pursue a B.A. in Political Science at UC Berkeley, a choice that caused quiet concern at home. After graduating, he took a job with an Oakland-based housing non-profit. It was a formative experience. Daily, he witnessed the stark contrast between the soaring wealth generated in Silicon Valley and the displacement it caused just across the bridge. This was his turning point. He realized the most critical policy battles of his generation weren't in Sacramento or D.C., but inside the tech companies themselves. He enrolled in a Master of Public Policy program at Stanford, focusing his studies on technology ethics and governance.\n\nNow 32, Raj is a Policy Analyst for a major tech firm. His 0.0-mile commute ends at a standing desk in the corner of his Hayes Valley apartment. He spends his days drafting responsible innovation frameworks and wrestling with the ethical quandaries of AI and data privacy. He is the internal conscience, a translator between the engineers who build the future and the society that has to live in it.\n\nHis life is structured and deliberate. Mornings begin with a walk to a local coffee shop, creating a mental separation from his home office. He lives with his partner, Lena, a landscape architect whose work physically shapes the city he tries to influence digitally. They find balance in their different worlds, often debating the city\u2019s future over dinner. Raj feels deeply connected to San Francisco\u2014he\u2019s a product of its orbit, a critic of its excesses, and a hopeful believer in its capacity for reinvention. His dream is to help steer the industry that defines his home toward a more equitable and humane future, one policy memo at a time."
