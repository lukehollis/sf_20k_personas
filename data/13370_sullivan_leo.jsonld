Born in Daly City to a Filipino mother who worked tirelessly as a nurse and an Irish-American father who was a proud union carpenter, Leo grew up bridging cultures. His childhood was filled with the scents of both adobo and corned beef, and his parents instilled in him a profound sense of community service and the quiet dignity of hard work.\n\nThis foundation led him to SF State, where he eagerly enrolled in the Social Work program. He saw a direct path to helping families like his own. However, that path fractured during his junior year when his mother suffered a debilitating stroke. Suddenly, the theories of social assistance became his reality. Leo dropped out of school to help care for her and pick up part-time work to support his family, deferring his own dreams.\n\nThe setback became a detour, not a dead end. Needing a full-time job, he found a position at a non-profit in the Mission District. He started by organizing supplies and mentoring a handful of kids, but his innate empathy and personal experience made him indispensable. Within a few years, he was promoted to Youth Program Coordinator, developing after-school programs that provided a safe haven for teenagers navigating precarious lives.\n\nNow 27, Leo\u2019s life is defined by his 1.5-mile walk to work through the Mission. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment with two roommates, his $62,000 salary making him feel both stable and perpetually priced-out. His daily routine is a tapestry of grant-writing, mentoring, and mediating conflicts, fueled by coffee from a corner panaderia. His social life is deeply intertwined with his work; his closest friends are fellow non-profit workers and his partner, Maya, is a public school teacher.\n\nLeo\u2019s ambition isn\u2019t to climb a corporate ladder. He dreams of finally finishing his bachelor\u2019s degree online and eventually getting a Master's in Social Work. He wants the credentials to not just run programs, but to design them and advocate for them at a policy level. He is San Francisco not by birth, but by choice and by service, his identity forged in the vibrant, complex neighborhood he fights for every day."

The air was thick with the scent of his mom\u2019s adobo and the savory smell of his dad\u2019s corned beef. He can still see his father, a big man with calloused carpenter\u2019s hands, laughing with his Filipino uncles over a beer. It wasn\u2019t two separate cultures, but one loud, loving, complicated family. He learned then that community wasn\u2019t about being the same; it was about sharing a table and making room for everyone.\n\n2.\nHe remembers the first time he helped his mother drink a glass of water after the stroke, when he was 21. Her hand, once so steady when checking his childhood fevers, trembled violently. He held the glass for her, a knot of grief and fierce determination tightening in his chest. In that silent, humbling moment, his SF State textbooks on social assistance felt like a foreign language. This was the real work. All his plans dissolved, replaced by a single, overwhelming need: to be there.\n\n3.\nHe remembers a quiet Tuesday two years into his non-profit job. A withdrawn 15-year-old named Javier, who never spoke, finally opened up about his mom\u2019s chronic illness. Leo didn\u2019t offer platitudes; he simply said, \"I get it. My mom, too.\" The look of shocked relief on Javier\u2019s face was a gut punch of purpose. For the first time, the pain of dropping out of school felt less like a failure and more like a necessary credential. This happened when he was 23.\n\n4.\nHe remembers walking to work last spring, stress about a dwindling grant application tightening his chest. He passed the MaestraPeace mural on the Women\u2019s Building, its vibrant colors almost humming in the morning light. A few steps later, the owner of the corner panaderia waved and called out his name, a coffee already waiting. The mix of grand, defiant art and simple, personal connection settled him. This was his San Francisco: a daily fight worth fighting, a community that saw him back.\n\n5.\nHe remembers a night last month, both he and his partner Maya exhausted on their second-hand couch. They were mapping out their budgets on a shared laptop, a sea of small numbers that never seemed to add up. Maya sighed, then leaned her head on his shoulder. \"We're rich in everything but money,\" she whispered. In that moment of shared precarity and profound love, his ambition to finish his degree felt less like a personal goal and more like a promise to them both."
