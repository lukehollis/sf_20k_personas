They arrived in Oakland from Guangdong, China, with little more than a shared belief in hard work. Wei grew up watching them navigate the linguistic and cultural labyrinth of American healthcare, a frustrating experience that peaked when his grandmother, visiting from China, suffered a misdiagnosed illness due to translation issues. That memory became the silent engine of his ambition, steering him away from the lucrative tech paths his Bay Area peers pursued.\n\nAfter earning a biology degree from UC Davis, a pragmatic choice, Wei felt a pull eastward. He pursued a Master of Public Health from Columbia University, immersing himself in the global systems and policies that had once failed his own family. It was a transformative period, solidifying his purpose. He met his partner, Maya, a driven social work student, in a late-night study session, bonding over a shared desire for mission-driven work.\n\nReturning to the Bay Area felt like a homecoming. Wei settled in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond, a neighborhood whose foggy avenues and bustling dim sum restaurants reminded him of his roots. His role as a Program Coordinator for a global health initiative allows him to work from his cozy apartment, a 0.0-mile commute that blurs the lines between work and life. His days are a disciplined rhythm of international video calls, data analysis, and grant writing, punctuated by runs in Golden Gate Park to clear his head.\n\nWei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is intimate and hyperlocal. It\u2019s the morning ritual of grabbing a coffee on Clement Street, the weekend dim sum with his parents, and quiet evenings cooking with Maya. While his work addresses health crises continents away, his ultimate dream is to bring that focus home. He aspires to one day lead an initiative dedicated to improving healthcare access for the Bay Area\u2019s elderly immigrant populations, finally closing the loop on a journey that began in a sterile, confusing hospital waiting room years ago."
