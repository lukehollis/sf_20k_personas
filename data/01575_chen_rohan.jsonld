Born in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District to a first-generation father from Hong Kong and a third-generation Irish-American mother, his upbringing was a blend of Cantonese tradition and loud, loving family gatherings. He never felt a strong pull toward academics, finding the city itself to be a far more compelling teacher. School was a place he endured, but the real lessons were learned in the city's diverse neighborhoods and, most importantly, in the kitchen of his father\u2019s small diner in the Outer Sunset.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma. Rohan drifted for a few years, working odd jobs from bike messenger to warehouse stocker, feeling aimless. The turning point came when his father\u2019s health began to fail. At 24, Rohan stepped in to run the family diner, not out of passion, but a sense of duty. He discovered an unexpected talent for managing the controlled chaos of a restaurant. He learned inventory, scheduling, and payroll on the fly, earning the respect of the longtime staff through sheer hard work.\n\nAfter his father passed, the family sold the diner. With a small inheritance and a wealth of hands-on experience, Rohan worked his way up through the city\u2019s demanding culinary scene. He served, he bartended, and he managed, eventually landing his current role as the general manager of \u201cSylvan,\u201d a popular, upscale California-cuisine spot in Hayes Valley.\n\nNow at 39, Rohan\u2019s life revolves entirely around the restaurant. He lives in a small studio apartment directly above Sylvan, making his commute a simple walk downstairs. His days are a relentless cycle of inventory spreadsheets, staff meetings, and orchestrating the nightly dinner service. His social life is deeply intertwined with his job; his staff are his family, and his closest relationships are with the restaurant\u2019s regulars. His dream is to save enough to one day open his own place\u2014something small and unpretentious in the Richmond, a spot that honors both his Chinese and Irish roots, a true neighborhood joint that feels like coming home."

Staring at the empty vinyl booths, the scent of old coffee and Windex filled him not with passion, but with a cold, terrifying duty. He wasn't the aimless drifter anymore; he was just the son who had to show up. In that quiet, pre-dawn moment, responsibility settled onto his shoulders, and he learned to carry its weight. It became the foundation of his character.\n\n2.\nHe was nine, at a boisterous family party in their foggy Richmond flat. His Irish grandmother was teaching his father\u2019s friend, Mr. Wei, how to properly pour a Guinness. On the table, a platter of his mother\u2019s corned beef sandwiches sat next to a steaming bamboo basket of his father\u2019s har gow. The mingled scents of steamed shrimp and boiled cabbage felt perfectly normal, perfectly *home*. That feeling of easy, delicious collision is the one he\u2019s still chasing for his own future restaurant.\n\n3.\nIn his early twenties, a bike messenger, he\u2019d lock up his battered fixie to deliver a package to a restaurant not unlike Sylvan. He remembers pausing at the door, catching a glimpse of the warm lighting, the clink of wine glasses, and the seamless performance of the staff. He felt a million miles away from that world\u2014sweaty, anonymous, and unimportant. That brief moment, feeling like a ghost looking through the glass, stuck with him as a stark measure of the life he never thought he would have.\n\n4.\nDuring his first month managing Sylvan, a sommelier meticulously explained the terroir of a Sancerre to a wealthy couple. Rohan just nodded, his mind instinctively calculating the cost-per-pour and inventory turnover. He realized then that the language was different\u2014terroir instead of Tuesday\u2019s delivery\u2014but the math was the same. The controlled chaos of his father\u2019s diner had prepared him for this perfectly. He wasn\u2019t an imposter; he was just speaking a different dialect of the same language, and he knew he was fluent.\n\n5.\nOn a rare quiet night last winter, alone in his sterile studio above Sylvan, the evening fog rolled in thick, obscuring the Hayes Valley streetlights. The scent of damp air reminded him so strongly of his childhood bedroom in the Richmond. He closed his eyes and could almost taste his father\u2019s congee and his mother\u2019s soda bread. In that moment of intense nostalgia, his dream sharpened into a clear, aching need: to build a place that smelled and felt exactly like that. A home."
