            "value": "Rohan Chen is a product of San Francisco\u2019s unique cultural fusion. Born in the foggy avenues of the Richmond District to a first-generation father from Hong Kong and a third-generation Irish-American mother, his upbringing was a blend of Cantonese tradition and loud, loving family gatherings. He never felt a strong pull toward academics, finding the city itself to be a far more compelling teacher. School was a place he endured, but the real lessons were learned in the city's diverse neighborhoods and, most importantly, in the kitchen of his father\u2019s small diner in the Outer Sunset.\n\nHis formal education ended with a high school diploma. Rohan drifted for a few years, working odd jobs from bike messenger to warehouse stocker, feeling aimless. The turning point came when his father\u2019s health began to fail. At 24, Rohan stepped in to run the family diner, not out of passion, but a sense of duty. He discovered an unexpected talent for managing the controlled chaos of a restaurant. He learned inventory, scheduling, and payroll on the fly, earning the respect of the longtime staff through sheer hard work.\n\nAfter his father passed, the family sold the diner. With a small inheritance and a wealth of hands-on experience, Rohan worked his way up through the city\u2019s demanding culinary scene. He served, he bartended, and he managed, eventually landing his current role as the general manager of \u201cSylvan,\u201d a popular, upscale California-cuisine spot in Hayes Valley.\n\nNow at 39, Rohan\u2019s life revolves entirely around the restaurant. He lives in a small studio apartment directly above Sylvan, making his commute a simple walk downstairs. His days are a relentless cycle of inventory spreadsheets, staff meetings, and orchestrating the nightly dinner service. His social life is deeply intertwined with his job; his staff are his family, and his closest relationships are with the restaurant\u2019s regulars. His dream is to save enough to one day open his own place\u2014something small and unpretentious in the Richmond, a spot that honors both his Chinese and Irish roots, a true neighborhood joint that feels like coming home."
