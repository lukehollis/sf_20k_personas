            "value": "Leo Reyes-Liu is a product of the Bay Area\u2019s cultural confluence. Raised in Daly City, he is the son of a pragmatic Chinese-American engineer and a compassionate Filipina nurse. His childhood was a blend of his father\u2019s structured logic and his mother\u2019s deep sense of community care. Growing up, he witnessed firsthand how freeways, zoning laws, and public transit routes shaped the lives of his family and neighbors, sparking an early fascination with the hidden architecture of a city.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a degree in Urban Studies. He was less interested in abstract theory and more in the tangible impact of design on people. A pivotal internship with a non-profit focused on developing community gardens in West Oakland cemented his career path. He saw how a small, well-designed public space could become the heart of a neighborhood, and he wanted to be part of that transformative process.\n\nNow 26, Leo works as a Project Manager at a prominent architecture firm in SoMa. He\u2019s not the visionary sketching on a blank page, but the essential organizer who translates those visions into reality. He navigates permits, manages budgets, and liaises between architects and community stakeholders, a role that perfectly suits his blend of pragmatism and empathy.\n\nHis life is quintessentially San Francisco. He lives in a small but sunny apartment in the Inner Richmond, sharing the rent with a college friend. His day begins with a strong coffee from a local cafe before he bikes the 3.5 miles to his office, often cutting through the Panhandle. Evenings are for rock climbing at the local gym, catching an indie film at the Balboa Theatre, or debating city politics with friends over beers in the Mission.\n\nLeo feels a deep, if complicated, love for San Francisco. He\u2019s keenly aware of the disparities he navigates daily on his bike. His ultimate aspiration isn\u2019t to lead the design of another luxury high-rise, but to manage projects that genuinely serve the city\u2014a community center, a truly affordable housing development, or a reclaimed public park. He wants to use his skills to build a more equitable San Francisco, one that lives up to the promise he first saw as a kid from Daly City."

His dad would point out the engineering of the overpass, but his mom would sigh, worrying if her patient\u2019s family could make their appointment. From the back seat, Leo saw both things at once: the cold logic of the concrete and the human lives it dictated. It was the first time he understood the city wasn't just a place, but a system that could either help people or trap them. That image never left him.\n\n2.\nHe was sixteen the first time he took BART and the N-Judah alone to the Balboa Theatre. He remembers the specific clatter of the streetcar and the smell of old popcorn in the lobby. It wasn't about the film. It was the feeling of unlocking a new part of the map, of navigating the city\u2019s arteries on his own terms. For a kid from Daly City, it felt like gaining a new kind of citizenship, a secret password to a world he desperately wanted to join.\n\n3.\nDuring his internship in West Oakland, he remembers an older woman named Mrs. June showing him how to properly stake a tomato plant. She spoke about how the new community garden was the only place she really saw her neighbors anymore. In that moment, his abstract Berkeley studies became real. He wasn't just looking at zoning maps; he was seeing how a few garden boxes and a bench could mend the frayed fabric of a neighborhood. He knew then he had to build things that healed.\n\n4.\nBiking through the Panhandle last week, he felt a familiar whiplash. The rush of green fell away, replaced by a line of tents huddled under an overpass, then suddenly, the gleaming glass of a new SoMa tower. In ten minutes, he passed through three different cities. The jarring contrast wasn\u2019t just an observation; it was a physical weight, a daily reminder of the work that wasn't getting done and the reason he couldn\u2019t celebrate another luxury project his firm was building.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, arguing with friends over beers in the Mission, someone cynically asked what one person could even do. Leo, surprisingly animated, found himself sketching a multi-use community center on a napkin\u2014the library, the clinic, the shared kitchen. It wasn't a real project, just an idea he'd seen somewhere. But explaining it, defending its possibility against their skepticism, made it concrete in his own mind. It was no longer just a hope; it was his blueprint."
