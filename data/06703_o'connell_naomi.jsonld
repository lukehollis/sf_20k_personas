            "value": "Naomi O\u2019Connell is a product of San Francisco\u2019s quiet, fog-laced avenues. A third-generation Japanese-American, she was raised in the Sunset District by parents who instilled in her the Sansei values of diligence and community-mindedness. The unspoken history of her grandparents' internment during WWII was a subtle undercurrent in their home, fueling a drive for security and a deep-seated empathy for the marginalized.\n\nInitially drawn to psychology at UC Berkeley, Naomi pictured a clinical practice. However, a volunteer position at a Tenderloin after-school program was a profound turning point. Witnessing the silent struggles of children navigating complex home lives and academic pressures, she found her calling. She pivoted, earning her Master's in School Psychology from San Francisco State University and dedicating her career to the city\u2019s public school district.\n\nFor over two decades, Naomi has been a steady, calming presence for students. Her life found its own steady rhythm when she met Sean O\u2019Connell, a warm-hearted architect whose Irish-American boisterousness was a perfect complement to her thoughtful nature. They raised their daughter, Maya, in a cozy Edwardian in the Inner Richmond, a home filled with books, art, and the smells of both Japanese and Irish cooking.\n\nNow 48, Naomi\u2019s life has shifted again. The pandemic transitioned her role to be fully remote, explaining her 0.0-mile commute. Her office is a sunlit room overlooking the back garden, her days a patchwork of video calls with anxious teens, concerned parents, and overwhelmed teachers. While she misses the energy of a bustling school, she has adapted, finding new ways to build trust through the screen. With Maya away at college, she and Sean are rediscovering life as a couple, taking long walks through Golden Gate Park and planning future trips to Kyoto and County Cork. Naomi\u2019s dream is no longer just about individual students; she aspires to develop a district-wide peer counseling program, building a legacy of resilience for the next generation of San Franciscans."
