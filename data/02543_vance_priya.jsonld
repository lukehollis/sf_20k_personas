Raised in a quiet Ohio suburb by her Indian immigrant mother, a pragmatic software engineer, and her American father, a high school history teacher with a passion for folk art, Priya\u2019s childhood was a gentle negotiation between logic and creativity. Her mother preached the stability of STEM, while her father filled their home with pottery and stories of place. This duality defined her path, leading her to a double major in Sociology and Art History, a combination that baffled her mother.\n\nThe key turning point came during a study abroad semester in Berlin. Wandering through streets alive with murals, repurposed industrial spaces, and spontaneous galleries, Priya had an epiphany: the soul of a city wasn't just in its monuments, but in the creativity it allowed to flourish in its margins. She realized she didn't have to choose between her parents' worlds; she could build bridges between them. This revelation propelled her toward a Master's in Urban Planning with a concentration in Cultural Policy.\n\nDrawn by its legacy of counter-culture and vibrant public art, Priya moved to San Francisco. Today, she works for the city as an Arts Planner from her live/work loft in SoMa. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life and work are deeply intertwined. Her days are a blend of drafting zoning policies to protect performance venues, reviewing mural proposals for public parks, and walking the neighborhood to meet with the artists whose spaces she fights to preserve.\n\nHer social life is an extension of her work, a tight-knit circle of artists, activists, and community organizers met through grassroots projects. While romantic relationships have taken a backseat, her connections to her community are profound. Priya\u2019s ultimate dream is to create a \"Cultural Resilience Plan\" for San Francisco\u2014a comprehensive strategy to secure permanent, affordable spaces for artists, ensuring the city's creative heart isn't hollowed out by economic pressures. She sees her work not as a job, but as a form of civic stewardship, a way to ensure the city that inspired her continues to inspire others."
