Raised in the foggy avenues of the Sunset District, he was the dutiful son of first-generation immigrants who ran a bustling dry-cleaning business on Irving Street. Their hopes for him were practical: a stable job, a secure future. To honor this, Michael dutifully earned a Business Administration degree from San Francisco State University, a path chosen for its pragmatism.\n\nHis heart, however, was always elsewhere\u2014in the sunlit galleries of the de Young Museum and the cavernous, echoing halls of SFMOMA. During a soul-crushing stint in corporate finance after graduation, he began volunteering for museum installations on weekends. It was there he discovered his true talent: not creating art, but orchestrating its arrival into the world. He had a natural gift for translating the chaotic vision of an artist into a feasible, budgeted plan, bridging the gap between creativity and construction.\n\nThis discovery was his turning point. He leveraged his business degree and newfound network to land an assistant role at a prestigious architecture firm renowned for its work on cultural institutions. Over the next decade, he ascended to Project Manager, his name now attached to gallery renovations and public art installations across the Bay Area.\n\nToday, Michael lives in a minimalist SoMa loft, a world away from his Sunset upbringing. The building, a sleek structure of glass and steel his firm helped design, also houses his home office, rendering his commute non-existent. His days are a flurry of Zoom calls with architects, city planners, and temperamental artists. Evenings are often spent at gallery openings or in quiet contemplation at his drafting table, sketching not buildings, but the logistical flow of his next project.\n\nDeeply connected to San Francisco, Michael sees his work as a form of civic stewardship. He is more than a manager; he is a custodian of the city\u2019s creative soul. His ultimate dream is to lead the development of a new, iconic cultural center for the city, a legacy project that will permanently shape the skyline he has known his entire life. He\u2019s begun dating a textile artist he met during a recent installation, a relationship that is slowly teaching him to build a life as meticulously as he builds a project."
