His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk down a creaking staircase from his small apartment to the bustling kitchen of \"Hearth & Vine,\" the restaurant that is both his life\u2019s work and its most demanding master.\n\nBorn and raised in Stockton, David grew up far from the epicurean world he now inhabits. His family was working-class, valuing practicality over passion. He dutifully earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college, a path he thought would lead to a stable office job. It was a backpacking trip through rural Spain in his early twenties that served as his true education. He was captivated by the simplicity of the food: fresh-caught fish grilled with lemon, sun-ripened tomatoes with local olive oil, and crusty bread from a village bakery. This was an honesty he\u2019d never found in a textbook.\n\nReturning to California, David abandoned his expected career path. He started as a dishwasher in a Sacramento bistro, absorbing everything he could. He was a relentless worker, and his quiet intensity saw him promoted from prep cook to line cook, learning the craft through repetition and grit rather than formal instruction. He arrived in San Francisco at 30, a city that both inspired and intimidated him. For a decade, he honed his skills in other chefs\u2019 kitchens, saving every dollar.\n\nThe turning point came at 41 when he cashed in his savings, took out a terrifying loan, and leased the small ground-floor space that would become his own. The business degree, once forgotten, proved invaluable for managing costs and staff. His marriage buckled and broke under the strain of 100-hour workweeks, leaving him solely wedded to his restaurant.\n\nNow 54, David\u2019s life follows the rhythm of his kitchen. His days begin at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and end long after the last customer has gone. His staff is his surrogate family, and his regulars are his closest friends. He\u2019s a respected, if somewhat reclusive, figure in the neighborhood. His dream is no longer of expansion or Michelin stars, but of sustainability\u2014to see his restaurant thrive and to one day mentor a young chef to take the reins, allowing him, perhaps for the first time in decades, to simply enjoy a meal cooked by someone else."
