Raised by a high school history teacher father and a dental hygienist mother, his upbringing was stable, predictable, and imbued with a Midwestern sense of pragmatism. He was a quiet, observant child who found escape in books, which led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature at the University of Illinois. He envisioned a life in publishing or academia, surrounded by the stories he loved.\n\nThe post-graduation reality was different. Armed with a humanities degree in the mid-2000s, his path seemed unclear. The key turning point came when a college friend, working for a burgeoning tech startup in San Francisco, told him they needed someone who could \u201cwrite and talk to people.\u201d On a whim, David applied for a marketing coordinator role. He got the job, packed two suitcases, and moved west, trading literary theory for landing page copy.\n\nHe proved to be exceptionally organized and an excellent communicator, a bridge between the creative chaos of engineers and the structured demands of marketing. Over the years, he methodically climbed the ladder to his current role as a Project Coordinator. He shepherds projects from messy conception to tidy completion, a digital sheepdog in a world of Slack channels and Gantt charts.\n\nNow 41, David\u2019s life is a study in comfortable routine. His 0.0-mile commute is a ten-step journey from his espresso machine to the standing desk in the second bedroom of his Inner Richmond apartment. His days are a blur of Zoom calls and project management software. He knows the baristas at his local Clement Street coffee shop by name and finds solace in long, quiet walks through Golden Gate Park, a ritual that breaks up the monotony of remote work. His social circle is small, a tight-knit group of friends from former jobs who, like him, are navigating their 40s in a city obsessed with youth.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is one of an appreciative, long-term tenant rather than a native. He loves the city\u2019s beauty but feels a persistent disconnect from its frenetic core. David\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup or become a VP. He harbors a quieter aspiration: to finally use his English degree and write a novel, a story about ordinary people making pragmatic choices, much like his own. He wonders if he has the courage to start."
