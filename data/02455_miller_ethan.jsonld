Raised in a meticulously organized suburban home in Cincinnati, Ohio, by an accountant father and a librarian mother, Ethan inherited both a love for narrative and an innate understanding of order. He was the child who alphabetized his books before he could read them fluently.\n\nThis duality led him to pursue a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature, a quiet rebellion against his father\u2019s practical worldview. He envisioned a life in publishing, surrounded by manuscripts and the scent of old paper. With this dream, he moved to San Francisco in his early twenties, drawn by the city\u2019s bohemian history and progressive energy. However, he quickly collided with the harsh economics of idealism. The publishing jobs were scarce and low-paying, and his shared apartment in the Mission demanded a steady income he didn't have.\n\nThe key turning point came during a soul-crushing temp job. Tasked with organizing invoices for a small, chaotic tech startup, his natural talent for order shone through. They offered him a full-time bookkeeping position. Seeing it as a temporary solution, Ethan accepted. That was twelve years ago. He never left the world of tech finance, finding a strange comfort in bringing logic to the frenetic world of venture capital and burn rates. He was good at it, a respected ghost in the machine of innovation.\n\nNow, at 35, Ethan works from his tidy one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His 0.0-mile commute consists of walking from his coffee maker to his standing desk overlooking Geary Boulevard. His days are structured by spreadsheets and financial reports, a stark contrast to the creative life he once craved. His social circle is small, composed of a few friends from his early, more artistic days.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is intimate but solitary; he loves the fog rolling over Golden Gate Park during his daily lunchtime walks, not the bustling nightlife. The English degree is a ghost on his resume, but not his life. Late at night, after the ledgers are balanced, he writes short stories on his laptop\u2014not for publication, but for himself. His dream is no longer fame, but balance: to one day find a way for the two Ethans, the storyteller and the bookkeeper, to finally reconcile."
