Growing up in a small Ohio town, her family life revolved around her younger brother\u2019s chronic illness. Anya became a fluent translator of hospital jargon and a keen observer of the emotional toll it took on her parents. It was a compassionate hospital social worker who first showed her how empathy could be a profession, a guiding light in the sterile chaos of healthcare. This experience became her unwavering calling.\n\nSeeking a world beyond her hometown, she moved to California for her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The Bay Area\u2019s vibrant energy was a revelation, and it was here she met her husband, Kenji Tanaka, a landscape architect whose calm demeanor grounded her. After graduating, Anya honed her skills at a major San Francisco hospital, navigating the labyrinthine system she knew so well from the other side. While rewarding, the work was draining, and she felt the creeping tendrils of burnout. The turning point came when she realized she could offer more profound, individualized care outside the confines of institutional bureaucracy.\n\nNow, at 38, Anya\u2019s life is rooted in the fog-laced quiet of San Francisco's Inner Sunset. She and Kenji purchased a classic Edwardian, converting the ground-floor garden unit into her private practice. Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs. Her days are a structured rhythm of telehealth sessions and in-person appointments with clients grappling with illness, grief, and life transitions. She finds balance in her routine: a morning run through Golden Gate Park, grabbing a coffee at the small cafe on 9th Avenue, and ending the day collaborating with Kenji on their perpetually evolving garden.\n\nAnya feels deeply connected to the city that allowed her to build a life on her own terms. Her future aspirations are not about expansion, but depth. She dreams of starting a small, pro-bono support group for caregivers, bringing her life\u2019s work full circle. For Anya, success is measured in the quiet healing she facilitates, both in her clients\u2019 lives and in the peaceful, intentional world she has carefully built for herself."
