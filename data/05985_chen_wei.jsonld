Born in San Francisco to parents who had immigrated from Chengdu, his upbringing in the Outer Richmond was a blend of American cartoons and his mother's masterful home cooking. The kitchen was his true classroom, where he learned the delicate balance of *ma la* (numbing and spicy) that would come to define his life.\n\nHis \"some college\" education was a brief, pragmatic detour into a business administration program at CCSF. He tried to follow the expected path, but his notebooks filled with recipe ideas instead of lecture notes. The turning point came not as a grand epiphany, but as a quiet realization during a late-night prep shift at a Chinatown restaurant where he worked part-time. The meticulous craft of knife work and the roar of the wok felt more honest and vital than any textbook. He dropped out to learn the trade from the ground up, dedicating himself to the grueling but rewarding life of a line cook.\n\nA small inheritance from his late father provided the seed money for a massive risk. At 29, Wei poured every dollar and every ounce of his energy into opening \"Spicy Aroma,\" a modest 30-seat restaurant in the Inner Richmond, with a small apartment for himself right above it. This explains his zero-mile commute; his life and work are one.\n\nNow 37, Wei\u2019s days are a blur of repetition and passion. He\u2019s the first to arrive, personally selecting produce from local markets, and the last to leave after scrubbing the kitchen clean. His staff is his family, and his regulars are his community. His widowed mother is his most trusted critic, visiting weekly to sample new dishes and ensure he hasn\u2019t lost the taste of home. Wei isn't chasing Michelin stars or vast wealth. His dream is to earn a Bib Gourmand\u2014recognition for exceptional food at a reasonable price. He wants Spicy Aroma to be a neighborhood institution, a place that honors his heritage and proves his father's legacy was a worthy investment. Each night, as he locks the door, he\u2019s not just a restaurant owner; he\u2019s a storyteller, serving his family\u2019s history one plate at a time."
