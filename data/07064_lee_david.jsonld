A second-generation Chinese-American, he grew up helping his parents at their small neighborhood grocery store. From behind the counter, he watched the community\u2019s rhythms\u2014the elderly Cantonese-speaking grandmothers on their morning walks, the families struggling to make ends meet, and the subtle but persistent health disparities that marked their lives. This firsthand observation of systemic challenges planted a seed that would define his future.\n\nWhile his parents hoped he\u2019d pursue a more lucrative career, David felt a pull toward service. He attended UC Berkeley, initially undeclared, but a class on health equity ignited his passion. Witnessing his own grandparents navigate the bewildering American healthcare system with limited English solidified his path. He pursued a Master of Public Health, focusing on community health and education, determined to build bridges where he had seen walls. His early career involved grassroots outreach, working directly with immigrant communities before he steadily climbed the ladder to his current role as a Public Health Program Manager for a major healthcare provider.\n\nThe pandemic was a pivotal turning point, shifting his role to be fully remote. Now, his 0.0-mile commute anchors him to his Duboce Triangle apartment, a quiet, orderly sanctuary he shares with his partner, Alex, an architect, and their scruffy terrier, Mochi. His days are a mix of Zoom meetings with city health officials, analyzing data on health outcomes, and writing grants for wellness programs.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is deep and protective. He\u2019s not a transplant chasing a trend; he is part of the city's fabric. His mornings start with a walk to Duboce Park, and evenings often involve cooking with Alex or meeting a small circle of old friends. Though his work is demanding, his greatest aspiration is to launch a city-wide, multilingual health navigation program\u2014a direct tribute to the community that raised him. For David, success isn't a title or salary, but the quiet, profound satisfaction of improving the city that is, and always has been, his home."
