The son of Korean immigrants who ran a small grocery store in Daly City, David\u2019s childhood was steeped in pragmatism and the scent of produce. His parents, who had sacrificed everything for a foothold in America, hoped he would become an engineer or a doctor. But David was drawn to the hushed, cavernous halls of the de Young Museum, a world his father called \u201ca luxury we cannot afford.\u201d\n\nHis choice to study Arts Administration at San Francisco State University was a quiet rebellion. He wasn't an artist, but he understood systems, logistics, and people. He saw the invisible framework that held the beautiful things up. His career began not with glamour, but in the trenches: coordinating event rentals, managing ticketing systems, and later, overseeing facilities. He was the one who ensured the climate control was perfect for a fragile 17th-century tapestry and the one who managed the crew for a midnight installation of a massive Richard Serra sculpture. This behind-the-scenes mastery became his signature.\n\nA key turning point was a difficult exhibition in the late \u201890s that was plagued by shipping delays and a temperamental lead curator. David, then a mid-level manager, worked for 72 hours straight, calmly untangling logistical knots and placating partners. He saved the show, earning the respect that set him on the path to his directorship. His personal life has been less linear; a 15-year relationship with an abstract painter ended five years ago, a painful separation between the world of pure creation and structured reality.\n\nNow, at 50, his life has a comfortable rhythm. He lives in a meticulously kept apartment in the Inner Richmond. His day begins with the rumbling of the N-Judah for the 3.7-mile commute downtown. At the museum, he is the calm eye of the operational storm. Evenings are for cooking simple, elegant Korean meals and listening to jazz. His hope is to oversee the museum's next major capital campaign, securing its legacy for a new generation. Personally, he aspires to travel for pleasure again, not for work, and perhaps find a quiet companionship that complements, rather than clashes with, his orderly world. He remains a man who finds his deepest satisfaction in the perfect, seamless hum of the institution he so carefully maintains."

The scent of floor wax and controlled air was a shocking contrast to the sweet, earthy smell of his parents\u2019 grocery store. His father called this place a \"luxury,\" but to David, it felt like a sanctuary. He didn\u2019t just see the paintings; he felt the perfect, quiet order holding them. It wasn't rebellion that stirred in him that day, but a deep, secret sense of purpose. This was a system he needed to understand.\n\n2.\nLate 1990s. Forty-eight hours into a 72-hour crisis, a Dutch crate was stuck in customs. At 3 AM, over a crackling line to Amsterdam, he finally brokered its release. Hanging up, surrounded by cold coffee and shipping manifests, a wave of profound calm washed over him. Not triumph, but the quiet satisfaction of a solved puzzle. This was his art form: untangling chaos. It cemented his belief that the most important work happens when no one is watching.\n\n3.\nAround 2008, his father, stoic and aging, came to a major opening. David watched him ignore the art, instead scanning the ceilings and walls. Finally, his father gestured vaguely. \"It\u2019s not cold in here,\" he said. \"The lighting is good.\" It was the highest praise he could offer\u2014an acknowledgment of function, of flawless operation. For the first time, David felt his world wasn\u2019t a rebellion against his father\u2019s, but an evolution of it.\n\n4.\nEight years ago, he was in Lena\u2019s studio. She was a whirlwind of creation, paint flecking the floorboards as she worked. He loved her fire, but his eye kept drifting to a flickering light and the poorly sealed window letting in a draft. In that moment, he saw the unbridgeable gap: she lived for the beautiful storm of creation, while he found his peace in the quiet after. The love between them was real, but their realities could never truly merge.\n\n5.\nJust last winter, he came in before sunrise to check on the newly installed Serra sculpture. Alone in the silent gallery, he ran his hand over the immense, cold curve of the COR-TEN steel. The only sound was the faint, perfect hum of the climate control system\u2014a sound he had calibrated himself. In that moment, he felt a profound, solitary peace. He wasn\u2019t just an administrator; he was the keeper of the building\u2019s breath, the guardian of its silence."
