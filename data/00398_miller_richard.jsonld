Born and raised in an Ohio town where steel mills were closing, Richard saw his future written on the faces of his father and uncles: a life of hard labor with dwindling rewards. He wasn't an academic; school was a place to endure, not excel. After graduating high school, he worked a series of dead-end jobs before realizing a Commercial Driver's License was a ticket to a stable trade, a skill no one could take away.\n\nHe came west in his early twenties, not for the counter-culture, but for the promise of steady work. After a decade of long-haul routes, a turning point came when he landed a job hauling specialized equipment for a major tech company. The pay was better, the routes were local, and the benefits were solid. It also cemented his role as a ghost in the machine of the new economy. He delivered the expensive, fragile servers and prototypes that powered the digital world, often exchanging brief, transactional words with programmers half his age who looked right through him.\n\nHis personal life has been similarly pragmatic. A marriage in his thirties ended amicably; she was an artist who loved the idea of San Francisco more than the reality of being married to a man whose life was dictated by shipping manifests. Now, his connections are rooted in routine: the pre-dawn nod to the warehouse foreman, the familiar banter with other drivers at the depot, the friendly but distant relationship with his neighbors in his small Dogpatch apartment. His 0.0-mile commute means he lives and breathes his work, starting his day a stone's throw from the warehouse.\n\nRichard\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to climb the corporate ladder he delivers to. He saves diligently, his hope pinned on a quiet future. He aspires to buy a small house with a garage in coastal Oregon, a place where he can work on an old truck, fish on the weekends, and finally put the truck in park for good. He is an essential, invisible part of the city\u2019s engine, patiently hauling its future while dreaming of his own quiet escape."
