Born in Fremont to Iranian immigrants who fled Tehran in the late 90s, her childhood was filled with the scents of her mother\u2019s ghormeh sabzi and the diligent hum of her father\u2019s small rug import business. They instilled in her a profound sense of duty and the importance of community, values that drew her across the bay to San Francisco State University to study Social Work. She was determined to build bridges for families like her own.\n\nHer path was abruptly diverted during her junior year. Her father suffered a heart attack, and the family business faltered. Without hesitation, Nadia put her education on hold, returning home to help manage the shop and support her mother. The experience was a crucible, forging her theoretical knowledge into practical empathy. She learned firsthand the stress of navigating healthcare bureaucracy and the quiet desperation of keeping a family afloat.\n\nAfter her father recovered, returning to full-time study was financially impossible. Instead, Nadia channeled her passion into action, landing a role as a Bilingual Youth Program Coordinator at a non-profit in the Western Addition. Now, her life is a carefully budgeted routine. Her day begins with a crowded ride on the 38 Geary from her shared apartment in the Inner Richmond. At work, she is a lifeline for immigrant and refugee children, switching effortlessly between English and Farsi to help with homework, translate for parents during teacher conferences, and organize after-school activities.\n\nNadia lives on a tight budget, finding joy in simple things: walks through Golden Gate Park, sharing cheap, delicious dinners with her two roommates, and bi-weekly calls with her parents. San Francisco is both her sanctuary and a constant financial challenge. Her dream of finishing her degree and becoming a licensed clinical social worker still burns brightly. She saves what little she can, aspiring to one day open a community center that offers not just after-school help, but holistic support for entire families\u2014the very kind of support her own family needed."

The air smelled of wool, dust, and the ghormeh sabzi her mother was stewing for dinner. He\u2019d lift her up, his hands rough but gentle, explaining the story in the threads. In that moment, she learned that community wasn't just people; it was a tapestry of care and history woven together. It became the blueprint for the life she wanted to build for others.\n\n2.\nShe remembers the fluorescent buzz of the SF State library when her phone vibrated. Her mother\u2019s voice was a fractured whisper: \u201cBaba\u2026 the hospital.\u201d The world of social theory she was studying collapsed into a single, terrifying point of reality. Duty, once a concept discussed in class, became a visceral pull in her gut. She packed her bag, left the library, and crossed the bridge back to Fremont, a student no longer. Her education in empathy had just truly begun.\n\n3.\nDuring that frantic year managing the shop after leaving school, an older woman came in, not for a rug, but with a confusing medical bill. They sat together on a stack of Kashan carpets, Nadia translating the formal English into gentle Farsi. For a moment, she wasn't a daughter carrying a business, but a bridge. Seeing the woman\u2019s shoulders relax was more rewarding than any sale. It was the first time her life\u2019s work felt not like a diverted path, but a destined one.\n\n4.\nLast spring, a quiet girl from Herat refused to speak in class for weeks. Nadia sat with her during homework time, speaking Farsi softly, never pushing. One afternoon, while looking at a picture book, the girl pointed to a cat and whispered, \u201cGorbeh.\u201d Nadia\u2019s heart seized. It wasn\u2019t just a word; it was a door creaking open. In that moment, she felt the profound power of her dual identity\u2014not as a burden, but as a key that could unlock a child\u2019s lonely world.\n\n5.\nOn a foggy Tuesday evening after a draining day, feeling the familiar pinch of her budget, she walked to the Dutch Windmill in Golden Gate Park. The salty air was thick and cold. Leaning against the wall, she watched the massive arms turn with relentless grace against the gray sky. The motion was a quiet promise. It reminded her that even when exhausted and unseen, persistence creates its own power. Her dream of a community center felt less distant then, powered by that same steady, enduring rotation."
