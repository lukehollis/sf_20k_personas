Born in Honolulu to a Native Hawaiian longshoreman and a second-generation Chinese-American bookkeeper, she grew up watching giant container ships glide into port, keenly aware that every item on the island, from rice to car parts, had a story of transit. This practical, port-side upbringing instilled in her a deep understanding of systems and a no-nonsense work ethic.\n\nShe moved to the mainland for college, choosing the practical path of Supply Chain Management at Cal Poly. While her peers were chasing the speculative glitz of the first dot-com bubble, Leilani found her niche in its physical backbone. She started as a coordinator, orchestrating the delivery of servers and infrastructure that powered the burgeoning digital world. As the tech industry ebbed and flowed, her skills remained essential, allowing her to methodically climb the corporate ladder.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. A painful divorce left her feeling unmoored, prompting her to pour her energy into her career with a new ferocity. She became known for her calm authority in high-pressure situations, navigating the logistical chaos of port strikes and natural disasters. Now, as a Director of Logistics, she oversees a complex web of transportation and warehousing that keeps Northern California running.\n\nAt 50, Leilani lives a life of controlled efficiency and quiet comfort in her Cole Valley condo. Her day begins before sunrise, catching the N Judah MUNI for the 4.8-mile trip downtown. Her social life is small but deep, centered on a few close friends and a weekly volunteer shift at a local food bank, where she helps optimize their distribution. She finds peace walking the trails at Lands End, the view of the container ships in the distance a familiar comfort. While proud of her professional success, Leilani dreams of a third act. She envisions starting a consulting firm to help small, local businesses build ethical and sustainable supply chains, bringing her life full circle\u2014from watching the ships in Honolulu to helping her San Francisco community thrive."

He pointed his chin toward a massive container ship, a floating city of steel. \u201cEverything has to come from somewhere, *pua*,\u201d he\u2019d rumbled. In that moment, the world wasn\u2019t magic; it was a series of movements, a grand, logical dance. It was the first system she ever truly understood, a lesson in practicality that became her foundation and sparked a lifelong awe.\n\n2.\nThe dot-com warehouse in 1999 was pure chaos. An entire startup\u2019s future was on pallets, the truck was late, and VPs were shouting about burn rates. While others panicked, Leilani grabbed a clipboard and felt a strange calm. Mapping the physical flow of servers from dock to rack was real. She realized then that while others chased ghosts in the machine, she would be the one to make sure the machine was delivered and plugged in. It solidified her identity as an architect of the tangible world.\n\n3.\nIt was 2011, the first Monday after he\u2019d moved out. The Cole Valley condo was silent and cavernous. She felt adrift, a ship cut from its moorings. Then she saw her work briefcase by the door, a solid, tangible thing in a life that had become fluid and uncertain. She grabbed it, the worn leather a comfort. Order. That was something she could control. She walked to the N Judah an hour early, determined to channel the storm inside her into solving problems on a global scale.\n\n4.\nDuring the 2016 port strike, the meeting room was a knot of anger. She didn\u2019t see executives and union reps; she saw men who looked like her father, their livelihoods stalled. Instead of raising her voice, she spoke quietly about demurrage fees and terminal velocity, translating corporate panic into the practical language of the docks. She found a workable path forward. It wasn't about winning; it was about getting things moving again. That day, she honored her past by mastering her present.\n\n5.\nLast Saturday, the fog broke over Lands End. Leilani stood on the muddy trail, watching a familiar container ship glide beneath the Golden Gate. The sight, once a symbol of vast, impersonal systems, now felt different. She saw not just cargo, but coffee for a shop in the Mission, fabric for a designer in the Haight. Her purpose crystallized with the view: it was time to help the small boats navigate the massive currents she knew so well. It was time to bring the ships home."
