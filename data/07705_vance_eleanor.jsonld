The daughter of a union carpenter and a public-school administrator, she grew up understanding the value of a stable home and the systems that either protect or endanger it. While her peers dreamed of escaping the Midwest, Eleanor studied it, earning an undergraduate degree in Urban Studies, fascinated by how cities function and communities thrive or fail.\n\nCalifornia was the true turning point. She moved west for law school at UC Hastings, drawn to its public interest programs. The initial allure of San Francisco was its vibrant counter-culture and progressive ideals, a stark contrast to her predictable upbringing. After graduating, a brief, soul-crushing stint at a corporate firm handling commercial real estate deals solidified her path. She hated helping faceless developers maximize profits. This disillusionment led her to her current role at a legal services non-profit, where she became a formidable real estate attorney for the people.\n\nNow, at 40, Eleanor\u2019s life is deeply embedded in her Cole Valley neighborhood. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to a post-pandemic shift she embraced fully. Her office is a sunlit corner of her second-floor apartment, overlooking the N-Judah line. Her days are a disciplined rhythm: a morning walk through the Panhandle for coffee, followed by hours of drafting motions, advising tenants on their rights, and negotiating with landlords\u2019 attorneys over Zoom.\n\nHer social life is a tight-knit \"found family\" \u2013 a book club with other professional women, a weekend hiking group that tackles trails on Mount Tam, and a few close friends from her law school days. While past long-term relationships have ended, she finds fulfillment in her work and community. Eleanor\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to get rich; it\u2019s to effect systemic change. She aspires to move from direct client services to policy advocacy, working with city supervisors to draft stronger tenant protections and help create community land trusts. For Eleanor, her home in San Francisco isn't just property; it's the very foundation of a just life, a principle she defends one case at a time from her desk just steps from her bed."
