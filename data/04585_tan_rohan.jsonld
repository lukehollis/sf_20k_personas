Born and raised in the Excelsior District, he is the son of Filipino immigrants who embodied the city\u2019s working-class grit; his father was a lifelong Muni driver and his mother, a nursing home caregiver. From a young age, Rohan was more interested in deconstructing household electronics than grappling with abstract theories in a textbook. His parents, hoping for a four-year university degree, watched with a mix of pride and concern as he rewired old radios and fixed neighborhood VCRs with an intuitive talent that school never seemed to tap into.\n\nAfter a lackluster high school career, Rohan bypassed the traditional university route that his friends took. He found his footing at City College of San Francisco. It was there, in an Electronics Technology program, that his passion for tinkering was finally given a schematic. He thrived in the hands-on labs, his mind lighting up with the logic of circuits and systems. This Associate's Degree became his key, not to a corporate office, but to a world he genuinely loved.\n\nHis turning point came through an internship at a small-batch manufacturing firm in the Dogpatch neighborhood, a company specializing in custom audio and lighting equipment. He was hired full-time upon graduation and has been there ever since. A few years ago, when a loft apartment opened up in the same converted warehouse as his workshop, he jumped at the chance. His commute is now a simple walk down a flight of industrial steel stairs.\n\nRohan\u2019s life is contained and content. His days are filled with the scent of solder and the hum of machinery. His social circle is tight-knit\u2014colleagues who\u2019ve become family and a steady girlfriend, Maya, a UX designer who is fascinated by the tangible things he creates. His San Francisco isn\u2019t the Golden Gate Bridge or cable cars; it's the local brewery down the block, the weekend basketball game at Potrero Del Sol park, and the quiet satisfaction of building something real with his hands. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to get rich, but to one day co-own the workshop, perfecting his craft and creating his own line of bespoke audio amplifiers. He is a testament to the city\u2019s maker spirit, a quiet artisan building his life in the industrial heart of San Francisco."

His father, smelling of city air and exhaustion, pointed out the simple, heavy switches. Rohan didn't care about the route; he cared about the machinery. He saw the pride in his father\u2019s tired hands and understood that some of the most important work didn't happen in an office. It was a lesson about labor and dignity he never forgot.\n\n2.\nHe remembers Mrs. Santos crying when he returned her VCR. He\u2019d spent a weekend coaxing it back to life, replacing a brittle belt with a carefully selected rubber band. When the machine played a flickering tape of her late husband, she held Rohan\u2019s hand, her gratitude more meaningful than any grade on a report card. In that Excelsior living room, he understood his tinkering wasn't a distraction; it was a way to restore people\u2019s most precious moments.\n\n3.\nThe City College electronics lab was a revelation. He remembers the moment his first complex breadboard project worked. After hours of careful work, following the schematic\u2019s elegant logic, he flipped a switch and a single green LED lit up\u2014bright and steady. It wasn't just light; it was proof. For the first time, his intuitive mind and the world of technical theory fused into a single, brilliant circuit. He knew, with absolute certainty, that he had found his language.\n\n4.\nDuring his internship, his boss pointed to a vintage amplifier covered in workshop dust. \"See what you can do,\" was all he said. That quiet trust was terrifying and exhilarating. Rohan spent days meticulously cleaning contacts and tracing dead channels. When he finally coaxed a clean, warm sound from the speakers, the nod of approval he received was more validating than any diploma. It was the moment he went from a kid who tinkers to a technician who creates.\n\n5.\nThe first night in his Dogpatch loft was silent, but not still. Lying in bed, he could feel a low, familiar vibration through the floorboards\u2014the hum of the ventilation system from his workshop directly below. It was the sound of his livelihood, his passion. It wasn't noise; it was a lullaby. He smiled in the dark, realizing his entire world was finally, perfectly, in one place. This was his version of success."
