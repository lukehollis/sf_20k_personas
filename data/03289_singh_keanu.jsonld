The son of a Punjabi immigrant father who drove a taxi for three decades and a third-generation Japanese-Hawaiian mother who worked as a nurse at SF General, Keanu grew up in Daly City hearing stories of two very different worlds united by a shared work ethic. He saw San Francisco not as a glittering postcard, but as a complex machine of services, regulations, and communities his parents navigated daily.\n\nThis firsthand view of the city\u2019s inner workings fueled his academic path. After earning a B.A. in Political Science from UC Davis, he witnessed the growing housing crisis displace family friends. This was the turning point. It wasn't an abstract problem; it was personal. He dedicated himself to public service, earning a Master of Public Policy from UC Berkeley, focusing on urban planning and housing affordability.\n\nLanding a job as a Policy Analyst for the City and County felt like coming home. Now 30, Keanu works on the very issues that shaped his youth. His 0.0-mile commute means his world is his Hayes Valley apartment, a space that doubles as his office. His days are a disciplined cycle of early morning coffee from a local cafe, followed by hours of data analysis, stakeholder Zoom calls, and writing dense policy briefs on zoning ordinances and affordable housing initiatives.\n\nHis social life is his escape from the policy bubble. He reconnects with grad school friends for trivia nights in the Mission or rock climbing at Dogpatch Boulders. He\u2019s currently navigating the city\u2019s notoriously difficult dating scene with a mix of optimism and pragmatism. Though tethered to his laptop, his connection to San Francisco is profound. He feels its pulse through the data points he analyzes and the neighborhood he walks through each evening.\n\nKeanu's ultimate dream is to see a piece of legislation he drafted make a tangible difference\u2014to help create a city where a nurse and a taxi driver could still afford to raise a family. He hopes to build a future for San Francisco that honors the diverse, working-class spirit that raised him."

Keanu was focused on the meter, the crackle of the dispatch radio, and his father\u2019s calm voice naming every cross street in the Tenderloin. He wasn\u2019t seeing a landmark; he was seeing a map of his father\u2019s long days. That night, San Francisco solidified in his mind not as a place of beauty, but as a complex system of survival and mastery.\n\n2.\nFourteen years old, at the Thanksgiving table in Daly City. His mother\u2019s family brought mochi from Japantown, sweet and perfectly chewy. His father\u2019s sisters brought chana masala, aromatic and warm. He\u2019d have a piece of one, then a spoonful of the other. The textures and tastes didn\u2019t clash; they created a third, unique flavor that was simply *home*. It taught him that disparate worlds could not only coexist but create something stronger together. This became a core belief of his, a fusion he hoped to foster in the city itself.\n\n3.\nHe was nineteen, home from UC Davis for the summer, helping his childhood neighbors, the Delacruz family, move to Vallejo. He spent a Saturday hauling boxes, the screech of the packing tape sounding like a protest. Mrs. Delacruz, who always shared her lumpia, cried while emptying her kitchen. Keanu felt a hot, useless anger. These weren't statistics from a textbook; this was the sound of a community breaking apart. He sealed a box labeled \"Photos\" and in that moment, sealed his own resolve to fight this exact problem.\n\n4.\nIt was 2 AM in a Berkeley library during his master\u2019s program. He stared at a digital map of San Francisco, dotted with eviction notices from the early 2000s. He zoomed in on a cluster in the Mission District and felt a chill. He remembered his father, exhausted after a long shift, talking about another driver who\u2019d lost his apartment there. The data points weren't abstract; they were stories. They were lost livelihoods. In that silent library, his life\u2019s work snapped into focus: to translate those dots back into people.\n\n5.\nLast year, on a Tuesday night Zoom call. It was a public input session for a zoning change in the Excelsior. A woman, a home healthcare aide, spoke with quiet frustration about her endless commute and rising rent. Her words were almost a perfect echo of conversations his own mother used to have at their dinner table twenty years ago. Keanu, on mute, just listened. For the first time, his job didn't feel like analyzing policy. It felt like he was finally in the room to help answer his mother\u2019s long-standing worries."
