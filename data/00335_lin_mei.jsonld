The daughter of hardworking Chinese immigrants, she grew up in the fog-drenched avenues of the Sunset District. Her parents ran a small laundromat on Noriega Street, where the scent of bleach and the rhythmic churn of machines formed the soundtrack of her childhood. They preached practicality and stability, hoping she would pursue a secure profession. Mei, however, was drawn to stories and people, earning a Bachelor's in Communications from San Francisco State University, a choice her parents found worryingly abstract.\n\nHer career began not by design, but by chance. In the late 90s, she took a temp job as a receptionist for a fledgling dot-com south of Market. Amidst the chaos of launch deadlines and venture capital pitches, Mei\u2019s innate ability to create order from entropy shone. She anticipated needs, streamlined processes, and managed the volatile personalities of young engineers and ambitious founders. She quickly became the office manager, the indispensable human glue holding the operation together. For two decades, she surfed the waves of tech booms and busts, her role as the calm, organizational center a constant.\n\nThe pandemic was her great turning point. The bustling SOMA office she had curated for years vanished overnight, replaced by the quiet of her one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute was a revelation. Her life, once dictated by the MUNI schedule and chaotic open-plan offices, was suddenly her own. She replaced frantic mornings with peaceful walks in Golden Gate Park, listening to podcasts instead of all-hands meetings.\n\nNow, at 46, Mei manages a fully remote team with quiet efficiency from her standing desk. Her apartment, once just a place to sleep, is a sanctuary filled with thriving plants and stacks of books. While she misses the energy of her old colleagues, she\u2019s reconnected with neighborhood friends over dinners at local Clement Street restaurants. Stable and secure, she harbors a new dream: to leave tech behind. She envisions opening a small, meticulously organized shop in her neighborhood\u2014a quiet place selling curated books and beautiful houseplants, a tangible world she can cultivate herself, far from the digital noise that defined so much of her life."
