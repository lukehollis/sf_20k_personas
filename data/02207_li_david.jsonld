The only son of first-generation immigrants, he grew up behind the counter of his family\u2019s small grocery store in the Outer Sunset. He watched his parents work with a tireless, physical exhaustion that he vowed to escape. Their dream for him wasn't wealth, but stability\u2014a life of the mind, not of the body. Driven by this, David excelled, earning a scholarship to UC Berkeley and later pursuing a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Stanford, fascinated by the intersection of people and the systems they use.\n\nHis career as a management consultant in technology was a direct fulfillment of that youthful vow. For over a decade, his life was lived in airport lounges, sterile hotel rooms, and the gleaming boardrooms of tech giants. He was brilliant, sought-after, and utterly rootless, a ghost in his own expensive Hayes Valley condo. A long-term relationship withered under the strain of constant travel and his singular focus on the next project, the next promotion.\n\nThe global pandemic in 2020 was the turning point he never knew he needed. The abrupt halt to travel grounded him, forcing him to inhabit the life he had built but never lived in. His commute shrank from 5,000 miles to zero. For the first time, he learned the name of his local barista, discovered the quiet trails of Mount Sutro, and felt the specific chill of the evening fog rolling into his neighborhood.\n\nNow, at 39, David\u2019s days are structured around a new, local rhythm. A morning run, a pour-over coffee from his favorite cafe, and then hours of strategic video calls from his minimalist home office. The anchorless ambition has been replaced by a quiet desire for connection. He\u2019s re-engaging with old university friends and tentatively exploring the city's social scene, seeking genuine relationships over networking contacts. His aspiration is no longer just to climb higher but to build something tangible in the city he\u2019s finally inhabiting\u2014perhaps advising a local startup, or simply cultivating a life that feels as real and present as his parents' was, but on his own terms."
