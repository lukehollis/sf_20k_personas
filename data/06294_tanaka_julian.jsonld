His commute from his minimalist second-floor apartment to the kitchen of his restaurant, *Kaze*, is a simple flight of stairs. Now 54, Julian is a fixture in the San Francisco culinary scene, a status built on decades of relentless dedication.\n\nBorn in San Jose to third-generation Japanese-American (Sansei) parents, Julian grew up in a world of suburban expectation. His father, an engineer, envisioned a stable, white-collar future for his son. Julian dutifully enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's degree in Business Administration that felt utterly foreign to him. To avoid returning home, he took a job as a dishwasher in a bustling North Beach restaurant. It was there, amidst the clatter of pans and the intense heat of the line, that he found his calling.\n\nThe kitchen was a meritocracy. He absorbed everything, rising from dishwasher to prep cook, his natural palate and work ethic catching the eye of the gruff French chef-owner. This chef became his mentor, teaching him classical technique, which Julian began to fuse with the subtle, seasonal flavors of his Japanese heritage. He spent his twenties and thirties working his way up in various kitchens, a period that cost him his marriage but solidified his ambition.\n\nThe turning point was purchasing a defunct laundromat in a then-gritty Hayes Valley. He poured every cent he had into creating *Kaze*, a small, intimate space dedicated to Japanese-inspired Californian cuisine. The early years were a blur of 18-hour days, but his reputation for precision and artistry grew steadily.\n\nToday, Julian's routine is monastic. He\u2019s at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market by dawn, hand-selecting produce. The rest of his day is a ritual of prep, staff management, and service. His personal life is spare; his relationships are with his suppliers and his small, loyal staff. His adult daughter, Maya, who lives in Oakland, is his primary connection to a world outside the restaurant, though their calls are often scheduled around his prep schedule. Julian\u2019s dream is no longer about expansion but legacy. He quietly covets a Michelin star\u2014not for ego, but as the ultimate validation for a life spent in service to his craft. He hopes, one day, to find a successor worthy of *Kaze*, so he can finally take a trip with Maya, without worrying if the fish delivery arrived on time."
