Born in Hayward to a Samoan mother, a warm and community-focused nurse, and an Indian father, a driven software engineer, Tui\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two vibrant, yet disparate, cultures. His home was filled with the scent of both coconut oil and curry, and his ears with stories of island legends and Hindu epics.\n\nFollowing his father\u2019s practical guidance, Tui enrolled in computer science at a state college. He spent two years staring at lines of code, feeling a profound sense of disconnection. The abstract logic felt sterile compared to the rich, human-centric worlds his mother had taught him to value. The turning point came during a summer break when he took a part-time job at a daycare to earn extra money. Surrounded by the chaos, creativity, and unfiltered emotion of four-year-olds, he felt an immediate and undeniable sense of purpose. He never returned for his junior year.\n\nDisappointing his father was difficult, but Tui knew he had to forge his own path. He moved across the bay to San Francisco, seeking a life less defined by tech fortunes. He found an assistant teacher position at a small, play-based preschool in the Inner Richmond. His life is now contained within a few blocks; his apartment is a small studio above a bakery just a three-minute walk from work, making his commute a daily non-event.\n\nHis days are a whirlwind of storytelling, mediating disputes over wooden blocks, and wiping away tears. In the evenings, he unwinds by walking through Golden Gate Park or visiting his favorite boba shop on Clement Street. His social circle is small but tight-knit, consisting of his lead teacher, a few parents, and the owner of the local bookstore.\n\nTui is content, but not complacent. He is slowly taking online courses to earn his early childhood education credential. His dream is to one day open his own preschool, one that intentionally weaves together diverse stories and traditions, creating a space where children from all backgrounds feel seen\u2014a reflection of the world he always wished he'd had."

In the kitchen, his Samoan mother and aunties were pulling a steaming pan of palusami from the oven, laughing as they placed it on the table next to the samosas. The scent of curry and coconut hung together in the air. For Tui, it wasn't two cultures colliding, but one beautiful, complete world. It became the blueprint for the sense of belonging he would later strive to create for others.\n\n2.\nIt was a sweltering July afternoon at the daycare. A quiet boy, Leo, hadn't spoken all day. Tui sat beside him and softly began telling the story of M\u0101ui pulling the islands from the sea. As he described the magic fish hook, Leo looked up, his eyes wide, and whispered, \"More?\" In that single word, Tui felt a jolt of connection more real than any line of code he had ever written. He knew, with absolute certainty, he was done with computer science. This was what mattered.\n\n3.\nThe fight with his father over dropping out had been a wall of silence and disappointment. Tui felt utterly adrift. Then, a week later, he found a book on his bed: *Theories of Childhood Development*. There was no note. It wasn't forgiveness, and it wasn't approval. It was his father\u2019s practical way of acknowledging his new path. That quiet, pragmatic gesture gave him the strength to forgive himself and truly begin his new life, knowing love could exist even within disapproval.\n\n4.\nHis first morning in San Francisco, he woke to the warm smell of croissants from the bakery below his studio. He walked the three minutes to the preschool, passing the bookstore he\u2019d soon frequent and the boba shop that would become his ritual. The fog was cool on his face, the neighborhood sounds gentle. He realized his entire world\u2014home, work, community\u2014was now beautifully contained within a few blocks. This wasn\u2019t an escape; it was an arrival. He felt, for the first time, perfectly placed.\n\n5.\nDuring story time last spring, he impulsively wove a tale of the Samoan goddess Nafanua together with the story of the Hindu goddess Durga, both powerful protectors. Later, a mother pulled him aside, eyes wet with gratitude. \"My daughter is half-Indian, half-Fijian,\" she said quietly. \"Today, you made her feel completely seen.\" In that moment, Tui's vague dream of opening his own school sharpened into a clear, undeniable mission. He wasn't just a teacher; he was building the world he'd always wished for."
