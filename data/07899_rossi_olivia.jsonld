Raised in the manicured comfort of Walnut Creek by a risk-averse accountant father and a pragmatic high school teacher mother, Olivia\u2019s upbringing was stable and predictable. She was encouraged to follow a secure path, but a restless curiosity about the larger systems that governed society led her to major in Political Science at UC Davis. She imagined a future in diplomacy or policy-making, a world of ideas and influence.\n\nA junior year internship, taken on a whim to bolster her resume, changed everything. It wasn't at a think tank, but at a major investment bank in Sacramento. There, amidst the hum of servers and the quiet intensity of traders, Olivia discovered a surprising aptitude for market analysis\u2014a different kind of system to master, one with immediate, quantifiable results. The clear path to financial independence was a powerful lure compared to the uncertain trajectory of a political career. Upon graduation, she accepted a position as a Financial Analyst, trading her ideals for a six-figure salary and a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco\u2019s Hayes Valley.\n\nJust as she was settling into the rhythm of office life, the pandemic shifted her company to a fully remote model, a policy that became permanent. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within the walls of her apartment. Her days are a disciplined cycle of early morning coffee, intense hours logged into complex financial models, and a sharp 6 PM logout. Her social life is intentional and scheduled, revolving around a tight-knit group of college friends and the often-impersonal ritual of dating apps.\n\nThough successful, Olivia feels a growing disconnect. She loves San Francisco for its vibrant weekends\u2014exploring the Mission\u2019s culinary scene, hiking in the Marin Headlands\u2014but feels detached from its daily pulse. Her political science books gather dust, a reminder of a different ambition. Her current dream is to bridge that gap: to move into impact investing, using her financial acumen to fund companies dedicated to social or environmental change. She yearns to make her analytical skills serve a purpose beyond profit, to finally connect the secure world her parents wanted for her with the meaningful one she once envisioned for herself."
