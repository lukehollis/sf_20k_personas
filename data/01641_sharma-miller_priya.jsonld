Born in Berkeley to an Indian immigrant mother, a vibrant textiles artist, and a quiet, methodical American father, a linguistics professor, Priya\u2019s childhood was a masterclass in navigating different worlds. Her home was a blend of fragrant spices and dusty academic journals, a place where understanding complex systems\u2014whether a sentence structure or a supply chain\u2014was a dinner table topic. This upbringing instilled in her a unique ability to see the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate things.\n\nChoosing a practical path, Priya earned a Business Administration degree from San Jose State University. She was drawn to the tangible, logical puzzle of logistics. She began her career in the bustling Port of Oakland, learning the intricate dance of ships, trucks, and containers. With relentless competence and a calm demeanor that belied the high-stakes pressure, she rose through the ranks. She wasn\u2019t a flashy leader, but a respected one, known for untangling impossible knots in global supply lines with a few precise phone calls.\n\nHer life\u2019s anchor is her husband of 22 years, Alex Miller, a graphic designer she met at a friend\u2019s barbecue. Their shared decision to not have children allowed them to pour their energies into their careers and a deep, supportive partnership. The most significant recent turning point was the pandemic-induced shift to permanent remote work. Her 0.0-mile commute transformed her life.\n\nToday, Priya manages a complex global supply chain from a spare bedroom in her serene Noe Valley home. Her mornings begin not with a frantic BART ride, but a quiet walk to a local bakery for coffee and a croissant. Her day is a sequence of intense video calls, troubleshooting port delays in Singapore or customs issues in Rotterdam. The stress is immense, but now contained within her own walls. In the evenings, she and Alex take long walks through the neighborhood, discussing his latest design project or her plans for streamlining a supplier\u2019s route.\n\nAt 51, Priya\u2019s aspirations have shifted. She no longer chases promotions. Her dream is to leverage her decades of expertise into a consulting practice, working on her own terms. She envisions a future with less crisis management and more time for travel with Alex, and perhaps, finally taking a pottery class\u2014creating something tangible and beautiful, just for herself."
