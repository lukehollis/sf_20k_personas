Born and raised in the Fillmore District to a Muni bus driver father and a community health clinic administrator mother, she learned early that a city\u2019s health depends on its arteries. She absorbed her parents\u2019 deep sense of civic duty, watching neighborhoods change and long-time residents get priced out. This fueled her decision to attend San Francisco State University, where she earned a degree in Urban Planning and Public Administration, determined to understand the systems that shaped her world.\n\nHer career began in the trenches of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), starting as a planning assistant. Anya\u2019s sharp mind and no-nonsense work ethic saw her rise steadily. She married young, a brief but formative relationship with a Russian immigrant musician that left her with the surname Volkova, which she kept as a quiet testament to her own complex history. The marriage\u2019s end became a turning point, solidifying her focus on her career and her city.\n\nNow 46, Anya is a formidable Transit Operations Manager. Her days are a high-stakes ballet of logistics, crisis management, and personnel issues. Her own 4.8-mile commute from her modest Inner Sunset apartment to her office downtown is her daily field inspection. Riding the N-Judah, she\u2019s not just a passenger; she\u2019s a diagnostician, noting timing discrepancies, vehicle cleanliness, and operator morale.\n\nAnya\u2019s social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow city lifers who remember the San Francisco of the 90s. They meet for drinks in Cole Valley or dim sum on Clement Street, bemoaning tech-fueled changes while fiercely defending the city\u2019s soul. Her true connection remains with the system she manages. Her aspiration isn\u2019t a bigger salary or a Bay-view condo, but a truly equitable and efficient transit system. She dreams of a day when a bus driver\u2019s child can afford to live and thrive in the city her father served, a legacy she works tirelessly to make possible, one scheduled run at a time."

His hands covered hers on the enormous steering wheel as he explained how this one vehicle connected Chinatown to the Marina. For Anya, it wasn't a bus; it was a vessel of civic life, and her father was its captain. In that moment, the hum of the city\u2019s engine became her own heartbeat, a rhythm she\u2019d dedicate her life to maintaining.\n\n2.\nThe fight that ended her marriage wasn\u2019t about infidelity but about ideology. \"You love this city\u2019s systems more than you love a person,\" her husband had yelled, his musician\u2019s soul clashing with her planner\u2019s mind. At 28, the words stung but also rang with a clarifying truth. He saw schedules and concrete; she saw lifelines. The silence after he left wasn\u2019t emptiness, but focus. Keeping his name, Volkova, was a quiet acknowledgment of the complex choice she had made: San Francisco itself.\n\n3.\nHer first year at the SFMTA, fresh from SF State, she presented a route efficiency proposal to a room of veteran operators. A driver with 30 years on the 38-Geary line stood up and systematically tore it apart, citing traffic patterns and passenger habits her data missed. The flush of public humiliation was intense. But it forged her core principle: theory is useless without the wisdom of the person behind the wheel. She learned that day to listen before she ever dared to plan.\n\n4.\nIt was about ten years ago when she saw the \"For Lease\" sign on the window of her favorite dim sum place on Clement Street, a spot her family had gone to for decades. A week later, a sleek, minimalist tech-funded boba shop was announced for the space. It wasn\u2019t progress, it was an erasure. A deep, protective anger settled in her bones that day. Her work was no longer just about function; it became a quiet, fierce fight to keep the city's soul from being sold to the highest bidder.\n\n5.\nIt was 1 a.m. last winter, a power line down on the T-Third during a storm. A young operator, her voice trembling on the phone, was stranded with a full train. Anya stayed on the line, not as a manager, but as a calming presence, talking her through the protocol until help arrived. Hearing the operator's sigh of relief, she saw her father's face. This was the legacy\u2014not just managing a system, but taking care of the people who were its lifeblood, just as her father once was."
