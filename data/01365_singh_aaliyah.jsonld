Her life, much like the sets she helps create, is assembled from unconventional pieces. Raised on a Sausalito houseboat by a philosopher father and a textile artist mother, Aaliyah\u2019s childhood was a lesson in resourcefulness and aesthetics. Formal schooling was secondary to learning how to patch a hull, identify migratory birds, and appreciate the narrative weight of a worn-out object.\n\nForgoing university, she spent her early twenties traveling, collecting experiences instead of degrees. It was a chance encounter in a dusty Marrakesh market that crystallized her calling. Watching a photographer meticulously arrange local crafts for a shoot, she realized her innate talent for telling stories with objects. Back in the Bay Area, she talked her way into an unpaid internship with a commercial photographer, quickly proving her value. Now, at 38, she is the indispensable assistant to a top-tier prop stylist, her eye for detail and knack for sourcing obscure items\u2014from pre-war typewriters to specific shades of faded velvet\u2014making her a quiet legend in their small circle.\n\nHer zero-mile commute is the cornerstone of her lifestyle. Mornings are for coffee and sketching ideas, afternoons are for building sets in her studio space, and evenings are often spent hunting for treasures in Alameda antique fairs or Mission district thrift stores. A painful breakup in her late twenties with a partner who craved a stability she couldn't offer cemented her path; she chose the beautiful uncertainty of her craft. Her social life is a small, tight-knit group of fellow creatives who trade skills and inspiration over drinks at a nearby brewery.\n\nAaliyah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tactile. She feels it in the cold fog that rolls over Potrero Hill and in the history of the reclaimed industrial materials she works with. Her dream is to step out from her mentor\u2019s shadow and become a lead stylist, her name synonymous with evocative, soulful set design. She doesn't aspire to wealth, but to creative autonomy\u2014the freedom to build entire worlds from the stories objects tell."
