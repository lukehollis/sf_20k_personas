Raised by a Black father, a proud third-generation San Franciscan who drove a Muni bus, and a pragmatic Filipina mother who worked long shifts as a nurse at SF General, Kiara\u2019s childhood was a blend of rich cultures and working-class realities. Her parents preached the gospel of stability, envisioning a future for her with a secure job and a business degree.\n\nShe tried to follow their path, enrolling in the business program at San Francisco State University. But the lectures on marketing and accounting felt hollow. The city outside her classroom window was infinitely more compelling. The real turning point came when her grandfather passed away, leaving her his old, heavy Pentax K1000 film camera. Holding it felt more natural than holding any textbook. She started skipping classes to wander the Mission, capturing the defiant murals, or to Ocean Beach, documenting the powerful dance between the waves and the shoreline. After two aimless years, she dropped out, a decision that created a quiet rift with her parents.\n\nHer entry into the arts was a grind. She worked as a barista, using her tips to buy film and her days off to build a portfolio by shooting local bands for free. Her break came when a food photographer, impressed by her raw talent and work ethic, hired her as an assistant. Now, at 32, Kiara is a sought-after freelance assistant. Her \"0.0 mile commute\" is a technicality; her small, rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond is her command center, but her real office is the entire Bay Area. One day she\u2019s hauling lighting rigs for a fashion shoot in SoMa, the next she\u2019s meticulously arranging props for a product shot in a Dogpatch studio.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight-knit circle of other creatives who understand the freelance hustle. Her dream is to finally step out from behind the lead photographer. She spends her rare free moments on a personal project, a photo series documenting the legacy businesses and long-time residents of her neighborhood, a quiet act of preservation against the city's relentless change. Kiara aspires to have her own gallery show one day, to prove to her parents, and to herself, that the unsteady, light-chasing path she chose was the right one all along."
