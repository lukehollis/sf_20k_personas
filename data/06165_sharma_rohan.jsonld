            "value": "Rohan Sharma is a son of the San Francisco fog. Born and raised in the Sunset District to parents who immigrated from Punjab, India, his childhood was a blend of his family's heritage and the city\u2019s laid-back, multicultural rhythm. His father, a taxi driver, and his mother, who worked in a bakery, preached the gospel of education. For them, Rohan\u2019s success was the entire point of their trans-Pacific journey. He was a bright, dutiful son who enrolled at San Francisco State University, initially planning to major in business, a practical path they all agreed upon.\n\nThe turning point came during his sophomore year. His father suffered a debilitating stroke, instantly transforming Rohan from a full-time student into a part-time caregiver. The abstract world of business theory felt meaningless compared to the immediate, tangible needs of helping his father relearn to walk and speak. He saw the profound impact of the nurses and assistants who cared for his dad with quiet dignity. Dropping out of SF State wasn't a single decision but a slow drift as family responsibilities mounted. Instead of returning, Rohan enrolled in a short, intensive program and earned his Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) license. It was a choice born from crisis, but one that gave him a new, unexpected purpose.\n\nNow, at 34, Rohan\u2019s world is contained within a few city blocks of the Inner Richmond. The 0.0-mile commute is literal; he lives in a small studio apartment in a wing of the same assisted living facility where he works the early morning shift. His days start before dawn, a routine of gentle wake-ups, assistance with meals, and providing compassionate care for elderly residents who remind him of his own family\u2019s journey. He knows their stories, their favorite TV shows, and the names of their grandchildren. His social life is modest, consisting of occasional dinners with a few high school friends and deep, meaningful connections with his residents and their visiting families.\n\nRohan\u2019s dream is not one of grandeur but of growth. He is slowly saving money and taking prerequisites at City College with the hope of one day entering a nursing program to become a Registered Nurse (RN). He doesn\u2019t regret leaving the business world behind. In a city obsessed with disruption and scaling, Rohan has found his calling in the quiet, essential work of human connection, an unseen anchor providing stability and care in the city that raised him."
