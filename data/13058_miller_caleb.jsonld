Growing up in a quiet Portland suburb, the only child of a history teacher father and a librarian mother, his sanctuary was The Roseway, a single-screen neighborhood theater. While other kids were outside playing sports, Caleb was inside, transfixed by the works of Kurosawa, Fellini, and Hitchcock, internalizing the language of cinema before he could even analyze it.\n\nThis passion led him to UCLA for an MFA in Film Studies. He initially dreamed of directing, but a pivotal moment came during a student project where he found more joy in assembling a screening series for his class than in commanding a set. He realized his true talent wasn't in creating images, but in contextualizing and curating them. After graduation, he bounced between programming gigs at various film festivals, a nomadic existence that was exciting but lacked permanence. The call from one of San Francisco's most prestigious independent cinemas to be their Lead Film Programmer was the turning point he\u2019d been working towards for over a decade.\n\nNow, at 39, Caleb\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Mission District. He lives in a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment filled with Criterion Collection box sets and vintage film posters. His 2.1-mile commute is a daily ritual; a brisk bicycle ride that cuts through the neighborhood's vibrant chaos, past murals and taquerias, to the cinema he now calls a second home. His days are spent in darkened rooms, debating the merits of a new restoration or mapping out a month-long retrospective. His social life bleeds from his work\u2014post-screening discussions over drinks with local filmmakers and loyal cinema patrons are his primary form of connection, especially after a long-term relationship ended a year ago.\n\nCaleb\u2019s dream is no longer about personal fame, but about preservation. He aspires to launch a small, niche festival dedicated to reviving forgotten B-movies and silent-era gems. In an era of streaming algorithms, he sees himself as a keeper of the communal flame, convinced that the magic of watching a story unfold with strangers in the dark is an essential San Francisco experience worth fighting for."

On screen, the sunlight in Kurosawa's *Rashomon* was almost violent, cutting through the forest canopy. He didn\u2019t understand the shifting perspectives, but he understood the feeling: here, in the dark, with the scent of old popcorn and dust, he was safe. It wasn't a choice to love film; it was an imprinting, the moment he knew this world of projected light was more real to him than the one outside.\n\n2.\nUCLA, age 24. His student film had been a stressful disaster, but this was different. He was in the back of the screening room, watching faces illuminated by a rare 16mm print of *The Night of the Hunter* he'd sourced. The collective gasp from his classmates during the river scene felt like a current running through him. It was a profound, quiet thrill\u2014more fulfilling than any \"cut\" he\u2019d ever called. In that moment, he understood his role wasn\u2019t to be the artist, but the one who prepares the temple.\n\n3.\nHe was 31, sitting on a hard plastic chair at LAX between festival gigs, feeling utterly adrift. The call came from a San Francisco area code. He listened, dumbfounded, as the voice on the other end offered him the Lead Programmer position. He hung up and stared at the departure board, the destinations blurring. For the first time in years, the feeling wasn't of moving on, but of arriving. The nomadic chapter was over; he finally had a place to anchor his life and his passion.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, he'd programmed a sold-out screening of Dreyer\u2019s *The Passion of Joan of Arc* with a live pianist. During the final, devastating close-up on Falconetti, the theater was so silent he could hear the pianist breathing. When the film ended, a wave of sniffles gave way to a thunderous standing ovation. Standing in the back, unseen, Caleb felt an electric thrill of shared humanity. This feeling, he knew with absolute certainty, was the magic he was put on earth to protect.\n\n5.\n\"It's like we're just characters in your retrospective,\" she\u2019d said last year, her voice quiet but final. They were standing in his living room, surrounded by posters of lonely heroes. He looked from her face to the spine of a Godard box set and realized she was right. His life was so perfectly curated, he\u2019d left no room for unscripted love. When she left, the silence in the apartment was heavier than any he\u2019d ever experienced in a theater. It was the moment he understood the profound quiet of a one-person audience."
