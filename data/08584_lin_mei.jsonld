Born and raised in the Inner Richmond, her childhood played out between the tables of her parents\u2019 restaurant, \u201cJade Phoenix.\u201d It was a life she was determined to escape. For her immigrant parents, the restaurant was their American dream; for Mei, it was a gilded cage of filial duty she planned to unlock with a college degree.\n\nShe\u2019d made it to SF State, chasing a future in graphic design, a world of clean lines and digital creativity far from the chaotic rhythm of the kitchen. But in her sophomore year, her father suffered a heart attack. Her mother couldn\u2019t manage the restaurant alone, and what was meant to be a semester off to help became Mei\u2019s new reality. The path back to school blurred and then vanished. Reluctance slowly gave way to a surprising competence. She had an eye for detail her parents lacked, streamlining ordering, redesigning the dated menus, and adding a curated list of local beers that brought in a new, younger crowd.\n\nNow at 41, Mei is the undisputed heart of the Jade Phoenix. She lives and breathes the business, her 0.0-mile commute a testament to her complete immersion. Her staff is her family, and the neighborhood regulars are her closest friends, their lives shared over bowls of her father\u2019s signature wonton soup. Her personal life has been a quiet casualty of her dedication; relationships tend to wither without the time and energy she pours into the restaurant.\n\nMei\u2019s connection to San Francisco is deep, rooted in the very floorboards of her home and business. She is a steward of her family's legacy, but she dreams of more. Her hope is not to escape, but to build upon it\u2014perhaps earning a Bib Gourmand mention or finding a partner who understands her relentless world. Ultimately, she aspires to one day find a successor, someone she can trust with the Jade Phoenix, so she can finally discover who Mei Lin is when she\u2019s not just the manager downstairs."
