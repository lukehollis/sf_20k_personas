Born and raised in the apartment above the small Chinatown shop her parents opened in the late 1970s, the scent of sandalwood and jasmine tea is the background to her earliest memories. Her childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty, helping her parents stock shelves and practice calligraphy for the shop\u2019s signage after finishing her homework.\n\nWhile she loved her family, Mei yearned for a world beyond the bustling six-block radius of her home. She pursued this dream at San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. She imagined a life spent in the quiet, climate-controlled halls of a museum, curating exhibits on Ming dynasty ceramics. However, just as she graduated, her father suffered a major stroke, leaving her mother unable to manage the family business alone. Mei stepped in, telling herself it was temporary.\n\nThe temporary became permanent. Now 41, Mei is the manager, owner, and heart of \u201cZhao\u2019s Treasures.\u201d What was once a store selling generic tourist trinkets, she has slowly transformed into a curated space for artisanal teas, modern ceramics from Asian-American artists, and minimalist home goods. The turning point was realizing she could bring her art history education to her family legacy, rather than abandoning one for the other.\n\nHer social life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her friends are the baker next door and the regulars who come for their weekly oolong purchase. A long-term relationship in her twenties ended due to the immense pressure of the store, and she has remained single since, finding companionship in her quiet routines. She begins each day with meditative tea service before walking downstairs to open shop. Her dream is no longer a grand museum career, but a smaller, more intimate one: to one day travel to Jingdezhen to source porcelain directly from artisans and perhaps, in the back of the store, host small community art shows. Mei Zhao is a fixture of modern San Francisco\u2014a woman whose life is a quiet testament to the enduring power of family, place, and the art of reinvention."

The scent of black ink and sandalwood fills the air as he teaches her the calligraphy strokes for \u201ctreasure.\u201d She feels the weight of it, not as a burden, but a deep, anchoring love. This moment forged her appreciation for form and lineage, giving her a quiet strength she would lean on decades later, even as a part of her longed to write her own story on a different kind of paper, in a world beyond the shop\u2019s door.\n\n2.\nShe was twenty, standing alone in the hushed halls of the Asian Art Museum. Before her was a single Song dynasty bowl, its celadon glaze a perfect, tranquil sea. In that silent, climate-controlled room, she felt a profound sense of self\u2014a world ordered by beauty, not commerce. This was the future she wanted; a quiet, intellectual life. The memory became a painful benchmark for years, a symbol of the pristine world she had to abandon for the beautiful, chaotic mess of her inheritance.\n\n3.\nMei was twenty-two, a week after graduation, when her mother called. The words \u201cstroke\u201d and \u201chospital\u201d dissolved the future she had so carefully designed. The decision to go back wasn\u2019t a decision at all; it was an instinct. Standing in her new apartment, she looked at her art history textbooks and knew they\u2019d go back into a box. That moment was a quiet, sharp severance\u2014choosing her family\u2019s past over her own future, telling herself the lie that it was only temporary.\n\n4.\nIt happened in her late twenties, during a late-night inventory. She found a dusty box containing a small, imperfect ceramic tea cup her father had cherished. It was flawed, but loved. In that moment, staring at the cup, her art history degree and her family legacy clicked into place. She didn't have to choose. She could curate her own small world right here, celebrating not ancient perfection, but the living art of her community. This quiet epiphany transformed her resentment into purpose, turning the shop from a burden into a canvas.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young ceramicist from the Outer Richmond brought in a set of minimalist tea bowls. Mei cleared the central shelf\u2014where tourist dragons used to sit\u2014and placed the artist's work there. A regular bought one within the hour. It wasn\u2019t the hushed reverence of a museum, but something better: a living connection between an artist, an object, and a home. In that quiet transaction, she felt a profound sense of peace. Her life wasn\u2019t a compromise; it was a creation."
