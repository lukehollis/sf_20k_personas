Born and raised in the apartment above the small Chinatown shop her parents opened in the late 1970s, the scent of sandalwood and jasmine tea is the background to her earliest memories. Her childhood was a blend of American schooling and filial duty, helping her parents stock shelves and practice calligraphy for the shop\u2019s signage after finishing her homework.\n\nWhile she loved her family, Mei yearned for a world beyond the bustling six-block radius of her home. She pursued this dream at San Francisco State University, earning a Bachelor's degree in Art History. She imagined a life spent in the quiet, climate-controlled halls of a museum, curating exhibits on Ming dynasty ceramics. However, just as she graduated, her father suffered a major stroke, leaving her mother unable to manage the family business alone. Mei stepped in, telling herself it was temporary.\n\nThe temporary became permanent. Now 41, Mei is the manager, owner, and heart of \u201cZhao\u2019s Treasures.\u201d What was once a store selling generic tourist trinkets, she has slowly transformed into a curated space for artisanal teas, modern ceramics from Asian-American artists, and minimalist home goods. The turning point was realizing she could bring her art history education to her family legacy, rather than abandoning one for the other.\n\nHer social life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her friends are the baker next door and the regulars who come for their weekly oolong purchase. A long-term relationship in her twenties ended due to the immense pressure of the store, and she has remained single since, finding companionship in her quiet routines. She begins each day with meditative tea service before walking downstairs to open shop. Her dream is no longer a grand museum career, but a smaller, more intimate one: to one day travel to Jingdezhen to source porcelain directly from artisans and perhaps, in the back of the store, host small community art shows. Mei Zhao is a fixture of modern San Francisco\u2014a woman whose life is a quiet testament to the enduring power of family, place, and the art of reinvention."
