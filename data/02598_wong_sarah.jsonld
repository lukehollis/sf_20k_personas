Raised in the Sunset District, she was the quiet, diligent daughter of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery. Their hopes for her were straightforward and safe: a medical degree from a top UC school. Sarah dutifully enrolled as a pre-med major at UC Davis, spending her first two years buried in organic chemistry and filial piety.\n\nThe turning point was not a single, dramatic event, but a slow-simmering realization. It crystallized when her father, a man who survived on willpower and instant noodles, was diagnosed with a manageable heart condition. She watched him struggle not with the diagnosis, but with the confusing pamphlets and impractical lifestyle advice. The gap between medicine and human behavior became her obsession. Defying her parents' expectations, she switched her focus and later pursued a Master's in Public Health at UC Berkeley.\n\nHer early career in community non-profits felt meaningful but frustratingly slow. Lured by the promise of \u201cimpact at scale,\u201d Sarah pivoted to the city\u2019s thriving tech sector. Now, she works as a Health Educator for a wearables startup. From her Hayes Valley apartment, she spends her days translating complex health data into user-friendly notifications and app-based challenges. Her 0.0-mile commute offers freedom but demands discipline; she structures her days with morning runs through the Panhandle and evenings at a Mission district climbing gym, seeking tangible connection in a digital world.\n\nAt 32, Sarah navigates the duality of her existence. She is a native who feels the city changing under her feet, a tech professional wrestling with the ethical implications of her industry, and a daughter who finally earned her parents\u2019 pride in her own way. Her dream is to lead a product team that demonstrably lowers rates for a chronic disease, a goal that feels both professionally ambitious and deeply personal. She hopes to one day afford a small piece of the city that raised her, a permanent anchor in the ever-shifting tides of San Francisco."
