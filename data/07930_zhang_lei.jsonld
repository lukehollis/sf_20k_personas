Her 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from her bedroom to the studio space that dominates her living area, a landscape of miniature models, fabric swatches, and immersive VR mock-ups. At 48, she has curated a life as meticulously as the museum exhibits she designs.\n\nThe daughter of a pragmatic engineer and a former teacher who fled the Cultural Revolution, Lei grew up in Fremont under the heavy scaffolding of parental expectation. Art was a hobby, not a future. Bowing to their wishes, she pursued a Bachelor's degree in Architecture at UC Berkeley, a respectable compromise between her creative instincts and their need for security. For five years, she designed sterile corporate lobbies and efficient office layouts, a career that felt like a well-appointed cage.\n\nThe turning point came at 31. After visiting a particularly moving installation at the Asian Art Museum, she felt a profound sense of purpose. She quit her lucrative architecture job, took a massive pay cut to become a junior assistant at a small design firm specializing in museum spaces, and began her true education. She learned how to tell stories with light, how to guide emotion with space, and how to build worlds within four walls.\n\nNow a sought-after freelance exhibit designer, Lei is a respected name in the Bay Area arts scene. Her life is one of curated solitude and deep connection. She never married, pouring her passion into her work and a tight-knit circle of friends\u2014curators, artists, and writers she hosts for intimate dinners. Her days start with a walk along the waterfront with her rescue greyhound, Kilo, followed by hours lost in creative flow.\n\nSan Francisco isn't just her home; it\u2019s her canvas and collaborator. The city\u2019s history, its constant reinvention, fuels her work. Lei\u2019s current dream is to design a major retrospective for a contemporary Chinese artist, a project that would finally bridge the world her parents left behind with the one she so carefully built for herself. It would be her ultimate exhibit: a narrative of self, forged in the heart of the city that let her design her own life."
