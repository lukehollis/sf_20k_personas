Arriving in Daly City in the 1970s, his parents built a life through their bustling dry-cleaning business, envisioning a secure future for their son as an engineer or doctor. Daniel, however, saw the world through a different lens\u2014literally. He was captivated by the stark, beautiful honesty of black-and-white photography, a passion they dismissed as a fleeting hobby.\n\nAgainst their wishes, he enrolled in a photography program at City College of San Francisco. The fight with his father that followed was a quiet, devastating turning point. Daniel moved into a shared apartment in the Mission and never completed his degree. His real education came from stringing for small community papers, honing his craft in the city\u2019s chaotic streets. He learned to anticipate the decisive moment, capturing the raw emotion of protests, the vibrancy of street fairs, and the quiet dignity of the city\u2019s forgotten corners. His career grew with the digital age, trading the darkroom for Lightroom but never losing his eye for the human story within the frame.\n\nA marriage, vibrant and full of promise like the city itself, eventually dissolved under the quiet pressures of diverging paths, leaving him with a deeper understanding of impermanence. Now at 48, Daniel operates with a practiced calm. He lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond, a relic of a more affordable era. His daily 2.5-mile bike commute to his downtown digital news office is a meditative ritual, a way to observe the city\u2019s morning pulse.\n\nAs a senior photojournalist, he mentors younger staff, his advice more philosophical than technical. He\u2019s seen San Francisco morph through booms and busts, and feels a profound responsibility to document its soul beyond the shimmering tech campuses. His quiet hope is to one day publish a book of his life's work\u2014a gritty, compassionate visual history of the city that became his true home. It wouldn\u2019t be a bestseller, he knows, but it would be a testament."

The images that emerged were of his own parents, young and vibrant, on a beach he didn\u2019t recognize. Seeing them so full of a life he\u2019d never known\u2014before the endless work and worry\u2014ignited something in him. Photography wasn\u2019t just an art; it was a way to rescue truth from time. This discovery made his future path feel less like rebellion and more like destiny.\n\n2.\nHe was 19. The fight wasn't a shouting match. He\u2019d left his City College photography course registration on the kitchen table. His father looked at it, then at him, his face a mask of weary disappointment. In Korean, he said, \u201cThis is a waste.\u201d The silence that followed was deafening, a chasm opening between them. Daniel knew then he had to leave. He wasn't just leaving home; he was accepting the lonely weight of his own dream, knowing it was built on the foundation of his father\u2019s broken one.\n\n3.\nIt was the mid-90s, covering an eviction protest in the Mission. He was 25, still green. Amid the chaos of chants and police lines, he saw a small girl on her father's shoulders, her face not scared, but filled with a solemn wonder. He captured the shot just as she reached out to touch a line of yellow tape. Seeing that image on the community paper\u2019s front page\u2014a quiet moment of humanity in the storm\u2014was his true graduation. It affirmed that his place was here, finding the story within the noise.\n\n4.\nA year after the divorce, around age 40, he saw her across Dolores Park. She was laughing with friends, haloed by the late afternoon sun, looking genuinely happy in a life that no longer included him. There was no anger, just a profound, hollow ache. He realized he was looking at her the way he looked at his subjects: a beautiful, complete story he was merely observing from a distance. It was the moment he truly understood impermanence, a quiet lesson in letting go that deepened his work and his soul.\n\n5.\nJust last year, a young staffer showed him a technically flawless shot of a new glass skyscraper. Daniel nodded, then pointed out the window to an old man sweeping the sidewalk below. \"The light is perfect,\" he told her, \"but the soul of the city is down there. Don't shoot the building; shoot what the building's shadow falls on.\" In that moment, he wasn't just mentoring; he was clarifying his own life's purpose\u2014to document the city's heart, not just its shiny, new facade."
