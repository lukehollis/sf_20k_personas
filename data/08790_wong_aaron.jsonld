Born and raised in the Richmond District, he is the second-generation proprietor of the small neighborhood store his parents opened after immigrating from Hong Kong in the 1970s. His childhood memories are steeped in the scent of cardboard, dried herbs, and the constant, gentle chime of the bell above the door.\n\nHe was supposed to be the one who got out. His parents funneled their savings into his education, and for two years, Aaron explored a world beyond the shop\u2019s four walls at San Francisco State University, tentatively studying graphic design. But when his father had a major stroke during his sophomore year, the choice was made for him. Aaron left school to help his mother run the store, a temporary measure that slowly solidified into a permanent reality. He inherited the title of manager not through ambition, but through a quiet pact of familial duty.\n\nNow 41, Aaron\u2019s life is a testament to routine and reliability. He opens the shop at 8 a.m. and closes it at 7 p.m., six days a week. His social connections are the elderly neighbors who come for their morning paper, the young families who need a last-minute gallon of milk, and the city workers who grab a soda on their lunch break. A long-term relationship ended five years ago, unable to withstand the gravity of his rootedness; she wanted to travel the world, and his world was this single city block.\n\nHis connection to San Francisco is both intensely intimate and incredibly narrow. He is an anchor in the swirling tide of the city, watching from his storefront as the neighborhood gentrifies around him. The dreams of being a designer have faded, replaced by a more immediate aspiration: to keep the store afloat and serve the community his parents built. In his quiet moments, after the last customer leaves, he sometimes takes out his camera and photographs the fog rolling down Clement Street, capturing the enduring, quiet beauty of the life he didn't choose but has fully come to embrace."
