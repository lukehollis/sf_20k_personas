Raised in Daly City, the son of Filipino immigrants\u2014a hotel concierge father and a nursing assistant mother\u2014Kai grew up understanding the value of a stable job and a short commute. He watched his parents work tirelessly, their lives dictated by bridge traffic and shift schedules. From them, he inherited a quiet diligence and a desire for a life with less friction.\n\nWhile his high school peers chased prestigious four-year degrees, Kai opted for a more direct path. He enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Biotechnology. It was a practical choice, designed to get him into the region\u2019s booming life sciences industry without accumulating massive debt. He landed his first job as a lab technician at a small South San Francisco biotech startup, a role that involved long hours on his feet, meticulously running assays and documenting results.\n\nThe key turning point in his life was the pandemic. As his company pivoted to remote work, his role unexpectedly shifted. The hands-on lab work was minimized, and Kai was retrained to handle the vast datasets the experiments generated. He discovered a knack for it, finding a sense of order in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing complex biological data. When his company made remote work permanent for his department, Kai seized the opportunity. He moved out of his family\u2019s home and into a small one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond.\n\nNow, Kai\u2019s life is defined by his 0.0-mile commute. His mornings start not with a frantic BART ride, but with a short walk to his desk. His work as a Research Associate is entirely computational. He spends his days immersed in spreadsheets and statistical software, his world contained within his apartment walls. To combat the isolation, he forces himself into a routine: a lunchtime walk through Golden Gate Park, an evening workout at a local gym, and weekend dinners with friends on Clement Street. He remains close to his family, often visiting Daly City for his mother\u2019s home-cooked sinigang.\n\nKai\u2019s dream isn\u2019t world-changing; it\u2019s personal. He hopes to save enough for a down payment on a condo, creating a permanent anchor in the city he loves. He aspires to advance in the computational biology field, perhaps pursuing a Bachelor's degree online to open more doors. He values the stability he has built\u2014a quiet, ordered life just a few miles, but a world away, from the one he grew up in."
