The son of two dissident intellectuals\u2014a physicist father and a historian mother\u2014he was raised on whispered poetry and forbidden books. In 1989, when Dmitri was a teenager, his family seized the opportunity of Perestroika and emigrated, landing in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond. The neighborhood\u2019s persistent fog and the Cyrillic signs on local delis offered a strange, muted echo of home.\n\nA wistful and scholarly young man, Dmitri enrolled at San Francisco State University, eschewing a practical major for his true passion: a Bachelor's in Comparative Literature. He dreamed of a life in academia, of translating forgotten Russian poets and debating literary theory. But life intervened. Shortly after his graduation, his father suffered a massive stroke, requiring full-time care. Ambition was a luxury he could no longer afford. Dmitri took the first stable job he could find: a data entry position at a market research firm.\n\nThat \"temporary\" job became his career. Over two decades, he moved from data entry to a Research Assistant, a title he has held for the last fifteen years. The work is meticulous but impersonal, a world of spreadsheets and survey results that demands his attention without touching his soul. At 50, he works from the same small, rent-controlled apartment he moved into in his late twenties. His commute is the ten steps from his bed to his desk.\n\nDmitri\u2019s life is a collection of quiet routines. He starts his day analyzing consumer trends and ends it with long, solitary walks through the Presidio, watching the container ships glide under the Golden Gate. His social life is minimal; a weekly phone call with his aging mother, now in a care facility, and polite nods to the cashiers at Green Apple Books. His great, unfulfilled dream sits in a box under his bed: a half-finished translation of an obscure Symbolist poet. Some days, he believes he will finish it, a final tribute to the man he once planned to be. For now, he finds a quiet contentment in his predictable world, a ghost of Leningrad haunting the foggy streets of San Francisco."

In their grey Leningrad flat, his father\u2019s voice was a low, urgent murmur, weaving forbidden poems of loss and resilience. Dmitri, not yet ten, felt the weight of each word as a secret, precious stone in his pocket. It was then he learned that literature was not a pastime, but a dangerous, beautiful act of survival that bound his family together.\n\n2.\nIt was 1989. Walking down Geary Boulevard for the first time, enveloped in a fog as thick as any St. Petersburg white night, he saw it: a bakery sign in stark Cyrillic. His heart seized with a confusing mix of relief and alienation. The script was home, but the smell was of sourdough, not black bread. He understood then that San Francisco would never be a clean break\u2014it was a place where home would forever be a ghost, a familiar language selling unfamiliar things.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-three, staring at the phone receiver in his hand after his mother\u2019s call. The clinical words\u2014\u201chemorrhagic,\u201d \u201ccognitive deficits\u201d\u2014had erased his future. The graduate school applications on his desk, his notes on Symbolist poetry, suddenly looked like relics from another man\u2019s life. There was no grand, emotional breakdown. Instead, a hollow, practical stillness settled over him. Ambition was a luxury, and his father, silent in a hospital bed, needed him. The scholar died that day, and the dutiful son was born.\n\n4.\nHis first day at the research firm. A manager, smelling of stale coffee and ambition, pointed to a spreadsheet. \u201cThis is your universe now,\u201d the man had joked. Dmitri stared at the infinite grid of cells, the blinking cursor a tiny, mocking pulse. Each cell felt like a brick walling off his former self. He began to type, and the mechanical click of the keys was the sound of him trading the rhythm of poetry for the cold, impersonal logic of data, a choice made out of necessity.\n\n5.\nJust last week, on a walk through the Presidio at dusk, he watched a massive container ship glide silently under the Golden Gate. He thought of the box under his bed, his own unfinished vessel of translation that would never reach its port. For a moment, the old ache of failure was sharp. But then the fog rolled in, softening the world\u2019s edges. The ship disappeared. He was alone with the cypress trees and the sound of the foghorn, and felt a strange, quiet contentment. The dream was gone, but the walk was real."
