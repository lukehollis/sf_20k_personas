Born in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown to Cantonese immigrants, she was the bridge between her parents\u2019 world of tradition and a new world of bewildering American bureaucracy. She navigated doctor\u2019s appointments, rental agreements, and parent-teacher conferences, feeling the weight of her family's hopes on her small shoulders. This early responsibility planted the seed of her life\u2019s work, showing her how easily people could fall through cracks she was determined to mend.\n\nThis drive propelled her to UC Berkeley for a degree in Sociology, followed by a Master of Social Work from San Francisco State. She turned down more lucrative corporate offers to take a position as a caseworker for the city, returning to the very communities she grew up in. Her career has been a three-decade journey through the city\u2019s hidden heartaches: reuniting families in the Tenderloin, finding shelter for elderly residents in the Richmond District, and advocating for troubled youth. She earned her \"Senior Social Worker\" title not just through time, but through a reputation for unshakeable empathy and grit.\n\nA key turning point was a marriage that dissolved in her late thirties. Her husband, a kind man, couldn't understand why she brought the ghosts of her cases home with her. The divorce was painful but clarifying; Mei realized her work wasn\u2019t just a job, but her deepest calling. She has remained single since, finding companionship in a tight-knit circle of colleagues and old neighborhood friends.\n\nNow 54, Mei lives in a modest apartment in the Inner Richmond, a stone's throw from Golden Gate Park. The 0.0-mile commute is a recent development; her work is now primarily remote. Her day starts with tai chi in the park and ends with paperwork at her small desk overlooking Geary Boulevard. She is a neighborhood fixture, known by the bakers at the Hong Kong-style bakery and the grocers on Clement Street. Her dream isn\u2019t of travel or riches, but a simpler one: to mentor a new generation of social workers to carry the torch, and to one day retire with enough peace to finally read for pleasure, her windows open to the familiar sounds of the city she has spent her life serving."
