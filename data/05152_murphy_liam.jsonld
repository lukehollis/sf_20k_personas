Born in Daly City to an Irish-American ironworker and a first-generation microbiologist from Kerala, India, his upbringing was a loving fusion of cultures. His father, a man with a poet\u2019s soul, filled their home with Celtic myths and union hall stories, while his mother instilled in Liam a deep-seated value for education and stability. This duality defined him: a dreamer with a pragmatic streak.\n\nHe pursued his passion for narrative at UCLA, earning a degree in English Literature, imagining a future in academia or publishing. That dream was shattered during his senior year when his father died suddenly from a heart attack. The event was a seismic shift. Seeing his mother\u2019s grief and sudden financial precarity, Liam\u2019s romantic notions gave way to a powerful desire for security. He pivoted, applying his analytical skills to the GMAT and earning an MBA from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nNow 32, Liam is a Senior Consultant for a major firm. His 0.0-mile commute is to the desk in the corner of his sleek Mission Bay apartment, where he spends his days on Zoom calls, architecting business strategies for tech giants. Life is comfortable, predictable. Mornings start with artisanal coffee and a jog along the Embarcadero before the digital workday begins. Evenings are often quiet, though he maintains a close circle of friends from his MBA program, meeting for drinks in Hayes Valley or trying new restaurants in the Mission.\n\nLiving in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s innovation hub, he feels both a part of and apart from its soul. The city\u2019s creative energy calls to him, a faint echo of his former self. Liam\u2019s true aspiration is to bridge the two halves of his life. He dreams of leveraging his business acumen and financial independence to one day launch a small, independent press dedicated to publishing works by Bay Area authors from underrepresented backgrounds\u2014a tribute to the stories his father once told and the stability his mother fought for."

As his dad\u2019s voice gave life to C\u00fa Chulainn, Liam could smell the rust and saltwater on his jacket and see the distant spine of the Golden Gate Bridge, a structure his father\u2019s union brethren helped maintain. In that moment, stories felt as real and as strong as steel beams, a foundational magic that he believed could build worlds.\n\n2.\nAt fourteen, while his father told stories in the living room, his mother would sit at the kitchen table under a pool of light, her brow furrowed in fierce concentration over microbiology journals. The quiet hum of the refrigerator was the only sound. He saw the sheer force of will it took for her to master a new language, a new science, a new country. It wasn't magic, it was discipline. He learned then that stability was a fortress built not of dreams, but of relentless, focused effort.\n\n3.\nIt was the week after the funeral, he was twenty-one. He found his mother in the kitchen, staring at a small pile of bills next to a sympathy card. The look on her face wasn't just grief, but stark fear. In that instant, the romantic world of literary theory and poetic abstraction collapsed. Security wasn't a concept, it was heat and light and a roof. The weight of his father\u2019s absence felt crushingly practical. The decision to abandon his thesis and study for the GMAT felt less like a choice than a reflex.\n\n4.\nThe celebration after his Haas graduation felt like a scene from another life. On a rooftop in Oakland, surrounded by his sharp, ambitious MBA cohort, he held a craft cocktail and listened to talk of Series A funding and market caps. He looked across the water at the glittering lights of San Francisco, the city he had conquered on their terms. He felt a profound sense of accomplishment mixed with a quiet, aching emptiness. He had the vocabulary for success, but had forgotten the language of his soul.\n\n5.\nLast Tuesday, on his morning jog along the Embarcadero, he saw a woman reading a slim volume of poetry aloud to a friend on a bench, her voice a fragile challenge to the city\u2019s roar. He stopped, catching a few lines about fog and displacement. The echo of his father\u2019s voice and the longing for a different kind of narrative hit him with the force of a physical blow. Standing there in his expensive running gear, he knew his work wasn\u2019t just about spreadsheets; it was about building the capital to give those voices a home."
