The son of Hong Kong immigrants who ran a small, beloved grocery store in the Outer Sunset, David grew up stocking shelves and translating for his parents. He learned the rhythms of the city not through its skyline, but through the daily needs of its diverse residents. While his parents hoped he\u2019d take over the family business, David was drawn to the larger systems that made the city tick. He pursued this fascination at UC Berkeley, earning a Master's degree in Urban Planning, intent on shaping a more equitable Bay Area.\n\nHis early career in a municipal planning department, however, was a study in frustration. Weighed down by bureaucracy, he saw the tech boom of the late 90s transforming the city faster than any zoning law ever could. In a pivotal career change, David leveraged his data analysis skills from his planning degree and taught himself to code, pivoting into the nascent field of data science. The move paid off. His knack for seeing patterns in chaos propelled him upward, from a junior analyst to his current role as a Director of Data Analytics at a major tech firm.\n\nNow 47, David\u2019s life is contained within the few square blocks of his Hayes Valley neighborhood. The 0.0-mile commute means his world is his spacious condo, where he lives alone following an amicable divorce years ago. His daily routine is disciplined: a 6 a.m. espresso from his local cafe, a long day of virtual meetings managing a global team, and an evening walk through the neighborhood\u2019s streets. His primary connection is his daughter, a sophomore at UCLA, with whom he shares nightly texts and fortnightly video calls.\n\nThough financially secure, David feels a growing disconnect from the tangible city he once studied. He aspires to bridge his two lives: the data-driven world of tech and the community-focused world of his youth. His dream is to eventually leave the corporate grind and consult for non-profits, using his analytical prowess to tackle issues like housing instability and food insecurity\u2014the very problems he once saw firsthand from behind the counter of his parents' grocery store. On his evening walks, he isn\u2019t just decompressing; he\u2019s observing, analyzing, and searching for the human data points he feels he\u2019s lost."
