His parents, immigrants from Hong Kong, ran a small, beloved bakery on Irving Street, their lives a testament to grueling hours and the quiet dignity of providing for their family. Liam\u2019s childhood was a blend of Cantonese spoken at home and the boisterous English of his public school. He was studious and observant, more interested in the patterns of language than the chaotic energy of the schoolyard.\n\nThis fascination led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a graduate degree in Computational Linguistics. He was on a clear academic path, envisioning a life of research, until a pivotal moment during the pandemic. He saw the deep financial fear in his parents\u2019 eyes as their bakery struggled, and the abstract appeal of academia suddenly felt like a luxury he couldn't afford. Driven by a newfound pragmatism, he leveraged his skills in data and modeling to pivot into tech, quickly landing a lucrative job as a data scientist.\n\nNow 29, Liam lives a life his parents could only dream of, yet it feels worlds away from his upbringing. His commute is zero miles; he works from a sleek, minimalist apartment in Hayes Valley, his days dictated by Slack notifications and complex datasets. The structured, logical world of his job offers a comforting clarity, but also a profound isolation. His mornings start with a walk to a local coffee roaster with his Shiba Inu, Kenji, one of the few constants in his routine. Evenings are often spent at a bouldering gym, a solitary pursuit of problem-solving that mirrors his work.\n\nThough financially secure, Liam feels a persistent ache of unfulfillment. He recently ended a long-term relationship, the quiet of his apartment now amplified. He dreams of using his skills for something more meaningful than optimizing ad clicks\u2014perhaps building a platform to help preserve endangered languages, a nod to his original passion. He is a man caught between the city he was born into and the one he helped build, navigating the fog of his own aspirations, searching for the data point that will finally tell him where he truly belongs."
