Raised in Portland, Oregon, by a public school teacher and a registered nurse, his upbringing was steeped in conscientiousness and community service. He saw firsthand the burnout his parents experienced fighting systemic problems with limited resources, a reality that planted a seed of pragmatic idealism in him.\n\nThe turning point came during college when he watched his grandmother struggle to manage her Type 2 diabetes. She was overwhelmed by a frustrating labyrinth of digital health tools\u2014apps that didn\u2019t sync, patient portals with impossible passwords, and telehealth services she couldn't navigate. It wasn't a lack of effort on her part, but a failure of technology to meet a user with empathy. This experience cemented Ben\u2019s path. He pursued a Master's in Public Health, focusing on technology's role in patient accessibility.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco not for the IPO dreams, but for the unique chance to work from within the tech industry. As a Community Health Coordinator, he is the human interface between his company\u2019s health app and the community clinics that use it. His 0.0-mile commute from his Mission District apartment means his days are a blend of Zoom calls with engineers and fielding feedback from nurses in the field. He advocates for simpler interfaces, multi-language support, and features that serve the vulnerable, not just the tech-savvy.\n\nCurrently, Ben\u2019s days are structured. A morning run through Dolores Park gives way to hours in front of his monitor. He unwinds by exploring the Mission's culinary scene or meeting friends for trivia at a local bar. He feels a deep connection to his neighborhood's vibrant, chaotic energy but is also acutely aware of the tensions between long-term residents and the tech workforce he belongs to.\n\nBen\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but impact. He aspires to lead a social impact division, ensuring that the immense power of Silicon Valley is wielded with a conscience. He wants to build technology that feels less like an obstacle and more like a helping hand, honoring the legacy of service his parents taught him."
