Her father, a MUNI bus driver for 30 years, and her mother, a unit clerk at SF General, instilled in her a deep sense of community and civic duty. As the eldest of two, Keisha was the responsible one, often looking after her younger brother while her parents worked demanding shifts. This early exposure to the city\u2019s working-class backbone shaped her worldview.\n\nInspired by her mother\u2019s work in healthcare, Keisha enrolled in the Social Work program at San Francisco State University. She was passionate and driven, but her path was abruptly rerouted during her junior year when her mother suffered a debilitating stroke. Keisha dropped out of college to become her primary caregiver, a role she managed for nearly five years. Navigating the labyrinth of insurance, home health aides, and social services was a frustrating, eye-opening education. It was a trial by fire that taught her more about systemic gaps and human resilience than any textbook ever could.\n\nAfter her mother passed, returning to school felt impossible. Instead, Keisha channeled her hard-won experience into a career. She found her calling as a Community Health Worker for a non-profit serving families in the Western Addition. Today, she is the crucial link between people in need and the resources they deserve, helping them with everything from Medi-Cal applications to finding stable housing. Her daily 2.1-mile commute on the MUNI feels a bit like coming home, tracing the routes her father once drove.\n\nKeisha lives in a small, rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in NOPA, a cherished space she protects fiercely. Her income is enough to be stable but requires careful budgeting. Her social life revolves around a tight-knit \u201cchosen family\u201d of friends, with whom she shares potlucks and weekend walks through Golden Gate Park. At 39, Keisha\u2019s dream isn\u2019t wealth, but impact. She harbors a quiet ambition to finally finish her degree online, not for a promotion, but for herself. More than that, she hopes to develop a dedicated support program for young caregivers, ensuring others on the difficult path she once walked never have to feel alone."

The bus was empty, smelling of diesel and disinfectant. As he drove them back to the depot, the city lights blurred into streaks of gold and red. He\u2019d let her press the button for the stop bell, its chime echoing in the vast, quiet space. In those moments, holding his hand, the whole city felt like it belonged to them. It was the beginning of her love for San Francisco\u2019s bones.\n\n2.\nIn a crowded SF State lecture hall, a social work professor said, \u201cThe system isn\u2019t broken; it was built this way.\u201d The words landed like a thunderclap. Keisha, then 20, felt a fire ignite in her chest. For the first time, the frustrations she saw in her community weren\u2019t just isolated events, but part of a larger, flawed design she suddenly felt desperate to understand and dismantle. That conviction was the pure, unfiltered dream, before life forced her to live inside the system she wanted to change.\n\n3.\nShe was 23, on the phone with an insurance agent, fighting over coverage for her mother's physical therapy. The sterile, bureaucratic language of the agent met the sound of her mom\u2019s labored breathing from the next room. Keisha felt a surge of cold, focused rage replace her despair. Hanging up, she sat in silence, the pile of bills on the table mocking her. That afternoon, helplessness hardened into resolve. She would learn their language, master their forms, and never let a person on a phone decide her family\u2019s fate again.\n\n4.\nHer first true victory as a Community Health Worker was for an elderly man whose housing assistance was about to be cut. After weeks of calls and paperwork, Keisha got the email confirming his benefits were restored. She walked to his SRO to deliver the news, watching the fear drain from his face, replaced by a deep, weary gratitude. He just squeezed her hand and said, \u201cThank you, child.\u201d In his relief, she felt the painful years with her mother find their purpose. This was what it was for.\n\n5.\nLast fall, her NOPA apartment was crammed with her chosen family for a potluck. Laughter bounced off the walls as someone told a story. Keisha looked around at the faces\u2014her real support system\u2014and felt a profound sense of peace. The isolation of her twenties had been so complete, she\u2019d forgotten what being part of a community felt like on a personal level. Surviving was one thing, she realized, but this\u2014this easy, unconditional belonging\u2014was truly living. It was a foundation she had built for herself."
