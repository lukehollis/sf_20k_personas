The only son of Taiwanese immigrants, he grew up in the Sunset District amidst the scent of his parents\u2019 small grocery store\u2014a world of crisp bok choy, pungent dried mushrooms, and the sweet dust of rice flour. His parents, pragmatic and hardworking, pushed him toward a stable career, urging him to get a \"real\" degree. Dutifully, Daniel enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning an Associate's in Business Administration, a credential that felt as foreign to him as the textbooks he barely read.\n\nHis true education began not in a classroom, but in the scalding steam of a restaurant dishwasher. At 22, disillusioned with spreadsheets, he took a menial job in a bustling North Beach kitchen. There, amidst the clatter of pans and the bark of orders, he found his calling. He was a quick study, absorbing techniques through observation and relentless practice. He rose from prep cook to line cook, learning the culinary gospel from grizzled chefs who valued grit over diplomas. This hands-on, grueling apprenticeship became his path forward.\n\nThe turning point came at 35. Leveraging every cent he had, along with a small loan from a believer, he bought a rundown two-story building in a still-developing Hayes Valley. He poured his life into it, designing a small, intimate restaurant on the ground floor and a spartan apartment for himself above. This is how his commute became zero miles; his life and work are stacked one on top of the other. His restaurant, \"Linwood,\" is a reflection of his journey: refined but unpretentious, blending Taiwanese flavors with Californian ingredients.\n\nNow 45, Daniel\u2019s days are a ritual. Mornings are for farmers' markets, afternoons for prep and mentoring his small, loyal staff, and nights are for the controlled chaos of service. His personal life has often taken a backseat to his ambition; a long-term relationship ended years ago under the strain of his 80-hour work weeks. His staff is his family, his regular patrons his community. Daniel\u2019s dream isn\u2019t expansion or a Michelin star, but refinement. He hopes to one day pass the restaurant to his talented sous-chef, ensuring the legacy of the little grocery store in the Sunset continues in a new, delicious form."

His small hands sorted dried shiitake mushrooms by size, the earthy, concentrated scent clinging to his clothes. His mother hummed beside him, her movements deft and sure. It wasn\u2019t a chore; it was a quiet lesson in patience and reverence for the ingredient. That scent became the ghost note in his future dishes, a silent promise to honor the foundation they had built, one mushroom at a time.\n\n2.\nAt 23, he was a line cook in North Beach, sweat stinging his eyes. The ticket machine was screaming, pans clattered, and a grizzled chef barked orders. He finished plating a complex cioppino, his hands moving on pure instinct. The chef glanced, gave a single, curt nod, then shouted \"Next!\" That silent, momentary approval was more validating than any diploma or degree. It was his true graduation, confirming he was exactly where he was meant to be: in the heart of the chaos, creating.\n\n3.\nThe first night in Hayes Valley, at 35, he sat on the dusty floor of his empty apartment above the gutted restaurant space. The silence was absolute, filled only by the immense weight of the loan and the smell of old plaster. It was a terrifying freedom. Looking down through the floorboards, he understood that his home and his dream were now the same entity. For the first time, his entire life was stacked on a single foundation; if one part crumbled, so would the other.\n\n4.\nHe was nearly 40 when the relationship ended. She had said, \"This restaurant is the only thing you have room to love,\" and the quiet after the door closed proved her right. He stood in his kitchen, staring at the gleaming stainless steel that reflected his tired face. It wasn't a choice he made in that moment, but a truth he finally had to acknowledge. His ambition had a price, paid for with the life he might have had outside those four walls.\n\n5.\nHis parents came a year after Linwood opened. His father, a man of few words, quietly ate the braised pork belly\u2014a dish from his mother\u2019s table, now refined. Daniel watched from the kitchen pass, his breath held tight. After a long silence, his father met his eye from across the dining room and gave a small, slow nod. No words were needed. In that moment, he wasn\u2019t the rebellious son, but the continuation of a legacy. The grocery store had found a new voice."
