Raised in Dorchester by a union electrician father and a school secretary mother, his childhood was one of hardworking stability. Liam, however, was the family dreamer. He devoured novels and, to his parents\u2019 loving confusion, pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature from UMass Amherst, graduating with a head full of literary theory and few practical prospects.\n\nIn 1999, lured by the siren song of the dot-com boom, Liam impulsively moved to San Francisco. He survived the subsequent bust by a thread, taking freelance copywriting jobs and bartending in the Mission. It was during this period he discovered his unique value: he could translate the complex, jargon-heavy language of engineers into compelling stories that actual humans wanted to read. This skill became his ticket in. He worked his way up from a junior writer at a struggling startup to a respected Content Strategist at a major cloud-services company.\n\nA key turning point came five years ago with the end of a decade-long relationship. The breakup left him unmoored but also forced him to build a life that was truly his own. He bought a small condo in the Inner Sunset, embracing the quiet, foggy mornings and his immediate community. His 0.0-mile commute means his days are structured by local rhythms: a morning run in Golden Gate Park, grabbing a coffee at the same cafe where the baristas know his order, and working from a sunlit spare room overlooking his street.\n\nNow 42, Liam is comfortable and successful, yet the English major in him remains restless. He finds deep satisfaction in crafting a perfect brand narrative, but his true aspiration lies in a half-finished manuscript saved on his personal laptop\u2014a novel about a family much like his own. His quiet hope is to one day trade corporate storytelling for his own, to finally connect the dreamer from Boston with the strategist in San Francisco."
