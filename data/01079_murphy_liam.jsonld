He grew up in a working-class Irish-Catholic neighborhood in South Boston, the quieter younger brother to his charismatic, troubled sibling, Sean. While Liam found stability in books, Sean found chaos in addiction. Liam\u2019s teenage years were a blur of his brother\u2019s relapses and the stoic grief of his parents, a formative experience that etched a deep, painful empathy into his soul.\n\nSeeking distance, Liam pursued his undergraduate degree on the West Coast, but found he couldn\u2019t outrun his calling. He watched from afar as Sean cycled through programs, each one seeming more impersonal and ineffective than the last. This ignited a quiet resolve in Liam. He enrolled in UC Berkeley\u2019s Master of Social Work program, determined to understand the systems that had so thoroughly failed his family.\n\nAfter graduating, he took a case manager position with a non-profit providing supportive housing in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin. This is where his 0.0-mile commute comes from; his modest apartment is on the third floor of the same building where his clients live. His key life event wasn't a single moment, but the slow, cumulative act of embedding himself in the community he serves.\n\nLiam\u2019s days are a structured blend of paperwork, crisis intervention, and quiet triumphs\u2014securing a client\u2019s disability benefits, celebrating sixty days of sobriety, or just sharing a coffee in the communal kitchen. His social life is small but strong, consisting of a handful of fellow social workers with whom he shares a gallows humor and an unwavering commitment. Romantic relationships have been difficult, often buckling under the weight of his emotionally demanding and ever-present work.\n\nNow 36, Liam is a fixture in his neighborhood, known for his calm demeanor and tired, kind eyes. He loves San Francisco for its acceptance of the marginalized, even as he fights the bureaucracy that so often lets them down. His dream isn't fame or fortune, but to one day lead a program modeled on radical compassion, a place that might have saved his brother. For now, he finds purpose in the small victories, a steady anchor in the turbulent heart of the city."
