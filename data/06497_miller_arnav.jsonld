His 0.0-mile commute is a simple walk downstairs from his studio apartment to the chic lifestyle boutique where he works as the Assistant Store Manager. This hyperlocal existence is a stark contrast to his upbringing in Berkeley, where he was a constant navigator between two worlds. Born to a pragmatic Indian immigrant mother, a respected cardiologist, and a free-spirited white American father, a jazz pianist, Arnav grew up feeling like a cultural bridge. His surname, Miller, often obscured his South Asian heritage, a fact that both simplified and complicated his youth.\n\nHe chose Communications for his bachelor's degree at UC Davis, a compromise between his father\u2019s artistic leanings and his mother\u2019s desire for a practical career. He fell into retail part-time to pay for books and discovered a surprising aptitude for logistics and customer relations. After graduating, he saw a management-track position in San Francisco as a stable, respectable next step. He excelled, his calm demeanor proving invaluable, especially during the chaotic early days of the pandemic, a period that solidified his professional confidence but also planted seeds of doubt about his long-term fulfillment.\n\nNow, at 26, Arnav\u2019s life runs on a retail rhythm. His days are a blur of inventory management, staff scheduling, and maintaining the store\u2019s curated aesthetic. He knows the local baristas and restaurant owners by name, forming a tight-knit community within his small radius. Yet, he feels a growing restlessness. The Communications degree gathers dust while he dreams of launching his own concept store\u2014a space that would blend local art, independent publications, and ethically sourced goods, a true fusion of his parents' worlds. He feels caught between the security of a steady paycheck and the terrifying risk of pursuing a personal vision. For now, he remains in his comfortable bubble, wondering when he\u2019ll find the courage to walk more than a few feet from his front door to build a life that is truly his own."
