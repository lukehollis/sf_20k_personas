His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk downstairs from his small apartment to \"Kaze,\" the modern Japanese-Californian restaurant he co-owns.\n\nA third-generation Japanese American, James grew up in the Sunset District, the son of practical parents who valued stability over passion. They pushed him toward a business degree at San Francisco State University, a path he dutifully followed for two years. However, his real education took place in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, where he learned the fundamentals of traditional Japanese home cooking\u2014the importance of seasonality, balance, and respect for the ingredient. The sterile concepts of his business classes felt hollow compared to the tangible satisfaction of creating a perfect dashi.\n\nThe turning point came during a grueling internship at a downtown financial firm. Utterly uninspired, James quit both the internship and his degree program. He took a dishwasher job at a respected restaurant in Hayes Valley, determined to learn the industry from the ground up. His work ethic and innate talent were undeniable, and he quickly moved up to the line. It was there he met Chef Anya, a seasoned culinary veteran who saw in James a rare combination of reverence for tradition and a bold, modern palate.\n\nThey decided to become partners, pooling Anya\u2019s savings and industry connections with James\u2019s youthful energy and vision. They found a small, neglected space in the Mission and transformed it into Kaze (wind), a reflection of their fresh approach.\n\nJames\u2019s life is a cycle dictated by the restaurant. His mornings begin before dawn, sourcing produce from the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market. His social circle consists of his staff, loyal regulars, and his patient girlfriend, Chloe, a graphic designer who understands his all-consuming dedication. While he has patched things up with his parents, who are now proud of his success, his primary connection is to his craft.\n\nHis dream is both simple and monumental: earn a Michelin star for Kaze. Beyond that, he hopes to one day travel through Japan for a year, reconnecting with the culinary roots his grandmother gifted him, and perhaps, finally, finding a world that exists beyond his restaurant's front door."
