The son of pragmatic Cantonese immigrants who ran a laundromat on Clement Street, his childhood was a study in contrasts: the diligent, filial son who excelled in math, and the boy who secretly filled notebooks with sketches inspired by the city's fog-draped architecture. His parents hoped for an engineer or a doctor, a path of stability they had crossed an ocean to provide.\n\nHe initially obliged, enrolling in Public Policy at UC Berkeley, a practical compromise. The turning point was volunteering at a community arts center in Oakland. He found he wasn't meant to be the artist on stage, but the one ensuring the stage had lights and the doors could open. This epiphany led him to a Master's in Public Administration, specializing in non-profit management. He had found a way to serve his passion without becoming the \u201cstarving artist\u201d his parents feared.\n\nAfter years of grant writing and program coordinating at various Bay Area institutions, Michael found his home. For the past fifteen years, he has been the Art Program Manager for a vibrant, if perpetually underfunded, arts non-profit. His 0.0-mile commute is no data error; he lives in a simple loft apartment directly above the gallery space. His life and work are completely intertwined, a fact that contributed to an amicable divorce a decade ago. His ex-wife had wanted a life beyond benefits and gallery openings.\n\nMichael\u2019s days are a ritual. He starts with coffee and a pastry from a panaderia down the block, exchanging greetings with muralists and local business owners. His work is a blend of spreadsheets, donor meetings, and consoling young artists rejected for a grant. He is deeply connected to his neighborhood, having witnessed its waves of gentrification with a mix of resignation and defiance. His non-profit champions the underrepresented artists being priced out of the city they help define.\n\nNow 52, Michael\u2019s dreams are not for himself, but for the institution. He yearns to secure a multi-million-dollar endowment that will guarantee the non-profit\u2019s existence long after he\u2019s gone. His legacy won't be a painting on a wall, but the enduring space where future generations of San Francisco artists can create them."
