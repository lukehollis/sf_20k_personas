The daughter of Indian immigrants who settled in Fremont in the late 1970s, Priya was raised on a dual diet of her mother\u2019s scientific pragmatism and her father\u2019s engineering logic. She was expected to excel, and she did, but with an artistic flair that initially set her apart.\n\nShe first arrived in the Bay Area as a student, pursuing an undergraduate degree in Architecture at UC Berkeley. She loved the elegance of systems, the beauty of a well-designed structure. But as the first dot-com bubble inflated around her, she saw the world being built not of concrete and steel, but of code. After the bust, seeing the fragility of traditional industries, she made a calculated pivot. She enrolled at Stanford, earning a Master\u2019s in Computer Science, and dedicated herself to designing the invisible architecture that underpins modern life.\n\nHer career was a series of strategic moves through Silicon Valley\u2019s ranks. She endured the grueling hours of a mid-2000s startup, survived the acquisition, and eventually landed at a major tech firm where her ability to see the entire system, not just the individual components, earned her the title of Principal Architect. Along the way, her marriage to another ambitious tech professional dissolved, a casualty of two competing careers and too many late nights.\n\nThat divorce was a turning point. At 47, Priya has intentionally engineered her life for balance. Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to this, allowing her to trade traffic for time in her small, meticulous garden. Her days are a blend of intense virtual meetings designing cloud infrastructure and quiet moments pruning her heirloom roses. She maintains a tight-knit circle of friends from her Berkeley days, a non-tech group that keeps her grounded.\n\nNow, her aspirations have shifted from climbing the corporate ladder to building a legacy. She dreams of starting a mentorship program for young women in STEM and perhaps, one day, consulting on projects that prioritize ethical technology. Priya Sharma has already built a career; now she\u2019s focused on designing a life of meaning, finding a sustainable structure for her own future within the city she has long called home."
