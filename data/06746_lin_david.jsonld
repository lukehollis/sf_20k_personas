The only son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small neighborhood grocery store on Taraval Street, David\u2019s childhood was a blend of American cartoons and the quiet diligence of his parents. While they hoped he\u2019d pursue a prestigious university degree, David was always more interested in the \"how\" than the \"why\"\u2014how the walk-in freezer worked, how to fix the buzzing fluorescent lights, how the cash register\u2019s gears turned. He was a tinkerer, not a scholar.\n\nHis academic journey reflected this. After graduating from Lowell High School with respectable but uninspired grades, he enrolled at City College of San Francisco. He found his calling not in lecture halls, but in the workshops, earning an Associate\u2019s degree in Building Engineering Technology. It was a practical choice that honored the spirit of his father, a man who could fix anything with a bit of wire and immense patience. This decision created a quiet rift with his mother, who saw it as a missed opportunity, a sentiment that still hangs between them during their weekly phone calls.\n\nDavid\u2019s career has been a steady, upward climb through the city\u2019s unseen infrastructure. He started in property management for older apartment buildings in the Richmond, but his big break came fifteen years ago when he was hired by a burgeoning tech company. He wasn\u2019t a coder; he was the man who ensured the coders had power, climate control, and functioning plumbing. As a Facilities Specialist, he is the ghost in the machine of a massive SoMa tech campus. His 0.0-mile commute is a perk of the job; he lives in a company-owned apartment within the same complex he manages, making him eternally on-call.\n\nA key turning point was his divorce a decade ago. His ex-wife, a marketing professional, grew frustrated with what she called his lack of ambition. David, however, saw it as stability. The split solidified his quiet, self-contained nature. His daily routine is a metronome of building system checks, work orders, and troubleshooting. His social connections are with the night security guards and the catering staff, fellow members of the essential but invisible workforce. He knows the building\u2019s secrets\u2014its groans and sighs\u2014better than any person. His dream is simple: to one day buy a small house in Pacifica, with a garage he can convert into a proper workshop, where he can finally fix things just for himself."
