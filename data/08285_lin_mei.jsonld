The only daughter of Cantonese immigrants, she was raised in a home filled with the aromas of her mother\u2019s cooking and the weight of her parents' expectations. They had sacrificed everything for a life in America, and their dream for Mei was one of stability: a practical degree in business or engineering from a good UC school, followed by a secure, high-paying job.\n\nMei, quiet and observant, obliged. She enrolled at UC Davis as a business major, dutifully attending lectures on marketing and microeconomics. But it was a single art history elective, taken to fulfill a requirement, that became her turning point. The course, focusing on Asian American protest art from the 1960s, ignited a passion she never knew she had. It felt more real and vital than any balance sheet. In an act of quiet rebellion, she secretly switched her major to Art History, a decision she knew would disappoint her parents.\n\nAfter graduation, she eschewed lucrative corporate offers and instead found her calling in San Francisco\u2019s non-profit arts scene. She landed a position as a Program Assistant for a small community arts organization in the Mission District. The pay was modest, but the role came with a rare city perk: a small, subsidized apartment directly above the gallery space, making her commute exactly zero miles.\n\nHer life is now deeply woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her mornings start with a walk to a local panader\u00eda for coffee before heading downstairs to coordinate artist workshops, assist with grant writing, and prepare for gallery openings. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of fellow artists, activists, and non-profit workers she\u2019s met through her work. While her relationship with her parents is loving, it remains tinged with their gentle concern for her financial future.\n\nMei\u2019s dream is to grow within the organization, eventually becoming a curator. She aspires to create exhibitions that give a platform to emerging immigrant artists whose stories, like her parents', often go unheard. For Mei, her work isn't just a job; it\u2019s an act of claiming space and building community in a city that is constantly changing, ensuring that its artistic soul endures."
