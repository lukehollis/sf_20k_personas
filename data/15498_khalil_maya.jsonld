The only child of a Lebanese-American history professor and a Filipina-American nurse, she grew up in Daly City, absorbing a rich blend of cultures, languages, and cuisines. Her parents instilled in her a deep respect for both intellectual rigor and compassionate caregiving, a duality that would come to define her professional life.\n\nHer fascination with the \"why\" behind human behavior led her to UC Berkeley, where she pursued a degree in Cognitive Science. It was there, during her senior year, that her path crystallized. She watched her own grandmother, a sharp and capable woman, become deeply frustrated trying to navigate a new online patient portal. In that moment, Maya saw how even the most well-intentioned technology could create barriers. It wasn't just a design flaw; it was a failure of empathy. This experience became her professional catalyst.\n\nNow 32, Maya is a sought-after UX Researcher in San Francisco, specifically choosing projects in educational and healthcare technology. She sees her work as a form of digital advocacy, ensuring that new tools are intuitive and empowering for everyone, regardless of their age or technical literacy. Her commute on the J-Church Muni from her apartment in the Mission to her SoMa office is a daily reminder of the diverse communities she serves.\n\nMaya\u2019s life is woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. She shares her rent-stabilized apartment with her partner, Alex, a landscape architect. Weekends are for runs through Dolores Park, browsing the stacks at Dog Eared Books, and trying new recipes that blend the flavors of her heritage. Her dream isn\u2019t to launch a startup, but to lead a research team that develops a truly transformative public health platform. For Maya, San Francisco isn't just a city of innovation; it's a city of people, and her life\u2019s work is to ensure technology serves them all."

From the stove, the sharp, comforting smell of her mother\u2019s chicken adobo\u2014garlic and soy sauce\u2014mingled with the olive oil and za\u2019atar from her father\u2019s snack bowl. In that moment, surrounded by competing, harmonious aromas and histories, Maya felt the warm, complex comfort of being a crossroads herself. It wasn\u2019t confusing; it was home. This feeling became the foundation of her identity.\n\n***\n\n2.\nIt was the hiss of frustration from her Lola that she remembers most. Senior year at Berkeley, age 21. Her grandmother, a woman who had managed hospital wards, stared at the glaring laptop screen, defeated by a patient portal. Maya tried to help, but the interface was a maze of confusing icons. Seeing her Lola\u2019s sharp mind encased by poor design ignited something fierce in her. It wasn\u2019t anger, but a cold, clear purpose. Empathy wasn\u2019t a soft skill; it was a structural necessity.\n\n***\n\n3.\nThe J-Church lurched around the corner at 20th and Dolores, the metal squealing. It was a few months after she and Alex had moved into their Mission apartment. She was 26, pressed between a woman whispering in Tagalog on her phone and a man reading a well-worn history book. Looking out at the vibrant, chaotic street, with Alex\u2019s hand finding hers in the crowd, she felt an overwhelming sense of belonging. This wasn't a commute; it was a daily immersion into the very community she was determined to serve.\n\n***\n\n4.\nShe was 29, conducting a usability test for a new vaccination scheduling tool. An elderly man, Mr. Chen, was navigating the prototype, his hand trembling slightly on the mouse. After a few tense moments, he successfully booked his appointment. He looked up from the screen, not at her, but through her, and said in a quiet voice, \u201cMy daughter won\u2019t have to do this for me.\u201d That simple statement of reclaimed dignity hit Maya harder than any corporate approval. It was the entire reason she did her job.\n\n***\n\n5.\nLast spring, lying on a blanket in Dolores Park with Alex. He was sketching the gnarled trunk of a nearby palm tree while she watched the city skyline soften in the late afternoon light. The chatter of the crowd, the distant clang of a cable car, all of it faded into a peaceful hum. In that quiet moment of contentment, her ambition crystallized not as a frantic climb, but as a clear, steady calling: to build something that would protect the health of every person living under that golden light."
