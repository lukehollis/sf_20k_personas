The only child of immigrants who ran a small corner grocery, her childhood was a quiet rhythm of stocking shelves and watching the N-Judah streetcar rattle past. Her parents, loving but perpetually exhausted, measured success in hours worked, not report cards. In the sprawling, underfunded public schools of her youth, Mei-Ling felt more like a number than a name, often struggling to keep up and slipping through the cracks. Her formal education felt anonymous and disconnected, a chapter she would later mentally file under \"Unknown.\"\n\nThe turning point came at age 15. Overwhelmed by family stress and academic pressure, she was referred to the school's social worker, a kind, patient man named Mr. Evans. For the first time, an adult in the school system saw *her*\u2014not her grades or her quiet demeanor, but the bright, capable person underneath. He didn\u2019t solve her problems, but he gave her the tools to navigate them herself. That experience planted a seed. She decided she would become the person she had so desperately needed.\n\nHer path wasn't linear. After high school, she worked full-time, taking classes at City College of San Francisco before transferring to San Francisco State University. It was a grueling decade of juggling jobs, studies, and family obligations, but the goal was clear. She eventually earned her Master of Social Work, a degree that felt like a hard-won victory over her earlier invisibility.\n\nNow, at 34, Mei-Ling lives and works in the same community that raised her. She rents a small in-law apartment just three blocks from the middle school where she is a social worker, making her commute a short walk through familiar streets. Her days are a whirlwind of mediating conflicts, connecting families with resources, and offering a steady presence for students who, like her, feel overlooked. Her personal and professional lives are intrinsically linked; the kids she counsels are the same ones she sees at the local library and grocery store. This deep connection is her greatest strength and her biggest challenge. Her dream is to establish a neighborhood mentorship program, creating a stronger safety net than she ever had. In the quiet evenings, listening to the distant foghorns, Mei-Ling feels a profound sense of purpose, having built a meaningful life by ensuring no child has to feel unknown."
