From this quiet command center, the 52-year-old Senior Environmental Consultant shapes the physical future of San Francisco, a city he has called home for nearly three decades. Born Ishaan Davis to Indian immigrants in San Jose, his name was anglicized by his pragmatic engineer father, a choice Ethan adopted without protest. His childhood was a blend of suburban diligence and weekend escapes to Yosemite and Big Sur, where his mother, a librarian, instilled in him a deep reverence for the natural world that would define his professional life.\n\nHis educational path was a straight line north. An undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from UC Davis led to a Master's in Environmental Management from UC Berkeley. It was there he fell for San Francisco's chaotic charm. He began his career conducting impact assessments, slowly building a reputation for navigating California\u2019s labyrinthine environmental regulations with integrity. His ambition, however, came at a cost. A marriage in his early thirties dissolved a decade later, strained by long hours and a relentless drive that left little room for partnership. The divorce was a quiet turning point, pushing him deeper into his work, where the rules were clear and the outcomes measurable.\n\nNow, Ethan\u2019s life moves to a steady, solitary rhythm. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to his home office, a space overlooking a small, shared garden. Days are filled with client calls, policy analysis, and the meticulous work of ensuring urban development projects are sustainable. Evenings are for himself: cooking simple meals, listening to his collection of jazz vinyl, or taking long walks through his neighborhood. At 52, his ambition has softened from personal success to professional legacy. He hopes to lead a landmark project\u2014perhaps a shoreline restoration or a major green infrastructure overhaul\u2014that will leave a lasting positive mark on his adopted city. He dreams of a future where his impact is etched not just in reports, but in the very land he works to protect."
