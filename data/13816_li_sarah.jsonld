The daughter of a pragmatic Chinese-American engineer and a white high school history teacher, she grew up in the suburban sprawl of Cupertino, a landscape of blossoming tech and apricot orchards. Her childhood was a blend of her father\u2019s logic and her mother\u2019s love for narrative and order. While her friends\u2019 parents were building circuit boards, Sarah was happily organizing her mother\u2019s classroom library and creating elaborate filing systems for her baseball cards.\n\nThis innate passion for structure led her not to engineering, but to a Master's in Library and Information Science from UCLA. She envisioned a calm life among university archives. However, graduating in the late 90s placed her at a digital crossroads. Seeing the chaotic explosion of information online, she pivoted. Instead of cataloging rare books, she applied her methodical mind to the burgeoning field of digital assets. This foresight defined her career; she rose steadily from a junior digital librarian at a media company to her current role as Director of Digital Asset Management, taming the sprawling digital chaos of a major information firm.\n\nHer personal life has been similarly structured, centered on a 15-year partnership that ended amicably three years ago. Now, at 49, she navigates a peaceful solitude in her Outer Sunset condo. Her daily routine is a ritual: a long, contemplative commute on the MUNI N-Judah line, soundtracked by history podcasts, followed by a demanding day herding terabytes of data. Weekends are for long, foggy walks along Ocean Beach, browsing the shelves at Green Apple Books, and hosting a small, dedicated book club.\n\nSarah feels deeply connected to the quieter, intellectual side of San Francisco, a city that accommodates both her tech-driven profession and her analog soul. Her future aspirations aren't about climbing higher on the corporate ladder, but about finding a way to merge her skills with her original passion. She dreams of consulting for a small museum or historical society, digitizing a local archive, and perhaps finding a companion who appreciates the simple joy of a perfectly organized bookshelf."
