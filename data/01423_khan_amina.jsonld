Raised in the East Bay, her childhood was a mosaic of different apartments and schools, a nomadic existence that made formal education a fragmented, inconsistent experience. She never earned a diploma, but she gained a Ph.D. in observation and adaptation. Her true education began when her younger brother developed severe asthma, aggravated by the mold in their low-income housing. Watching her mother fight landlords and navigate a confounding healthcare system, Amina learned her first lessons in advocacy. She became the family\u2019s researcher, translator, and relentless navigator of bureaucracy.\n\nThis path led her not to a university, but to San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin, a neighborhood she saw as the city's struggling, tenacious heart. The turning point was a volunteer stint at a free clinic, where she realized her lived experience was more valuable than any degree. She could connect with recent immigrants, the elderly, and disenfranchised families in a way formally trained staff couldn't. This organically grew into her role as a Community Health Worker for a grassroots neighborhood collective.\n\nAt 40, Amina\u2019s life is contained within a few dense city blocks. Her 0.0-mile commute is the walk from her small, rent-controlled apartment down two flights of stairs to the community space that serves as her office. Her days are a fluid cycle of a aaccompanying an elderly Vietnamese resident to a doctor\u2019s appointment, helping a newly arrived Yemeni family apply for CalFresh, and organizing tenant rights workshops. Her social life is inseparable from her work; her closest friends are the activists, cooks, and residents she fights alongside.\n\nAmina\u2019s dream isn\u2019t to escape the Tenderloin, but to help it bloom from within. She envisions a rooftop community garden above her building and a fully funded youth arts program. While she rarely thinks of her own future, her hope is simple: to one day see the children she helps grow up healthy and empowered, their own paths defined not by necessity, but by choice."
