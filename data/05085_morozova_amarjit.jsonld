Born to Punjabi immigrant farmers, his childhood was defined by the scent of earth, the expectation of hard work, and the pressure to pursue a lucrative, respectable career in engineering or medicine. He was a dutiful son, but a quiet observer, more interested in the complex family dynamics of his community than in calculus. This innate empathy felt like a liability until he discovered the field of social work during his undergraduate years at UC Davis. It was a quiet rebellion, a choice for people over profits.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco for his graduate studies, a Master of Social Work, and never left. The city was a revelation, a place where one could redefine their identity. His most significant transformation began when he met Elena Morozova, a fiery ceramic artist who had emigrated from St. Petersburg. Their bond was immediate and profound. When they married, Amarjit took her surname, not as a rejection of his heritage, but as an embrace of the new self they were building together. Though their marriage ended amicably a decade later, he kept the name. It was a tribute to a pivotal era of his life, a part of his own unique history.\n\nNow, at 51, Amarjit is a fixture in the Inner Sunset. His commute is zero, a deliberate choice that anchors him to his neighborhood. From his small, book-lined flat, he works as a clinical social worker, providing telehealth counseling to patients navigating chronic illness and end-of-life care. His days are a quiet rhythm of deep listening and gentle guidance, punctuated by walks in Golden Gate Park, his sprawling backyard. He knows the park\u2019s trails intimately, using them to decompress between emotionally taxing sessions.\n\nAmarjit\u2019s aspirations are no longer grand; they are deep. He dreams not of climbing a career ladder but of continuing to provide a steady, compassionate presence for those in crisis. He hopes to one day mentor new social workers, especially those from immigrant backgrounds, helping them navigate the cultural and emotional complexities of the work. Amarjit Morozova found his true self in San Francisco, a city that made space for his unique, blended identity, and he now spends his days helping others find their own footing within it."

A guest lecturer, a social worker who served migrant families, spoke of the unspoken griefs and triumphs she witnessed. It wasn't about data or diagnoses; it was about stories. For Amarjit, it felt like a lock clicking into place. In that moment, the pressure from his family faded, replaced by the profound, clarifying realization that he wanted to tend to people\u2019s inner worlds, not their portfolios or blood pressure. It was the quiet beginning of his true life\u2019s work.\n\n2.\nIt was 1996, at a Mission District open studios event. He saw her before he saw her art: Elena, with fiery red hair and clay-dusted hands, arguing passionately in Russian with a customer. Then he saw her pottery\u2014asymmetrical, beautiful, and unapologetically imperfect. He felt a jolt of recognition. Here was a person living with the raw, messy passion he had always kept hidden. Buying a small, lopsided bowl from her felt less like a transaction and more like an introduction to a part of himself he was finally ready to meet.\n\n3.\nHis first telehealth patient after going fully remote, around 2011, was a woman named Carol who was housebound by MS. During one session, her cat jumped on her lap, and she spent ten minutes describing its personality with more joy than he\u2019d heard from her in weeks. He didn\u2019t interrupt. He simply listened, realizing his job wasn't to force breakthroughs, but to hold space for small moments of grace. This memory cemented his patient, gentle approach\u2014finding the therapeutic power in the ordinary and embracing the humanity in the mundane.\n\n4.\nAfter signing the divorce papers in 2007, he and Elena sat in their quiet Inner Sunset apartment. \"Will you change your name back?\" she asked, her voice soft. He considered it for a moment\u2014the name of his father, the scent of the valley soil. But Morozova felt like his own skin now. \"No,\" he said, surprising them both. \"It's my story, too.\" It wasn't a rejection of his past, but an acceptance of the man he had become with her. The name was a history, not just a label.\n\n5.\nJust last week, after a gut-wrenching session with a young client facing a terminal diagnosis, the silence in his flat felt heavy. He pulled on his jacket and walked into Golden Gate Park as the fog rolled in. He didn't jog or hike with purpose; he just walked the winding path through the eucalyptus grove, breathing in the damp air. The park felt like a silent, leafy colleague, absorbing his professional grief without asking for anything in return. This simple ritual is his anchor, the way he honors his work while protecting his soul."
