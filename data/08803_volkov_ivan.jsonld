The son of Russian immigrants who fled the collapsing Soviet Union, he was raised in Cleveland, Ohio, under a cloud of stoic pragmatism. His parents, an engineer and a bookkeeper, valued stability above all else, urging their son toward a practical, lucrative career. Ivan dutifully complied, earning a Bachelor's in Economics and spending five miserable years as a financial analyst, his soul withering in the cold glow of spreadsheets.\n\nThe turning point was his mother's sudden cancer diagnosis. Navigating the labyrinthine healthcare system, Ivan\u2019s family floundered until a hospital social worker stepped in. This woman, with her calm competence and profound empathy, became Ivan\u2019s inspiration. She didn't just coordinate care; she held their family\u2019s emotional turmoil, offering a path through the chaos. Within a year, Ivan had quit his job and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program at San Francisco State University, drawn to a city where society\u2019s fractures were on full display.\n\nNow 42, Ivan is a Clinical Social Worker for a major San Francisco hospital. His 0.0-mile commute takes him from his bedroom to a small, meticulously organized home office in his Inner Sunset apartment. He spends his days on telehealth calls, a calm voice for patients and families facing devastating diagnoses, end-of-life decisions, and the anxieties of illness. He absorbs their trauma, translating medical jargon and validating their fear.\n\nHis personal life is a reflection of his professional need for order. Divorced for three years, his relationship ended under the weight of his emotional burnout. His social circle is small, mostly other healthcare professionals who understand the psychic toll of the work. His release comes from long, solitary walks through the fog-drenched greenery of Golden Gate Park, a stone's throw from his apartment. He finds the fog comforting, a blanket that muffles the city's noise.\n\nIvan\u2019s hope is simple: to continue his work without shattering. He dreams of one day opening a small private practice, giving him more control over his caseload. More privately, he yearns to bridge the emotional distance with his aging father, using the skills he employs with strangers to finally connect with his own family."
