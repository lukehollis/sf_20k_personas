Adopted at nine months old by a loving Irish-American couple\u2014a history professor and a librarian\u2014he was raised in a book-filled home in the Inner Richmond. His name, a legacy of his father\u2019s literary hero, often prompted questions that made him acutely aware of his unique position: a boy with an Irish name and a Korean face, navigating the city\u2019s diverse cultural landscape. This feeling of being an insider and outsider simultaneously fostered a keen observational skill, a tendency to see the city not as a single entity, but as a complex system of overlapping communities.\n\nHis fascination with urban systems led him to UC Berkeley, where he pursued a Master's in Urban Planning. He saw the city as a living document, a text he could learn to read and, eventually, help write. Thomas joined San Francisco\u2019s Planning Department straight out of graduate school, starting as a junior analyst. He wasn\u2019t a flashy political climber; he was a diligent, thoughtful public servant who earned respect through his meticulous research and deep understanding of the city\u2019s historical context. His ascent to Principal City Planner was the result of three decades of steady, dedicated work.\n\nA key turning point was his early involvement in the redevelopment of Hayes Valley after the Central Freeway was dismantled. Witnessing a neighborhood reborn from concrete rubble into a vibrant, walkable community solidified his belief in human-centric urban design. Personally, Thomas is a quiet man. A brief marriage in his thirties ended amicably, leaving him married to his work. He lives alone in a minimalist condo in Hayes Valley, a deliberate choice that allows him to walk to his City Hall office. His commute is a daily field study, observing the interplay of commerce, green space, and the persistent challenges of homelessness and gentrification that occupy his thoughts.\n\nHis days are a mix of virtual meetings from his sunlit living room and intense strategy sessions at City Hall. Evenings are for unwinding with jazz records and poring over architectural blueprints or policy proposals. Thomas\u2019s aspiration isn't for wealth or fame, but for legacy. He dreams of championing a project\u2014be it a revolutionary public housing model or a major transit expansion\u2014that will make San Francisco more equitable and resilient for generations to come. He sees his own story in the city: a place of complex origins, continually being reshaped, striving to build a more coherent and compassionate future."
