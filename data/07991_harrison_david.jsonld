Raised in Marin County, he was the sensitive son of a formidable corporate lawyer and a socially prominent mother. His childhood home was a showroom of success, emotionally sterile and governed by unspoken rules. David was expected to follow his father\u2019s path, and he dutifully enrolled in Political Science at UC Davis, but the world of legislation and lobbying felt hollow. He felt more like an observer of human struggle than a participant in its power structures.\n\nA volunteer position at a crisis hotline during his senior year was the turning point. For the first time, David felt a profound sense of purpose in listening to the raw, unfiltered stories of others. He abandoned the law school track, much to his father\u2019s disdain, and pursued a Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. His early career was a trial by fire in the emergency department of a major San Francisco hospital, where he guided families through unthinkable trauma and sudden loss. The work was vital but corrosive, leading to severe burnout and the end of a long-term relationship with a partner who couldn\u2019t endure the secondary trauma David brought home.\n\nSeeking sustainability, David transitioned five years ago to a private telehealth practice run from his meticulously organized apartment in the Inner Sunset. His 0.0-mile commute is a deliberate act of self-preservation. His days are a structured rhythm of intense, empathetic video sessions with patients, punctuated by long, meditative walks through the fog-dampened trails of Golden Gate Park. He finds solace in the green expanse, a necessary counterbalance to the emotional confines of his work.\n\nAt 50, David is a man who has found a quiet equilibrium. His social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues who understand the unique weight of their profession. His hope is no longer to change the world, but to help one person at a time navigate theirs. He dreams of eventually reducing his caseload to mentor new social workers, ensuring the next generation is better equipped to handle the emotional toll of a life spent caring for others."
