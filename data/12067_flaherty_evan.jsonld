Adopted as an infant by a loving Irish-American couple, he was raised in the foggy avenues of the Outer Sunset. His father, a union carpenter, filled their garage with the smell of sawdust and the hum of power tools; it was here Evan received his true education. While he struggled with the abstract nature of traditional high school subjects, he thrived in shop class and spent hours alongside his dad, learning to measure twice, cut once, and respect the integrity of his materials. He understood the world through his hands.\n\nForegoing college, Evan enrolled in a vocational arts program at City College, mastering welding, CNC machining, and industrial design. His meticulous craftsmanship landed him an entry-level position at a firm that built exhibits for museums and tech conferences. He quickly became indispensable, known for his creative solutions to complex engineering and aesthetic challenges. A key turning point was a solo trip to Seoul in his late twenties. It wasn\u2019t a search for his birth family, but a pilgrimage to understand a part of himself. The trip infused his work with a new appreciation for minimalist design and elegant functionality.\n\nNow 35, Evan is the Lead Exhibition Fabricator for a prestigious design firm, managing a small team that brings ambitious concepts to life for institutions like the California Academy of Sciences. His $85,000 salary affords him a modest but comfortable one-bedroom apartment in the Inner Richmond. His daily routine is grounded and physical: a brisk 3.5-mile bicycle ride to his workshop in SoMa, followed by a day of problem-solving with metal, wood, and plexiglass.\n\nHis social life is a tight-knit circle of fellow makers and artists, often centered around gallery openings or drinks at a local brewery. He has a long-term partner, a graphic designer who appreciates his quiet confidence. Evan\u2019s connection to San Francisco is tangible; he helps build the very things that define its cultural landscape. His dream is to one day open his own small, bespoke fabrication studio, creating permanent art installations that will outlast him, a permanent mark on the city that made him."

He wasn\u2019t fixing it for him, just steadying him. \u201cFeel the grain, Evan. Don\u2019t fight it.\u201d When the two sides of the dovetail joint finally slid together, clean and snug, a wave of quiet pride washed over him. In the garage, surrounded by the scent of sawdust, he hadn\u2019t just learned a skill; he\u2019d found a language that made perfect sense when schoolbooks didn\u2019t.\n\n2.\nAt nineteen, standing in the City College welding bay, the sharp hiss of the TIG torch was a song. He\u2019d just abandoned the idea of traditional university, the sting of academic failure still fresh. Sliding his helmet down, he drew a steady, shimmering bead of molten steel, fusing two plates together. Lifting the mask to see the clean, strong seam\u2014a perfect, uniform stack of dimes\u2014was pure vindication. He wasn\u2019t broken or unintelligent; his mind simply worked best when building something real and permanent.\n\n3.\nStanding in a quiet gallery in Seoul at age twenty-eight, he wasn\u2019t looking at portraits or landscapes. He was mesmerized by an ancient, lacquered chest of drawers. He saw joinery so elegant it seemed to have grown that way, a minimalist perfection his hands instantly understood. It was the same logic his father had taught him, refined to a sublime art. In that moment, the Irish carpenter\u2019s son from the Outer Sunset and the boy from Busan clicked into place. It was a silent, profound homecoming with his own aesthetic.\n\n4.\nThe whole team was stumped. A massive, suspended installation at the Moscone Center was sagging, defying the architect\u2019s CAD models. Evan, then thirty-one, ignored the frantic chatter, walked under the piece, and simply looked. He didn\u2019t see a physics problem; he saw weight and tension. On a dusty plywood scrap, he sketched a simple, welded steel armature to redistribute the load. It worked perfectly. In the quiet that followed, he felt not just pride, but a calm authority settle over him. He was the one who could fix it.\n\n5.\nOn a rainy Sunday last year, he stood with his partner inside the California Academy of Sciences, watching a child press her hands against a curved plexiglass panel of the rainforest exhibit. He remembered wrestling with that specific curve for days, the precise tolerance it required. His partner squeezed his hand, knowing exactly what he was thinking. He wasn't just a visitor admiring the display; he was part of its very bones. This, he thought, watching the child\u2019s wonder, this is the feeling I want to make last forever."
