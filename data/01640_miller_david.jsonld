His father, a pragmatic engineer, instilled in him a belief in secure, linear career paths. David followed this advice, earning a business degree and diving into the lucrative but demanding world of corporate sales. For nearly two decades, he excelled, chasing commissions and climbing a ladder that led to gleaming office towers but left him feeling hollow.\n\nThe turning point arrived not with a bang, but a slow, crushing burnout in his late thirties. The constant pressure and transactional nature of his work felt profoundly meaningless. Seeking an outlet, he began volunteering on weekends at a shelter for unhoused youth. It was there, simply listening to stories and offering a cup of coffee, that he felt a sense of purpose he\u2019d never known. This experience ignited a quiet revolution within him.\n\nAt forty, in a move his family considered reckless, David quit his job, sold his oversized suburban house, and enrolled in a Master of Social Work program. He chose San Francisco, a city that seemed to embrace reinvention. The transition was humbling; he traded a six-figure salary for student debt and late-night study sessions.\n\nNow, at 54, David is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) operating a private practice from a small, dedicated office in his Inner Richmond apartment. His 0.0-mile commute is a cherished perk. His days are structured not by sales quotas, but by the needs of his clients, whom he sees mostly via telehealth. He begins each morning with a walk through the fog-laced streets to Golden Gate Park, a ritual that grounds him before a day of holding space for others' trauma.\n\nHis social life is small but deep, centered on a long-term partner he met in a pottery class and a few close friends from his field. He has found his place in the city's ecosystem of care. David\u2019s aspirations are no longer tied to acquisition but to contribution. He hopes to start a low-cost support group for young adults navigating anxiety and dreams of one day mentoring new therapists. He didn't find the wealth he once chased in San Francisco, but on its fog-swept avenues, he found something far more valuable: himself."
