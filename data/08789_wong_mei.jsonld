She came to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown at sixteen, not with dreams of her own, but carrying the heavy hopes of her parents. They had left their small village in Toisan, China, a few years prior, pouring every cent and waking hour into a modest restaurant, the \u201cLucky Phoenix.\u201d Mei\u2019s formal education ended the day she stepped off the plane. Her new classroom was the cramped, steaming kitchen, where her mother taught her the precise fold of a dumpling and her father, the art of controlling the wok\u2019s fiery breath.\n\nHer career was not a choice but an inheritance. She started by washing mountains of bok choy and scaling fish, her hands perpetually smelling of ginger and garlic. When her father\u2019s health began to fail in her late twenties, the head cook role fell to her. It was a silent, solemn transition. There was no promotion, only the added weight of responsibility. It was during this time she met Bao, a steadfast delivery driver who saw the quiet strength behind her exhaustion. They married and he began managing the front of the house, becoming her partner in both life and labor.\n\nTheir home is the small, two-bedroom apartment directly above the Lucky Phoenix. Her commute is a single flight of stairs. Her day begins at 6 AM, prepping stocks and sauces before the city truly wakes. Her world is the few blocks around Portsmouth Square, a tight-knit community where she knows the grocers by name and trades gossip with the neighboring shopkeepers. She and Bao have a shared, unspoken dream: to sell the restaurant one day and travel, perhaps even see their home village again.\n\nBut Mei\u2019s most cherished hope is for her son, Alex, a bright 18-year-old who just received an acceptance letter from UC Davis. Every long hour she stands over the stove is a down payment on a future for him that exists beyond the kitchen walls. She doesn\u2019t want him to inherit the restaurant, but the freedom she never had. The quiet pride she feels watching him study at their small kitchen table is the fuel that keeps her going, a flavor more satisfying than any dish she could ever create."
