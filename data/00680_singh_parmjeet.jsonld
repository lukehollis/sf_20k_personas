The only son of Punjabi Sikh immigrants who found their American dream in the almond orchards near Yuba City, Parmjeet\u2019s childhood was a blend of hard physical labor, the scent of dust and blossoms, and the deep-rooted community values of the local gurdwara. His parents, who spoke broken English, instilled in him the principle of *seva*\u2014selfless service\u2014and hoped he would use his education to secure a stable, lucrative profession, like engineering.\n\nHe obliged, partly, by moving to the Bay Area for college, but surprised his family by pursuing a Bachelor's in Sociology at San Francisco State University. He was fascinated by systems, communities, and the forces that shaped people's lives. The pivotal moment came during his senior year when he spent a frustrating week helping his parents navigate a labyrinthine government website to apply for farm aid. He saw their intelligence and life experience rendered useless by a digital barrier. In that moment, he realized his calling wasn't to build the technology, but to build the bridges for people like his parents to cross it.\n\nAfter graduating, instead of chasing a high-paying tech role, Parmjeet joined a non-profit, \u201cDigital Navigators,\u201d funded by tech-sector philanthropy. For over fifteen years, he has been an outreach worker, a patient guide for seniors, recent immigrants, and low-income families struggling to access essential online services. His 0.0-mile commute begins and ends in his quiet Inner Richmond apartment, a world away from the orchards of his youth. His days are a mosaic of Zoom calls, creating multilingual tutorials, and visiting community centers.\n\nNow 44, Parmjeet lives a life of contented purpose. He is deeply connected to his neighborhood, starting most mornings with a run through Golden Gate Park and enjoying dinners with a close-knit circle of friends at the diverse restaurants on Clement Street. He remains devoted to his aging parents, visiting them monthly. While single, he is not lonely, finding fulfillment in his community and work. His dream isn't a promotion or a startup, but to see his program expand, ensuring no one in his adopted city is left behind by the relentless march of progress. He found a way to practice *seva* not in a temple, but through a laptop, a testament to his unique San Francisco story."
