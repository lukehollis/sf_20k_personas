Raised in the sun-drenched suburbs of Sacramento by an accountant father and a high school history teacher mother, her upbringing was stable, loving, and aimed squarely at a traditional four-year degree and a sensible career. She obliged at first, enrolling at UC Santa Cruz to study Art History, a subject that felt like a respectable compromise between her creative spirit and her parents\u2019 academic expectations.\n\nThe turning point came during her sophomore year. Rebecca realized she was less interested in the brushstrokes and historical context of a painting and more fascinated by the stories of the people who owned it, the lives lived within the walls where it hung. The world of academia felt too detached. Craving connection to the present, she made the bold decision to drop out and move to San Francisco, a city that felt like a living, breathing story in itself.\n\nNeeding to pay the rent on a shared apartment in the Marina, she took the first solid job she could find: an Administrative Assistant at a bustling real estate agency. The position was a perfect, if unintentional, fit. Her commute is a two-block walk, a daily ritual that grounds her in the neighborhood\u2019s rhythm of joggers, coffee runs, and salty air.\n\nNow, at 25, Rebecca is the organizational backbone of the office. She manages schedules, preps documents, and answers endless calls. But to her, the job is a clandestine study of human aspiration. She sees each client file not as paperwork, but as a dream in progress\u2014a couple buying their first home, a family relocating for a new opportunity. Her social life revolves around her two roommates and casual nights out, but her true passion is secretly observing the city through the lens of her work.\n\nHer ambition is no longer abstract. She plans to complete her college credits online at night, not in Art History, but in business. Her dream is to get her real estate license, not for the commission, but to be the one who guides people through the most significant transaction of their lives\u2014to help them find their own small chapter in the grand story of San Francisco."
