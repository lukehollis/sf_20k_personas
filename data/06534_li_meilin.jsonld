            "value": "Meilin Li\u2019s San Francisco is a city of layers, both geographical and personal. Raised in the Outer Sunset by a structural engineer father and a librarian mother, her childhood was a blend of fog-muted streets and the crisp logic of blueprints and card catalogs. She watched her parents navigate the city\u2019s complex transit system with a mix of frustration and resignation, a daily struggle that planted the seed of her future career. While her friends dreamed of tech or finance, Meilin was fascinated by the arteries of the city: the Muni lines, the freeways, the intricate dance of movement.\n\nHer academic path was a straight line toward this fascination. After earning her bachelor's degree at UC Berkeley, she pursued a Master of Urban and Regional Planning at UCLA, finding the Southern California sprawl only reinforced her love for the Bay Area's dense, walkable potential. Returning to San Francisco, she joined the city\u2019s planning department, meticulously working her way up from a junior analyst to her current role as Senior Transportation Planner.\n\nA key turning point came in her late thirties. A marriage, strained by long hours and diverging paths, ended amicably. The divorce prompted a personal reinvention. Meilin sold the suburban-style house she had shared with her ex-husband and bought a compact, modern condo in Hayes Valley. This move was a conscious choice to live the principles she championed. With a 0.0-mile commute, her home office overlooks a bustling streetscape of cafes, boutiques, and the distant hum of the Central Freeway she has long advocated to redesign.\n\nHer days are a disciplined mix of data analysis, virtual stakeholder meetings, and poring over environmental impact reports. Evenings are for herself: long walks through the Panhandle, enjoying a solo dinner at a favorite ramen spot, or quiet nights with a book and a view of the city lights. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted colleagues and friends from her university days.\n\nAt 49, Meilin isn't driven by ambition for a higher title. Her aspiration is tangible: she wants to see the Page Street promenade project fully realized, to ride a new bus rapid transit line she helped design from conception to completion. Her dream is to leave a lasting, positive mark on the city that raised her, ensuring that future generations can navigate its beautiful, complex terrain with a little more ease."
