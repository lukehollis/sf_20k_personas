Born and raised in the Richmond District, Sarah is the only child of a Cantonese mother, Mei, and a white American father, a Vietnam veteran who fell in love with both Mei and her cooking while stationed abroad. They poured their life savings into opening their small, neighborhood Cantonese-American restaurant in the late 1980s.\n\nSarah grew up inhaling the scent of ginger and garlic, her childhood a cacophony of clattering woks and the murmur of loyal patrons. She was bright and determined to forge her own path, enrolling at San Francisco State University to study graphic design. For two years, she lived a life separate from the restaurant, full of art projects and late-night study sessions. The turning point came during her junior year when her father suffered a major heart attack. With her mother overwhelmed, Sarah put her education on indefinite hold to help manage the front of the house, a temporary measure that became permanent after her father\u2019s passing a year later.\n\nNow, at 40, Sarah is the restaurant's heart and soul. Her 0.0-mile commute means her life is contained within a single city block. Her days begin before dawn, checking inventory and prepping with the kitchen staff who have become her surrogate family. Her social life consists of brief, friendly chats with regulars and shared exhaustion with her team after a busy service. Past relationships have fizzled, unable to compete with the demands of her work.\n\nSarah\u2019s connection to San Francisco is hyperlocal and deeply personal; it\u2019s the specific way the fog rolls down Clement Street and the familiar faces of her customers. While proud to carry her parents\u2019 legacy, she feels a quiet yearning for something more. Her dream is to gently modernize The Golden Poppy\u2014to introduce a craft beer list, to subtly update the menu, to put her own stamp on it without erasing her parents\u2019 history. She hopes one day to share this life with a partner who understands that her world may be small, but it is rich, flavorful, and filled with a profound sense of duty and love."
