Born and raised in the fog-laced avenues of the Richmond District, she was the only daughter of hardworking immigrant parents from Guangzhou. Their world revolved around the steamy, boisterous kitchen of their family-owned Cantonese restaurant on Clement Street, a place of pragmatism where dreams were measured in balanced ledgers. Bucking expectations, Mei pursued a Bachelor's degree in English Literature at SF State, a choice her parents privately deemed a frivolous luxury.\n\nHer entry into the tech world was a happy accident of the first dot-com boom. Initially hired as a technical writer to make complex software manuals intelligible, her knack for untangling chaos and managing competing personalities soon became obvious. She methodically climbed the ladder from writer to project lead to, eventually, project manager. This steady ascent provided the stability she craved, especially after her amicable but draining divorce in her late thirties, which left her the primary caregiver for her young son, Alex.\n\nThe most significant turning point was the recent shift to permanent remote work. Suddenly, her meticulously planned life, once dictated by commutes and office schedules, became centered entirely within the sunny, quiet confines of her Noe Valley apartment. Her home, once just a refuge, is now her entire world\u2014office, sanctuary, and social hub.\n\nMei\u2019s days follow a practiced rhythm. They begin not with an alarm, but with the morning light hitting her bay window. After a strong coffee, she logs into a world of Gantt charts and virtual stand-ups, her calm authority a welcome presence in chaotic international video calls. Her connection to San Francisco is now hyperlocal; she knows the baristas at the corner cafe by name and considers a walk up to Twin Peaks her form of meditation. With her son Alex now away at college, her relationships are maintained through scheduled FaceTime calls and a close-knit circle of friends, fellow veterans of the tech industry who share her wry amusement at its ever-changing fads.\n\nHer aspirations have shifted from career milestones to personal fulfillment. Mei dreams not of a VP title, but of traveling through southern Europe, finally using the high school French she\u2019s kept alive with Duolingo. She hopes to one day start a small consulting business, lending her expertise on her own terms, leaving more time for the novel she has always promised herself she would write."
