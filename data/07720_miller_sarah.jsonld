The daughter of a librarian and a community college professor, her upbringing was full of books and intellectual curiosity. The key turning point came at seventeen when her grandfather suffered a debilitating stroke. Sarah watched her family navigate the labyrinthine healthcare system, overwhelmed and under-supported. It wasn\u2019t the doctors or nurses who left the deepest impression, but the lone social worker who helped them find resources, manage expectations, and grieve. In that experience, Sarah found her calling.\n\nShe pursued her undergraduate degree at UC Davis before moving to the Bay Area for her Master of Social Work at UC Berkeley. The transition to urban life was a shock, but the city\u2019s complex social tapestry fascinated her. Upon graduating, she accepted a demanding position as a Medical Social Worker at a major San Francisco hospital. Her career is a daily tightrope walk of compassion and bureaucracy, advocating for patients facing life-altering diagnoses while dealing with insurance denials and resource shortages.\n\nNow 28, Sarah lives in a small, rent-controlled apartment in NOPA, just a few blocks from her hospital. Her zero-mile commute is both a blessing and a curse; her world can feel small, confined to the emotional radius of her work. Her daily routine involves a morning walk to a local cafe for an oat milk latte before diving into a caseload that is emotionally taxing but deeply meaningful. She decompresses by running through the Panhandle or meeting her small circle of friends\u2014mostly fellow social workers\u2014for cheap pho in the Richmond.\n\nSarah's connection to San Francisco is complicated. She is confronted daily by the city's starkest inequalities, a reality that fuels her professional drive but also feeds a simmering burnout. She dreams of a future with better work-life balance, maybe a supervisory role where she can mentor new social workers. Personally, she hopes for a lasting relationship and the seemingly impossible dream of owning a small piece of the city she serves. For now, she finds solace in the little things: the view from Alamo Square, a perfect burrito, and the knowledge that, one patient at a time, she is making a difference."
