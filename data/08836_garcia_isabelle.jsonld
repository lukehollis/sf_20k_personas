The only child of a farmworker father and a cannery worker mother, she grew up keenly aware of the disparities etched into the landscape. She saw how language barriers, long work hours, and a lack of culturally competent healthcare created cycles of chronic illness in her community. The turning point was watching her grandmother, her beloved *abuela*, struggle to manage her diabetes, lost in a healthcare system that didn't speak her language or understand her life. That experience ignited a quiet, determined fire within her.\n\nDriven by this mission, Isabelle pursued a sociology degree at San Jose State and then a Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley. Her education wasn't just academic; it was a tool she was sharpening for a specific purpose. After graduating, she chose to live and work in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, starting as a health educator at a small community clinic. There, she translated medical jargon into Spanish, organized preventative care workshops, and built trust block by block.\n\nHer effectiveness and strategic mind led to her current role as a Program Manager for a large healthcare provider. From her light-filled apartment in the Mission, her commute a mere fifteen steps from her bed to her desk, she now designs and oversees the very initiatives she once implemented on the ground. Her days are a mix of Zoom calls with hospital leadership, data analysis, and virtual check-ins with community partners.\n\nNow 39, Isabelle\u2019s life is deeply woven into her neighborhood. Her lunch breaks are spent grabbing carnitas from a local taqueria, her evenings running the vibrant loop around Dolores Park. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of friends from grad school and former colleagues who share her passion for social justice. Though successful, she feels a pull toward bigger change. Her dream is to move beyond managing programs and into shaping policy, to one day lead a city-wide health department. For Isabelle, success isn't just a title; it\u2019s building a system where no one\u2019s *abuela* is ever left behind again."
