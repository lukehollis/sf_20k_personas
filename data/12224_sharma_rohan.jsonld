Born in Fremont to Indian immigrants who valued stability above all, his path was meant to be straightforward. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a school administrator, saw his Bachelor's in Business Administration from SF State as the first step toward a secure corporate future. Rohan played the part, spending five soul-crushing years in a downtown marketing firm, feeling more like a component than a person.\n\nThe turning point came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow burn of dissatisfaction, culminating in a trip to his ancestral home in Jaipur. There, surrounded by the vibrant textiles and the memory of his late grandfather, a master tailor, Rohan felt a calling he could no longer ignore. His grandfather\u2019s old shears and measuring tapes felt more natural in his hands than any spreadsheet. He returned to San Francisco, resigned from his job to his parents' profound dismay, and poured his savings and a small inheritance into an apprenticeship with an old Italian tailor in North Beach.\n\nToday, at 43, Rohan is the proud owner of \"Sutra & Thread,\" a small, immaculate bespoke tailoring shop on the edge of the Financial District. His commute is a 3.1-mile Muni ride from his tastefully decorated apartment in Duboce Triangle, a journey he uses to observe the city\u2019s myriad characters, finding inspiration in their gaits and styles. His clients are a mix of tech executives, lawyers, and artists who appreciate his meticulous craftsmanship and his ability to create garments that are both an armor and an expression of self.\n\nHis social life is intimate, centered on a small circle of friends and the deep, trusting relationships he builds with his clients. A long-term relationship ended years ago, a casualty of his single-minded focus on establishing his business. While he\u2019s open to connection, his craft remains his primary passion. Rohan\u2019s dream isn\u2019t expansion; it's legacy. He hopes to one day find a worthy apprentice to pass his skills on to, ensuring the art of true bespoke tailoring continues to have a place in the fast-paced, ever-changing fabric of San Francisco."

He picked them up, the weight settling in his palm, and made a single cut through the air. The crisp *shing* of the blades sliced through the silence, feeling more decisive and true than any business deal he\u2019d ever closed. In that moment, the spreadsheet grids of his San Francisco life dissolved, replaced by the clear, straight line of his future.\n\n2.\nThe phone call to his parents in Fremont was quiet, which made it worse. After he explained his resignation, his father said nothing. It was his mother\u2019s voice, tight with worry, that truly wounded him. \u201cBut Rohan, the security? Your future?\u201d The word \u2018tailor\u2019 hung in the air, an embarrassment. Hanging up, he felt the profound loneliness of severing an expectation, but also the terrifying, invigorating freedom of being the sole architect of his own life, for better or worse. This happened when he was 30.\n\n3.\nHis North Beach mentor, Signore Moretti, was a man of few words. For six months, Rohan\u2019s work earned only grunts. Then one afternoon, Rohan presented a lapel he had hand-padded. Moretti took it, held it to the light, and rolled the edge between his thumb and forefinger. \u201cNot bad,\u201d he murmured, before turning away. That small, gruff validation, smelling of wool and espresso, felt more valuable than any corporate bonus he\u2019d ever received. At 31, it was the first time he truly felt like a craftsman.\n\n4.\nYears later, a high-powered lawyer\u2014one of his first major clients\u2014put on her finished jacket in his new shop. She stared at her reflection, and he saw not just appreciation, but a transformation. Her notoriously tense shoulders relaxed; she stood taller. \"I feel\u2026defended,\" she said, finally meeting his eyes in the mirror. At 37, he understood his purpose wasn't just to sew fabric, but to stitch together an outer self that fortified the inner one. That moment became his mission.\n\n5.\nJust last year, on a quiet Tuesday night in his Duboce Triangle apartment, he was fixing a seam on his own coat. Through the window, he watched the N-Judah streetcar glide by, its windows filled with couples and groups of friends laughing. A familiar pang of loneliness, a ghost of the relationship he\u2019d sacrificed, surfaced for a beat. Then, he looked down at the steady, practiced motion of his own hands, the needle and thread moving with purpose. The pang dissolved into a deep, quiet contentment."
