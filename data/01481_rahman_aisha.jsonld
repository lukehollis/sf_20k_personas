Her 0.0-mile commute is a testament to the life she built for herself, one deeply rooted in the city's unseen commerce. Born to Bangladeshi immigrants, Aisha grew up not in a classroom, but amidst the fragrant chaos of her parents\u2019 small import shop in the Mission District. This shop was her true education. While other kids learned algebra, she learned logistics: how to negotiate with suppliers in Dhaka, track container ships crossing the Pacific, and navigate the labyrinth of US customs.\n\nShe never attended college, a decision that baffled her high school counselors but made perfect sense to her. Her parents\u2019 declining health in her early twenties was a turning point. Aisha stepped up, taking full control of the supply chain and discovering a profound satisfaction in untangling complex logistical knots. She was the silent engine that kept the family business running. When her parents finally retired and sold the storefront, Aisha kept the most valuable part: her network and her expertise.\n\nToday, at 39, she is a freelance logistics coordinator. Her clients are other small, immigrant-owned businesses across the Bay Area who trust her implicitly. Her life is a disciplined routine: early mornings corresponding with Asia, a mid-day walk through Golden Gate Park to clear her head, and afternoons coordinating domestic freight. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few trusted clients and her neighbor, Clara, with whom she shares a bottle of wine on Friday nights.\n\nAisha's connection to San Francisco is not Golden Gate Bridge postcards but the view of the port cranes from Potrero Hill. She feels the city\u2019s pulse through its flow of goods. Her dream isn\u2019t wealth, but ownership\u2014to one day buy the apartment she\u2019s lived in for fifteen years. She also harbors a quiet desire to visit the port cities she knows only as names on a manifest, to finally stand on the shores where her shipments begin their long journey home."
