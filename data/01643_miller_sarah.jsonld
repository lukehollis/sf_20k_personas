Raised in a sprawling, car-dependent suburb of Columbus, Ohio, her childhood was a landscape of identical houses and strip malls. She spent her youth sketching intricate city maps in notebooks, imagining places where people could walk, meet, and live without being tethered to a vehicle. This private passion led her to pursue a Master's in Urban Planning from a practical, no-frills state university, a degree she saw as a tool for building the world she\u2019d always dreamed of.\n\nHer turning point came at 28 with a job offer from a boutique San Francisco urban design firm. It was a leap of faith, leaving her family and the familiar Midwest behind for a city she\u2019d only visited once. The firm, which specializes in community-led public space projects, was a perfect fit. She found she thrived not in a sterile downtown high-rise, but working on projects that directly impacted neighborhoods.\n\nNow 37, Sarah\u2019s life is deeply woven into the fabric of the Inner Richmond. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her bedroom to the bay window in her living room, which serves as her office. Her workday is punctuated by walks to a favorite bakery on Clement Street for coffee and treks through the Presidio\u2019s hiking trails to clear her head. She isn't a city bureaucrat; she's a passionate advocate who spends her days on video calls with neighborhood associations and her evenings refining plans for pedestrian plazas or community gardens.\n\nHer social life revolves around a tight circle of friends\u2014a mix of fellow transplants and SF natives\u2014met through a local book club and volunteer park cleanup days. San Francisco is more than her home; it\u2019s her life's work. She sees its flaws\u2014the inequality, the bureaucracy\u2014but loves its messy, imperfect glory. Her dream isn\u2019t grand; it's tangible. She hopes to one day lead a project that creates a new, beloved public park and to finally save enough to buy a small condo in the very neighborhood she helps to shape, making her connection to the city permanent."
