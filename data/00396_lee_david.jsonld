The only son of Taiwanese immigrants, his childhood was a landscape of manicured lawns and the ambient hum of Silicon Valley\u2019s ambition. His father, a taciturn software engineer, saw a clear path for David: a top-tier engineering degree and a stable career at a tech giant. David, dutiful and bright, initially followed this map, earning a practical economics degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nA post-graduation backpacking trip through Southeast Asia, however, became his pivotal turning point. Witnessing firsthand the mountains of e-waste and polluted waterways\u2014downstream consequences of the very industry that had built his hometown\u2014ignited a profound sense of responsibility in him. He returned home and announced a detour from his father\u2019s plan. He enrolled in Yale\u2019s School of the Environment, earning a Master of Environmental Management, a degree that baffled his pragmatic parents but set David on his true course.\n\nNow 34, David has synthesized his two worlds. From his apartment in NoPa, he works as an environmental consultant for the tech industry. His 0.0-mile commute means his days begin not on a shuttle bus, but with a walk to a local bakery for coffee before he logs on. He spends his hours on video calls, advising the world\u2019s largest tech companies on everything from sustainable data center cooling to ethical supply chain sourcing. He is the quiet conscience in their boardrooms, translating climate science into corporate policy.\n\nDavid lives a structured, purpose-driven life. Recently out of a long-term relationship, his social life revolves around a tight-knit group of friends\u2014a mix of tech optimists and climate pessimists. He finds solace in long trail runs through the Presidio and biking across the Golden Gate Bridge. His NoPa apartment, filled with plants and books on sustainable architecture, overlooks the Panhandle, a constant green reminder of his mission. His dream is to eventually move from consulting to a leadership role within a major tech company, to have the power not just to advise, but to implement systemic change from the inside. For David, San Francisco is the perfect paradox: the heart of the innovation he hopes to transform."
