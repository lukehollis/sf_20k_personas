Immigrants from Guangzhou, they channeled all their hopes into their son, teaching him that relentless work ethic was the baseline, but education was the ladder. David absorbed this lesson, excelling in school with a quiet, intense focus, driven by the desire for a life less precarious than the one his parents endured.\n\nHe pursued a business degree at UC Berkeley and landed a promising job in commercial real estate finance, only to see his world upended by the 2008 financial crisis. Watching established firms crumble was his key turning point. For David, the crash wasn't a tragedy but an epiphany; he saw the future wasn't in traditional assets, but in the technology that would disrupt and redefine them. This conviction propelled him through a Stanford MBA and into the nascent, high-risk world of PropTech venture capital.\n\nNow a Managing Director, David\u2019s life is a study in disciplined success. His day starts before dawn with a run through his Noe Valley neighborhood, the quiet streets a stark contrast to the high-stakes video calls with founders in London and Singapore that will fill his day. He drives his Tesla the 3.5 miles to his office, a short, silent commute that belies the global scale of his investments.\n\nHe and his wife, Elena, an architect, consciously strive to ground their teenage daughter, wanting her to understand the grit that built their life, not just the gloss it now possesses. They are regulars at the local farmers' market and host intimate dinner parties, preferring a tight circle of friends over the performative networking scene. David\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and deeply personal; he sees the city as a living laboratory for the future he\u2019s investing in. His ultimate aspiration isn't just a higher return, but to fund a company that fundamentally reshapes urban living for the better, proving that his parents' gamble on a new world was, in the end, an extraordinary success."

He watches his father\u2019s hands, a blur of practiced motion, as they chop scallions with a heavy cleaver. They are strong, calloused, and seem to hold the entire weight of their family\u2019s hopes. In that moment, watching the relentless rhythm of the blade, David feels not the burden of expectation, but a quiet, fierce resolve. He knew then that his own hands had to build something different, something lasting, from that foundation of sacrifice.\n\n2.\nThe Lehman Brothers news ticker scrolled across a muted TV in his pristine real estate finance office in 2008. But the real memory is the sound\u2014the profound silence that fell over the floor. He watched a senior partner, a man who oozed confidence, simply pack his desk photos into a box with a defeated slump. It wasn't fear David felt, but a cold, electrifying clarity. The old world wasn't just failing; it was making way for something new. That sudden void became the single biggest opportunity of his life.\n\n3.\nDuring his Stanford MBA, he pitched an early-stage PropTech concept to a visiting veteran VC. The man listened patiently before dismissing it as \u201ca niche solution for a non-existent problem.\u201d The polite rejection stung, but as David walked out into the quad, a defiant conviction settled in him. It was the same feeling his parents must have had, leaving everything they knew for an uncertain future. That moment solidified his path; he would no longer seek approval from the old guard but would instead fund the outsiders who were building the new one.\n\n4.\nAt the Noe Valley farmers' market, his daughter, then about fourteen, was absorbed in her phone. He stopped at a stall, watching the gnarled, soil-stained hands of the farmer bagging their greens. They reminded him so much of his father's. He gently touched his daughter's arm and said, \u201cLook at her hands. That\u2019s where our dinner comes from.\u201d It wasn't a lecture, but a shared moment of observation. It was the first time he felt he\u2019d successfully built a small bridge for her, connecting the life she knew to the grit it was built on.\n\n5.\nDriving his Tesla home one evening, he passed a block in SoMa with a new luxury condo tower casting a long shadow over a dilapidated single-room-occupancy hotel. He saw the stark inefficiency, the human disconnect. It wasn\u2019t an intellectual problem; it was a visceral one. This was the living laboratory. The thrill of a potential 10x return was suddenly dwarfed by a more urgent ambition: to find and fund the company that could intelligently and humanely solve *that* specific, tangible problem right in front of him."
