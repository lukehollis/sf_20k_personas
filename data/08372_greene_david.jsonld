Born to a Filipino mother and an Irish-American father who passed away when he was young, David\u2019s upbringing was a blend of two cultures, marked by boisterous family parties filled with lumpia and the quiet resilience of a single immigrant parent. He was raised surrounded by his mother\u2019s extended family, instilling in him a deep-seated sense of duty and a quiet, observant nature.\n\nHis escape was meant to be San Francisco State University. Enrolling in the art history program, David felt a sense of intellectual freedom for the first time, dreaming of a career in museum curation. However, during his second year, his mother suffered a debilitating stroke. Without hesitation, David dropped out of college to become her primary caregiver. The experience was a crash course in patience, anatomy, and the stark realities of the American healthcare system. Finding the work surprisingly meaningful, he pursued a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification\u2014a practical, fast track to stable employment that allowed him to support his healing mother.\n\nThis decision became a turning point that defined his entire adult life. Now 33, David lives and works at a skilled nursing facility in the Inner Sunset. His zero-mile commute is a function of his small, subsidized apartment on the facility's ground floor, a perk that makes living in the city possible on a CNA\u2019s salary. His days are a blur of compassionate routine: assisting elderly residents with their morning care, listening to stories from generations past, and finding moments of human connection amidst the scent of antiseptic and institutional food. His world is largely confined to the facility's walls, with his social life limited to a few trusted co-workers and weekly visits to his mother, now stable and living in a senior community.\n\nDavid\u2019s dreams are modest but deeply felt. He hopes to one day return to school, not for art history, but to become a Registered Nurse, seeking greater autonomy and financial security. He fantasizes about renting his own apartment in the Richmond, a place completely separate from his work, where he could finally build a life and perhaps a relationship of his own. For now, he finds solace in his service, a quiet cornerstone of his community, holding onto the hope that the care he gives to others is carving a path back to a future he can claim for himself."
