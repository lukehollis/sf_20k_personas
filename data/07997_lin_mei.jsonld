The only child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she grew up in the back of her parents\u2019 small laundromat on Balboa Street. Her childhood was a symphony of whirring machines, the scent of steam and detergent, and the constant, quiet diligence of her parents. They instilled in her a profound sense of pragmatism and a belief that stability was the highest virtue.\n\nForgoing the allure of a four-year university, Mei chose a more direct path. She earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration from City College of San Francisco, a practical choice that allowed her to enter the workforce quickly. She found her calling not in a glamorous high-rise but in the intricate, unseen world of logistics. Starting as a junior clerk for a shipping company near the Port of Oakland, she displayed a natural talent for untangling complex supply chains. Over three decades, her meticulous nature and unwavering reliability saw her rise to Senior Logistics Coordinator, a master of schedules, shipments, and troubleshooting.\n\nA key turning point was a brief, tumultuous marriage in her late twenties. Its dissolution, while painful, solidified her independence and reinforced her focus on her career and self-sufficiency. She never remarried and has no children, finding fulfillment in her own quiet domain. Her social circle is small but deep, consisting of a few childhood friends and her brother\u2019s family, who live across the bay in Alameda.\n\nToday, Mei works from the same modest house she inherited from her parents. Her 0.0-mile commute takes her from her kitchen to a spare bedroom converted into a command center of monitors and keyboards. Her days follow a comforting rhythm: a brisk morning walk at Ocean Beach, a strong cup of tea, and the familiar dance of managing global freight movements. Having witnessed San Francisco\u2019s many booms and busts, she feels a deep, protective connection to her quiet corner of the city. Her dream isn\u2019t one of grand ambition, but of quiet contentment: to retire in five years, tend to her small backyard garden, and finally take the well-planned, comfortable trip to see the ancestral villages in Guangdong her parents always spoke of."
