Raised in Daly City by a nurse mother and an electrician father, his childhood was steeped in the values of *ohana* (family) and *kapwa* (a shared sense of self). He saw firsthand how his mother cared for her patients with a deep, unwavering empathy, but also witnessed the community's quiet struggles with mental health, often hidden behind a facade of strength.\n\nThe turning point that set his life\u2019s course was his grandfather's battle with depression after retiring. Oliver watched his family navigate a healthcare system that felt culturally disconnected and ill-equipped to address the specific needs of an elderly Filipino man. This feeling of helplessness ignited a quiet fire within him. He pursued a Bachelor's in Psychology at SF State and then earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, determined to bridge the exact gaps his family had fallen through.\n\nNow 29, Oliver is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major healthcare provider, specializing in telehealth. His \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to the small, sound-proofed office in his Inner Sunset apartment. His days are a series of faces on a screen, each one a universe of anxiety, trauma, and hope. He has become a master of creating connection through a digital medium, providing a crucial lifeline for patients across the Bay Area.\n\nHis apartment, shared with his long-term partner, Maya, a landscape architect, is his sanctuary. After his last session, he deliberately closes his laptop, a ritual to separate work from life. Evenings are for cooking together, walks to Golden Gate Park, or strumming his ukulele\u2014a tangible link to his Kalani roots. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends who understand the emotional weight of his work.\n\nOliver\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. He serves its diverse population from his quiet corner of the city. His dream is to open a private practice within the next five years, focusing specifically on culturally competent therapy for the AAPI community. For him, it\u2019s the ultimate expression of *kapwa*: to see himself in others and offer the understanding his own family once desperately needed."
