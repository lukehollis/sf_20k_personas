Raised in Daly City by a nurse mother and an electrician father, his childhood was steeped in the values of *ohana* (family) and *kapwa* (a shared sense of self). He saw firsthand how his mother cared for her patients with a deep, unwavering empathy, but also witnessed the community's quiet struggles with mental health, often hidden behind a facade of strength.\n\nThe turning point that set his life\u2019s course was his grandfather's battle with depression after retiring. Oliver watched his family navigate a healthcare system that felt culturally disconnected and ill-equipped to address the specific needs of an elderly Filipino man. This feeling of helplessness ignited a quiet fire within him. He pursued a Bachelor's in Psychology at SF State and then earned his Master of Social Work from UC Berkeley, determined to bridge the exact gaps his family had fallen through.\n\nNow 29, Oliver is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) for a major healthcare provider, specializing in telehealth. His \"commute\" is a ten-step walk from his bedroom to the small, sound-proofed office in his Inner Sunset apartment. His days are a series of faces on a screen, each one a universe of anxiety, trauma, and hope. He has become a master of creating connection through a digital medium, providing a crucial lifeline for patients across the Bay Area.\n\nHis apartment, shared with his long-term partner, Maya, a landscape architect, is his sanctuary. After his last session, he deliberately closes his laptop, a ritual to separate work from life. Evenings are for cooking together, walks to Golden Gate Park, or strumming his ukulele\u2014a tangible link to his Kalani roots. His social circle is small but deep, comprised of friends who understand the emotional weight of his work.\n\nOliver\u2019s connection to San Francisco is both professional and personal. He serves its diverse population from his quiet corner of the city. His dream is to open a private practice within the next five years, focusing specifically on culturally competent therapy for the AAPI community. For him, it\u2019s the ultimate expression of *kapwa*: to see himself in others and offer the understanding his own family once desperately needed."

He remembers the squeak of his mother\u2019s nursing clogs on the linoleum and the faint, clean smell of the hospital that clung to her scrubs. She would sink into a chair, exhausted, but her eyes would find his and soften with a weary but absolute presence. It wasn't just a job; it was an energy she brought home. That quiet, unwavering strength became the bedrock of his own understanding of empathy, shaping the very core of his desire to care for others.\n\n2.\nAt seventeen, the memory that set his course is seared in his mind. During a family party, his Lolo (grandfather) sat silently before a full plate of pancit, a ghost at his own feast. The usual boisterous chatter felt hollow, skirting around his visible sadness. This loving, vibrant family, so rich in *ohana*, had no tools for this specific pain. Oliver felt their shared helplessness, a version of *kapwa* twisted into sorrow. That image\u2014of love being insufficient\u2014ignited the fire that drove him to find the right tools himself.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-three, in a clinical simulation at UC Berkeley. Role-playing a therapist for a mock client, an elderly Asian man, Oliver ignored the textbook openings. Instead, he asked about the man\u2019s hometown and his favorite meal. The professor stopped the session. \u201cSee that?\u201d she told the class. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lead with the problem; he led with the person.\u201d In that moment, Oliver felt his personal history and professional future click into place. He wasn\u2019t just learning a trade; he was getting a degree in what his heart already knew.\n\n4.\nA year into his telehealth career, he had a patient, a young veteran, who rarely spoke. Then, Oliver noticed a ukulele on the wall behind him on the screen. He paused the session and simply asked, \u201cIs that yours?\u201d The patient\u2019s eyes met the camera for the first time, and a fragile, genuine smile appeared as he talked about the instrument. It proved to Oliver that a screen wasn\u2019t a barrier but a window. It taught him that his most vital skill was finding those small, human openings, even through a digital divide.\n\n5.\nLast winter, after a particularly harrowing session, he closed his laptop with a quiet, deliberate click\u2014a door shutting on a world of trauma. He walked into the living room where Maya was sketching a garden design, the scent of ginger hanging in the air. She didn't ask about his day; she just handed him a knife and a cutting board. The simple, physical act of chopping vegetables beside her grounded him instantly, a ritual that anchored him back in his own life. This, he knew, was his sanctuary."
