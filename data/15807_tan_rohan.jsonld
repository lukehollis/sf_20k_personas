Raised in Daly City, the child of Filipino immigrants, he grew up in a world of practicality and hard work. His father, a meticulous mechanic, filled their small garage with the scent of motor oil and the sound of socket wrenches, teaching Rohan the language of engines. His mother, a nursing aide, instilled in him a quiet sense of duty and a respect for the people who keep a city running.\n\nNaturally, Rohan enrolled in the Automotive Technology program at City College. He loved the complex logic of transmissions and the satisfaction of a perfectly tuned engine. His dream was to open his own custom restoration shop. But midway through his second year, his father\u2019s health took a serious downturn, forcing him out of work. Suddenly, the long, uncertain path to owning a business felt like a luxury. Stability mattered more than passion.\n\nA family friend mentioned that Muni was hiring. The job offered a union, a pension, and a tangible role in the city. On a whim, Rohan applied. To his surprise, he found a new sense of purpose not under the hood of a car, but behind the wheel of a 40-foot bus. He swapped his dream of restoring classic cars for the responsibility of navigating the 1 California route, a cross-section of the city from the Financial District to the Outer Richmond.\n\nNow 30, Rohan lives in a rent-controlled apartment in the Inner Richmond with his girlfriend, Maya, a physical therapist. His day starts before dawn, his commute a short ride on a fellow operator's bus. He is a silent observer of the city's daily rhythm, watching the city\u2019s diverse cast\u2014from finance bros to elderly grandmothers\u2014board his bus. He feels a quiet pride in being a constant, reliable part of their lives.\n\nWhile he no longer works on cars professionally, his old dream persists. He and Maya are saving aggressively for a down payment on a small house in the Sunset, one with a garage. His ultimate aspiration isn\u2019t to be wealthy, but to finally buy a beat-up 1968 Ford Mustang and, on his weekends, bring it back to life, piece by patient piece."

His father\u2019s calloused hand guided his own, showing him how to feel the subtle tension in a socket wrench. \u201cListen,\u201d his dad said softly, \u201cthe engine tells you what it needs.\u201d The satisfying *click* as the bolt gave way felt like learning a secret word. That day, Rohan understood that patience and attention could fix more than just machines. It was the moment his father\u2019s work became his own passion.\n\n2.\nAt twenty, the City College automotive textbook on his kitchen table felt as heavy as an anchor. He looked at his father, frail in his armchair, and saw his future shift. The dream of a restoration shop, full of chrome and possibility, dissolved into the urgent, practical need for a union and a pension. Closing the textbook was a silent, gut-wrenching decision. It wasn\u2019t a surrender, but a pivot; the moment he learned the profound weight of putting his family\u2019s stability before his own desires.\n\n3.\nHe was twenty-two, gripping the huge steering wheel on his first solo 1 California run. An elderly Cantonese woman, navigating a wheeled grocery cart, caught his eye as she got off at Clement Street. She paused, looked him right in the eye, and gave a small, deliberate nod of thanks. In her simple acknowledgement, he felt the immense responsibility and purpose of his new role. He wasn't just driving a bus; he was a steady, reliable current in the city's complex ecosystem.\n\n4.\nWalking with Maya by Stow Lake when he was twenty-seven, he finally told her about the Mustang. He\u2019d always kept the dream of restoring a '68 tucked away, a relic of a life he\u2019d abandoned. He expected her to find it silly. Instead, she stopped, took both his hands, and said, \u201cSo when we get our house, the garage is the first thing we\u2019ll set up.\u201d Her belief transformed his private loss into a shared goal, making the dream feel not just possible, but inevitable.\n\n5.\nLast month, waiting for the light at California and Presidio, a vintage Ford Bronco, beautifully restored, pulled up alongside his bus. He was thirty. A familiar pang of longing resonated in his chest, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of calm patience. He looked at the family inside, then at his own reflection in the side mirror\u2014a man in uniform, doing his job. He wasn't behind the wheel of his dream car yet, but he was driving the very vehicle that would get him there."
