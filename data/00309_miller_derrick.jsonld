The son of a General Motors engineer in suburban Ohio, he was raised on the logic of steel, schematics, and things you could fix with your hands. He was expected to follow a similar path, but found himself drawn to a different kind of system: the city. He pursued an undergraduate degree in sociology before moving to California for a Master's in Urban Planning at UC Berkeley, arriving in the Bay Area full of youthful idealism. He envisioned a career designing equitable, human-centric public spaces.\n\nThe reality he found in the early 2000s was one of bureaucratic gridlock and underfunded city departments. The slow, frustrating pace felt like a dead end. A turning point came when a friend from his Berkeley program, who had pivoted to tech, introduced him to the world of management consulting. The problems were abstract\u2014optimizing workflows, scaling platforms, restructuring teams\u2014but the pace was electrifying and the compensation staggering. Derrick made the pragmatic choice, shelving his urban planning dreams for a career advising the very tech giants that were reshaping the city he once hoped to design.\n\nNow 48, Derrick is a partner at a top-tier consulting firm. He doesn\u2019t commute; his world is the view from his minimalist SoMa condo, where he orchestrates corporate change through a relentless schedule of video calls. His daily routine is a highly optimized loop of coffee, market analysis, client calls, and strategy decks, often punctuated by a late-night delivery from a high-end restaurant.\n\nHis success has come at a cost. A marriage dissolved a decade ago under the weight of his 80-hour work weeks. His friendships are largely transactional, maintained over expensive dinners with other industry leaders. He lives in the heart of San Francisco but experiences it as a service, a backdrop. From his window, he watches the flow of traffic and people not as a citizen, but as a strategist observing a complex system. He sometimes dreams of cashing out, maybe funding a nonprofit focused on urban housing or simply walking the city\u2019s neighborhoods without an agenda. For now, though, he remains a master of systems, quietly wondering if he can still find the blueprints for a life with a better design."
