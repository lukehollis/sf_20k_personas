Adopted as an infant by a loving Jewish-American couple, Saul and Miriam Cohen, he was raised in the intellectually vibrant and culturally diverse environment of 1970s Berkeley. His parents, both professors, instilled in him a deep appreciation for history and storytelling. This upbringing shaped his identity, leaving him with a unique blend of cultural heritages that he would spend a lifetime navigating.\n\nHe pursued his passion at UC Berkeley, earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History. His first career was a natural extension of his studies: an archivist for a local historical society. For a decade, David was a quiet custodian of other people's pasts, meticulously cataloging letters and photographs. Yet, he felt a growing disconnect, like a spectator watching life from behind glass. The turning point came during the 2008 housing crisis. Witnessing the profound emotional and financial turmoil of people losing their homes, he realized he wanted to engage with history as it was being made. He wanted to help people find their anchor, their own private piece of history: a home. At 37, he earned his real estate license.\n\nNow 51, David is a highly respected agent specializing in legacy properties in Noe Valley, the very neighborhood where he lives. His 0.0-mile commute is a short walk from his bedroom to his home office in his impeccably restored Edwardian flat. His deep knowledge of architecture and his genuine love for the stories embedded in a building\u2019s walls make him more of a matchmaker than a salesman. His days are a disciplined blend of work and neighborhood life: an early morning walk through Douglass Park with his rescue terrier, Buster, coffee at a familiar cafe, followed by client calls and property viewings.\n\nThough a long-term relationship ended five years ago, David maintains a rich social life with a close-knit circle of friends. His dream isn't to become the city's top seller, but to one day travel to Seoul, to connect with the first chapter of his own story. He aspires to write a book, not about real estate, but about the secret lives of San Francisco houses, ensuring their stories, like his own, are never forgotten."

The question hung in the air, a sudden point of confusion in his bright world. That night, his father, Saul, held his face and said, \"David, love makes a family, not looks.\" It wasn't a magic spell that erased the feeling of difference, but it was the first, sturdy anchor in the complex sea of his identity, a truth he would hold onto for the rest of his life.\n\n2.\nAt 36, surrounded by the hushed reverence of the archive, he cataloged photos of a family that lost everything in the 1906 quake. He examined their faces, their home, their documented ruin, and felt a horrifying numbness. It was a clinical, academic exercise. In that sterile silence, a chill went through him. He wasn't a historian; he was a ghost, curating the lives of other ghosts. That profound disconnect was the first crack in the glass wall separating him from the world, igniting a desperate need to feel history, not just file it.\n\n3.\nThe sound of a hammer hitting wood in 2008 changed everything. He was 37, walking in the Richmond, when he saw an elderly woman crying on her porch as a man pounded a foreclosure sign into her small lawn. The finality of the sound, her silent grief\u2014it shattered his emotional detachment. History wasn't in dust-free boxes; it was here, raw and devastatingly present. In that moment, his life\u2019s purpose became clear: he couldn\u2019t just watch people lose their anchors. He had to help them find and keep them.\n\n4.\nAround age 39, he handed over the keys to his first major sale, a charming Noe Valley Craftsman. Instead of just \"congratulations,\" he told the young couple about the original owner, a Norwegian shipwright who planted the ancient lemon tree in the yard. Seeing their faces light up as they connected not just to a structure but to its soul, he felt a profound click of purpose. This wasn't selling. This was matchmaking\u2014connecting a home\u2019s past to a family\u2019s future. He had finally found his place.\n\n5.\nHe was 46 the night the front door of his Edwardian flat clicked shut for the final time on his long-term relationship. The silence was absolute, a hollow space where a life used to be. He stood alone in the hallway, tracing the intricate grain of the redwood wainscoting with his fingers. The house, with its century of stories, seemed to hold him. It was an aching loneliness, but in that moment, he began to root himself not in another person, but in the quiet, sturdy comfort of his own home."
