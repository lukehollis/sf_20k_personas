Raised in Fremont by first-generation Indian immigrants\u2014an engineer father and a math teacher mother\u2014his childhood was a disciplined curriculum of academic excellence. The unspoken goal was a stable, high-earning career in STEM. Rahul, however, was quietly fascinated by the human mind. He compromised by pursuing a Cognitive Science degree at UC Davis, a field that felt like a bridge between his parents\u2019 world and his own.\n\nThe turning point came after graduation. Faced with a nebulous job market for his degree, the weight of his parents\u2019 sacrifices spurred a pragmatic pivot. He enrolled in a competitive Master\u2019s in Data Science program at UC Berkeley, channeling his analytical skills into a more marketable path. He excelled, landing a coveted role as a Data Analyst for a major tech firm before the ink on his diploma was dry.\n\nNow 26, Rahul lives a life of calculated routine in a modern Hayes Valley studio. With a zero-mile commute, his apartment is both office and sanctuary. His days are a blur of SQL queries and data visualizations, broken up by walks to a local cafe for an oat milk latte and solo runs through the Panhandle. He enjoys the city\u2019s energy from a slight remove, his social life consisting of a tight-knit circle of college friends and a weekly bouldering session at a SoMa gym\u2014predictable, structured interactions that suit his introverted nature.\n\nDespite his professional success, a quiet longing persists. Rahul dreams of bridging the gap between his job and his original passion. He spends his evenings reading about AI ethics and human-computer interaction, hoping to one day lead a team that uses data not just to optimize ad revenue, but to genuinely understand and improve human experience. He is a man who built the life he was supposed to, and is now searching for the one he truly wants within the fog and vibrant possibility of San Francisco."
