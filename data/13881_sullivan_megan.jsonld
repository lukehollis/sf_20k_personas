Raised by a firefighter father and a legal secretary mother, she grew up with a deep appreciation for civic duty and pragmatism. Her career path was cemented in her teens while helping care for her younger brother through his severe asthma, where she witnessed the profound impact of calm, competent nurses. Foregoing a traditional four-year university, she enrolled at City College of San Francisco, earning her Associate's degree in Nursing to enter the workforce quickly.\n\nHer first decade as an RN was spent in the crucible of SF General Hospital\u2019s emergency room. There, she honed her skills under immense pressure, becoming an unflappable presence amidst chaos. However, the relentless trauma and emotional exhaustion eventually led to a critical juncture. The demanding shifts contributed to the amicable end of her marriage, and Megan realized she was nearing burnout. Seeking a different way to utilize her skills, she transitioned to become a school nurse for a large public high school.\n\nNow 39, Megan has found a new rhythm. Her daily 3.5-mile MUNI ride from her Inner Richmond apartment takes her to a world of scraped knees, adolescent anxiety, and crucial health education. She thrives on building trust with students, feeling she makes a more lasting impact through prevention and support than she ever could in the ER. Her personal life is stable; she maintains a close-knit circle of friends, a mix of fellow nurses and old high school pals.\n\nMegan feels a fierce, protective love for her hometown, even as she laments its changing landscape. She is saving diligently, her primary dream being to buy a small condo in her neighborhood, a tangible anchor in the city that holds her entire life story. While open to a new relationship, her focus remains on her community work and the quiet satisfaction of a life consciously rebuilt for sustainability and purpose."

Megan, 15, watched her steady hands on the nebulizer, her voice a low murmur that cut through the panic. In that moment of helplessness, a fierce purpose bloomed in her chest. She wouldn\u2019t just worry from the sidelines; she would become the calm in someone else\u2019s storm. It was the night she decided to become a nurse.\n\n2.\nIt was a Saturday night, maybe her second year at SF General. After a pileup on the 101, the ER was a blur of blood and noise. Megan, then 24, focused on one patient, a man with a shattered leg, calmly talking him through the pain as she started an IV. The chaos faded to a hum. When her supervisor gave her a sharp, approving nod, she felt a click deep inside her. This crucible wouldn't break her; it would forge her into the unflappable presence she needed to be.\n\n3.\nHer husband was already gone for his early shift, but his coffee mug was still warm. Megan, just turned 33, sat at their kitchen table, the pre-dawn light grey over the avenues. She hadn't really slept, still vibrating from her ER shift. She realized they were just two ships passing, exhausted and on different schedules. There was no blame, only a profound, hollow sadness. She had given her entire self to the hospital. That morning, she knew she had to choose a different way to live, even if it meant doing it alone.\n\n4.\nA freshman was hyperventilating in her office, terrified about a math test. No sirens, no trauma shears. Megan, 35 and new to the job, simply sat with him. She guided his breathing, talking about the fog over Ocean Beach until his shoulders finally dropped. He left with a shy thank you. In the quiet that followed, she felt a profound sense of rightness. Not stitching major wounds, but mending anxieties before they became crises. This felt more like healing than anything she'd done at General.\n\n5.\nJust last spring, she was walking home from the MUNI stop on Clement Street. The scent of steamed dumplings mixed with the damp, salty air as the fog began its evening crawl from the ocean. She saw old neighbors she recognized and new storefronts she didn\u2019t. A fierce, protective wave washed over her\u2014a love for this imperfect, changing city that held all her ghosts and hopes. She gripped her grocery bag tighter, the dream of a small condo feeling less like a want and more like a necessity. An anchor."
