Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, to a union carpenter father and a school secretary mother, Sarah grew up with a deep appreciation for stability and hard work. She sought a different path, however, pursuing an Art History degree at the University of Oregon. The degree felt romantic and expansive, but upon graduating, she found it impractical for paying the bills.\n\nDrawn by the promise of a more dynamic life, she moved to San Francisco at 23. The city was both intoxicating and financially punishing. She took the first job she could get: a front desk clerk at a boutique hotel near Union Square. To her surprise, she thrived. Her art history background gave her a unique ability to speak about the hotel's architecture and design, charming guests and impressing management. She was calm under pressure, empathetic, and exceptionally organized.\n\nThe key turning point came six years ago. After a painful breakup left her feeling unmoored, the hotel's Front Desk Manager position opened up. The role was a promotion, but its most significant feature was the included benefit: a small, simple apartment on-site. For Sarah, who was tired of roommate drama and crippling rent, it felt like a lifeline. She took the job, and her commute became a 30-second elevator ride.\n\nNow, at 37, Sarah\u2019s life is a paradox of connection and isolation. She is the consummate host to the world, offering recommendations for romantic dinners and hidden city gems she herself hasn't visited in years. Her colleagues are her family, and the hotel's constant hum is the soundtrack to her life. While she cherishes her financial security, she sometimes feels the walls of her sanctuary closing in. She dreams of traveling to see the European art she only knows from textbooks and owning a small condo in a quieter neighborhood, a place entirely separate from her work. For now, she remains the ever-present, welcoming face at the heart of a city she experiences primarily through the stories of others."
