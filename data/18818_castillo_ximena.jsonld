Born in the Mission District to immigrant parents from Jalisco, Mexico, her childhood was a vibrant mix of Spanish broadcasts, the smell of pan dulce from the corner bakery, and the constant hum of a community trying to hold its ground. She watched firsthand as families she\u2019d known her whole life were slowly squeezed out by rising rents in the 90s, a formative experience that planted a seed of fierce ambition.\n\nForgoing college, which felt like an unaffordable luxury, Ximena entered the workforce right after graduating from Mission High. She started as a receptionist at a small real estate firm in Noe Valley, where her sharp memory for names and innate ability to connect with people quickly made her indispensable. She absorbed everything, learning the language of escrows, listings, and commissions. The turning point came when she helped a Spanish-speaking family navigate a complex rental application, realizing her background was not a barrier but a powerful asset. At 25, she poured her savings into getting her real estate license.\n\nNow 46, Ximena is a force in the city\u2019s property market. A pragmatic and shrewd agent, she built her $145,000 income through sheer grit, specializing in both sales and property management to ensure a steady financial base. Divorced for a decade, her most significant relationship is with her 20-year-old son, a student at SF State, for whom she is determined to provide the stability she never had.\n\nShe lives in a modest but well-kept single-family home in West Portal, the 9.5-mile commute in her Audi A4 a quiet ritual to decompress between the demands of her clients and her son. Her connection to San Francisco is complex; she feels a deep-seated love for its beauty and energy but harbors a quiet resentment for the economic forces that displaced her family. Her ultimate dream is not to sell a mansion in Pacific Heights, but to purchase her own multi-unit building in the Excelsior or Outer Mission\u2014a tangible piece of the city for herself, offering fair rents and a sense of security to families like the one she grew up in."

Mr. Rojas pressed a warm concha into her hand, his eyes tired. \"Ya no podemos, mija.\" The scent of sugar and yeast, a constant of her childhood, vanished overnight. That empty storefront became a symbol\u2014not of failure, but of a fight her community was losing. It was the first time she understood that a home could be taken away, a lesson that settled deep in her bones and hardened into resolve.\n\n2.\nShe was 22, still just a receptionist. A young couple, the Garcias, sat defeated, staring at a rental application. Ximena saw her own parents in their faces. She took the papers, her Spanish flowing easily as she explained each line. Seeing the relief wash over them as she helped secure their lease wasn't just satisfying\u2014it was a revelation. Her heritage wasn\u2019t something to overcome; it was her superpower. She started studying for her license the next week.\n\n3.\nAt 27, her first big commission check felt unreal in her hands, more than her father made in three months. She didn\u2019t splurge on a purse or a vacation. Instead, she opened a college savings account for her young son, Mateo. Staring at that first deposit slip, she felt a seismic shift inside her. It wasn't just money; it was a foundation. It was the first brick she laid for the life of stability she was so determined to build for him.\n\n4.\nTwo years ago, helping her son move into his dorm at SF State, she was hit by a wave of emotion so strong she had to grip her car keys. This was it. A Castillo, going to college. She had worked for this\u2014the endless open houses, the late-night calls, the shrewd negotiations. It wasn\u2019t about her not going; it was about ensuring he *could*. In his confident smile, she saw her own ambition reflected back, but without the sharp, anxious edges of her youth.\n\n5.\nDriving home to West Portal last week, the leather of her Audi\u2019s steering wheel cool under her hands, she took a detour through the Excelsior. She spotted a 'For Sale' sign on a slightly worn four-unit building. For a moment, she wasn\u2019t an agent assessing a property; she was a girl from the Mission seeing a foothold. A quiet hum of determination vibrated through her. *Soon*, she thought. This city took from her family, and one day, she would buy a piece of it back."
