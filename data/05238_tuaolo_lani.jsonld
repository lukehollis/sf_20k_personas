Born in Daly City to Samoan immigrants, her upbringing was a vibrant tapestry of church gatherings, large family meals, and the strong communal principles of *fa'a Samoa*. Her parents, who had worked tirelessly in service jobs to provide for their family, hoped she would pursue a stable career in medicine or law. Lani, however, was a watcher, an observer drawn to the subtle stories told by people and the spaces they inhabited.\n\nShe honored her family\u2019s wish for higher education but chose her own path, earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Cultural Anthropology from San Francisco State University. Her studies fascinated her, teaching her to see the world as a collection of artifacts and rituals. During her final year, a chance internship at a small, independent gallery in the Mission District became her defining turning point. There, she discovered that contemporary art was the modern world's most potent collection of artifacts, each piece a window into a culture, a conflict, or a dream. The gallery became her new temple.\n\nAfter graduation, Lani worked her way up the city\u2019s art ladder, moving from gallery assistant to associate director over fifteen years. Her anthropological background gave her a unique eye for curating, allowing her to weave compelling narratives into every exhibition. Eight years ago, she accepted the position of Gallery Manager for a respected contemporary art space in Hayes Valley. The offer included the loft apartment directly above the gallery, collapsing her commute to a simple walk down a flight of stairs.\n\nNow 43, Lani\u2019s life is intrinsically woven into the fabric of her neighborhood. Her daily routine begins with a coffee from a local cafe, a brief walk through the ever-changing streets of Hayes Valley, and then descending into her workspace. She lives and breathes her profession, spending her days liaising with artists, courting collectors, and meticulously planning installations. Her personal life is quiet; a recent amicable split from a long-term partner has led to a period of introspection. Her social circle is a tight-knit group of artists and other industry professionals. Lani\u2019s deepest aspiration is to use her position to champion underrepresented voices, especially those from the Pacific Islander diaspora, ensuring their stories are not just told, but seen and valued in the city she calls home."

While cousins wrestled and aunties laughed, she watched her father\u2019s hands, resting for a rare moment on the table. The calluses and faint scars weren't just signs of his labor; they were a silent language. In that quiet observation, she felt a pang of deep love and a nascent, fierce desire to understand the stories people carried not in their words, but on their very skin. It was the first time she chose watching over participating.\n\n2.\nAt 21, interning in a dusty Mission gallery, she helped uncrate a sculpture made of found objects\u2014rusted rebar, shattered glass, and faded plastic. Her anthropology textbooks suddenly felt inert. This object\u2014this artifact of the now\u2014pulsed with the city's conflicts and resilience. It was a visceral shock of recognition, the moment a theoretical framework became a living, breathing thing. The gallery wasn't just a room with art; it was a field site, and she had just found her tribe and her life's work.\n\n3.\nThe opening night of her first solo-curated show as an associate director. She was 32, terrified. The artist, a notoriously difficult painter, walked through the crowded room, his eyes scanning her arrangement. He stopped, not in front of his largest piece, but a small, quiet one she\u2019d placed in an unconventional corner. He met her gaze from across the room and gave a single, slow nod. That silent acknowledgment was more validating than any review, cementing her belief in her own unique vision for weaving stories with art.\n\n4.\nHer first night in the loft above the Hayes Valley gallery, eight years ago. After the movers left, she didn\u2019t unpack. She just stood by the large window, listening to the city\u2019s hum. Downstairs, the gallery was dark and silent, a space of pure potential waiting for her. In that moment, the frantic striving of her early career dissolved into a profound, settling calm. She had finally curated a life for herself where home and purpose were separated by only a single flight of stairs.\n\n5.\nA few months ago, during a studio visit, a young Fijian artist showed Lani a piece incorporating a digital print of *masi* cloth, glitched and fractured. Seeing that ancestral pattern, so familiar from her own childhood, re-contextualized as modern art, struck her to her core. It wasn\u2019t just a beautiful object; it was a flare of recognition, a call to action. It sharpened the quiet ache of her recent breakup into a clear, bright purpose: to ensure these cultural languages were seen and heard in the city\u2019s most important rooms."
