Adopted as an infant from South Korea by a loving couple in Marin County, he grew up surrounded by the natural beauty of Mount Tamalpais but felt an undercurrent of disconnect. His parents, a librarian and a landscape architect, kept his birth name to honor a heritage they couldn't fully explain. A thoughtful, introspective child, Julian struggled to articulate the complex feelings of his adoption. Words often failed him, but charcoal and clay did not. Art became his first language, a sanctuary where he could process a world he found both beautiful and bewildering.\n\nThis passion led him to pursue a fine arts degree at UC Santa Cruz, but a pivotal volunteer experience at a youth shelter revealed his true calling. He saw how creative expression could unlock trauma and build resilience in kids who, like him, felt displaced. This epiphany guided him to a graduate program in Marriage and Family Therapy, specializing in Art Therapy.\n\nFor the last fifteen years, Julian has been a fixture in San Francisco's community health network. He works primarily with underserved youth in the Mission District, helping them navigate everything from family instability to identity crises through painting, sculpture, and collage. His Inner Richmond apartment is his quiet retreat from the emotional intensity of his work. His daily 3.8-mile bicycle commute is a vital ritual\u2014a physical and mental buffer that allows him to pedal through the city\u2019s fog and his own thoughts, arriving at work clear-headed and returning home with a sense of release.\n\nRecently single after the end of a long-term relationship, Julian finds himself applying his professional tools to his own life, using his sketchbook to navigate his solitude. His social life is a small, tight-knit circle of friends met through work and old cycling groups. His dream is to one day open a small, private practice and community studio in his neighborhood, a dedicated safe space for adopted children and teens\u2014the very place he wishes he could have found all those years ago."

It wasn't sadness he felt, but a quiet, profound confusion\u2014a visual confirmation of the space between them he couldn't name. It was the first time he understood his adoption not as a story he was told, but as a physical fact. That understanding planted the seed of a lifelong search for belonging, a feeling he would later recognize in the eyes of countless children.\n\n2.\nHe was 21, volunteering at the UC Santa Cruz youth shelter. A silent teenage girl, who hadn't spoken about her past, painted a small boat alone on a vast, dark sea. He didn\u2019t have to ask what it meant; he knew that specific loneliness in his bones. In her brushstrokes, he saw his own unspoken childhood feelings perfectly reflected. His fine arts degree suddenly felt hollow. In that moment, he saw his true path: not just making art, but using it to help others navigate the storm.\n\n3.\nThe bike ride the morning after his partner moved out was brutal. Every landmark on the familiar 3.8-mile route felt alien. The chill of the Richmond fog cut deeper, and the climb through the Panhandle felt impossibly steep. It was more than a commute; it was a physical act of carrying his grief across the city. He realized then that the daily ritual wasn't just a buffer, but a moving meditation\u2014a way to pedal through pain until it became just another part of the landscape.\n\n4.\nDuring a session last year, a 14-year-old client who felt torn between his foster and biological families built a clay sculpture. It was two houses, impossibly far apart. For weeks, that\u2019s all it was. Then one afternoon, the boy quietly built a bridge to connect them. Seeing the relief on the boy's face as he completed the structure crystallized Julian's dream. He wouldn\u2019t just help kids build metaphorical bridges; he would build the physical space for them to do it.\n\n5.\nTwo months ago, alone in his quiet apartment, he opened his sketchbook to a blank page. The silence felt deafening after a decade of partnership. Instead of drawing his grief, he sketched the floor plan for his future studio. He drew the big windows for natural light, the shelves for clay, the large tables for collage work. It was the first night he didn't feel adrift. He was applying his own therapy to himself, designing a future where his own feeling of displacement could build a place of refuge for others."
